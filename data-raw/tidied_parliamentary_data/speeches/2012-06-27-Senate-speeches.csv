Senator CASH
 (Western Australia) (09:57):  In the very short time that has been allotted to speak, I rise to speak on the Paid Parental Leave and Other Legislation Amendment (Dad and Partner Pay and Other Measures) Bill 2012. This bill will amend the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 and the Fair Work Act 2009 as well as implement other minor changes to five acts consequential to the dad and partner pay payment in order to extend the Paid Parental Leave Scheme to fathers and partners from 1 January. 


The coalition welcome the long-overdue change in this amendment, which was promised by the government in 2010. Schedule 1 of this bill extends the Paid Parental Leave Scheme to provide two weeks pay for fathers and partners at the national minimum wage level of $590 per week before tax. It is important to note that fathers and partners will only be able to lodge claims from October 2012 for children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2013. Despite this payment being promised at the 2010 election, dad and partners will have to wait until 2013 to receive a paternity leave payment from the government. While the coalition do not oppose the bill, the reality is that the coalition's paid parental leave scheme is far superior to the government scheme, in that our scheme provides real benefits for women, men, families, business and the economy. In summary, instead of trying to fool the public and portray the coalition's PPL scheme as a reward for the rich, Labor should look at the facts. Labor's paid parental leave scheme does not pay superannuation, while the coalition's scheme includes superannuation at the mandatory level. Our scheme is a genuine social reform that will help families; it is not the box-ticking exercise that is the government's. Labor is asking employers to be the pay clerks, despite the Productivity Commission warning that the biggest dangers of an employer co-funded paid parental leave scheme are discrimination against women of reproductive age and, in the shorter term, financial pressure on cash-strapped employers. Under the coalition's plan, small business will not pay the levy and they will not administer the scheme. Workers taking paid parental leave will be paid directly by the government and businesses do not have to find the money and then wait to be reimbursed. Labor's scheme places an administrative burden on small business, while the coalition's plan will be administered by the Family Assistance Office.


A clear contrast between the coalition's PPL scheme and Labor's scheme is that no woman will be any worse off under the coalition's scheme and, further, 99 per cent of working women will be financially better off compared with the Labor scheme. The coalition's PPL scheme also provides more time for mothers to bond with their children. Labor's 18 weeks is insufficient time for women to breastfeed and bond with their child. The coalition will be giving women 26 weeks of PPL compared with Labor's scheme of 18 weeks. The coalition's 26-week scheme is precisely the duration that health experts recommend is the minimum period for optimal maternal and health outcomes.


One of the most important differences under the coalition's scheme is that working women on PPL will receive superannuation contributions at the mandatory nine per cent level. Labor's PPL scheme does not provide for any superannuation payments during PPL and, because of this fundamental failing, will further entrench the financial disadvantage of women who have chosen to have children. The coalition believes that if government is committed to women and to ensuring their financial security, superannuation contributions must be paid while women are receiving paid parental leave.


This is a step towards ensuring that women are not disadvantaged when it comes to their retirement savings. With the average life expectancy for women being higher than for men, it is important that women are not penalised with low retirement savings for having children. Research shows that a typical woman will have 35 per cent less savings than a typical man and that a woman who takes a career break to have children will have 26 per cent less for retirement than if she had continued working. That is why the coalition believe that women should not be disadvantaged when the time comes to draw on retirement savings and that is why we have included superannuation in our policy. Financial security for women is something we have seen various Labor ministers for the status of women pay lip service to but take no action on, and that is clearly reflected in the government's paid parental leave scheme. The least the government could do is admit that its policy on this is wrong and harmful to a woman's financial security.


Men will also be better off under the coalition's scheme. More than 94 percent of full-time working men will be better off financially under the coalition's PPL scheme and, unlike Labor's scheme, no man will be worse off. Men on low incomes will be up to $200 better off under the coalition's scheme and men on middle incomes will be up to $1,500 better off. Working families are also significantly better off under the coalition's PPL scheme. Why? Because they will get more time off and more money under our scheme. Unlike Labor, the coalition recognises that paid parental leave is a work entitlement rather than a welfare benefit.


Employees are entitled to sick, carers, annual, bereavement and public holiday leave at their actual salary amount and paid parental leave, in our opinion, should be no different. Under the coalition's PPL scheme, employees will receive a proper work entitlement. A proper paid parental leave scheme reinforces that taking time off work for births is a normal part of life and not an inconvenience, as the Labor scheme would have it. The coalition's PPL scheme gives women real choice because it fully supports their income when their family is at a most financially vulnerable time. Our PPL scheme recognises that a family's financial responsibilities do not reduce when a child is born into the family. There is no maternity leave from mortgage payments, power and fuel bills or grocery expenses. Mortgage payments, electricity and fuel bills and grocery costs do not take maternity leave but women certainly do and so, for a reasonable amount of time, their pay should be like any other work entitlement and not a basic welfare entitlement.


One of the other clear differences between Labor's scheme and the coalition's scheme is that the Labor scheme forces small and big business to incur the red-tape cost of administering the PPL payments. On that point, I was astounded to hear the member for Corangamite in the other place say:


... I want to make it very clear to those listening in the House today or via the broadcast that the paperwork burden is actually very manageable and very small and does not take a great deal of effort by either the employee or the employer. If you look at the efforts that this government has made in terms of red tape reduction, I think we have a first-class record of removing unnecessary red tape. Importantly, there is some necessary red tape or regulation to ensure proper operation of our laws. The level of paperwork associated with this is appropriate, it is not a great burden and it does not take an unnecessary amount of time.




Senator Ronaldson:
  He's a fool.




Senator CASH:
  Thank you, Senator Ronaldson, I will take that interjection. You are right. If the member for Corangamite stands by that statement he is clearly a fool who has absolutely no understanding at all about the way that small business functions.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Fawcett
):  Order! Senator Cash, you will withdraw that remark about a member in the other place.




Senator CASH:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I will withdraw the remark, and I will say that the statement—




Senator McLucas:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I would also request that Senator Ronaldson withdraw his comment, which will also be on the record.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ronaldson, before you leave the chamber, the comment you made about the member for Corangamite may well appear in the Hansard; would you withdraw that remark.




Senator Ronaldson:
  Mr Acting Deputy President, I was actually directing my comment to Senator Cash that the member for Corangamite is a fool—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Ronaldson, I realise that.




Senator Ronaldson:
  But, if there is a concern, I will withdraw it.




Senator McLucas:
  No ifs.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.




Senator CASH:
  The member for Corangamite has made these statements and they clearly show that he has no understanding at all of how a small business runs. If he honestly believes that the level of paperwork associated with this is appropriate, that it is not a great burden and that it does not take an unnecessary amount of time he should go to any small business owner in the Australian community, as I have done, and I can tell you that the first thing they will say is that they cannot afford the red tape and regulation that is placed on them by Labor's PPL scheme. If the first-class record of removing unnecessary red tape that the member for Corangamite refers to is in relation to the 18,089 additional regulations created by the Rudd-Gillard government since the beginning of 2008 whilst only 86 were repealed then, quite frankly, the Liberal Party has a very, very different definition of a first-class record—so different that we have committed to cutting red tape and the compliance burden on small businesses by $1 billion a year if and when we are elected to government.


The coalition's PPL scheme, unlike Labor's scheme, will release employers from the pay-clerk burden imposed by the Gillard Labor government, unless employers opt in for this additional regulatory and compliance task. Imposing such additional regulatory and compliance obligations on employers for no good reason adds nothing to ongoing workplace relationships and is an additional burden that most employers can well do without. Anybody who has spoken to an employer will know that red tape is not conducive to good business practice. Imposing such additional regulatory and compliance obligations on employers for no good reason makes ongoing workplace relationships tougher than they need to be and is an additional burden that they can well do without.


As always, it is a coalition government, not a Labor government, that wants to make life easier for small business owners, who carry our economy each and every day. This will be especially important for small business owners who, unlike big employers, do not have whole departments that can actually handle the PPL pay-clerk task imposed by the government's scheme. The coalition's PPL scheme will also help boost productivity in the workplace. Our scheme boosts productivity because it provides more encouragement to women to remain in the workforce, to continue gaining practical workforce skills, to learn on the job and to continue applying their knowledge, skills and abilities in the workplace. It provides more encouragement for workplace participation and it makes more workplaces more efficient by removing the onus Labor has put on employers to administer the PPL scheme.


The Productivity Commission estimates that when faced with a choice of resigning or taking paid parental leave almost one-fifth of mothers choose to resign their jobs. The coalition recognises that, for employers, replacing an entire role is expensive and time-consuming in terms of recruitment and training costs and the risk of loss of corporate knowledge that an individual has built up in a role. Our PPL scheme provides the right incentives for working mothers to return to work. The coalition's PPL scheme is a globally recognised productivity boost. In fact, Australia is the only country in the world with a paid parental leave scheme that is entirely based on the minimum wage. According to the Productivity Commission's report on paid parental leave, at least 37 nations around the world had introduced a paid parental leave scheme prior to the launch of Labor's minimum wage scheme. Of those schemes, 35 were based on full or part replacement wage. Many other countries offer replacement wage, just like the coali­tion's scheme, including France, Germany, Austria, Russia, Denmark, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, Estonia, Greece, Mexico, Morocco, Luxembourg, Poland, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland and Spain. They all deliver paid parental leave based entirely on a mother's prebirth earnings. I find it very interesting that in so many areas the Labor Party conveniently wants to be world leader.



Senator McEwen interjecting—



Senator McLucas interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Cash, resume your seat. I remind senators that under standing order 197 a senator shall not interrupt another senator speaking except to call to attention a point of privilege or a point of order. Senator Cash has the call.




Senator CASH:
  As I was stating, the Labor Party conveniently, when it suits them—certainly not when it suits the Australian public—likes to be world leader in so many areas. They want to be a world leader when it comes to the carbon tax. They promised the Australian people, prior to the last election—the 2010 election—that there would be no carbon tax if they were elected to government. Conveniently, when they assumed office, they broke that promise. And when we questioned them as to why they broke that promise, what did they say? They said that Australia needs to be a world leader when it comes to reducing the impacts of climate change. So what do they do? Well, in four days time they will impose on Australia the world's greatest carbon tax.


So they want to be a world leader when it comes to carbon taxes. However, when it comes to the paid parental leave scheme it is the exact opposite. Goodness forbid that the Labor Party actually support women. Goodness forbid that the Labor Party actually support the economic success of women—because gosh, you cannot actually give women a hand up in life if you are from the Labor Left! You need to keep them down, because then you have an excuse for remaining in government.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Cash, resume your seat. Senators on my right and my left, I remind you again that under standing order 197 a senator shall not be interrupted except on a point of privilege or order. Senator Cash has the call.




Senator CASH:
  Goodness forbid that the Labor Party would ever say to women in Australia, 'We think it is absolutely fantastic that you are successful.' Did you know that less than one per cent of women in Australia earn in excess of $100,000? Instead of saying to those women, 'Well done; we celebrate your success, because we want you to be better,' what does the Labor Party say? They say: 'Quite frankly, that's not good enough. If you take time off work we will not give you a replacement wage. Because we're from the left of society, we believe that all you are entitled to is a welfare benefit.' And that is what they give them.


We on this side of the parliament, however, celebrate the economic success of women. If there is a woman in Australia who gets an improvement in her job, if there is a woman in Australia who gets an increase in salary, we say that is absolutely fantastic, because that is a step in the right direction towards ensuring the financial security of women. That is why our paid parental leave scheme will celebrate the economic success of those women and provide them with 26 weeks at their replacement wage up to $150,000.


Despite the Gillard government's best efforts to talk up the benefits of Labor's paid parental leave scheme, the truth is that the coalition is the party in Australia that celebrates the economic success of women, and that is why it is our paid parental leave scheme that is the better scheme for Australia.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2012-06-27,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Bob Carr) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ronaldson today relating to Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits recipients and the carbon tax.


Obfuscation and bravado is clearly no substitute for even a passing interest in veterans' pensions. This minister today has been caught out because he has absolutely no knowledge or understanding of what people are doing in the real world. Veterans are doing it tough, and I will tell you exactly why a little later on.


The responsibility of government involves an awful lot more than having a deep cultured voice and a thespian demeanour. This minister brings to the table of charade of knowledge that is so thin as to be almost as thin as this government's prospective budget surplus. There are 57,000 DFRDB personnel. They have been misled; they have been lied to; they have been effectively cheated of their vote in the 2000 election.


Pensioners have received compensation. The question to this minister was: what is going to happen to DFRDB recipients? He did not even know that Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits is referred to as DFRDB. He was groping around looking for what is one of the most important things. These are people who have given great service to their country and this minister simply does not know or care or understand about them. He is dismissive. He was clearly inconvenienced by having been asked a question on the plight of these pension recipients in the face of this carbon tax based upon a lie. It was a lamentable performance.


It makes me worry about our standing with our near neighbours and further abroad when this man is in charge of diplomatic issues. To be so dismissive, to be so disdainful and, frankly, to be so ignorant says a lot about why we have had, since 2007, 350 boats and more than 19,000 people arrive on our shores. When he goes back to his office I can just imagine the first thing he will say to his staff is, 'What the hell is DFRDB? What is it? What on earth is MTAWE?'—male total average weekly earnings. He has no concept of the day-to-day lives of ordinary Australians. He does not even know or understand the massive betrayal, given that Kevin Rudd said, before the 2000 election: 


A Rudd Labor government will maintain a generous military superannuation system, in recognition of the importance of the ADF and the immense responsibility placed on personnel in securing and defending Australia. 


… … …


The Military Superannuation Review is the latest example of the Howard Government refusing to release vital information about the operation, costs and alternative policy approaches that should be considered in this area. 


'A Rudd government will provide a fresh approach.' So he held out the opportunity and the prospective opportunity for DFRDB recipients to have an indexed system that was 'much fairer and more generous'. What did they do? On 21 August 2009, Lindsay Tanner said:


The Rudd Government is satisfied, after considering Mr Matthews’ report, the purpose of indexation of civilian and military superannuation pensions should continue to maintain the purchasing power of the pension.


We are aware that this will disappoint many superannuants ...


In short, all of the promises by Rudd and Labor were cast aside by this callous government. They wonder why their primary vote is at 30 per cent. It is the great lies: the carbon tax, the 2009 defence white paper and of course the promises to veterans to index defence DFRDB pursuant to MTAWE—and we know that that was the great lie. This minister has no idea about it. (Time expired)

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:08):  It is very surprising and disappointing that Senator Johnston would use this take note debate to attack a minister and to attack people for having no responsibility and no respect for people who served our country. There has never been a debate in this place that that was the point. There has been a debate in this place about the appropriateness of how you actually look at DFRDB pensions and it has been quite serious and over a long period of time. As people on both sides of this chamber know, the issue of changing the way DFRDB pensions are assessed is not a new issue. We could go back over the extensive debates in this area, through periods of the Howard government through to the Rudd and the Gillard governments, and there have been disagreements. Recently, a very strong debate was conducted in this place that ended up with a decision that we would change the process. That was very difficult and people were deeply affected by the process. 


Senator Johnston was quoting again from the piece of paper that they have about what the Rudd process was before the 2007 election. Again, in the very words read out by Senator Johnston, there was an agreement for a 'fresh approach'. There was an agreement that the issues would be considered and indeed they were. As Minister Carr reflected in his answer to the Senate today, the report was done with the support of this chamber and it was an independent review of the way pensions were to be assessed. The results of that independent review came to this place and the government agreed with the review. That was not easy. All of us, every person in this chamber, have people in our electorates who have DFRDB pensions. All of us know what extremely strong advocates they are and I would expect that every one of us meets regularly with those people. They come forward with their arguments and they are very telling about the way they feel that their DFRDB pensions should be assessed. 


Those same arguments were the ones that they took to the review in 2008 and the independent assessment said that that was not going to be the way that the pensions would be assessed. We will continue to have a debate, and I think we should. None of these issues should remain untouched. All these debates should be had, but the real issue of the debate should be about what we are discussing, not some attempted slur on our minister, as we have seen today, to imply that he did not have any compassion or knowledge of the people who have served our country. That is not the way to have an effective debate. That is not the way to show respect for the very personnel about whom we are talking. The question given to the minister today talked about the process for DFRDB pensions, and we do know what that means—and Minister Carr does know what a DFRDB pension is—




Senator Ronaldson:
  He has no idea.




Senator MOORE:
  I can guarantee that he does in terms of the process. What the question was referring to was how it was going to be calculated for the impact of the carbon price. That was not mentioned by Senator Johnston in his taking note contribution. Senator Ronaldson clearly knows that the point of his question was about how the pensioners on the DFRDB system would be impacted by the carbon price. That was what the minister went to in his answer. But in Senator Johnston's taking note effort, he turned that around to an attack on the foreign minister. That does not actually add to the debate. It becomes personal and minimises the impact of the original question.


We can tell people in this chamber what the impact on DFRDB pensions will be by the indexation of their pension. Certainly, you would have to admit that the minister did say that DFRDB pensioners will have their pension linked to the CPI. That is what happens now. That is the result of the Wallis review. That is the result of several debates, and I think there have been at least three debates in the last 18 months in this place on the way DFRDB pensions will be handled. After all of those debates, the end result is that the CPI is the way that the pensions will be handled. I fully expect that we will have these debates into the future, and so be it. But in looking at the way the question was answered today, and that is what taking note is all about, what was said was that they are done through the CPI—the impact on DFRDB pensions will be continuing.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2012-06-27,"



Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (15:13):  As much as I like Senator Moore, that speech bore absolutely no relevance to either the response of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the response of Senator Johnston. Senator Carr clearly had no idea what DFRDB is—none at all. He probably knows by now because he is back in his office. He did not attempt to answer that question at all. He read from a brief which had been passed to him by someone else. Again, we have the repetition and the reinforcement today that the Australian Labor Party do not support the coalition's view on changing the DFRDB indexation. We know, again as a result of today, that the only way those DFRDB and DFRB recipients are going to get an appropriate indexation of their pensions is by a change of government. That was reinforced today. The minister made no attempt to answer my question in relation to the impact of the carbon tax on military superannuants. Some 57,000 superannuants and their families will receive no compensation for the carbon tax. That was quite clear from Minister Carr's answer today, or lack of answer, because if it were otherwise he had the perfect opportunity to set the record straight. They will be getting no compensation. So on 1 July 57,000 Australians and their families will get the double-whammy. They only get the six monthly CPI increase and not the full suite of indexation options that the coalition will provide, and they get no compensation at all. 


Regarding Minister Carr, I would just make this comment. Every other minister in this place walks in with two armfuls of briefs. This minister, who has the responsibility of representing the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, walks in with a folder that fits under one arm—no weight at all. And he gives no weight to his responsibilities. He swans around this place as an esoteric show pony. He is not doing his job and he deserves to have someone sit down and tell him that he just does not swan in here and then swan overseas and not accept any responsibility for the matters for which he has representative responsibility.


I want to turn in the time left open to me to a quite remarkable speech given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the other place on 31 May. In a remarkable contribution, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs suggested that it was illogical that we the coalition pursue fair indexation of pensions. I do not have the time to go through this quote, but what the minister did was to take an example of a colonel equivalent who retired in 2010 after 35 years of service and then frame his whole debate around a superannuation payment of $59,000 per year. What he said was:


You might tell me what the logic is here. What is the logic of equating a superannuation payment of $59,000 per year to the age pension?


Well, we have equated military super­annuation to the age pension. We have equated it to the service pension. What the minister failed to do was to tell the other place that he had inflated by 250 per cent the average payment under the DFRDB and the DFRB. It was an absolutely and totally duplicitous use of an example that he should have known, and did know, was not an example of the average amount of the DFRDB or the DFRB. It was a deliberate attempt to mislead the other chamber by a minister who leads a government and who fails to accept that what is happening to military superannuants at the moment is grossly unfair.


In the 28 seconds left to me, I will again repeat that I do not care what Senator Moore and others say about further discussion taking place on this matter, because quite frankly no-one believes them. No-one believes the Australian Labor Party because 12 months ago in this chamber the Australian Labor Party and the Greens had the opportunity to provide fair indexation to military superannuants and they failed to do so.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2012-06-27,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (15:18):  As has been said today, and I think quite eloquently by my colleague Senator Moore, and earlier by Senator Carr, the government engaged Mr Trevor Matthews to conduct an independent review of the indexation method used to adjust Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation pensions. The government accepted Mr Matthews's recommendation that Commonwealth civilian and military superannuation pensions should continue to be indexed by the CPI. This is important, because if we had chosen not to accept Mr Matthews's recommendation those on the other side would be coming in and harping on as they do. So it does not matter what we on this side do; the other side always find the negative and like to take it up.


As Senator Moore alluded to, and I agree with her, this debate does need to continue. But I find it bizarre that the opposition come in and slur a minister and allege to know what he knows or does not know. I do not know how they know what he does know or does not know in relation to definitions and acronyms. But it is not the first time this week that the opposition have come in and slurred people. In fact, I myself was slurred by none other than Senator Bernardi the other day. I am pretty tough, and I am quite happy to take it up, but this is just another example of how they come in and tell so many untruths and so many fictions. Senator Bernardi commented that I had never worked in private enterprise or been self-employed. I have, Mr Deputy President, as I am sure you are aware. You are Tasmanian, so I am sure you are aware of that. I have done both of those things, so I am really pleased to be able to get that on the record.


It is pretty important that those on the other side come in and tell truths, but they do not. They continue to tell untruths. They continue to run their scare campaigns. They continue to carry on. If I listened to those on the other side, I might as well not wake up on 1 July because the world will come to an end. Mr Abbott himself has commented in regard to that. I think the direct quote from Mr Abbott was that the 'spectre' will destroy and kill entire industries and 'wipe towns off the map'. This is just another way those on the other side carry on all the time and tell untruths. Honestly, people are getting really sick of it. I was also interested today in some of the other comments that were made in regard to people on this side. What some of the newer senators on that side have not worked out is that I used to work in the childcare industry. In fact, it is the place where I was self-employed for quite some years. When I worked in the childcare industry, I could control 30 three-year-olds. But trying to control those on the other side—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Bilyk. I just want to draw to your attention back to the motion before the chair. I have given you a fair amount of free range and latitude. I just draw your attention to the motion before the chair.




Senator BILYK:
  No, Mr Deputy President, I am sorry, but I have to say that I am just trying to point out to those on the other side interjecting constantly throughout my speech—they have not stopped since I stood up—that I can just keep talking over them and I am happy to do that. They can waste their breath but, having worked with three-year-olds previously, I am quite used to being able to do that.


What else can we say about the motion to take note today? As I said, the government engaged Mr Trevor Matthews. This is something the other side do not seem to want to acknowledge. Mr Matthews, who is a prominent actuary—he does not do his funding processes in cafes or restaurants—conducted this independent review of the indexation method used, and we accepted those recommendations. That is what we have gone on. Those on the other side, as I said earlier, just do not like that fact. If we had not accepted any of those recommendations they would have had a little grizzle about that. They are grizzling about this. They grizzle that the sky is falling in. They grizzle that Whyalla is going to be wiped off the map. I do not personally think that is going to happen, and I do not think the sky is going to fall in. They come in here and grizzle all the time. They do have a bit of a problem—yes, I accept that—with the fact that I have worked for a trade union representing workers. (Time expired)

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2012-06-27,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (15:24):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Bob Carr to questions asked by Senator Ronaldson. I would like to go back to 10 March this year to an article written by Major General John Cantwell, retired. He starts by saying:


It's all about respect.


He is quite correct. He goes on to say:


Fitzgibbon was out of his depth. He simply didn't get it.


That statement can be applied to many on the other side. The answer to this question today is a classic example. We are talking about respect for the people who have served this nation and who have retired on a DFRDB pension. We are talking about the fact that service pensioners, who are a different group, age pensioners and others have received compensation but the people who are on a DFRDB have not. This government and their representatives here in this chamber do not even understand the difference. How can they pretend to have respect for service men and women of this country when they do not even understand the basis upon which people receive their retirement income? Major General Cantwell is indeed correct when he says that it is all about respect.


If this government respected our serving men and women, not only would ministers be across their briefs and understand the things that affect people but they would be looking out for the interests of people affected by their portfolios. They would not just be able to answer questions here in the Senate; they would be proactively looking out for the interests of those people to make sure that budget measures did not disadvantage them. Clearly, the minister responsible and his representative here in the Senate today have not taken the first step to being proactively concerned for people who are DFRDB recipients in terms of the carbon tax compensation payments and have not bothered to be across their briefs to be accountable in this place when they are asked questions.


The same lack of respect goes to how they have treated service men and women in this budget. Not since 1938 has a government stripped so much funding out of and paid so little of our gross national income to the defence department. The budget cuts not only are on major items, the $1.6 billion cut from equipment, but also go to personnel issues—for example, saving a small amount of money, about $15 million, by cutting the eligibility of single members aged 21 and over, about 22,000 people, to have an airfare paid for their next of kin once a year. That may seem like a small thing but for somebody who does not know when they will be returning from an exercise or from deployment or who may not be close to internet access to book cheap fares that can be a significant cost impact if you are based in Northern Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia and your family lives in Adelaide, Sydney or Melbourne or in the regional parts of Australia. So to achieve their wafer-thin budget surplus, which there is no guarantee they will achieve, this government have been prepared to not only place Australia's national security at risk through cutting funding, some $5.5 billion from the budget this year, and deferring programs over a number of years; they have also shown a complete lack of respect for our service men and women through these measures which affect personnel entitlements.


That flows on to things like caring for wounded and injured servicemen. The government makes great announcements about programs but then it turns out that those are funded from within Defence's existing budget. Defence is doing a very good job, as we found out at estimates, of trying to make that work. But the reality is that the things that this government claims about its care and respect for servicemen is not demonstrated by the minister when he is in Afghanistan and it is not demonstrated by the minister or the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in their planning or preparation for when they come into this place. The minister was clearly not across his brief today and did not understand the basic question that was being asked. It shows that Major General Cantwell is indeed correct: it is all about respect, and there is no respect from this government.

  This motion from the opposition is more about politics than outcomes for people with disability. It is about the opposition trying to find a place in the political sun rather than doing the hard work to design an NDIS to deliver real outcomes for people with disability, their families and carers. Irrespective of the words of the motion, the coalition does not have a clear position on supporting an NDIS. Our Labor government is getting on with the job of building a national disability insurance scheme. We have delivered $1 billion to fund our share of the first stage of a national disability insurance scheme. Twenty thousand people with significant and permanent disabilities, their families and carers will benefit from the first stage in up to four locations around the country. The first stage will start in the middle of next year, a full year ahead of the timetable set out by the Productivity Commission. We are getting on with the job because we know how long people with disability have been waiting for change. They waited for change for 12 years under the Howard government while disability funding went backwards. We asked the Productivity Commission to look into care and support for people with disability because we knew the system was letting people down. This motion from the opposition is about politics. It is not about doing the right thing for people with disability.

  I thank the chamber. This short statement is essentially on behalf of Senator Siewert, who is on leave of absence this week and who has carriage of this matter. The Australian Greens do support the obvious need for cross-party support for the NDIS and increased transparency for the rollout process, so this is a measure brought forward by the coalition that we support in intent but not in effect. We do not believe that establishing a joint select committee is the best way of achieving the kinds of transparency and broad cross-parliamentary support that this measure is going to required. We have spoken to a broad range of stakeholders who have voiced concerns about today's attempt by the coalition to form a joint committee. They are wary of action which adds further unnecessary oversight to an already very complex process. Other mechanisms, such as an improved Senate estimates process, would help ensure that the NDIS rollout can be examined closely without adding an additional layer of bureaucracy to the process. We have reached an agreement with the government that additional information on the rollout will be provided through regular briefings to the parliamentary friends of people with disability group, which, of course, has coalition members.

Senator FIFIELD:


To say that I am extremely disappointed and the coalition is extremely disappointed with the decision of the government and the Greens in relation to this motion is an understatement. The assertion by Senator McLucas that the opposition does not support an NDIS is outrageous. The government are quite happy to say from time to time that there is bipartisan and cross-party support and they willingly supported the previous motion but when it actually comes to a concrete demonstration that they genuinely support bipartisanship, that they genuinely want bipartisanship and that they genuinely want cross-party support they reject that at every opportunity. The opposition has extended the hand of bipartisanship in relation to this motion. Mr Abbott has written to the Prime Minister three times proposing the establishment of a cross-party committee. Because the implementation of an NDIS will span several parliaments, there needs to be a mechanism to lock in all parties over several parliaments. But there also needs to be a mechanism that will elevate the implementation of an NDIS above partisanship. The government have rejected the mechanism that would do just that. They are very happy to pay lip service to bipartisanship and they are very happy to pay lip service to cross-party support but when it actually comes to a practical demonstration they say no. I have got to tell you, Mr Deputy President, that the groups in this sector that I have spoken to think that this committee is a good idea. They want this committee and they will be extremely disappointed by the decision and the response of both the government and the Australian Greens.

Senator LUDLAM:
  I thank the chamber. This short statement is essentially on behalf of Senator Siewert, who is on leave of absence this week and who has carriage of this matter. The Australian Greens do support the obvious need for cross-party support for the NDIS and increased transparency for the rollout process, so this is a measure brought forward by the coalition that we support in intent but not in effect. We do not believe that establishing a joint select committee is the best way of achieving the kinds of transparency and broad cross-parliamentary support that this measure is going to required. We have spoken to a broad range of stakeholders who have voiced concerns about today's attempt by the coalition to form a joint committee. They are wary of action which adds further unnecessary oversight to an already very complex process. Other mechanisms, such as an improved Senate estimates process, would help ensure that the NDIS rollout can be examined closely without adding an additional layer of bureaucracy to the process. We have reached an agreement with the government that additional information on the rollout will be provided through regular briefings to the parliamentary friends of people with disability group, which, of course, has coalition members.



Senator Fifield interjecting—




Senator LUDLAM:
  We believe that this is an effective first step, Senator Fifield, in improving transparency. What we clearly need is an improved flow of information to stakeholders and to the community and we believe a clearer estimates process and improved briefings from the government is the best way to achieve this. I thank the chamber.

 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (15:37):  Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for two minutes.




Senator FIFIELD:


To say that I am extremely disappointed and the coalition is extremely disappointed with the decision of the government and the Greens in relation to this motion is an understatement. The assertion by Senator McLucas that the opposition does not support an NDIS is outrageous. The government are quite happy to say from time to time that there is bipartisan and cross-party support and they willingly supported the previous motion but when it actually comes to a concrete demonstration that they genuinely support bipartisanship, that they genuinely want bipartisanship and that they genuinely want cross-party support they reject that at every opportunity. The opposition has extended the hand of bipartisanship in relation to this motion. Mr Abbott has written to the Prime Minister three times proposing the establishment of a cross-party committee. Because the implementation of an NDIS will span several parliaments, there needs to be a mechanism to lock in all parties over several parliaments. But there also needs to be a mechanism that will elevate the implementation of an NDIS above partisanship. The government have rejected the mechanism that would do just that. They are very happy to pay lip service to bipartisanship and they are very happy to pay lip service to cross-party support but when it actually comes to a practical demonstration they say no. I have got to tell you, Mr Deputy President, that the groups in this sector that I have spoken to think that this committee is a good idea. They want this committee and they will be extremely disappointed by the decision and the response of both the government and the Australian Greens. I expected better and, quite frankly, I am appalled.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (15:47):  Mr President, I seek leave to make a brief statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  Mr Deputy President, unfortunately, I suspect that I will require the standard two minutes, but let's go. The government recognises the importance of providing legal protections to migrant workers. Australia already has strong protections in place for migrant workers. Importantly, these are the same protections afforded to all Australians. The fundamental rights of all persons in Australia are already covered by the international human rights treaties to which Australia is party. Domestically, migrant workers are protected through a range of antidiscrimination legislation such as the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Age Discrimination Act 2004 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Migrants and temporary entrants are also subject to the same workplace rights and protections as Australians. These protections are set out in legislation. 


In 2008 Labor introduced further protections for temporary skilled workers, in particular 457 visa holders, through the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008. This act strengthens the integrity of temporary working visa arrangements and ensures that extra protections are afforded to visa holders. It is also through these laws and policies that Australia ensures compliance with Australia's international human rights obligations in relation to workers and migrants more generally. Australia does not intend to become party to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.


Question negatived.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-06-27,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (15:50):  I thank the Senate for the support in considering this matter of public importance: the failure during the two years of the Gillard prime ministership to honour the commitment to fix the climate change, mining tax and border protection policy disasters.


It is important to remember that this year we have noted the passing of the second anniversary of when Prime Minister Gillard stuck the knife into former Prime Minister Rudd and assumed the leadership of the parliamentary Labor Party. She and the Labor Party may not have wanted to note that anniversary but, nonetheless, it is an anniversary worth noting. It may have passed without the slightest consideration on the Labor side but, for the Australian people, it marks two years of chronic failure to address the very things that Prime Minister Gillard said she was elected to do in the first place. When asked to justify why it was necessary for her—the loyal deputy who was as likely to ever become Leader of the Labor Party as she was to play full forward for the Western Bulldogs—to backtrack on those solemn promises she apparently made to Mr Rudd, to her Labor colleagues and to the Australian people, Ms Gillard said that it was because the government had lost its way. In particular, she highlighted three areas in which she believed that the government had lost its way and it was necessary to fix its policy direction. Those three areas were the government's climate change policies, the mining tax policy and the border protection policy disaster.


Where are we at two years later? Two years later, it is safe to say that Australia is in a deeper hole on all three fronts than it was two years ago, that all of these issues are now mired in greater public controversy, that all of these issues now see greater waste and that all of these issues see greater threat to the Australian public and, of course, to the operation of government in this country.


Let me address these three issues. I will do so in reverse. I will start with the border protection policy disaster because this of course is a matter that is the subject of a very serious debate in the other place as we speak. We have seen today yet more tragedy on the sea. We have seen today yet another instance of human life being placed at risk because of a failure of policy in this country. It is disappointing to see arguments being put now that the way to end this human tragedy at sea is somehow to risk human rights on land—because that seems to be the proposal that is being pushed and put forward by the government.


There is a hue and cry at present, because of the tragedies we are seeing, for something to be done. It is an admirable instinct that when we see tragedy, when we see cause for action, there is a cry for something to be done. But the something that should be done must always be something that will make the situation better. The something that should be done must be something that is well considered and well thought through. In this case, sadly, the something that is being embraced by those opposite and being embraced by some of the crossbenchers in the other place is the so-called Malaysia solution.


The Malaysia solution represents an amazing transition of government policy for Ms Gillard in particular. Ms Gillard was once dead set against any form of offshore processing—dead set against it. Then, as Labor leader going into the last election, she decided that she was willing to accept a form of offshore processing and was up to negotiate a regional processing arrangement that would see a centre established in East Timor but that she would never consider offshore processing in a country that was not a signatory to the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. After she managed to cobble together her government, we saw the situation where the East Timor proposal fell apart. The government, of course, had failed to dot its i's and cross its t's or indeed to do even the scantiest bit of homework about the East Timor proposal. It fell apart, and the government went looking elsewhere. Ultimately laid on the table was this Malaysia proposal. Remarkable—a country that is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.


I know that many opposite in this place and in the other place have grave concerns at the idea of Australia sending people who arrive here seeking asylum to Malaysia to be put at the back of the queue of others in Malaysia, with no guaranteed protections that Australia could reasonably be certain of to be afforded to their human rights. I know those concerns are shared by people opposite because people opposite have shared them with me. I have also heard them share them publicly. And I share those concerns.


The No. 1 reason why the Malaysia option should be rejected by this parliament is obviously the concern about the failure to be able to protect the most basic human rights of those who have come seeking asylum. It is the No. 1 difference between the proposal for Nauru and the proposal for Malaysia, because at least under the Nauru proposal the Australian government was in charge. Nauru has now become a signatory to the UN convention but nonetheless, importantly, the Australian government was in charge of the facilities. People were still processed in a manner in which their rights were not just respected but guaranteed. That is not the case with regard to Malaysia.


That is why the amendment to what is before the other place should be accepted. Then we could get something done. Then we could get a solution to this issue. Then we could actually see some progress on this very important subject, rather than the government doggedly sticking to an option that even those who really care about this issue in their own party know is an awful, awful solution.


The two other issues related to this matter of public importance, the mining tax and the climate change policies, which of course have turned into the carbon tax—the carbon tax that Ms Gillard said before the last election would never be introduced under a government she led—are equally areas of policy disaster. They are disasters on a less tragic scale when it comes to human life but certainly on a scale that is significant for the Australian economy, which will have significant ramifications for all Australians going forward. In a few days time, these taxes will take effect and have dramatic repercussions across the Australian economy. The mining tax poses great uncertainty to the budget and this week we have seen total uncertainty as to whether the mining tax will manage to raise any money at all—a remarkable situation. It is totally uncertain as to how this tax will deliver for the Australian government. However, there is no doubt the carbon tax will, in the first three years of a fixed price, raise billions and billions of dollars, a fixed price way above anything applied anywhere else in the world, with a scope and a coverage across the economy far beyond that anywhere else in the world.


Labor's carbon tax will threaten Australian jobs in Australian industry because it is applied here and not applied in the countries who are our major competitors or our major trading partners. It will have a direct cost-of-living impact on all Australians, especially on the millions of Australian households who, as government modelling admits, will be worse off. Across these three areas what does the report card say for Ms Gillard after two years? It says she and the Labor Party have gone backwards on these policy failures.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-06-27,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (16:00):  Here we have it again, another Orwellian motion from the Orwellian writers of the Liberal Party. The only major party in this parliament doing anything about climate change and spreading the benefits of the mining boom and border protection is the Australian Labor Party. All those opposite ever do is say no to policy reform in these areas. In fact, they are so negative that their spokesperson on immigration said on 7.30 the other evening that he would even vote against their own policy in the parliament if it were put forward by the Australian Labor Party. That shows the credentials of those opposite when it comes to serious consideration and resolution of issues, in particular the most pressing issue facing our nation at the moment—that is, border protection. I will come to that in a moment.


In respect of climate change, it is a complete furphy that the Labor Party is not delivering on its commitments. Nine out of 10 climate scientists all agree that human induced global warming is pushing up the planet's temperature and that, if we do not do something about it, there will be catastrophic economic and social consequences. The Stern review and the Garnaut review were the most comprehensive economic and scientific studies into this issue. In the wake of those reviews, Australia made an international commitment to reduce emissions by five per cent by 2020. The opposition has now adopted that target and we have the same target for the reduction of emissions in our economy—five per cent by 2020. 


The question then becomes: how do we achieve that in the most efficient method? There have been no fewer than 37 parliamentary inquiries in this parliament into that very question. Each and every one of them has recommended a market based mechanism as the most effective, efficient and cheapest way to reduce emissions in our economy. That was the finding of the Shergold review, implemented by John Howard when he was Prime Minister of this country.


What is this parliament to do? Ignore those 37 parliamentary inquiries, ignore all of the work conducted by those experts into this issue? We would be fools, and the Australian public would see us as such, if we were to ignore the advice of those experts. That is why Labor is implementing its policy of a market based mechanism to reduce carbon emissions in our economy over time.


We all know that households, families, have made changes to their behaviour to reduce emissions and their carbon footprint. They have been involved, at increasing cost, in refitting their houses, installing energy efficient light bulbs, refitting their showerheads and investing in low-emission vehicles instead of gas guzzlers. Households and families have made a commitment to reduce their carbon emissions. This government believes it is about time that big business and big companies that are responsible for the overwhelming majority of emissions in our economy did the same thing, that they pulled their weight and took on some of the responsibility that households in this country have taken to reduce emissions. That is what our plan is all about. 


Three hundred companies will pay a price for the right to pollute. There will be cost increases. We have never said there will not be. There is no cost-free way to reduce emissions in our economy, despite what those opposite would like the Australian public to believe. There will be costs associated with it and we have asked Treasury to model those. The modelling has estimated that the cost impact on the CPI will be 0.7 per cent, one fifth of the cost impact of the goods and services tax when it was introduced by the Howard government. When that was done, Treasury modelled the cost impacts of the GST. They said that the cost impact would be 2.49 per cent on the CPI. What did it come in at? It came in at 2.5 per cent. They were spot on then with their modelling and they will be spot on again—0.7 per cent on the CPI will be the cost impact of Labor's clean energy future package. On average, households will receive $10.10 per week to compensate them for the average rise to the CPI of $9.90 per week. 


And we have given extra powers to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to prosecute companies who seek to price gouge and take advantage of the fundamental change which will be occurring in our economy over the coming months and years. The longer we wait to take action on climate change the greater the cost will be and the greater the cost will be for future generations of Australians. It will not be us who will be paying it if we do not do something now; it will be our children and our grandchildren. They would pay hell of a lot more than we would to deal with this issue. That is why we are acting on climate change and that is why we have implemented the Clean Energy Future package. 


The second element of this goes to the mining boom and the mining tax. Well, Labor have delivered the minerals resource rent tax. We have seen that these companies are making super profits, many of them international companies sending some of those profits overseas—profits from minerals that belong to the Australian people. We have seen that the royalty system that the states have is inefficient and does not tax properly the returns that people are getting from some of these mines. That is why we implemented the minerals resource rent tax in consultation with representatives of the mining industry. What will that deliver? It will deliver an increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent over the next eight years, boosting retirement incomes for Australians. It will also deliver greater investment in rural and regional infrastructure—in roads, rail and ports—in some of these important mining towns that are crying out for sufficient investment in their infrastructure.


Through other policies, we are spreading the benefits of the mining boom. We understand that Australian families who are not in the fast lane in our economy are feeling the effects of cost-of-living increases. That is why we are implementing tax cuts through the recent budget. Anyone on less than $80,000 will receive a tax cut of $300 per year on average. We are tripling the tax-free threshold, taking it from $6,000 to $18,000—a great win for people on low incomes, as most of them will now pay no tax. They will pay no tax under Labor, which is a great incentive for those people.


We are introducing the schoolkids bonus because we understand there are cost pressures associated with sending kids to school. Families will get compensation in the form of $410 for primary school students and $820 for high school students. We have implemented a supplementary payment to ensure that families can meet electricity and gas price increases, the majority of which are due to network upgrades being undertaken by state governments, which have offered insufficient rebates to families and households to cover the cost of these network upgrades. We are not doing that. We understand these cost pressures and so we are providing people with sufficient compensation, not only through the Clean Energy Future package but also through a supplementary payment to help meet those cost increases. We are increasing family tax benefits to ensure that those who are on the lowest incomes in our economy get the extra support they need to make the transition to a clean energy future. We have increased our investment in the areas of disability support and aged care, with a $1 billion investment over the coming financial year in the establishment of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, and extra money for aged care—in particular, for home-care support.


How would those opposite spread the benefits of the mining boom? We do not know. We do not know because they will not tell us. All they have told us is that they oppose the minerals resource rent tax. They oppose taxing the biggest miners and using that revenue to spread the benefits to families in this country. They oppose that. What we do know is that they are planning $70 billion worth of cuts to services—$70 billion. At each and every opportunity I ask them: what will those cuts involve? Will it be Medicare? Will it be the childcare rebate? Will it be pensions?




Senator Brandis:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: the senator is misleading the Senate in a wilful manner, because he knows that the opposition has not said that—

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2012-06-27,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (16:11):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, looking at the Hon. Julia Gillard's two years as Prime Minister of our country. Some over there might be celebrating, but I do not think many are. Why are the polls so bad for Labor? This longstanding party is supposed to represent the workers. As I often say, you cannot find a shearer among the Labor Party senators over there, even though the shearers started their party—now it is full of union reps. They are the ones going around selling the tickets, getting the commissions, getting the free ride. What are they celebrating from the two years of the Hon. Julia Gillard as Prime Minister?


Remember the words Ms Gillard used when she had the faceless men, Paul Howes and the crew, around her to dispose of the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd? She said the government had 'lost its way'. Next thing, she will tell us the government has found its way! How ridiculous. Before the last election, we all heard—and I am sure you remember it very well, Mr Deputy President—what Ms Gillard, and Treasurer Swan, said about a carbon tax. I will not repeat it; everyone has heard it a hundred times.




Senator Brandis:
  No, say it again.




Senator WILLIAMS:
  I will say it again, at the request of Senator Brandis: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'




Senator Brandis:
  Who said that?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  That was the Prime Minister, who is still the Prime Minister thanks to people like Independents Mr Rob Oakeshott, Mr Tony Windsor and a couple of others. How could you stand in front of a camera and make a commitment to the Australian people that you would not bring in a carbon tax and then, after the election, go back on that—following pressure from the Greens, of course? Don't leave the Greens out of it. They are the ones who want to shut everything down, close every coalmine in Australia, have us go live in caves and issue us with three sticks of wood a week to keep ourselves warm and cook our meals. That is where they want to take us—



Senator Di Natale interjecting—




Senator WILLIAMS:
  Sorry, two sticks of wood, Senator Di Natale is pointing out!




Senator McEwen:
  Is that what he was doing?




Senator WILLIAMS:
  It may have meant something else, Senator McEwen; I am not sure! The point I make is this: we live in a modern world and we have to produce. We have to produce a lot of food in rural Australia, and we in rural Australia are so proud of our farmers and what they produce—and I have spent all my life living in rural Australia. We not only have to feed the Australian people; we also have to feed millions of other people overseas. As I said, we have to produce, but we live in a modern world, so we have, for example, big tractors. Case IH STXs these days have 460 horsepower. Farmers do not go along behind a Clydesdale horse with a one-furrow mouldboard plough any longer. We have to produce large volumes of food. Going back to the Prime Minister's commitment that there would be no carbon tax, we find out today that agriculture is exempted from the carbon tax, except for the $3.2 billion in the first year it is going to cost farmers, going up another $3.7 billion come July 2014. When we add another $520 million tax to the truckies' diesel to the carbon tax, it is no wonder that Tony Sheldon, boss of the Transport Workers Union, called it 'a death tax'. So much for the transparency and honesty Ms Gillard said she would deliver two years ago.


Sadly, we are talking about asylum seekers again. Sadly, another tragedy is unfolding today. This is really a serious issue. We know what happened. I can take you back to July-August 2001, when a thousand asylum seekers a month were coming to Australia. The coalition government, led by Prime Minister John Howard, and the immigration minister, Mr Phillip Ruddock—a very capable man and a man I have huge respect for—had a problem. The problem was that people were coming to this country in droves. They were putting their lives at risk on those leaky boats, paying their way to get here. Now we have tragedies again. We had a problem and we fixed the problem. It was this Labor government that said: 'Oh, let's abolish temporary protection visas; let's lower the bar; let's send a signal to those people-traffickers over there with their boats looking for an easy dollar—an easy retirement amount in Indonesia—and open the industry again.' Look at the tragedies we have faced—last week, last weekend and now again today. This must be stopped.


The Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard, said before the last election that she had the problem solved—East Timor would solve the problem. She told all of Australia that. It was her open and transparent way of communicating with Australia again, just as she had not communicated with the East Timorese government. That is where the problem was—nothing had been put in place. When that falls apart, along comes the Malaysian solution—something that we will never accept because the Prime Minister, Ms Julia Gillard, said on Perth radio that this government she leads would not send asylum seekers to countries that are not signatories of the 1957 Refugee Convention. And where did she want to send them? To a country that is not a signatory to that convention. It is simply another false statement. Of course, the High Court put an end to that. To think that you would send 800 asylum seekers in Australia to Malaysia and take 4,000 from Malaysia, when we cannot guarantee their health or the education for their youngsters and we cannot look after them properly. What is the government doing? It is a sad day when we find ourselves facing the loss of life with disasters happening far too frequently.


What is wrong with the solution that the coalition government had? I was not in this place then, but in 2001 the coalition government had the problem—it was looking them in the face—and they found a solution and brought it to a stop. Members of the government have sadly created the problem again, because they changed the rules and sent a clear message that we are an easy touch. The end result is the loss of life. This is the transparency, the accountability and the stability that the Prime Minister talked about after the election with the Independents, including my federal member, Mr Tony Windsor, in the seat of New England, who went with this government for stability, accountability and longevity. There would be millions of Australians who would be saying, 'We wish we didn't have the longevity now—just bring on an election and let the people of Australia have a say in who runs this country.' The problem this government has is that the Australian people do not trust this government. They do not trust them on their promise that the carbon tax, which will hit small business starting this Sunday. This Saturday we celebrate Australian small business, the biggest employer. I have worked in that sector all my life, either farming or small business, either driving trucks or a small business on the land. We love small business, but small business do not trust this government. They did not want that tax. They do not trust this government for the way it borrows money—last Friday the gross debt was $233.45 billion.


They do not trust the way the government borrows the money or how they waste the money. We have seen the programs, such as the Building the Education Revolution. You hand all that money to New South Wales, the proud state I come from, but its Labor government employed Reed Constructions to do all the programs in the New England area and the North Coast. Just this week we find a builder at Moree owed $640,000 by Reed Constructions, which was hand picked by the Labor government and is in administration. They have done their dough—$640,000 to a builder in Moree, not to mention the $80-odd thousand to the little builder in Warialda. These people will not see their money now. This is the way the government handles money—you are so irresponsible with taxpayers' money or the money you borrowed and the debt you are building. That is why the people do not trust you, especially in regional Australia, with your carbon tax. It is going to hurt the regions more than anywhere else, where electricity prices are already higher and where they are already facing tough times with the high dollar and higher cost of living. The people do not trust you. They have every reason not to trust the government, because of what it has done to our nation with debt, with border protection, with waste of money, with broken promises, with new tax after new tax to fill your big hole of debt.

  Of course, Senator Brandis knows everything about everything. What would the coalition have done during the global financial crisis? We know what they would have done—nothing.

The only thing that they do know is the word no. They have continually said no, and the Australian public are sick of it. They have actually at some point to come out with some positive policies.

Those opposite can sit on the other side of the chamber and take pot shots at the government over climate change, but it is worth remembering that they too used to believe, that those opposite, under Mr Howard and Mr Turnbull, were supporters of a carbon price.




Senator Williams:
  I wasn't here!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  They supported an emissions trading scheme. I am sure there are still some on that side of the chamber who believe. Some of those opposite know that taking action on climate change is the right thing to do. They know that we must reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and they know that a price on carbon is the most effective and efficient way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They do not have to believe me—I am sure they will not—but it is worth remembering that some of those opposite have stated their belief in climate change and in the need to introduce a carbon price. Okay, Senator Williams, you were not here. You are relieved of that obligation. But we know that your leader, Mr Abbott, said on Lateline in October 2009:


We don't want to play games with the planet. So we are taking this issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS …


Again, Mr Turnbull—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  Sorry, who said that?




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Mr Abbott, of course. Mr—I was going to say Mr Negativity—Mr Abbott.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Well you have; do not do it again!




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  I am sorry, Mr Deputy President. Next we have Mr Turnbull, who said on Q&A on 26 July 2010:


… you won't find an economist anywhere that will tell you anything other than that the most efficient and effective way to cut emissions is by putting a price on carbon.


While Mr Abbot's comments would suggest he was supportive of a carbon price, nothing could be further from the truth, because, as we know, over the past two years Mr Abbott has been running around spreading falsehoods and mistruths. He has engaged in the mother of all scare campaigns, which, unfortunately, has also reached Tasmania, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy President. He has been forecasting the end of entire industries. He has sent out his shadow ministry and his backbenchers, to go around predicting the end of towns, saying that whole towns will be wiped off the map. He has been trying to scare households into thinking that the sky is going to fall.




Senator Furner:
  Even puppies and kittens.




Senator CAROL BROWN:
  Yes, and today of course we had puppies and kittens brought into the negative story that is being told by Mr Abbott. Mr Abbott has been saying that the carbon price will be the wrecking ball that destroys Australia. But, slowly and surely, Mr Abbott has had to back away from these claims. Slowly, the truth is catching up with Mr Abbott. I look forward to 1 July when the carbon price is implemented and the mother of all scare campaigns can come crashing down.


Mr Abbott knows he is spreading mistruths. He knows that his mindless negativity and falsehoods will catch up with him and that he will be exposed. We have seen him, as we have seen the rest of the opposition, slowly shift away from his earlier description of the carbon price. He has gone from calling the carbon price the wrecking ball that will destroy industries and wipe towns off the map to now describing it as a python. Mr Abbott knows that his absurdities will be exposed. I do look forward to the time when those falsehoods are exposed.


While Mr Abbott has focused on spreading mistruths we have been getting on with talking about the facts of our scheme. I will take this opportunity to examine those facts. The federal Labor government's clean energy future package will place a price on carbon, it will cut pollution and it will drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure such as solar, gas and wind. Let us be clear: the carbon price will not be paid for by ordinary Australians. The carbon price is about making polluters pay. As such, only Australia's biggest polluters will pay the carbon price. All money raised by the carbon price will go to supporting jobs, to driving investment in clean energy technology and to households. This support to households through increased payments and tax cuts will be targeted to those who need it most. We will ensure pensioners, low- and middle-income earners and families doing it tough will be looked after. Nine out of 10 Australian households will receive assistance through a combination of tax and other increases to payments. Almost six million households will get tax cuts or increases to payments that cover the entire average price increase expected under a carbon price. Over four million Australian households will receive an extra buffer against the average price impact of the carbon price. These households will get assistance that is worth 120 per cent of the average price impact of the carbon price. All households will benefit from not having to pay the carbon price on any fuels including petrol, diesel and LPG for passenger motor vehicles. It is also worth remembering that this assistance is permanent, and the government will review the adequacy of the assistance each year and will increase it further if necessary.


Let me examine and refute the claim that Australia is going to do it alone internationally when it comes to the carbon price. While those opposite continue to wage their scare campaign, next week Australia will join more than three-quarters of the world's advanced economies in tackling climate change with an emissions trading scheme. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency has conducted an analysis that shows from 2013 there will be more than 50 national or subnational emission trading schemes in place around the world. These schemes will cover a combined population of more than 850 million people and account for around 30 per cent of the global economy, or 27 times the size of the Australian economy in 2012.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2012-06-27,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:31):  Government senators have risen in this place on this matter of public importance to defend the most conspicuous failures of the Gillard Labor government. It seems to me that they would be more intent on defining the problem and talking about the issue that the government is trying to confront than actually defending the government's solutions to those problems. They know as well as anybody else in Australia at the moment, observing these issues, that the very issues on which the Prime Minister defined the success or failure of her prime ministership are the very issues on which the government is most seriously failing.


On the issue of border protection, on the issue of new taxes, on the issue of climate change, confidence in the government's solutions to these problems is at rock bottom. There has never been less confidence in this government's capacity to handle any one of those three issues than there is today. That speaks volumes about how poorly this government has handled each of those issues.


Senator Carol Brown tells us we are running a scare campaign. Let us talk about the facts. Firstly, no country currently imposes an economy-wide tax on greenhouse emissions or has in place an economy-wide ETS. The United States, Canada, India, China, Japan and many others have all made it clear they will not be moving to the kind of broad based carbon tax that Australia is picking up. We are alone in taking this extraordinarily punitive approach to dealing with this problem, punitive to the ordinary men and women of Australia. Senator Brown said only the biggest polluters will pay the carbon price. Really? If that is the case why is compensation, such as it is, being directed to ordinary households.




Senator Williams:
  Because they'll pay as well.




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  Indeed, they will, Senator Williams—they will pay as well. This is a measure of the extraordinary hole that the government has dug for itself, that they are running these kinds of ridiculous lines—'Only  the top 500 polluters will pay'—but it is not the polluters who are getting the compensation; it is the households. Why are householders getting compensation? Because they are the ones who will pay at the end of the day with this extraordinarily stupid new tax.


We are told the carbon tax will not affect ordinary Australians, but already the dominos are falling. In my home of Canberra, Brindabella Airlines announced that they would cancel regular flights between Canberra and Albury and Canberra and Armidale. Why? Because the cost of the carbon tax has made it uneconomic to run routes of that kind. They estimate that the extra cost on the fuel that those routes entail caused by the carbon tax advent will contribute something like $1,000 a day to the cost of running the airline. It is the equivalent of $10 for every fare paid on that airline each day of the week, and that is why they have had to close those routes. That is a fact. They have had to make that decision. The decision has been made and the routes have gone. That is not scaremongering; it is fact.


The cost of the carbon tax to people living in this territory will be particularly severe because it is a cold city, as members opposite do not need to be reminded at the moment. It is a cold city and people here have higher than average earnings, which means that—again, these are not my figures; they are the figures of the ACT Labor government—60 per cent of Canberra households will be undercompensated for the carbon tax and 22 per cent of households in the ACT will receive no compensation whatsoever. If those opposite—and I am sure Senator Lundy would not be so foolish—think that 22 per cent of Canberrans are rich, are 'fat cats' who do not need compensation, clearly something is wrong with this badly flawed carbon tax.


The border protection policies of this government have failed. We only need to look at the many iterations of its policy to work out how badly it is floundering around, looking for new solutions every few months. This Prime Minister said she would fix the issue of border protection, of arrivals by boat, which had dogged the Rudd government. So she announced there would be a new solution. We would send our asylum seekers to be processed in East Timor, but the East Timorese had other ideas. They said no, you are not bringing refugees to be processed in East Timor. Then the government said they would go to a regional solution: 'We will have a regional solution that signs up other countries in our region to sort this problem out collectively.' How many countries today are signed up to the Labor government's regional solution, announced more than two years ago? The answer is, at best, one, if you want to count the bilateral arrangement with Malaysia as a regional solution. It is not a regional solution; it is one country. It is a special deal done for one country—a deal which is extraordinarily ill-advised which entails sending 800 refugees to Malaysia and having 4,000 come back to Australia. It is an extraordinarily badly designed arrangement and one which entails putting asylum seekers into a setting where they have been and will be caned. That is a completely unacceptable option. Do not take my word for it; ask the people on Labor's backbench who cannot live with that solution. I hope some of those present today also cannot live with it. 


It is a completely unacceptable option and represents the complete and abject failure of this government, and no doubt sometime in the next few days there will be another solution, a different solution to this problem. All of this is taking place against a backdrop of knowing that there is a solution—a solution which worked, a solution which operated effectively to slow the arrival of boats to a trickle under the previous government. In fact, there were some years when there were no boat arrivals at all. It worked, and we are told that somehow this is unacceptable. What stands in its way is pride, particularly the pride of this Prime Minister, who promised to fix this problem who said that she would be the one to solve the problem that so dogged the Rudd government, and still the boats come—thousands and thousands of people arriving on our shores, with a huge jump in the cost of managing those asylum seekers. The cost used to be about $85 million a year under the Howard government and has now climbed to $1.2 billion a year. 


I ask senators opposite to put aside the question about what is humane and what is fair to asylum seekers and ask themselves this: if somehow we could return to a policy which greatly reduced how much we have to spend dealing with unauthorised arrivals on our northern shores, how much benefit could we confer on the refugees of the world if we were to direct that $1 billion to assist people in refugee camps around the world? We do not admit any more refugees to this country under humanitarian settlement programs because we have to spend this money dealing with unauthorised arrivals on our shores. We still accept 13,500 people a year—the number is the same, it is just that more of them come on boats and fewer of them come through planned humanitarian resettlement programs. It is an extraordinary waste of money and it represents a huge immoral toll on the lives of people who are caught up in the tragedies we have seen in recent days. How extraordinary it is that this government should allow itself to get into this position.


Government senators have risen today to tell us what winners these policies are—how great the carbon tax is, how beneficial the mining tax will be to Australians, how effective its border protection policies are. Despite the evidence that these policies are anvils, which are dragging the government and its credibility to the bottom of the sea, government senators defend them and the Prime Minister, who was the architect of these policies in each case. I warn senators to be careful because the day is fast approaching when each of these senators will be faced with the question: do I dump this Prime Minister or do I leave her in place? When that question comes, if they answer, 'Yes, it is time to change the Prime Minister, again,' they will then have to answer the question: 'On what basis are we dumping the Prime Minister?' If it is not the questions of border protection, the mining tax and the carbon tax, what will be the basis for their decision? (Time expired)

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-06-27,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:41):  I rise to contribute to this debate today and, like always, it is another vexatious and frivolous motion put forward by those opposite, looking at a host of things that the government has been dealing with. This Sunday will mark the first anniversary where Australians can be proud that they are part of a clean energy future. They can be proud that this government is serious about tackling action on climate change. They can be proud that this government believes now is the right time to take action to ensure we leave behind the same environment that we enjoyed for future generations and for generations to come—generations like my first grandchild, who was born on the Queen's birthday this year. I want to leave something to that generation. That is what the opposition have failed to do: look to the future. 


They will also find on 1 July that the world is not going to end and that householders will not be stuck with a huge bill for emissions, as those opposite have been spruiking. The first of July will also signal the first day of an Australian government driving cleaner investment technologies, a government which will push clean alternatives like solar, gas and wind. We must emphasise that households will not be paying for carbon emissions, only those high-emitting businesses will be directly affected by this scheme. The more they pollute, the more they will pay. This will push these companies, many of which will receive transitional assistance, to move to cleaner technologies. 


On this side of the chamber, we are not the only ones who believe action on climate change is imperative. Many of those opposite spruiked their support for an emissions trading scheme, but are now speaking against it because they are disingenuous when it comes to tackling climate change and when it comes to this government progressively moving to a cleaner economy. For example, the member for Fadden, Stuart Robert, in August 2009 said in part: 


We believe that we need to give the planet the benefit of the doubt. We are committed to an ETS, informed by the Copenhagen meetings at the end of 2009, with a start date no earlier than 2012 ...


Also in 2009, Senator Brandis expressed his support for an ETS. He said:


The Coalition's policy, as has been expressed this week in clear terms by Malcolm Turnbull—


remember Malcolm Turnbull? He was knifed in the back by Mr Tony Abbott and the rest of them. Senator Brandis continued:


by Andrew Robb, by Greg Hunt, is support for an emissions trading scheme. In fact, it was Malcolm Turnbull as Minister for the Environment in the last year of the Howard Government who initiated legislation for an emissions trading scheme. So there is no doubt or ambiguity about the Coalition's position on this matter whatsoever.


They are your words, Senator Brandis. In 2009 another senator, Senator Eggleston, suggested that taxing carbon was the way to go. He said:


One way of avoiding the volatility of an emissions trading scheme would be to have a carbon tax. A carbon tax provides a very steady and known price for carbon, if you like, which is only varied by varying the tax. That tax can be set at a level that allows renewable energy systems to be competitive.


One of my duty seats is the electorate of Brisbane. I am really appalled that the Brisbane City Council's lord mayor, Graham Quirk, has blamed his hike in rates on a program that has yet to be implemented. It is going to be implemented this Sunday, yet he has already anticipated a rise in rates. Our assistance of $10.10 per week to households will compensate for this and it is no excuse to gouge ratepayers. Mr Quirk has added 0.7 per cent to rates, as he believes that pricing carbon will increase CPI by 0.7 per cent. This is unjustified, as CPI is a measure of inflation, not a measure of carbon pricing. Mr Quirk has also said Brisbane City Council will have to spend $1.3 million on carbon price administration and reporting. Once again, this is a fallacy. Brisbane City Council has already been reporting its greenhouse gas emissions for years under a national reporting system.


This is another scare campaign by the Liberal National Party. Just like Freddie Kruger in Nightmare on Elm Street, or Chucky in the Child's Play horror movies, you have the Mad Monk, Mr Tony Abbott, running around scaring everyone. Today it was reported in question time that he has even been scaring puppies and kittens here in Canberra with the lies they peddle in the scare campaign about the effects of the government's carbon emissions and renewable energy program.


On 1 July we will also see a new system of tax, with the tax-free threshold increasing from $6,000 to $18,200. One million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return, which will reduce the stress at tax time and also leave extra cash in the hands of our hardworking Australians.


Moving to the mineral resources tax, we will see the superannuation guarantee increase progressively until it reaches 12 per cent in 2019-20. I know those opposite opposed the superannuation guarantee legislation put in place when we were in government. We moved to allow workers to have something in retirement after their hardworking years in working life. So we are sharing the wealth of the mining boom, and that is exactly what we should be doing. We only have one opportunity to dig up our resources and this means we only have one opportunity to share the profits with Australians, and we will share it with all Australians.


I will move to the matter on everyone's lips today, particularly with the disastrous capsizing of a boat off Christmas Island, where approximately 130 people who were on board went into the water. Unfortunately, that is more and more becoming a reality and we need to deal with this issue. Fortunately, we have many brave men and women in the Australian Defence Force involved in the rescue and also men and women involved in the Customs department dealing with the rescue professionally and in a competent manner, picking those people up out of the water. For a long time now we have been willing to sit down with those opposite to negotiate a process to alleviate the threat, deal with the issue of border protection and combat the insidious trafficking by people smugglers who originate in Asia.


When it comes to how we deal with this, the Labor government is the only party that is willing to confront this issue and deal with offshore processing. I know those opposite indicate that they are willing to have some form of offshore processing, but when it comes to the point they are belligerent. Their bloody-mindedness in not being willing to sit down, negotiate and resolve it is stark. They are not even game to come to the table. They make these superficial claims and disingenuous offers to sit down and negotiate, but we cannot bring about a solution unless they are prepared to negotiate in good faith.


Included in our proposal to the opposition is the possibility of looking at Nauru and a review of temporary protection visas, which are coalition policies, as you would be aware, Acting Deputy President Crossin. This is an offer that has been continuously rejected by those opposite. We can only assume those opposite see more political benefit in continued boat arrivals than in pursuing their stated policies. They cannot deny that the High Court decision last year made all offshore processing illegal, including in Nauru.


We saw an attempt today by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Repre­sentatives to put forward a bill. They were inferring that they wanted to resolve this issue and referred to countries that were signatories to the UNHCR refugee provis­ions. One of those countries is Somalia. Can you imagine sending refugees to the likes of Somalia? They would not even get to the coastline if they were trying to arrive on those shores with the pirates that surround the country. This shows the disingen­uousness of those opposite in coming up with a solution to get this matter resolved. The only resolution is to sit down with the government of the day and resolve this matter, as we did when we were in opposition. However, we will not get a solution to this matter while you continue to play politics, as you always do, and continue down the road of disingenuousness. You allow yourselves to be continuously belligerent and bloody-minded so we cannot get a resolution to this insidious issue that confronts all of us in this country at this time.

A lot of the very good work of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee becomes a bit superfluous when you find that because of the guillotine a lot of the bills are dealt with in this chamber before the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report is tabled. But the Alert Digest—and I will not do more than bring this to the attention of senators—makes some very interesting comments on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2012 that is currently before the chamber and being dealt with as a matter of urgency.


All parties understand why it is urgent. But dealing with bills, particularly bills that have such enormous consequences, on the run, so to speak, can raise certain problems. The committee—and, I must confess, this was not the brilliance of the committee members so much as the brilliance of the legal advisers to the committee and of the committee secretary and staff—pointed out some issues in relation to the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) that really should be considered by all senators. So I draw that particular Alert Digest to the attention of senators.

Some of the issues there about undue trespass on rights and liberties would make interesting reading, and I urge senators to look at that. There are issues about fair trial, detention clauses and punishment causes in those bills that could well be looked at.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-06-27,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (17:31):  On behalf of the Chair of Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the 126th report on Treaty relating to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement tabled on 21 November 2011.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


In taking note of this report on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement—or ACTA, as it has become known—which was tabled in the Australian parliament on 21 November 2011, I highlight that this is a particularly noteworthy report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It is noteworthy because it deals firstly with just one treaty, the ACTA treaty or agreement. Secondly, most significantly, it is noteworthy because it does not recommend ratification at this time but instead takes the unusual step for JSCOT in outlining a range of steps that the treaties committee believed should be taken prior to further consideration regarding potential ratification of the treaty. 


This is unusual. It is a positive step from JSCOT in taking a treaty seriously and giving it the type of consideration necessary for these serious agreements. It is also positive in that it recommends a pathway forward and provides recommendations not just for the ACTA agreement but also for Australia's treaty, made in the process, that hopefully will encourage greater scrutiny and consideration of future agreements.


ACTA is an agreement designed to strengthen intellectual property standards around the world. It focuses, in particular, on trademark and copyright enforcement and establishes a legal framework for intellectual property enforcement. These are important issues and ones which I and the coalition have strong views about. We support such objectives: the protection of the intellectual property basis for many parts of our economy and for many individuals who are the developers and holders of such intellectual property.


ACTA has received strong support from Australia's performing arts community. All members of the community strongly support the need to protect the rights of the performing arts sector. It is certainly not ACTA's intent that the committee has expressed concern about. I think I can speak on behalf of all members of the committee in saying that there is a genuine belief in wanting to see IP enforcement enhanced to the best available standard.


The committee, however, is concerned that the text of ACTA potentially has a number of flaws and the committee is not yet convinced that the agreement in its current form would definitively be in Australia's national interest. Therefore the committee, in this report, asks for further analysis and clarification. In particular, the committee has noted the existing Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into copyright and the digital economy, which is due to report in the not too distant future, and hopes that the ALRC inquiry will inform future consideration of ACTA.


The committee has expressed its concern about the lack of clarity in some places regarding the text and also about certain exclusion provisions to protect the rights of individuals and ACTA's potential to shift the balance in the interpretation of copyright, intellectual property and patent law. The committee has made nine recommendations in this report, the most important being that this treaty should not be ratified by Australia until: the treaties committee has received and considered independent and transparent assessment of ACTA's economic and social benefits and costs; the ALRC report has reported on its inquiry into copyright and the digital economy; and the Australian government has provided clarification of some of the terms used in the treaty.


I note that this is a unanimous report that entails some give and take on all sides. Some members of the committee are perhaps more hopeful that we will see a conclusion of ACTA than others. I certainly fall into the category of those who hope we will ultimately see something that provides a greater global strengthening of our copyright and IP laws, which can be done in harmony with other countries and provide greater protection for those who develop and should rightly have some ownership of their IP into the future. But I do commend the treaty secretariat as well as all of my fellow members and senators on JSCOT for the spirit in which they approached this task.


The treaties committee has also made some recommendations to provide for some particular exclusions in the event that an ACTA is eventually ratified by the government. These exclusions relate to how patents are treated in the application of civil enforcement and border measures as well as ensuring that products produced in Australia as a result of the invalidation of a patent or a part of a patent in Australia are not subject to the counterfeiting prohibition enactor. Finally, the exclusions ensure that the expression 'counterfeit enactor' is not applied to generic medicines entered or eligible for entry on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.


I note on that last point that specific evidence was heard during the JSCOT hearings, and particular submissions were made regarding the treatment of generic medicines. I think that is an important area that I hope that the information provided by the government on this agreement in the future—and I hope it will be provided—covers some more specific consideration of its impact on the sector. I do particularly thank those in the generic medicine sector who provided particular evidence to the committee on those issues.


As I indicated, the committee has also taken an eye to the future and suggested that there are some lessons to be learned in the treatment of future agreements. It has suggested and recommended that future natural interest analyses of treaties, where the treaties clearly intend to have an economic impact, should actually include some assessment of the economic benefits and costs of the treaty. If not, and no assessment has been undertaken, at the least there should be a statement explaining why it was not undertaken or was unable to be undertaken. This has been an important factor in the committee's deliberations on this, with some members of the committee particularly concerned to have clearer evidence of the economic implications of this agreement.


There has also been some serious consideration given to the international reaction to ACTA, and indeed there is much international dispute about this agreement. Australia is not the only place where the agreement has been knocked back. Indeed, it comes from countries numerous in number, and many countries whose approaches you would expect Australia to take note of. Accordingly, the committee has recom­mended that in any future agreement or any future consideration of the agreement Australia should also have regard to the ratification status of the ACTA agreement, particularly in the EU and also in the United States. I do note that a range of European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Holland have taken positions of suspending consideration of ACTA, or indeed are doing similar things and seeking further information.


In closing, as I indicated this is a significant report of the treaties committee. I think it shows that the treaties committee is keen to ensure that its work in this parliament is work that enhances Australia's treaty-making process and that ensures appropriate scrutiny is applied to treaties that Australia enters into. I hope that the recommendations provided will be taken seriously. I hope that the recommendations will also be acted upon swiftly, because I do think that at its heart the intentions of ACTA are important and I would hope that the government, working if need be with others who have developed this treaty, can bring something back to the treaties committee to recommend ratification in the not-too-distant future once the various recommendations have been acted upon and taken into consideration. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:41):  I would just like to add a few comments to those of the deputy chair of the committee on behalf of the Australian Greens.


I suppose I will lead off with where Senator Birmingham left off. I suspect that his view is that his glass is half full on the eventual ratification of ACTA; I can assure the chamber that mine is half empty. I do not believe that this is a document that should come into force, and I am extremely pleased that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has done something quite unusual; it is unusual that the committee would have produced such a strongly worded document with so many conditions attached to the treaty being ratified by the Australian government. This is one instance where in the interests of a unanimous report—and this is a committee that is very collegial and that does try to bring all views to a consensus—I eventually elected simply to work with the recommendations that we had, and I am very pleased with them.


It is an agreement that attempts to create a global standard for intellectual property rights. It kicked off in 2007 with a discussion draft that was distributed in complete secrecy to lobbyists in the IP industry. In May 2008 that document was leaked through the wikileaks website, and the general public got its first look at it. So it is an agreement that was born effectively in secrecy and has remained there until not that long ago. It is called the anticounterfeiting agreement, but you might be surprised to know that it has got nothing whatsoever to do with currency fraud. It is in fact a proposal for an extremely strict global intellectual property rights enforcement regime.


The Australian government has signed this agreement and, almost alone in the world, still believes that it should be ratified without delay. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties unanimously and strongly disagrees with this view. The committee took evidence from some of Australia's best minds on copyright counterfeiting and patient law and has today presented a unanimous report that distils many of the compelling reasons why I believe ACTA should not come into force.


DFAT, on the other hand—the department; the negotiators who spoke to the committee and who were quite generous with their time and came back for a second helping after the committee was unsatisfied with their first presentation—are optimistic that ACTA will come into force some day. In fact, the two occasions the department gave evidence to the committee were characterised by a kind of surreal, gritted teeth sort of optimism. The committee has thoroughly examined the text, the arguments and the positions taken by other governments, and we see the writing on the wall. I quote:


… there appears a very real possibility that ACTA will not be ratified by sufficient countries in order to come into existence.


Australia risks being out there, effectively completely alone in its support for this flawed instrument. Our recommendations revolve around a strong set of preconditions that would need to be met in order for the committee to consider or reconsider whether or not the agreement should be passed. I draw the chamber's attention specifically to recommendation 8: 'That the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement not be ratified by Australia until'—and there are three serious preconditions there. Firstly, the treaties committee has requested and would propose to then consider an 'independent and transparent assessment of the economic and social benefits and costs of the Agreement referred to in Recommendation 2'. That is the first thing. Somebody needs to go back and do some homework. At no stage was the committee able to be provided with information sector by sector as to the economic and social winners and losers of signing up to an instrument such as this. The work had not been done, and on a number of occasions we were told that it probably could not be. For something such as this, it is not enough to simply proceed on some kind of blind ideological faith that all forms of trade agreement are uniformly good for all people in all countries, and that was the proposition that seemed to be advanced to JSCOT, with nothing to back it by way of formal or quantitative evidence.


The second part of recommendation 8 goes to the review into copyright that is currently being undertaken by the Australian Law Reform Commission. That is an issue that is quite central to the way that this instrument would operate if it did come into force. We believe that the committee, before it opens up the question of whether ACTA actually should be ratified again, should have in its possession that important piece of work by the ALRC. Thirdly, we propose that the Australian government issue notices of clarification in relation to the terms of agreement as recommended in other parts of the report. So we have put together quite a comprehensive list of things that the government and its trade negotiators, if they are insisting on proceeding with this instrument, should come back and clarify and provide. They should just be upfront and let the Australian public know—in this instance through the committee—what exactly it is and who exactly it is who will be benefiting from this treaty should it pass.


We heard a great deal of evidence about the fact that no reforms to Australian laws would need to be made in order for this agreement to come in force, and therefore it is appropriate for us to wave it through. Setting aside the arguments that were put by several witnesses that actually this is about imposing quite an onerous and flawed IP regime of other countries that would be effectively setting the standard, what the committee found is that in fact we would need to move several amendments to acts through the Australian parliament because of severe problems that would be thrown up if this agreement came into force. For example, the parliament would need to legislate to formally exclude patents from the appli­cation of civil enforcement and border measures components of the act or agreement. This is, I think, something that we just were not able to get through to those who represented the government in the committee hearings. Secondly, the parliament would need to legislate to ensure that products produced in Australia as a result of the invalidation of a patent or part of a patent in Australia are not subject to the counterfeiting prohibition in ACTA. This is a treaty so breathtaking in its vagueness and ambiguity that the people that we took evidence from simply were not able to settle the question as to whether ACTA would apply or influence patent law at all. The negotiators believe it does not, but it is nowhere in the document. Thirdly, the parliament would need to legislate to ensure that the expression 'counterfeit' in ACTA—which is a curious choice of words, as I am sure you agree—is not applied to generic medicines entered or eligible for entry on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. We had the generic medicine producers give quite compelling evidence to us that in fact this agreement trespasses all over the kind of work that they do to bring inexpensive medicines into Australia.


Senator Birmingham was quite right when he noted the experience of other countries overseas in their interpretations of ACTA, where it is quite severely on the way out. It is one of the reasons that we believe Australia should not ratify this agreement at all, because at the present time, if we did so, we would find ourselves the only country in the world that did so. Some governments, on the other hand, do appear to be listening to their populations. Europe and the United States have seen large and persistent demon­strations. In Germany there were demon­strations in 40 towns in June, and 100,000 people came out across Europe in February, 25,000 or so of them in Munich. People are organising around the world to block this treaty. The European Parliament's chief investigator into ACTA recommended against it coming into force because the intended benefits do not outweigh the potential threats to civil liberties, and there were resignations: the first rapporteur, Kader Arif, resigned in protest when the EU signed ACTA. This is an agreement that is seen as being extremely problematic around the world.


We have not in the committee gone very much into detail and did not directly address the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, which many are aware is coming down the pipeline directly behind ACTA, but I think this is the first domino being pushed over into the TPPA, and I think it heralds some very significant flaws there as well. There is a great deal wrong with this treaty, and I urge members of the public to read the JSCOT report. It is very interesting reading, largely thanks to the work of the chair, the deputy chair and the cross-party MPs who came to the meetings and the hearings. I would particularly like to thank the staff of that committee, who are exceptionally diligent in the work. Lastly I thank the witnesses. There was very, very high-quality testimony provided to the committee from some of the best minds in the country. On ACTA we learned a great deal from Dr Matthew Rimmer, Dr Hazel Moir and Dr Palombi from the ANU. I would like to mention Dr Kimberlee Weatherall and Anna George from the University of Sydney, who provided us with real insights from the perspective of former diplomats at the WTO. Lastly, I acknowledge Ellen Broad from the Australian Digital Alliance, who have done a great deal of work in drawing together common-sense arguments from around the world. I thank the chamber for the opportunity to comment, and I thank the other members and the chair of the committee for putting this document together. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2012-06-27,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia) (17:31):  On behalf of the Chair of Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the 126th report on Treaty relating to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement tabled on 21 November 2011.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


In taking note of this report on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement—or ACTA, as it has become known—which was tabled in the Australian parliament on 21 November 2011, I highlight that this is a particularly noteworthy report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. It is noteworthy because it deals firstly with just one treaty, the ACTA treaty or agreement. Secondly, most significantly, it is noteworthy because it does not recommend ratification at this time but instead takes the unusual step for JSCOT in outlining a range of steps that the treaties committee believed should be taken prior to further consideration regarding potential ratification of the treaty. 


This is unusual. It is a positive step from JSCOT in taking a treaty seriously and giving it the type of consideration necessary for these serious agreements. It is also positive in that it recommends a pathway forward and provides recommendations not just for the ACTA agreement but also for Australia's treaty, made in the process, that hopefully will encourage greater scrutiny and consideration of future agreements.


ACTA is an agreement designed to strengthen intellectual property standards around the world. It focuses, in particular, on trademark and copyright enforcement and establishes a legal framework for intellectual property enforcement. These are important issues and ones which I and the coalition have strong views about. We support such objectives: the protection of the intellectual property basis for many parts of our economy and for many individuals who are the developers and holders of such intellectual property.


ACTA has received strong support from Australia's performing arts community. All members of the community strongly support the need to protect the rights of the performing arts sector. It is certainly not ACTA's intent that the committee has expressed concern about. I think I can speak on behalf of all members of the committee in saying that there is a genuine belief in wanting to see IP enforcement enhanced to the best available standard.


The committee, however, is concerned that the text of ACTA potentially has a number of flaws and the committee is not yet convinced that the agreement in its current form would definitively be in Australia's national interest. Therefore the committee, in this report, asks for further analysis and clarification. In particular, the committee has noted the existing Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into copyright and the digital economy, which is due to report in the not too distant future, and hopes that the ALRC inquiry will inform future consideration of ACTA.


The committee has expressed its concern about the lack of clarity in some places regarding the text and also about certain exclusion provisions to protect the rights of individuals and ACTA's potential to shift the balance in the interpretation of copyright, intellectual property and patent law. The committee has made nine recommendations in this report, the most important being that this treaty should not be ratified by Australia until: the treaties committee has received and considered independent and transparent assessment of ACTA's economic and social benefits and costs; the ALRC report has reported on its inquiry into copyright and the digital economy; and the Australian government has provided clarification of some of the terms used in the treaty.


I note that this is a unanimous report that entails some give and take on all sides. Some members of the committee are perhaps more hopeful that we will see a conclusion of ACTA than others. I certainly fall into the category of those who hope we will ultimately see something that provides a greater global strengthening of our copyright and IP laws, which can be done in harmony with other countries and provide greater protection for those who develop and should rightly have some ownership of their IP into the future. But I do commend the treaty secretariat as well as all of my fellow members and senators on JSCOT for the spirit in which they approached this task.


The treaties committee has also made some recommendations to provide for some particular exclusions in the event that an ACTA is eventually ratified by the government. These exclusions relate to how patents are treated in the application of civil enforcement and border measures as well as ensuring that products produced in Australia as a result of the invalidation of a patent or a part of a patent in Australia are not subject to the counterfeiting prohibition enactor. Finally, the exclusions ensure that the expression 'counterfeit enactor' is not applied to generic medicines entered or eligible for entry on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.


I note on that last point that specific evidence was heard during the JSCOT hearings, and particular submissions were made regarding the treatment of generic medicines. I think that is an important area that I hope that the information provided by the government on this agreement in the future—and I hope it will be provided—covers some more specific consideration of its impact on the sector. I do particularly thank those in the generic medicine sector who provided particular evidence to the committee on those issues.


As I indicated, the committee has also taken an eye to the future and suggested that there are some lessons to be learned in the treatment of future agreements. It has suggested and recommended that future natural interest analyses of treaties, where the treaties clearly intend to have an economic impact, should actually include some assessment of the economic benefits and costs of the treaty. If not, and no assessment has been undertaken, at the least there should be a statement explaining why it was not undertaken or was unable to be undertaken. This has been an important factor in the committee's deliberations on this, with some members of the committee particularly concerned to have clearer evidence of the economic implications of this agreement.


There has also been some serious consideration given to the international reaction to ACTA, and indeed there is much international dispute about this agreement. Australia is not the only place where the agreement has been knocked back. Indeed, it comes from countries numerous in number, and many countries whose approaches you would expect Australia to take note of. Accordingly, the committee has recom­mended that in any future agreement or any future consideration of the agreement Australia should also have regard to the ratification status of the ACTA agreement, particularly in the EU and also in the United States. I do note that a range of European countries, including Germany, Switzerland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Holland have taken positions of suspending consideration of ACTA, or indeed are doing similar things and seeking further information.


In closing, as I indicated this is a significant report of the treaties committee. I think it shows that the treaties committee is keen to ensure that its work in this parliament is work that enhances Australia's treaty-making process and that ensures appropriate scrutiny is applied to treaties that Australia enters into. I hope that the recommendations provided will be taken seriously. I hope that the recommendations will also be acted upon swiftly, because I do think that at its heart the intentions of ACTA are important and I would hope that the government, working if need be with others who have developed this treaty, can bring something back to the treaties committee to recommend ratification in the not-too-distant future once the various recommendations have been acted upon and taken into consideration. I commend the report to the Senate.

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (17:41):  I would just like to add a few comments to those of the deputy chair of the committee on behalf of the Australian Greens.


I suppose I will lead off with where Senator Birmingham left off. I suspect that his view is that his glass is half full on the eventual ratification of ACTA; I can assure the chamber that mine is half empty. I do not believe that this is a document that should come into force, and I am extremely pleased that the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has done something quite unusual; it is unusual that the committee would have produced such a strongly worded document with so many conditions attached to the treaty being ratified by the Australian government.

Primary Schools for the Twenty First Century: Government Response to the Interim Report Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee








Recommendation







Response









Recommendation 1





The committee majority recommends that all quarterly reports on maintaining state spending on primary school infrastructure be made available immediately.







Disagree





Information in the quarterly reports is provided by the States in confidence and on the understanding that it would only be made public, in respect of a particular state, if the Commonwealth decided to impose a sanction on that state for failure to meet its benchmark.









Recommendation 2





The committee majority recommends that when the next round of P21 funding is made available the remaining P21 program funds be provided directly to those government schools choosing to manage their own projects to completion.







Disagree





With over 99 per cent of all P21 projects having commenced as at 31 December 2010, providing schools with funds directly, particularly where contractual commitments are already in place, would serve little benefit.





In its August 2010 interim report, the BER Implementation Taskforce recommended that projects not yet committed should be delivered in accordance with a pre-BER 'business as usual' approach to capital works and that school stakeholders should be more involved in decision making.





The Government has agreed to implement this recommendation made by the Taskforce in its August 2010 interim report.









Recommendation 3





The committee majority recommends that the government immediately require all state and territory education authorities and Block Grant Authorities to publish breakdowns of all individual P21 project costs.







Noted





In its August 2010 interim report, the BER Implementation Taskforce recommended that in the interest of transparency and public accountability, each education authority publish school specific project cost data related to BER P21 in a nationally common structure with consistent definitions. The Government has agreed to put in place a nationally common structure with consistent definitions. This structure was published in January 2011 with the agreement of education authorities.









Recommendation 4





The committee majority recommends that DEEWR release original applications and project costs as P21 projects are completed, together with an explanation regarding any contract cost variations.







Agree in part





Consistent with the response to recommendation 3, the Government has agreed to put in place a nationally common structure with consistent definitions for reporting on project costs. This structure was published in January 2011 with the agreement of education authorities.





The Government does not agree to release original applications as they pre-date detailed tendering and procurement processes and buildings were not designed or costed in detail at that point. In addition, the original applications and project costs may have been subjected to variations for a number of valid reasons and this will not be evident in this information.









Recommendation 5





The committee majority recommends strengthening accountability mechanisms for oversight of state expenditure of Commonwealth money. This should include enhancing the powers of the Auditor-General 
to 'follow the money trail' to ensure value for money is achieved by the Commonwealth for,





state expenditure of Commonwealth monies.




 






Noted





This issue was covered in the terms of reference of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997. While that inquiry lapsed with the prorogation of the Parliament on 19 July 2010, it would be appropriate for government to respond to this issue through any recommendations arising from that Inquiry.





The Government further notes that the BER Implementation Taskforce was established by the Australian Government in April 2010 with the express purpose of assessing value for money aspects of individual projects, as well as systemic issues, and ensuring allegations of waste are fully investigated. With the ongoing work of the Taskforce, a Senate inquiry, two state parliamentary inquiries, an Australian National Audit Office audit and the various audits being undertaken within jurisdictions the BER is a heavily scrutinised program.









Recommendation 6





The committee majority recommends that the BER Implementation Taskforce be given access to all costings and be able to examine all relevant contracts to enable it to properly discharge its function to ensure the community that value for money is being achieved.







Agree





The Government established the BER Implementation Taskforce to provide an additional level of scrutiny over the





implementation of the BER program, assessment of value for money and the use of Australian Government money.





In its August 2010 interim report, the Taskforce noted that it is receiving cooperation from Education Authorities to access costings and relevant contracts.









Recommendation 7





To ensure that further taxpayer money is not subject to waste and mismanagement, the committee majority recommends that the release of any further BER funding be





delayed until the BER Implementation Taskforce reports to the Minister for





Education in August 2010.







Disagree





The BER Implementation Taskforce released its interim report on 6 August 2010. The Government has accepted and will implement in full all 14 recommendations. The report stated that the BER program Is delivering much needed infrastructure to school communities while achieving the primary goal of economic activity across the nation.""





The Government will continue to consider recommendations from the Taskforce regarding any future payments.









Recommendation 8





The committee majority recommends that the BER Implementation 
Taskforce report be made publicly available when it is presented to the Minister for Education.







Agree





The BER implementation Taskforce interim report was made publicly available when it was released on 6 August 2010. The 
Taskforce's first full report was also made publicly available when it was released on 15 December 2010.









Recommendation 8





The committee majority recommends that the BER Implementation Taskforce report be made publicly available when it is presented to the Minister for Education.







Agree





The BER implementation Taskforce interim report was made publicly available when it was released on 6 August 2010. The Taskforce's first full report was also made publicly available when it was released on 15 December 2010.









Recommendation 9





In order to fully examine the systemic failure of Commonwealth oversight mechanisms, the committee majority recommends that a judicial inquiry be established to inquire into whether the BER program has achieved value for money.







Disagree





The Government believes a judicial inquiry is a long and expensive exercise that is unnecessary for a program that has already been subject to an Australian National Audit Office investigation and federal and state parliamentary inquiries.





The Government established the BER Implementation Taskforce to provide an additional level of scrutiny over the





implementation of the BER program, assessment of value for money and the use of Australian Government money. The independent chair of this taskforce has testified that all 22 Education Authorities are fully cooperating with his inquiries and making all requested documentation available. The Taskforce comprises specialist expertise from the building and construction industry, economists, Quantity Surveyors and contract law experts.
















Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report on Investment of Commonwealth and State funds in public passenger transport infrastructure and services





Government Response



On 4 December 2008 the Senate referred the following matter to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 18 June 2009:


The investment of Commonwealth and state funds in public passenger transport infrastructure and services, with reference to the August 2005 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, Sustainable Cities, and the February 2007 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, Australia's future oil supply and alternative transport fuels, including:


a.   an audit of the state of public passenger transport in Australia;


b.   current and historical levels of public investment in private vehicle and public passenger transport services and infrastructure;


c.   an assessment of the benefits of public passenger transport, including integration with bicycle and pedestrian initiatives;


d.   measures by which the Commonwealth Government could facilitate improvement in public passenger transport services and infrastructure;


e.   the role of Commonwealth Government legislation, taxation, subsidies, policies and other mechanisms that either discourage or encourage public passenger transport; and


f.   best practice international examples of public passenger transport services and infrastructure.


The Committee's report was tabled on 20 August 2009 and made nine recommendations. The Government response is set out below. 




Recommendation 1



That the Commonwealth recognise the cost-effectiveness of the 'TravelSmart' behaviour change program and consider reinstating funding for it from an appropriate department. 




Response



Noted. 


TravelSmart was delivered in conjunction with local governments under the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program (GGAP). The Wilkins Review, Strategic Review of Australian Government Climate Change Programs of 31 July 2008, recommended that the GGAP terminate in 2008-09. The GGAP subsequently ended. 


The Commonwealth Government's view is that travel behaviour change measures, such as the TravelSmart projects, are most effectively developed and applied at a local/regional level by State, Territory and Local governments.


The Commonwealth Government recognises there may be benefit in sharing information on travel projects at a national level and will continue to explore opportunities with State and Territory governments.




Recommendation 2



The Commonwealth in future negotiation of HACC agreements should be mindful of – 


the effectiveness of present community transport services; 


future transport needs of groups targeted by community transport; 


appropriate balance between community transport, regular public transport and taxis to meet those needs; and 


appropriate division of responsibilities, actions and funding to meet those needs.




Response



Noted.


Transport services are available to frail older people and younger people with disabilities, and their carers, through the current Home and Community Care (HACC) program. Assistance is provided with transportation either directly (for example, in a vehicle provided or driven by an agency worker or volunteer) or indirectly (taxi vouchers). 


On 2 August 2011, the Commonwealth Government, in partnership with states and territories, signed the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA). The NHRA cements the commitments made by all governments at the 13 February Council of Commonwealth Governments' meeting, to work together to reform the health system to ensure its future sustainability. 


Under the NHRA the Commonwealth assumed full funding and policy responsibility for basic community care maintenance and support services for older people from 1 July 2011 and will assume operational responsibility from 1 July 2012 in all states and territories except Victoria and Western Australia.


States and territories will be responsible for funding care services for younger people ( non-Indigenous people under  65 years and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under 50  years) – such as younger people with disabilities – wherever they are receiving care.


These changes are part of broader aged care reforms which will include consideration of future arrangements for community transport under HACC to ensure the creation of a nationally consistent, integrated and coordinated aged care system. Proposals in the Productivity Commission's report, Caring for Older Australians, which was released on 8 August 2011, may also inform future reforms to HACC services.


On 18 March 2011, the Commonwealth Government launched the National Disability Strategy which outlines a 10-year national policy framework to improve the lives of people with disability, promote participation, and create a more inclusive society. The Strategy will guide public policy across governments and aims to bring about change in all mainstream services and programs as well as community infrastructure. A key policy direction under the Strategy involves the creation of 'a public, private and community transport system that is accessible for the whole community'.




Recommendation 3



The Commonwealth Government in consultation with the states/territories and other stakeholders should establish a national transport research body suitable to be a national centre for detailed research into world's best practice public transport and active transport. 




Response



Noted.


The present arrangements provide for national transport research through various means.


As a national transport research body, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) is conducting research on public transport issues as part of its research program. Two recent BITRE publications are Urban Passenger Transport: How people move about in Australian cities, and Urban Public Transport: recent bus transport statistics. 


The Commonwealth Government is collaborating with the states and territories, which have primary responsibility for public transport delivery and management. 


In late 2009, the Australian Transport Council (ATC) endorsed the Australian Strategic Transportation Agenda for Research and Technology. In addition, the Council Chair will write to the Chair of the Australian Research Council (ARC) annually seeking ARC's consideration of ATC's strategic transportation research themes when determining ARC funded research. 




Recommendation 4



Commonwealth funding for public transport should only occur in the context of overall funding for infrastructure projects that meet a strict merit-based criteria. These include an objective assessment of the broader community and economic benefits and the degree to which the sponsoring state government has adopted an integrated, inter-modal, best-practice approach to transport planning and management. The Commonwealth can only make such decisions in the context of broader judgments regarding all competing infrastructure projects that have national significance. 




Response



Noted.


The Commonwealth Government has made infrastructure investment a key national priority, and has initiated and implemented a strategic approach to national infrastructure development. 


Integral to this national strategic approach is Infrastructure Australia's work in identifying both infrastructure gaps that hinder economic growth, and investment priorities for the coordinated delivery of national infrastructure investment.  


Acknowledging the vital function of Infrastructure Australia, the Government provided an additional $36 million in the 2011-12 Budget to enhance its role in planning and advising governments and the community on infrastructure investment opportunities.


Infrastructure Australia's mandate has also been expanded to include the production of an enhanced priority list to identify projects through top-down analysis of nationally significant infrastructure needs, only considering projects that exceed $100 million, are flagship, or demonstrate unique national interest characteristics.


Part of Infrastructure Australia's development of a long term integrated approach to infrastructure investment will be to develop a national public transport strategy. This proposed strategy will be aimed at improving service standards through better use of existing infrastructure and investment in new infrastructure. 




Recommendation 5



The Government should investigate options for tax incentives for public transport including estimating their likely effects on people's travel behaviour.




Response



Noted. 


The report of the Australia's Future Tax System review (the Tax Review) made no specific recommendations in relation to tax concessions for public transport, although it did report on the taxation of transport more generally.


On 4 and 5 October 2011, the Government held a Tax Forum to continue the tax reform debate and discuss ways to build on the Government's substantial tax reform agenda. The forum focussed on the broad sweep of topics in the Tax Review, with sessions discussing personal tax, transfer payments, business tax, state taxes, environmental and social taxes, and tax system governance. 


Issues regarding transport taxes, including congestion charging, road pricing, and fuel excise were debated. Issues relating to road pricing and user charging are largely a matter for state and territory governments. 




Recommendation 6 



Government support for behavioural change programs ('TravelSmart') should include measures to encourage 'buy-in' by employers in promoting sustainable transport in their workforces. 




Response



Noted. 


Please refer to response to Recommendation 1.




Recommendation 7



The Government should amend the car fringe benefits tax (FBT) statutory formula to remove the incentive to drive excessively to reach the next FBT threshold. 




Response to Recommendations 7, 8 and 9



Agree.


In the 2011-2012 Budget the Government announced a measure to remove the unintended tax incentive for people to drive more than they need to in order to obtain a larger tax concession, by reforming the statutory formula method for valuing car fringe benefits (implements Recommendation 9(b) of the Review of Australia's Future Tax System).


When an employer makes a car available to an employee for private use, a car fringe benefit will generally arise and be subject to FBT. Car fringe benefits are currently valued under either the operating cost method or the statutory formula method.


Under the operating cost method, the taxable value of the benefit is based on the cost of owning and operating the car, reduced by the portion which relates to the business use of the vehicle. Employers are required to substantiate the business use of the vehicle by maintaining a log book for a specified period.


The statutory formula method is designed to provide employers with a low compliance cost alternative to the operating cost method, eliminating the need to maintain a vehicle log book. It removes the need to explicitly distinguish between the business and private use of a vehicle. 




Recommendation 8



In relation to FBT of cars by the statutory formula method – the Government should state the purpose of making the tax concessionary (noting that whether the tax should be concessionary, and whether there should be a statutory formula for the sake of easy compliance, are different questions); the Government should investigate and report on what the likely effects on consumer behaviour would be if the concessionary aspect of car FBT was reduced or removed. 




Response



Please refer to response to Recommendation 7. 




Recommendation 9



The Government should change FBT rules so that the scope of exemptions is consistent between car transport and public transport. 


Response




Please refer to response to Recommendation 7. 





Additional Comments – Australian Greens – Dissenting Recommendations



Senator Ludlam of the Australian Greens provided additional comments to the Senate Inquiry and proposed replacing Recommendation 4 in the committee report with three recommendations of his own.


'Recommendation 4' already incorporates the views expressed in these recommendations while allowing for a more complete consideration of potential infrastructure projects within a broader transport planning and infrastructure framework. It is noted that the Australian Greens' recommendation to reinstate the funding for the 'Travelsmart' behaviour change program has been responded to in the government response to Recommendation 1.




Australian Greens Recommendation 1



The Commonwealth make infrastructure funding available for public transport, subject to strict merit-based criteria.




Response



Noted.


As discussed in the current Recommendation 4, the Commonwealth Government has made a significant funding commitment towards the development of priority national infrastructure projects through the Nation Building Program and through the advice provided by Infrastructure Australia. The Commonwealth Government has invested unprecedented amounts into public transport projects through the Building Australia Fund and Nation Building Program. This includes more than $7 billion investment in new funding for the planning, development and construction of nine rail projects in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and the Gold Coast. 


Public transport funding will continue to be a consideration of the Commonwealth Government through the next phase of the Nation Building Program from 2014-15 to 2018-19, contingent on meeting strict merit based criteria, such as the principles in the National Urban Policy (NUP). Nationally significant infrastructure needs will continue to be identified by Infrastructure Australia in the future.




Australian Greens Recommendation 2



Proposed Commonwealth funding for public transport be subject to an objective assessment of the broad community and economic benefits and the degree to which the sponsoring state or territory government has adopted an integrated, inter-modal, best-practice approach to transport planning and management.




Response



Noted.


As discussed in the current response to Recommendation 4, the Commonwealth Government takes a strategic approach to infrastructure development and investment, with Infrastructure Australia being integral to this process. Infrastructure Australia's recently expanded role includes the development of a national public transport strategy, which will build on the NUP and the COAG Reform Council's review of capital cities strategic planning systems. Decisions on investment of future public transport projects will consider the extent to which the proposals meet these nationally agreed principles.




Australian Greens Recommendation 3



The Commonwealth recognise the cost-effectiveness of the 'Travelsmart' behaviour change program and reinstate it's funding, building on the valuable work undertaken in this programme to date.




Response



Noted.


Please refer to the Government response to Recommendation 1 in the committee's report.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (17:51):  I present the following two government responses to committee reports. In accordance with the usual practice, I seek leave to incorporate the documents in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The documents read as follows—





Primary Schools for the Twenty First Century: Government Response to the Interim Report Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee








Recommendation







Response









Recommendation 1





The committee majority recommends that all quarterly reports on maintaining state spending on primary school infrastructure be made available immediately.







Disagree





Information in the quarterly reports is provided by the States in confidence and on the understanding that it would only be made public, in respect of a particular state, if the Commonwealth decided to impose a sanction on that state for failure to meet its benchmark.









Recommendation 2





The committee majority recommends that when the next round of P21 funding is made available the remaining P21 program funds be provided directly to those government schools choosing to manage their own projects to completion.







Disagree





With over 99 per cent of all P21 projects having commenced as at 31 December 2010, providing schools with funds directly, particularly where contractual commitments are already in place, would serve little benefit.





In its August 2010 interim report, the BER Implementation Taskforce recommended that projects not yet committed should be delivered in accordance with a pre-BER 'business as usual' approach to capital works and that school stakeholders should be more involved in decision making.





The Government has agreed to implement this recommendation made by the Taskforce in its August 2010 interim report.









Recommendation 3





The committee majority recommends that the government immediately require all state and territory education authorities and Block Grant Authorities to publish breakdowns of all individual P21 project costs.







Noted





In its August 2010 interim report, the BER Implementation Taskforce recommended that in the interest of transparency and public accountability, each education authority publish school specific project cost data related to BER P21 in a nationally common structure with consistent definitions. The Government has agreed to put in place a nationally common structure with consistent definitions. This structure was published in January 2011 with the agreement of education authorities.









Recommendation 4





The committee majority recommends that DEEWR release original applications and project costs as P21 projects are completed, together with an explanation regarding any contract cost variations.







Agree in part





Consistent with the response to recommendation 3, the Government has agreed to put in place a nationally common structure with consistent definitions for reporting on project costs. This structure was published in January 2011 with the agreement of education authorities.





The Government does not agree to release original applications as they pre-date detailed tendering and procurement processes and buildings were not designed or costed in detail at that point. In addition, the original applications and project costs may have been subjected to variations for a number of valid reasons and this will not be evident in this information.









Recommendation 5





The committee majority recommends strengthening accountability mechanisms for oversight of state expenditure of Commonwealth money. This should include enhancing the powers of the Auditor-General 
to 'follow the money trail' to ensure value for money is achieved by the Commonwealth for,





state expenditure of Commonwealth monies.




 






Noted





This issue was covered in the terms of reference of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) Inquiry into the Auditor-General Act 1997. While that inquiry lapsed with the prorogation of the Parliament on 19 July 2010, it would be appropriate for government to respond to this issue through any recommendations arising from that Inquiry.





The Government further notes that the BER Implementation Taskforce was established by the Australian Government in April 2010 with the express purpose of assessing value for money aspects of individual projects, as well as systemic issues, and ensuring allegations of waste are fully investigated. With the ongoing work of the Taskforce, a Senate inquiry, two state parliamentary inquiries, an Australian National Audit Office audit and the various audits being undertaken within jurisdictions the BER is a heavily scrutinised program.









Recommendation 6





The committee majority recommends that the BER Implementation Taskforce be given access to all costings and be able to examine all relevant contracts to enable it to properly discharge its function to ensure the community that value for money is being achieved.







Agree





The Government established the BER Implementation Taskforce to provide an additional level of scrutiny over the





implementation of the BER program, assessment of value for money and the use of Australian Government money.





In its August 2010 interim report, the Taskforce noted that it is receiving cooperation from Education Authorities to access costings and relevant contracts.









Recommendation 7





To ensure that further taxpayer money is not subject to waste and mismanagement, the committee majority recommends that the release of any further BER funding be





delayed until the BER Implementation Taskforce reports to the Minister for





Education in August 2010.







Disagree





The BER Implementation Taskforce released its interim report on 6 August 2010. The Government has accepted and will implement in full all 14 recommendations. The report stated that the BER program Is delivering much needed infrastructure to school communities while achieving the primary goal of economic activity across the nation.""





The Government will continue to consider recommendations from the Taskforce regarding any future payments.









Recommendation 8





The committee majority recommends that the BER Implementation 
Taskforce report be made publicly available when it is presented to the Minister for Education.







Agree





The BER implementation Taskforce interim report was made publicly available when it was released on 6 August 2010. The 
Taskforce's first full report was also made publicly available when it was released on 15 December 2010.









Recommendation 8





The committee majority recommends that the BER Implementation Taskforce report be made publicly available when it is presented to the Minister for Education.







Agree





The BER implementation Taskforce interim report was made publicly available when it was released on 6 August 2010. The Taskforce's first full report was also made publicly available when it was released on 15 December 2010.









Recommendation 9





In order to fully examine the systemic failure of Commonwealth oversight mechanisms, the committee majority recommends that a judicial inquiry be established to inquire into whether the BER program has achieved value for money.







Disagree





The Government believes a judicial inquiry is a long and expensive exercise that is unnecessary for a program that has already been subject to an Australian National Audit Office investigation and federal and state parliamentary inquiries.





The Government established the BER Implementation Taskforce to provide an additional level of scrutiny over the





implementation of the BER program, assessment of value for money and the use of Australian Government money. The independent chair of this taskforce has testified that all 22 Education Authorities are fully cooperating with his inquiries and making all requested documentation available. The Taskforce comprises specialist expertise from the building and construction industry, economists, Quantity Surveyors and contract law experts.
















Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report on Investment of Commonwealth and State funds in public passenger transport infrastructure and services





Government Response



On 4 December 2008 the Senate referred the following matter to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by 18 June 2009:


The investment of Commonwealth and state funds in public passenger transport infrastructure and services, with reference to the August 2005 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, Sustainable Cities, and the February 2007 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, Australia's future oil supply and alternative transport fuels, including:


a.   an audit of the state of public passenger transport in Australia;


b.   current and historical levels of public investment in private vehicle and public passenger transport services and infrastructure;


c.   an assessment of the benefits of public passenger transport, including integration with bicycle and pedestrian initiatives;


d.   measures by which the Commonwealth Government could facilitate improvement in public passenger transport services and infrastructure;


e.   the role of Commonwealth Government legislation, taxation, subsidies, policies and other mechanisms that either discourage or encourage public passenger transport; and


f.   best practice international examples of public passenger transport services and infrastructure.


The Committee's report was tabled on 20 August 2009 and made nine recommendations. The Government response is set out below. 




Recommendation 1



That the Commonwealth recognise the cost-effectiveness of the 'TravelSmart' behaviour change program and consider reinstating funding for it from an appropriate department. 




Response



Noted. 


TravelSmart was delivered in conjunction with local governments under the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program (GGAP). The Wilkins Review, Strategic Review of Australian Government Climate Change Programs of 31 July 2008, recommended that the GGAP terminate in 2008-09. The GGAP subsequently ended. 


The Commonwealth Government's view is that travel behaviour change measures, such as the TravelSmart projects, are most effectively developed and applied at a local/regional level by State, Territory and Local governments.


The Commonwealth Government recognises there may be benefit in sharing information on travel projects at a national level and will continue to explore opportunities with State and Territory governments.




Recommendation 2



The Commonwealth in future negotiation of HACC agreements should be mindful of – 


the effectiveness of present community transport services; 


future transport needs of groups targeted by community transport; 


appropriate balance between community transport, regular public transport and taxis to meet those needs; and 


appropriate division of responsibilities, actions and funding to meet those needs.




Response



Noted.


Transport services are available to frail older people and younger people with disabilities, and their carers, through the current Home and Community Care (HACC) program. Assistance is provided with transportation either directly (for example, in a vehicle provided or driven by an agency worker or volunteer) or indirectly (taxi vouchers). 


On 2 August 2011, the Commonwealth Government, in partnership with states and territories, signed the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA). The NHRA cements the commitments made by all governments at the 13 February Council of Commonwealth Governments' meeting, to work together to reform the health system to ensure its future sustainability. 


Under the NHRA the Commonwealth assumed full funding and policy responsibility for basic community care maintenance and support services for older people from 1 July 2011 and will assume operational responsibility from 1 July 2012 in all states and territories except Victoria and Western Australia.


States and territories will be responsible for funding care services for younger people ( non-Indigenous people under  65 years and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under 50  years) – such as younger people with disabilities – wherever they are receiving care.


These changes are part of broader aged care reforms which will include consideration of future arrangements for community transport under HACC to ensure the creation of a nationally consistent, integrated and coordinated aged care system. Proposals in the Productivity Commission's report, Caring for Older Australians, which was released on 8 August 2011, may also inform future reforms to HACC services.


On 18 March 2011, the Commonwealth Government launched the National Disability Strategy which outlines a 10-year national policy framework to improve the lives of people with disability, promote participation, and create a more inclusive society.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (17:53):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Government is committed to reducing red tape and unnecessary regulation on industry and small business.


We recognise that Australia's 2.7 million small businesses are this nation's economic engine room, employing over 5 million Australians and making up a third of our economy. 


These businesses comprise hard working men and women who, through their time and efforts, are building a career and a better future for their families.   


This Government is doing its part to make sure business owners can get on with growing their enterprises, not spending time searching for relevant assistance or wading through unnecessary red tape.


The Prime Minister recently announced the creation of the Small Business Commissioner to provide a direct voice to Government and a one-stop shop for small business services and information. And it took this Labor Government to ensure small business is represented in Cabinet.


This Bill is another step in the process to reduce unnecessary regulation, in an orderly, efficient and consultative way. It will provide a clear process to assess, renew or allow to 'sunset' the thousands of pieces of subordinate legislation currently on the statute books.


In 2003, the Legislative Instruments Act was enacted to establish a consistent system for the registering, tabling, Parliamentary disallowance and sunsetting of Commonwealth legislative instruments.  


The sunsetting provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act provide that most legislative instruments sunset, or automatically cease, after 10 years.  This limit was introduced to ensure that legislative instruments are regularly reviewed and only remain operative if they continue to be relevant.


This 10 year limit on validity remains appropriate.


However, at the time of enactment, the Government of the time did not accurately assess the number of legislative instruments in existence, apart from those 663 already published in hard-copy in the Statutory Rules series.  


This Labor Government has prioritised extensive work to discover and register a large number of  additional instruments, consistent with our commitment to clearer laws.  These were instruments made under previous governments which were for the first time made publicly accessible by this government – so that small businesses and indeed all members of our community would have ready access to the laws to which they are subject.


Due to the large number of instruments registered in the years immediately following commencement of the LIA, sunsetting will cause the mass expiration of over 6,300 instruments from 2015, with two peaks in 2016 and 2018.


As the legislation was structured in 2003, assessing which legislative instruments remain necessary would put unnecessary strain on industry, business groups and other stakeholders, as well as Government.


The Productivity Commission in its 2011 Report 'Identifying and Evaluating Regulation Reforms' expressed concern about the mass expiry of instruments from 2015.  They identified an increased risk that instruments will be remade without adequate review and without proper consultation with business and other stakeholders.


The Commission noted that the sheer quantity of instruments required to be remade by government increases the risk that business and other stakeholders will not have sufficient time to make a meaningful contribution to any review.


Consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, the purpose of this Bill is to smooth these sunsetting peaks, and encourage high quality consultation before regulations and legislative instruments are remade.  It is also intended to ensure the information on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments is current.


The specific measures in this Bill are as follows.


Firstly, this Bill will smooth sunsetting peaks by simplifying sunsetting dates.  For instruments that were registered in bulk when the Register commenced in 2005, sunsetting dates will be spread out to reduce the number of instruments that expire at the same time and provide ample time for proper review and consultation.


The Bill also establishes a new default rule for regulations and legislative instruments.  They will now sunset on their date of registration, making sunsetting dates easier to calculate.  


Secondly, the Bill will insert a new provision into the Act to provide for thematic reviews.  The introduction of thematic reviews was recommended by the Productivity Commission.  By contributing to these reviews, key stakeholders will be able to actively participate in the regulation of their sector and contribute to consistency in regulation making.


Under this new provision, the Attorney-General can declare a common sunset date for a number of legislative instruments if satisfied that the instruments will be subject to a single review.   The new aligned sunsetting date must be within five years of the sunset date of the earliest sunsetting instrument.  The Attorney-General's declarations will be tabled in Parliament for public scrutiny and be open to disallowance by either House of Parliament.


Thematic reviews will provide industry and business with the opportunity to engage in one comprehensive review process, instead of having to provide comment on up to dozens of separate regulations, without a view of the wider regulatory framework. 


Thirdly, the Bill will allow for the efficient repeal of spent and redundant instruments on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments.  According to the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing, approximately 40% of the 40,000 titles on the Register are either spent or redundant, but to a person looking for information on the Register, these instruments appear to be in force.


To ensure the Register accurately represents the current state of the law, the Bill provides for the automatic repeal of instruments and provisions which have commenced in full and whose only effect is to amend or repeal other instruments.  This amendment will only apply to instruments and provisions that are created after the Bill commences.  


For instruments already contained in the Register, the Bill will enable the creation of a specific regulation to effect a bulk repeal of instruments which are spent or redundant.  Bulk revocation will only occur after extensive consultation. The Attorney-General will also need to be satisfied that the instruments are in fact spent or redundant.


Regulations that effect a bulk repeal will be tabled in Parliament and open to disallowance by either House of Parliament.  


Finally, the Bill clearly communicates the requirements for explanatory statements that accompany legislative instruments.  It is these statements that help businesses and individuals understand the effect of legislative instruments.  


But too often in the past these materials have been confusing or apparently contradictory, forcing business to spend time and money obtaining advice on their legal obligations. By setting out clear requirements for explanatory statements, the Government will reduce the effort necessary to understand what steps are necessary to comply with the law.


Although this Bill may be largely technical, it will support efficient and effective consultation processes applying to all delegated legislation – much of which has a direct and significant affect on individuals, business and the community.


This Government is determined to keep our economy strong, and recognises the essential contribution of hard working individuals in our small business sector in keeping us the envy of the developed world. 


This Bill is yet another example of Government working with the community to create a clear, understandable and fair framework for doing business in Australia.

 (Western Australia) (17:58):  Obviously much of what Senator Parry has just presented is sensible and will contribute to the more efficient running of the chamber, but there is one matter that I do want to draw the chamber's attention to, effectively by way of a dissent to the procedures report that has just been tabled. In March of this year one of the recommendations of the 150th report of Privileges Committee, of which I am a member, proposed to the Procedures Committee to examine the ambiguity—in my view the quite dangerous ambiguity that has opened up—in the issue of the way that matters are referred from this chamber via the President through the chamber to the Privileges Committee. Quite a dangerous situation has opened up here in that the role of the President in referring these matters or assigning precedence to these matters has become quite ambiguous. The role of the chamber in ascertaining whether these matters go to the committee has become somewhat ambiguous, and I think it is a great shame that the Procedures Committee passed up the opportunity and the direct referral from Privileges to take a look at those matters, to take its time and to ensure that we do not see a repeat of what occurred last year in November.


I do not believe necessarily that it is appropriate to simply sit back and say, 'No, the situation is fine; it's not broken; it doesn't need fixing,' after the events that occurred.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-06-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:00):  I rise to speak on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2012. This legislation has been introduced to respond to the changed political and fiscal landscape brought about by the High Court decision in the case of Williams and the Commonwealth. The Williams case was centred on a challenge to government funding of the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program, which was held to be invalid under this High Court decision. However, the decision has far broader implications than this, and I will return to a discussion about the school chaplains program in due course.


The Australian Greens believe that this High Court decision is a change for the better. We welcome the Williams decision. It sends a clear message that the executive cannot, as it has done in the past, simply spend funds without adequate parliamentary scrutiny. Increasingly, executive government in Australia has been funding a diverse set of programs according to a set of guidelines rather than enabling the funding through specific legislation. In so doing, the programs relied on the government's executive power under section 61 of the Constitution. It is the scope of this increasingly relied upon power which has been challenged in this decision.


The Australian Greens welcome the opportunity to rebalance the relationship between the executive and the parliament that this decision has provided. It is a decision which asserts the primacy and role of parliament and it is a good decision for democracy. However, we understand that the decision has caused uncertainty about hundreds of spending programs which were established under the previous regime. It is clear that good governance dictates that those programs require certainty and clarity to enable them to continue to operate effectively. Given the large number of programs identified as being potentially affected by this decision, over 400, we understand that the government urgently needed to come up with a practicable and workable solution to validate those programs. We appreciate that the mechanism provided by this bill is an appropriate option.


We do, however, have significant concerns if, in the future, the government continues to use a regulatory mechanism for new programs, as is provided for in this bill. While it is true that a regulation comes before the parliament, it cannot be debated unless it is subject to a disallowance motion. The end result of the debate is solely that the regulation may be allowed or disallowed, and there is no scope for amendment. In that case, there is limited scope for true parliamentary scrutiny, where those in this parliament would have the capacity to bring for consideration suggested amendments that could improve the program of address perceived flaws or unintended consequences. The importance of parliamentary scrutiny as a function of government accountability and responsibility was emphasised in the judgement of Justice Crennan of the High Court, who was one of the majority, who describes the many conventions and practices of parliament which contribute to this scrutiny, and I quote:


Accountability of the Executive arises not only from the requirements under the Constitution affecting the Executive mentioned above, but also from various conventions of Parliament, the established mechanisms of parliamentary debate and question time, and the requirement that members of the Executive provide information to Select Committees of both Houses of Parliament. Leaving aside appropriation legislation, Bills are conventionally introduced to Parliament, and their purposes explained, by the Minister responsible for their initiation in the House of which the Minister is a member, or by a delegate in the House of which the Minister is not a member. They are then the subject of parliamentary scrutiny and debate. The ultimate passage of a Bill into law may involve a number of compromises along the way, reflected in amendments which secure the Bill's final acceptance. Parliament's control over expenditure is effected through the legislative process.


The practical workings of a system of government which is both responsible and democratically representative are not static, and have given rise to a more general and flexible sense of ""responsible government"" to indicate a government which is responsive to public opinion and answerable to the electorate. The mechanisms and layers of accountability described above permit the ventilation, accommodation, and effective authorisation of political decisions. The notion of a government's mandate to pass laws and to spend money rests both on democratic representative government and on the relationship between Parliament and the Executive, involving, as it does, both scrutiny and responsibility. Whilst the Executive has the power to initiate new policy and to implement such policy when authorised to do so, either by Parliament or otherwise under the Constitution, Parliament has the power to scrutinise and authorise such policy (if it is not otherwise authorised by the Constitution), and the exclusive power to grant supply in respect of it and control expenditure. The principles of accountability of the Executive to Parliament and Parliament's control over supply and expenditure operate inevitably to constrain the Commonwealth's capacities to contract and to spend.


The Greens accept that it is necessary to act swiftly to respond to the uncertainty regarding existing programs this decision has brought about but that it is then prudent to provide for some breathing space to enable time for a considered review of the decision, its implications and appropriate responses. First, it is by no means certain that this bill sufficiently addresses the principles enunciated in the High Court decision and that merely regulating future spending will be sufficient to enable 'parliamentary engagement in the formulation, amendment and termination of programs for the spending of money'. There is certainly some speculation from various legal commentators that it will not prove to be sufficient. The bill in itself has not been subject to proper scrutiny. It has passed through the house in approximately three hours, and it gives the executive broad powers to spend public moneys, with the only check on program spending occurring through the regulation process. Essentially, it sets the lowest possible bar for establishing these programs using subordinate legislation.


I welcome the indication given by Senator Wong earlier on behalf of the Attorney-General that the government will work through implementation issues to establish some guidelines as to which programs may be suitable for establishment by regulation and which would require legislation. But, notwithstanding these assurances that the government does not consider the regulation-making power embodied in this legislation to be unbounded, the concerns of the Australian Greens are not allayed. Clearly there is a need for careful consideration of which programs may require legislation because of their scope, their complexity or their cost, and which may be appropriately established by regulation. There is also a need for some flexibility to enable the executive government to respond speedily—for instance, in matters of urgency such as natural disasters.


It is for that reason that the Australian Greens felt it was prudent to keep our options open in respect of any future spending program that the government seeks to regulate rather than bring to the parliament. We do know, however, that this is an important milestone in the relationship between executive government and the parliament, allowing for more scrutiny of the actions of executive government, and it would be unacceptable and regressive to relinquish it at this stage.


I will be moving amendments in the committee stage. These will enable the government to use regulations to validate the existing programs, including any which have been possibly overlooked in the urgency of this response, up until 31 December 2012, but the Greens amendments will then require legislative authority for any new programs which are to commence on or after 1 January 2013. The effect of these amendments will be to provide the flexibility and urgency needed by the government and ensure the forward funding of already established programs beyond the end of the year but then require that all future programs must be established using the highest point of parliamentary scrutiny—that is, legislation—after 1 January.


The Greens do not support the amendment proposed by the opposition. Our advice is that this sunset clause would potentially prohibit the making of ongoing contractual arrangements that would take effect beyond the end of the year. This would have an adverse effect on existing programs, potentially curtailing their ability to continue their activities and functions beyond the next six months. It could impede the government's ability to enter into further contracts under existing programs and introduce more uncertainty. Despite the assurances of Senator Brandis that this would not be a consequence, this is not the advice we have received and this is not an outcome that the Greens are willing to risk.


Essentially, the amendments proposed by the Greens will provide a six-month breathing space in which all interested parties can consider and seek advice as to the best way forward and what criteria should be applied in determining whether to regulate or legislate in the future. In doing so, we would not be locking in a situation where all such programs may be established on the basis of regulation, the lowest bar for scrutiny, and thus we would not be squandering this opportunity offered by this landmark case to maximise the parliament's ability to scrutinise the executive.


I now turn to the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program. The Australian Greens have consistently raised concerns about the chaplaincy program since its inception by the Howard government and through its significant expansion under the current government. I acknowledge the important role played by Mr Ron Williams, the plaintiff in the case, who initiated the High Court challenge as the father of six children in the public school system. He has evidenced great courage, I think, in taking on what has been described as a David-and-Goliath battle in pursuing his principles. The Australian Greens do not believe that the program is in the best interests of students in our secular public education system. The qualification requirements for the program are wholly inadequate. This court decision has offered the government an opportunity to overhaul the chaplaincy program and to ensure that the millions of dollars being spent are actually to the benefit of schools and their students.


There is no doubt that Australian young people are increasingly under pressures which affect their wellbeing and mental health. In surveys they cite many issues which concern them, including bullying, relationships, sexuality and family relationships. Appropriate assistance and support are vital. The Australian Greens maintain that it is better public policy to replace the existing program with an alternative program that seeks to assist students and is delivered by professionals with appropriate qualifications. Schools and students may need counsellors with appropriate university qualifications. Other schools with large bodies of students who do not speak English as a first language may need assistance from people with relevant language qualifications. Essentially, the Australian Greens want the funds from the program spent but spent in ways that offer better value to our nation's schools and students.


To that end, I move the second reading amendment on sheet 7250 circulated by the Australian Greens:


At the end of the motion, add:


   but the Senate considers that the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program should be replaced with a program offering genuine counselling and other assistance to students by professionals with appropriate tertiary qualifications.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2012-06-27,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (18:12):  I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2012. I will be brief. There were just a few issues that were raised in the context of debate which I should respond to. The first is Senator Brandis's complaint as to the legal advice not being provided. I place on record that the government has offered him on more than one occasion in relation to this bill a briefing by the Acting Solicitor-General, which he has not taken up.


The second is in relation to Senator Brandis's comments on the regulation-making power. I am advised that the regulation-making power in the bill remains with the Governor-General as per section 65, I think, of the financial management and accountability legislation. I think a couple of Senator Brandis's comments on this issue suggested that not even a minister but an official could make a regulation. The delegation power to which he refers relates only to the ability of an official so delegated to enter an agreement after such an agreement would be authorised by regulation.


The third point I would make is in relation to the scope of Williams, which Senator Brandis made some comment on. I think it is important not to conflate this debate with a number of other issues. The Williams decision stands for the proposition that government expenditure and programs need legislative support. This legislation before the chamber deals with that issue. It is true, as Senator Brandis referenced, that there was also discussion in that case as to whether the Commonwealth's executive power is limited by reference to the legislative heads of power. However, that matter has not been determined by the High Court and I think it is important in the discussion that the legislative response to the Williams case do not conflate those two issues—the government has not done so. 


In relation to the sunset clause, I make a number of comments. Senator Brandis asserted in his speech in response to my comment that the sunset clause would not prevent the executive entering into arrangements which extend beyond the sunset day—he quoted from NSW v Bardolph. That case does not stand for the proposition on which he is relying. In particular the passage to which he was referring—which I think was, as he says, a paragraph out of the decision of the Chief Justice in Williams—refers to the Bardolph case. The Bardolph case stands for a proposition which relates to the contracts:


... in 'the ordinary course of administering a recognised part of the government of the State'. 


The example there, I am advised, relates to departmental running costs. That is what the Bardolph case referred to. The bill before the chamber is not about spending in relation to departmental running costs. The listed programs in schedule 2 do not include such agreements and spending.


The senator also suggested that therefore the sunset provisions, which he has included as part of the coalition's position, would have no effect on the chaplain's case. That is not the view of the government on advice. The view of the government on advice is that the effect of the coalition's amendment would be to prevent the government entering into contracts to fund the chaplains program that exists beyond 31 December 2012. That would mean the government would not be in a position to enter into contracts, as is typically the case for the chaplains program, for a three-year period. I am surprised, given the opposition's support for the chaplains case, that they are in fact persisting with this amendment and, if they had the opportunity of the briefing that was offered and perhaps a little more time to have the discussion internally, I suspect they may not have. I thank the Australian Greens for taking, on that issue, the responsibility position.


Finally, in response to the second reading amendment moved by the Australian Greens, the government has made clear we are not supportive of that amendment. We have made changes, however, of which I know Senator Milne and Senator Wright are aware, which introduce a requirement for a certificate IV qualification in relation to the delivery of this program. I believe those changes were made by Minister Garrett earlier this year. 


I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (18:25):  I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7252:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (after line 15), at the end of Division 3B, add:




32F  Sunset provision



   This Division ceases to have effect on 1 January 2013.


I am not going to repeat the observations I made in my speech in the second reading debate in which I foreshadowed this amendment. Suffice to say that the effect of this amendment would be to sunset the operative provisions of the act to 31 December this year. The opposition propose this amendment for reasons that have been recited by me and indeed Senator Wright in the contribution she just made: given the significance and complexity of the High Court's decision and the very large range of programs, many hundreds of programs, which are potentially affected by it, and given my lack of confidence in the legal effectiveness of this bill to repair the constitutional gap that the High Court identified last week—a view I share with Professor Anne Twomey, Professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Sydney—it seems to me to be a prudent and appropriate course for the parliament and, in particular, for the government to have an opportunity to take more thorough advice on the effect of the High Court's decision and to consider which of the many programs set out in the proposed regulation require a specific statutory foundation. That can be done in the spring sitting of parliament. So, according to the opposition's amendment, this temporary solution would operate for some six months into the future. As I say, we have doubts about its efficacy, but for the time being it is the best the government has been able to come up with, and we do want to assist the government and indeed future governments in dealing with the problem the High Court has identified.


Can I respond quickly to Senator Wong's observation in closing the second reading debate. Senator Wong has told me that the government has advice that, if the legislation were to be sunsetted, no contract could be validly entered into which involved obligations that would take effect beyond the sunsetting period. That is not, in my view, correct advice. It is inconsistent with the decision in the Bardolph case, which I referred to before. The minister's rejoinder to me in her response—and, in fairness to Senator Wong, she is not the author of that rejoinder—is inaccurate and reflects a lack of understanding of the principle at work. I might also say, Minister Wong, that your observation that the extent to which the executive power to spend is limited by the section 51 heads of legislative power is unsettled is also wrong. In fact, that is the very issue that was resolved in the Pape case and the very issue that lay at the heart of the High Court's decision last week in the Williams case. Indeed, the proposition that you say was unsettled was in fact a proposition advanced by the Commonwealth of Australia in argument in the Williams case as being a settled proposition of constitutional law. I do not know who is advising the government in relation to this matter and I do not mean any disrespect to officers, but the advice that has been relied upon in the Senate is, to those who have read the case and studied it and studied the arguments in it, demonstrably wrong. The opposition is confident that the sunsetting of this legislation is the appropriate course and will not put at risk any Commonwealth contractual obligations which might extend beyond the sunsetting period and will not put at risk any of the programs, including the chaplaincy program, which are the subject of the bill.


To anticipate, I also say that the opposition does not support the Greens amendment. Let me explain why. The Greens amendment, as I understand it, contains two elements. The first of them is unnecessary because that is what the bill itself does, whether sunsetted or not sunsetted. The second element of the amend­ment, which requires specific legislative support for identified Commonwealth programs—that is the law already. That is the law the High Court confirmed last week in the Williams case. One does not need to write into a statute a proposition of constitutional law that the High Court has lately declared to be the case. Any future government, whether it be a Liberal-National Party government or a Labor-Greens government, will be bound by the same legal principles as the High Court announced in the Williams case. The extra words that you propose, Senator Wright—if I may say so with respect—are unnecessary, because the High Court has told us that the law is consistent with the statutory words that you propose to include. For those reasons the opposition will not support the Greens amendments. For the reasons I earlier recited, the opposition thinks that the objective that you, Senator Wright, and your colleagues in the Greens party are trying to achieve is best achieved by the sunsetting measure which is the subject of my amendment. For the reasons I have explained, any advice that to sunset this clause would put contractual obligations or payment obligations at risk is simply wrong.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:32):  As I foreshadowed in my second reading speech, the Greens do not support the amendment proposed by the opposition, because our advice is that the sunset clause would potentially prohibit the making of ongoing contractual arrangements that would take effect beyond the end of the year. This would have an adverse effect on existing programs, potentially curtailing their ability to continue their activities and functions beyond the next six months. Notwithstanding the assurances of Senator Brandis and the coalition that his legal advice is right and the legal advice provided to the Greens is wrong, I am not satisfied it is appropriate to take a risk on that. One of the reasons this legislation has been introduced into the parliament is to create certainty in a climate where there is a great deal of uncertainty about the continued funding of some of these programs. The Greens are not willing to take the risk of an outcome whereby the government's ability to enter into, under existing programs, further contracts that would go beyond the end of the year is jeopardised. For that reason the Greens will not be supporting the opposition amendment.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2012-06-27,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (18:33):  I acknowledge to the Greens that this is an element of law far beyond my capabilities, but I suspect the legal advice they are talking about is the same legal advice the government has been given. With no disrespect to the government advisors, their legal advice is not always the very best. Senator Brandis has had a very distinguished legal career and he is a Senior Counsel.


I am simply urging the Greens to take note of the good legal advice that Senator Brandis is offering for free. I suggest, with no disrespect to whoever is advising the government, that Senator Brandis's advice—and he has briefly explained the nature of it—should be followed. We all want the same thing, but the coalition are concerned that we do not get into this same problem again. There are elements of this bill which must make the Greens, as they make us, very nervous—some of the very wide powers that are being given to the government in the rushed through approach to dealing with this issue. 


I did not intend to take part in this debate, but I think the Greens are on the same track as us. For some reason, however, the government has been able to convince them by putting forward some advice. I just think that, if we do not want to be back here within the next six months, amending this bill yet again—as we do with most of the legislation this government ram through the parliament—it is better to pass the opposition amendment today and then have another look at it within the next six months. If we are all happy with it in six months—there is nothing political about this; we are trying to help the government get to the conclusion we all want. It is just a procedural thing. Our suggestion of a sunset clause would, I think, help the whole chamber, the whole government and the whole of Australia get to where we all want to go.

Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (18:37):  I draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that the government's track record in relation to this whole issue and the implications of the Pape decision by the High Court do not instil a lot of confidence in the way the government handles these matters. The government told us for months that it was very confident about the legal sustainability of its Malaysia people-swap deal and then the High Court threw it out. The Pape decision was some years ago now. Senator Wong is the minister who was at the table during the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee's estimates hearings. I asked questions of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation about the checks and balances that are in place to make sure that, when the Commonwealth goes into new areas of expenditure, there are appropriate heads of power—so that the new areas of expenditure are consistent with the Commonwealth's constitutional powers to expend taxpayers' money.


This Labor government has done nothing since the Pape decision to make sure it has its house in order. Now we have this legislation before us. We understand the need to facilitate speedy passage and we are doing that. But we have before us legislation which, quite frankly, some very eminent constitutional lawyers, including Professor Anne Twomey, have expressed serious concerns about. We are offering an opportunity here to say, 'Okay, let us have the quick fix, but let us have the opportunity to revisit this in a more considered fashion.' The sunset clause amendment moved by our colleague the shadow Attorney-General, himself a very eminent and senior lawyer in Australia—a Senior Counsel, as Senator Macdonald has observed—has provided an opportunity to resolve this.


I thought it important to place on record that the performance of the finance minister, in particular, and the finance department in dealing with these issues since the Pape decision has not given us a lot of confidence that the government is properly dealing with these matters. There are of course serious issues with this bill as well.



The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7252 be agreed to.

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:46):  by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7251 together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 26), omit ""the regulations"", substitute ""an Act, or the regulations if those regulations are made before 1 January 2013"".


(2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 28), omit ""the regulations"", substitute ""an Act, or the regulations if those regulations are made before 1 January 2013"".


(3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (lines 29 and 30), omit ""the regulations"", substitute ""an Act, or the regulations if those regulations are made before 1 January 2013"".


As I indicated in my speech on the second reading, these amendments are designed to ensure that, from 1 January 2013, any new program must be established in legislation. Initially, this will set the bar appropriately high, consistent with the principles enunciated by the High Court, and then allow time for all interested parties to consider carefully what regime should be instituted for future programs. In such a way we can work together to achieve an appropriate considered response which will have effect in the future, enshrining an appropriate degree of parliamentary scrutiny of executive spending of public money. 




The CHAIRMAN:  The question is that Australian Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7251 be agreed to.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2012-06-27,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (18:00):  I rise to speak on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2012. This legislation has been introduced to respond to the changed political and fiscal landscape brought about by the High Court decision in the case of Williams and the Commonwealth. The Williams case was centred on a challenge to government funding of the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program, which was held to be invalid under this High Court decision. However, the decision has far broader implications than this, and I will return to a discussion about the school chaplains program in due course.


The Australian Greens believe that this High Court decision is a change for the better. We welcome the Williams decision. It sends a clear message that the executive cannot, as it has done in the past, simply spend funds without adequate parliamentary scrutiny. Increasingly, executive government in Australia has been funding a diverse set of programs according to a set of guidelines rather than enabling the funding through specific legislation. In so doing, the programs relied on the government's executive power under section 61 of the Constitution. It is the scope of this increasingly relied upon power which has been challenged in this decision.


The Australian Greens welcome the opportunity to rebalance the relationship between the executive and the parliament that this decision has provided. It is a decision which asserts the primacy and role of parliament and it is a good decision for democracy. However, we understand that the decision has caused uncertainty about hundreds of spending programs which were established under the previous regime. It is clear that good governance dictates that those programs require certainty and clarity to enable them to continue to operate effectively. Given the large number of programs identified as being potentially affected by this decision, over 400, we understand that the government urgently needed to come up with a practicable and workable solution to validate those programs. We appreciate that the mechanism provided by this bill is an appropriate option.


We do, however, have significant concerns if, in the future, the government continues to use a regulatory mechanism for new programs, as is provided for in this bill. While it is true that a regulation comes before the parliament, it cannot be debated unless it is subject to a disallowance motion. The end result of the debate is solely that the regulation may be allowed or disallowed, and there is no scope for amendment. In that case, there is limited scope for true parliamentary scrutiny, where those in this parliament would have the capacity to bring for consideration suggested amendments that could improve the program of address perceived flaws or unintended consequences. The importance of parliamentary scrutiny as a function of government accountability and responsibility was emphasised in the judgement of Justice Crennan of the High Court, who was one of the majority, who describes the many conventions and practices of parliament which contribute to this scrutiny, and I quote:


Accountability of the Executive arises not only from the requirements under the Constitution affecting the Executive mentioned above, but also from various conventions of Parliament, the established mechanisms of parliamentary debate and question time, and the requirement that members of the Executive provide information to Select Committees of both Houses of Parliament. Leaving aside appropriation legislation, Bills are conventionally introduced to Parliament, and their purposes explained, by the Minister responsible for their initiation in the House of which the Minister is a member, or by a delegate in the House of which the Minister is not a member. They are then the subject of parliamentary scrutiny and debate. The ultimate passage of a Bill into law may involve a number of compromises along the way, reflected in amendments which secure the Bill's final acceptance. Parliament's control over expenditure is effected through the legislative process.


The practical workings of a system of government which is both responsible and democratically representative are not static, and have given rise to a more general and flexible sense of ""responsible government"" to indicate a government which is responsive to public opinion and answerable to the electorate. The mechanisms and layers of accountability described above permit the ventilation, accommodation, and effective authorisation of political decisions. The notion of a government's mandate to pass laws and to spend money rests both on democratic representative government and on the relationship between Parliament and the Executive, involving, as it does, both scrutiny and responsibility. Whilst the Executive has the power to initiate new policy and to implement such policy when authorised to do so, either by Parliament or otherwise under the Constitution, Parliament has the power to scrutinise and authorise such policy (if it is not otherwise authorised by the Constitution), and the exclusive power to grant supply in respect of it and control expenditure. The principles of accountability of the Executive to Parliament and Parliament's control over supply and expenditure operate inevitably to constrain the Commonwealth's capacities to contract and to spend.


The Greens accept that it is necessary to act swiftly to respond to the uncertainty regarding existing programs this decision has brought about but that it is then prudent to provide for some breathing space to enable time for a considered review of the decision, its implications and appropriate responses. First, it is by no means certain that this bill sufficiently addresses the principles enunciated in the High Court decision and that merely regulating future spending will be sufficient to enable 'parliamentary engagement in the formulation, amendment and termination of programs for the spending of money'. There is certainly some speculation from various legal commentators that it will not prove to be sufficient. The bill in itself has not been subject to proper scrutiny. It has passed through the house in approximately three hours, and it gives the executive broad powers to spend public moneys, with the only check on program spending occurring through the regulation process. Essentially, it sets the lowest possible bar for establishing these programs using subordinate legislation.


I welcome the indication given by Senator Wong earlier on behalf of the Attorney-General that the government will work through implementation issues to establish some guidelines as to which programs may be suitable for establishment by regulation and which would require legislation. But, notwithstanding these assurances that the government does not consider the regulation-making power embodied in this legislation to be unbounded, the concerns of the Australian Greens are not allayed. Clearly there is a need for careful consideration of which programs may require legislation because of their scope, their complexity or their cost, and which may be appropriately established by regulation. There is also a need for some flexibility to enable the executive government to respond speedily—for instance, in matters of urgency such as natural disasters.


It is for that reason that the Australian Greens felt it was prudent to keep our options open in respect of any future spending program that the government seeks to regulate rather than bring to the parliament. We do know, however, that this is an important milestone in the relationship between executive government and the parliament, allowing for more scrutiny of the actions of executive government, and it would be unacceptable and regressive to relinquish it at this stage.


I will be moving amendments in the committee stage. These will enable the government to use regulations to validate the existing programs, including any which have been possibly overlooked in the urgency of this response, up until 31 December 2012, but the Greens amendments will then require legislative authority for any new programs which are to commence on or after 1 January 2013. The effect of these amendments will be to provide the flexibility and urgency needed by the government and ensure the forward funding of already established programs beyond the end of the year but then require that all future programs must be established using the highest point of parliamentary scrutiny—that is, legislation—after 1 January.


The Greens do not support the amendment proposed by the opposition. Our advice is that this sunset clause would potentially prohibit the making of ongoing contractual arrangements that would take effect beyond the end of the year. This would have an adverse effect on existing programs, potentially curtailing their ability to continue their activities and functions beyond the next six months. It could impede the government's ability to enter into further contracts under existing programs and introduce more uncertainty. Despite the assurances of Senator Brandis that this would not be a consequence, this is not the advice we have received and this is not an outcome that the Greens are willing to risk.


Essentially, the amendments proposed by the Greens will provide a six-month breathing space in which all interested parties can consider and seek advice as to the best way forward and what criteria should be applied in determining whether to regulate or legislate in the future. In doing so, we would not be locking in a situation where all such programs may be established on the basis of regulation, the lowest bar for scrutiny, and thus we would not be squandering this opportunity offered by this landmark case to maximise the parliament's ability to scrutinise the executive.


I now turn to the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program. The Australian Greens have consistently raised concerns about the chaplaincy program since its inception by the Howard government and through its significant expansion under the current government. I acknowledge the important role played by Mr Ron Williams, the plaintiff in the case, who initiated the High Court challenge as the father of six children in the public school system. He has evidenced great courage, I think, in taking on what has been described as a David-and-Goliath battle in pursuing his principles. The Australian Greens do not believe that the program is in the best interests of students in our secular public education system. The qualification requirements for the program are wholly inadequate. This court decision has offered the government an opportunity to overhaul the chaplaincy program and to ensure that the millions of dollars being spent are actually to the benefit of schools and their students.


There is no doubt that Australian young people are increasingly under pressures which affect their wellbeing and mental health. In surveys they cite many issues which concern them, including bullying, relationships, sexuality and family relationships. Appropriate assistance and support are vital. The Australian Greens maintain that it is better public policy to replace the existing program with an alternative program that seeks to assist students and is delivered by professionals with appropriate qualifications. Schools and students may need counsellors with appropriate university qualifications. Other schools with large bodies of students who do not speak English as a first language may need assistance from people with relevant language qualifications. Essentially, the Australian Greens want the funds from the program spent but spent in ways that offer better value to our nation's schools and students.


To that end, I move the second reading amendment on sheet 7250 circulated by the Australian Greens:


At the end of the motion, add:


   but the Senate considers that the National School Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program should be replaced with a program offering genuine counselling and other assistance to students by professionals with appropriate tertiary qualifications.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2012-06-27,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (18:12):  I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 2012. I will be brief. There were just a few issues that were raised in the context of debate which I should respond to. The first is Senator Brandis's complaint as to the legal advice not being provided. I place on record that the government has offered him on more than one occasion in relation to this bill a briefing by the Acting Solicitor-General, which he has not taken up.


The second is in relation to Senator Brandis's comments on the regulation-making power. I am advised that the regulation-making power in the bill remains with the Governor-General as per section 65, I think, of the financial management and accountability legislation. I think a couple of Senator Brandis's comments on this issue suggested that not even a minister but an official could make a regulation. The delegation power to which he refers relates only to the ability of an official so delegated to enter an agreement after such an agreement would be authorised by regulation.


The third point I would make is in relation to the scope of Williams, which Senator Brandis made some comment on. I think it is important not to conflate this debate with a number of other issues. The Williams decision stands for the proposition that government expenditure and programs need legislative support. This legislation before the chamber deals with that issue. It is true, as Senator Brandis referenced, that there was also discussion in that case as to whether the Commonwealth's executive power is limited by reference to the legislative heads of power. However, that matter has not been determined by the High Court and I think it is important in the discussion that the legislative response to the Williams case do not conflate those two issues—the government has not done so. 


In relation to the sunset clause, I make a number of comments. Senator Brandis asserted in his speech in response to my comment that the sunset clause would not prevent the executive entering into arrangements which extend beyond the sunset day—he quoted from NSW v Bardolph. That case does not stand for the proposition on which he is relying. In particular the passage to which he was referring—which I think was, as he says, a paragraph out of the decision of the Chief Justice in Williams—refers to the Bardolph case. The Bardolph case stands for a proposition which relates to the contracts:


... in 'the ordinary course of administering a recognised part of the government of the State'. 


The example there, I am advised, relates to departmental running costs. That is what the Bardolph case referred to. The bill before the chamber is not about spending in relation to departmental running costs. The listed programs in schedule 2 do not include such agreements and spending.


The senator also suggested that therefore the sunset provisions, which he has included as part of the coalition's position, would have no effect on the chaplain's case. That is not the view of the government on advice. The view of the government on advice is that the effect of the coalition's amendment would be to prevent the government entering into contracts to fund the chaplains program that exists beyond 31 December 2012. That would mean the government would not be in a position to enter into contracts, as is typically the case for the chaplains program, for a three-year period. I am surprised, given the opposition's support for the chaplains case, that they are in fact persisting with this amendment and, if they had the opportunity of the briefing that was offered and perhaps a little more time to have the discussion internally, I suspect they may not have. I thank the Australian Greens for taking, on that issue, the responsibility position.


Finally, in response to the second reading amendment moved by the Australian Greens, the government has made clear we are not supportive of that amendment. We have made changes, however, of which I know Senator Milne and Senator Wright are aware, which introduce a requirement for a certificate IV qualification in relation to the delivery of this program. I believe those changes were made by Minister Garrett earlier this year. 


I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (19:20):  Every day Australians are being exposed to asbestos fibres—through a parent drilling into a wall to bury a hook and hang a picture, through a full refurbishment of a bathroom, when the fibro walls are ripped off the joists, or through a full demolition, when the skip may be filled with asbestos which has been hidden at the bottom to avoid extra tipping costs. Every day, everyday Australians are being exposed to asbestos fibres. A devastating statistic is that more Australians have died of asbestos related disease than were killed in World War II. These everyday Australians have died because, through no fault of their own, they have inhaled microscopic asbestos fibre fragments which can enter even the smallest air passages in the lungs, where they embed in lung tissue. The fibres are highly resistant to removal by the lungs' natural cleaning processes. Over time, embedded asbestos fibres irritate the lung tissue, causing a number of diseases. The incidence of these diseases has not yet peaked in Australia and it will continue to increase unless action is taken now. We must decrease and eventually eliminate all exposure to asbestos.


On 29 October 2010, the then Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Evans, announced the establishment of a national review into the management of asbestos. The review was tasked with assessing current activities and research in the area of asbestos management and to make recommendations for the development of a national strategic plan to improve asbestos awareness, management and removal. Senator Evans said that 'it's time that we took a long-term, strategic approach to these important issues'. Well, the work has been done by the review. It reports later this week.


Today I hosted some members of the Asbestos Management Review group: Paul Bastian, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union National Secretary; Lindsay Fraser, Assistant National Secretary, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union; Michael Borowick, Assistant Secretary, Australian Council of Trade Unions; and Tanya Segelov, Managing Partner of the Adelaide office of Turner Freeman Solicitors. Importantly, they brought with them to Canberra Serafina Selluca, an asbestos disease sufferer. Their message to members of parliament and senators from all sides of politics is to support the forthcoming recommendations from the review.


I acknowledge Serafina's courage and honesty in sharing her story with us today. It was April 2007 and at only 37 years old—having never worked with asbestos in her life, having never cleaned the clothes of a partner who worked with asbestos and having never to her knowledge been exposed to asbestos—Serafina was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Serafina said that around this time she felt well apart from a nagging cough. Her doctor thought she had active pneumonia and did some tests. The doctor was sure all would be okay. It was not.


Her doctor told her it could be cancer. But it did not appear to be cancer. After more tests and a biopsy, Serafina, aged 37, as I said, and the mother of four young children, was diagnosed with mesothelioma. She asked her doctor what that was—she was unaware. Her doctor explained that mesothelioma is a cancer of the pleura; that it typically grows quickly and spreads widely before symptoms appear, making its early diagnosis and effective treatment very difficult; that there is no cure; and that the average survival time after diagnosis is only six to 18 months. Serafina's treatment involved chemotherapy and an operation to remove one lung followed by 30 treatments of radiotherapy. All seemed well until two years ago, when Serafina had a recurrence. Another tumour had appeared. More chemotherapy was required before the tumour was able to be removed, along with some of her ribs, last year.


As I said earlier, Serafina had never worked with asbestos and to her knowledge had never been exposed to asbestos. Her only recollections were from her childhood in Sydney's suburbs. Around 1977, when she was just seven years old, her dad built a fibro garage at the family's Randwick home. With her two brothers, Serafina played around in the offcuts while her father was building the shed. It was 1977 and he was oblivious to the dangers, as were the children. When the family moved to Sutherland and lived in an old fibro house, the kids did as kids do—played around the house, in the yard and in the shed. The shed was also made of fibro, and there were bits of the wall that were broken off—lots of fun for kids to pull and poke at. Her dad relined the inside of the shed, with no idea of the dangers he was working with or exposing his precious family to. It is these situations, these innocent exposures as a child, which are probably to blame for Serafina's mesothelioma. Her two brothers and mother have both tested clear for any asbestos related disease. Serafina told of how she had received compensation from James Hardie. But, with sadness in her voice, she then went on to say that that would not change her outcome but that it gave her some comfort to know that her children will be able to be looked after and that her husband will not have to struggle as much if a time comes when she is no longer here.


Importantly, I was not the only one Serafina was able to share her story with today. This afternoon, the Prime Minister made time to hear Serafina's story. Flanked by the members of the review I mentioned earlier, this was Serafina's chance to share her struggle. And it was her chance to urge the Prime Minister to act swiftly and move to enact the review's recommendations. The findings and recommendations will be reported to government later this week. The review has built on work already being undertaken at the Commonwealth, state and territory levels. It seeks to complement the development of harmonised workplace health and safety laws, including regulations and codes of practice relating to asbestos management and removal in the workplace, as well as the Tasmanian government's response to the 2010 report, Improving asbestos management in Tasmania. And its final report will represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity for this Labor government to implement a national asbestos authority.


The National Asbestos Summit was convened in June 2010 by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, by my union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, and by the Cancer Council of Australia. It was unanimously agreed at that summit that a national asbestos authority should initially be established as an independent authority with the appropriate powers to coordinate and enforce the removal of asbestos-containing materials from our built environment: at work, at home and in public and commercial buildings.


In the discussions with the delegation today, it was argued that the authority would work best as an independent body, as a statutory authority. This would allow for the family home, the local footy club, office buildings and the local village hall to be covered under its auspices. The activities of the authority could be overseen by a board of management consisting of representation from key stakeholders: from unions, the community, asbestos disease support groups, health groups and government. Crucially, it was raised that the authority must be given powers to educate and raise awareness amongst the community; audit and plan removal from government premises; require disclosure of asbestos-containing materials in the residential sector; manage waste disposal; and make workplaces safer. That is because we know that asbestos-containing materials remain prevalent throughout Australia. Prior to its phasing out in the mid-1980s and ban in 2003, Australia was one of the highest users of asbestos in the world. The unfortunate circumstance arises when materials that are cheap to mine and manufacture are used without analysis of their environmental affects.



The incidence of mesothelioma has not yet peaked in Australia. Australia has the highest per capita incidence of mesothelioma in the world. There is no threshold of exposure to asbestos for the causation of mesothelioma. Increasingly mesothelioma is being diagnosed in persons whose only exposure was through home renovations, just like Serafina. This review is the culmination of many years of struggle by asbestos related disease sufferers, by their unions, by their supporters, by their lawyers and—crucially with a terminal disease—by their family and friends. I thank members and officials of my union, the AMWU, for their strong leadership in seeking to take Australia towards a safe asbestos-free environment. I strongly urge the Prime Minister to favourably consider the recommendations in the review, in particular the proposal for a national asbestos authority whose work will ensure that fewer—or, preferably, no—everyday Australians are exposed to asbestos fibres.
