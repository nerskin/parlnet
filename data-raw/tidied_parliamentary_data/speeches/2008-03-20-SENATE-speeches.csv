"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-03-20,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 63.
This relates to the issue of the death penalty being rampant in China. Though somewhat pulled back by recent legislation to include only ‘extremely vile criminals’ according to the President of the Supreme People’s Court, Xiao Yang, China is nevertheless the place which executes more people—and sometimes these executions can only be described as summary executions because they occur within weeks of a court hearing, in which very often the people have no representation and no freedom to argue their case as we understand it in Australia—than the rest of the world put together. Included amongst those potentially facing the death penalty are political prisoners and people who the communist dictatorship in Beijing sees as a threat to its power. Currently we know there has been insurrection in Tibet and indeed in the Uygur part of western China, where death penalties have been handed out recently against people who were alleged to have been plotting against the Olympic Games.
The current massive movement of troops into Tibet can only be seen as a crackdown on political dissent within the Tibetan people. We know from past form under President Hu Jintao, who was the governor of Tibet in the late 1980s, that the death penalty is used as a coercive threat against people who have a different political point of view to the dictatorship in Beijing. We in Australia are not only historically opposed to the death penalty but also horrified by the potential for the death penalty to be used because of people’s political activities. I know that the government has a view that no single country should be named in motions such as this, but I believe this is a time when, as a chamber of the great Australian parliament, we ought to be directly calling on China to not use the death penalty.
There is no doubt that the Prime Minister and the government of the day will say, ‘Well, we will raise the issue of the death penalty.’ I ask: where is the logic, therefore, that a chamber of this parliament should not exactly promote the same matter of human rights and welfare? Of course we should, and I make no apology for particularly asking for the Senate to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Smith, seek the abandonment of the death penalty in China. This is a very reasonable motion. It is very directly targeted. It says what it means. I do not accept the argument that we have no place in this great and powerful Senate of Australia in calling directly on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to consult with another country on a matter as serious as this.
I reiterate that China puts to death by judicial decree more people than all the other countries of the world put together—Iran included. In 2006 Amnesty International recorded 1,000 death penalties in China but estimated that the total would be closer to 8,000. Other human rights groups put it as high as 10,000. These groups include the US State Department. I am—and I am sure many Australians are—absolutely horrified at the prospect that there will be summary executions in Tibet. (Time expired)

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2008-03-20,"—Just so that the position of the coalition is clear can I say that the coalition fully sympathises with the sentiments expressed by Senator Brown. This is a very important issue, but I must say that we should look at it in a broader context. Senator Brown’s motion is about China. Australia has long held the view that the death penalty is inappropriate, has said so internationally and has worked at the level of the United Nations to try to achieve a world where the death penalty is not practised across the board. So that is our position: we approach this with an across-the-board, international approach to say that the death penalty is not something that we believe in and we urge all those countries that have the death penalty to do away with it. I might add that that includes the United States and a whole range of other countries, not just China. Particularly where Australian citizens are subject to the death penalty we take every step possible to avoid that being carried out. But our position has been not just to confine it to Australian citizens but to view it very much in the broad.
I want to make it clear that the coalition’s position is that it is against the death penalty. It fully supports any moves by Australia internationally to do away with the death penalty across the world community, but this motion as it stands deals with just China. I think to suspend standing orders and have a debate in the Senate with short notice on such an important topic is inappropriate. Perhaps it is something the Senate could revisit. I agree with Senator Brown’s comment that this is something the Senate is quite entitled to look at. We do not shy away from important issues. You do not get anything more important than this, but to suspend standing orders and go into a debate on the death penalty in China in this way is inappropriate. I say that, whilst we sympathise with the sentiments expressed by Senator Brown in relation to the motion, there are wider considerations which a proper debate would have to canvass. That would engage and involve the international community, not just China. We cannot have a debate of this sort without cherry picking one particular country and leaving out others.
Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Senator Brown I would say that we sympathise with the sentiments of your motion. We oppose the suspension of standing orders in that it would lead to a full debate on the death penalty being exercised not only by China but by other countries. I think that for such a debate to be brought on without notice would not give it the due regard it needs. I am not saying that the Senate should never debate this—in fact, quite the contrary—but I think such a debate should be carefully considered and one where all senators would have an opportunity to participate. You just could not do that today by suspending standing orders and, at short notice, asking everybody to participate in such a debate.
The opposition, the coalition, will oppose the suspension of standing orders. It does so stating very strongly that it is against the death penalty. It fully supports Australia taking measures to encourage other countries not to have the death penalty, and we have made some achievements in that regard. There have been some countries in our region which have done away with the death penalty, but to bring on the debate in this fashion on the death penalty just in China would be, I think, not to give this due regard, being such an important issue.",SENATE,<title>CHINA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-03-20,"—Like so many other Australian political parties, the Australian Labor Party has a principled opposition to the use of the death penalty and that is an opposition of long standing. The government has a difficulty with this proposed motion in its current form. If there were a full debate, I would be proposing that the words ‘death sentence by China’ be deleted and ‘death penalty by all nations’ inserted. I have previously long argued in this chamber about my objection to dealing with complex international relations matters by means of formal motions. I commend to the Senate my speeches of the late 1990s on this issue. The government’s view is that it is counterproductive for motions of this kind to single out one country when Australia’s opposition to the death penalty is universal. Under the previous Labor government, Australia ratified the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 2 October 1990. That protocol gives effect to article 6 of the ICCPR, which refers to the abolition of the death penalty, and gives effect to an international commitment to abolish the death penalty by ratifying states.
In keeping with the government’s policy of encouraging universal ratification of the second optional protocol, we encourage all states, including our dialogue partners, to abolish the death penalty. By continuing to discuss this issue, we register our position and encourage progress towards abolition of the death penalty. According to Amnesty International figures released in April last year, at least 3,861 people were sentenced to death and 1,597 known executions occurred in 2006. Ninety-one per cent of all executions in 2006 took place in six countries—China, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Sudan and the US. While some countries in our region have abolished the death penalty—Bhutan, Cambodia, Nepal, the Philippines and Timor-Leste—many countries still impose the penalty. In United Nations forums, Australia has consistently called for the abolition of the death penalty. Australia has raised the death penalty’s use during bilateral human rights dialogues with China, Vietnam and Laos, and has joined international protests against the application of the death penalty in specific cases. Not all of these representations are made public because doing so can diminish the effectiveness of those representations.
Since the election of the Rudd government, we have foreshadowed a number of times to the Indonesian government that we will vigorously support clemency pleas by the six Australians facing the death penalty in Bali, should they pursue that course of action. The government has also given strong support to an application for clemency by an Australian man sentenced to death in Vietnam. I want to say clearly, categorically and without question that the government is committed to working with the international community to achieve the death penalty’s universal abolition, but I do say again to the Senate that it is, in our view, counterproductive for motions of this kind to single out one country when Australia’s opposition to the death penalty is universal.",SENATE,<title>CHINA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-20,"—I would like to put the Democrat position on the record. Like all parties in this place, the Democrats have a strong, longstanding opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances. This includes support wherever possible for all campaigns that seek to abolish the death penalty around the world. That is something that is shared—or, at least, is official policy—by all parties in this chamber now, which is certainly very welcome by most people within all those parties. I understand the misgivings that Senator Faulkner outlined. As he and a number of others have said in this chamber on various occasions, there are issues and difficulties with the process of formal business and seeking a straight up-and-down vote on important issues or complex matters.
This is not a complex motion; it is a very simple motion, but with complex issues arising from it. I appreciate that. If anybody can find a solution for how to deal with that without scrapping formal business—which would be a solution worse that the problem—then I would be interested to hear it. It is one that does need examination. From the point of view of parties in opposition and parties on the crossbench, formal business provides an important way of getting issues of significance on the record and getting a position on the record, which otherwise would not be able to be done. I recommend that people read Senator Faulkner’s and others’ speeches on these matters, and put their mind to finding a solution for this particular dilemma.
But we have to deal with matters that are put before the chamber according to the standing orders as they exist, and this debate we are having now is about whether or not to suspend standing orders to allow a vote on Senator Brown’s motion, rather than a debate on the motion itself. The Democrats believe it is an important issue and, notwithstanding the concerns Senator Faulkner has about singling out a particular nation, in the totality of the context at the moment, the Democrats would support the suspending of standing orders to allow a vote to be put on the matter. By virtue of this motion, we are having a quasi-debate on it anyway, which I think is worthwhile. It is such an important issue that it would merit a matter of public importance debate, for example, in the Senate.
Can I say for the record, and in the possibility that anyone in the chamber is not aware, that there is an ongoing working group of parliamentarians looking at the issue of further advancing abolition of the death penalty. It is a cross-party working group. Its co-chairs are both in the chamber at the moment. If any of you want to get more involved in this, get involved and support their efforts.
As Senator Faulkner said, Australia has ratified the second optional protocol, the ICCPR, which gives effect to an international commitment to abolish the death penalty. As people may not know, Australia has not incorporated that in our law yet, so there is nothing to stop a state government from reinstituting the death penalty should it wish to do so—not that there is any sign that that is going to happen. We have some scope for further advancement in Australia in categorically, completely and fully and permanently removing the opportunity for the death penalty to operate in this country. I certainly support moves to do that, and I encourage everybody that is lending their support to the general principle of abolition of the death penalty through this debate to support and engage all of their various party colleagues to get their support for further advances in this area.
Wherever possible, it is important to promote the need to abolish the death penalty in all countries, particularly in our region. We should all look for opportunities to do that. As has been mentioned, China executes more people than every other country on earth combined. It merits some singling out for that reason, particularly given that the legal processes that apply in bringing down those sentences are far from ideal, particularly when you include the fact that organs from executed prisoners are routinely used for transplant. That adds an extra level of horrendousness to the process of the death penalty. There is ample work still to be done in campaigning in this way. Whilst there may be some disagreement about the best way to do it, I lend my support to all efforts to do so. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>CHINA</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Motions,8,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-03-20,"—I rise to support the suspension of standing orders so that there can be a full debate on this matter. I sit here somewhat frustrated that I hear the niceties of discussion about parliamentary process as being something that stands in the way of a full debate on this issue, because while we sit here talking about whether this is the most appropriate mechanism there are house-to-house searches in Tibet for people who have been involved in fighting for the aspirations of the Tibetan people.
The Chinese government has made it quite clear that if people give themselves up now they will be considered for some sort of lesser penalty than otherwise would apply. It is very clear that people will die—will be put to death—because they stood up in Tibet. We in this parliament are saying, ‘No, we cannot discuss this now; it has complex foreign affairs ramifications.’ I do not know how many times we have stood in this parliament and talked about the proposed free trade agreement with China, and said we should do what the European Union does—make sure any free trade agreements have human rights agreements associated with them, with a caveat saying that you can pull out of those agreements if there are abuses of human rights. But Australia does not do that because we would not want to jeopardise our trade arrangements by consideration of human rights. That is the position to this day.
We are quite happy to sell uranium to China without any consideration about human rights. We are quite happy to have a Prime Minister going for a four-day visit to China and leaving the discussion of these matters until he gets there. We have the Prime Minister of Britain ringing overnight to speak to the Chinese about engaging in a dialogue and stopping the violence, expressing concern about what is going on. We have the President of the European Union speaking out about what ought to happen in relation to the Olympic Games. We have people around the world protesting outside Chinese embassies, because the reality is we know that people are going to be put to death. That is why this is a matter for the suspension of standing orders. This is not something we can put off to another day.
It is true that a short-notice debate puts some pressure on parliamentarians to get their thoughts together on an issue. But isn’t it better to put the pressure on people to actually get their heads around this quickly than to use that as a mechanism for not having the debate, for not making a decision on an issue like this? Haven’t we got a moral responsibility to tell the Chinese government right now that the Australian parliament does not support the death penalty and does not think it appropriate that China is putting more people to death with the death penalty than any other country in the world today? Don’t we think that is appropriate? Has this parliamentary inquiry on the death sentence met over what is happening in Tibet?
I feel like there needs to be a bit of a rethink about the role of parliaments. We represent the Australian people. This is a democracy and the Australian people would expect us to stand up for human rights around the world. After all, we have agreed to those human rights obligations through the treaties that we have signed, and we should be representing that stand at every opportunity. This is the opportunity to say to the Chinese government that we do not support the use of the death penalty in China or anywhere else.
I would also dispute the notion that Australia has given an unequivocal message around the world, because clearly there were mixed messages sent to the Indonesian government in the not too distant past. We need to have a reaffirmation of our position on the death penalty worldwide, but in this particular instance, because we know that the death penalty is to be meted out to Tibetans because of their stand against China, we have an obligation to have the full debate, to have a vote on this issue and to convey that to the Chinese government as a matter of urgency. If there is one thing we should be doing, it is not only standing up for Australian citizens facing the death penalty around the world; it is standing up for anybody facing the death penalty around the world, and that is why I support the suspension of standing orders.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2008-03-20,"—I have to say that I am both a little disappointed, obviously, that these very good amendments have not been supported by the government and also a little surprised. Mr Temporary Chairman of Committees Murray, no doubt from your long time in the Senate you would be aware of the rhetoric from those on the other side about the three tenets of transparency, accountability, and effectiveness and efficiency. They are the sorts of things that we look for in a piece of legislation. Certainly when the opposition constructively considered this bill those were the three areas that we looked at: transparency, accountability, and efficiency and effectiveness.
In terms of transparency and the tabling of directions, we moved some simple amendments that dealt with technical aspects to ensure that there was some transparency about the minister’s directions to Infrastructure Australia. In terms of efficiency, our amendments were about actually allowing some independence with Infrastructure Australia—and there are some issues about transparency there that I will get to in a moment. There were accountability issues about the employment of a coordinator and how you went about those things. I am surprised because those are the essence of the rhetoric we hear from the Labor Party. That rhetoric is simply not substantiated when it comes to their actions, because those are the fundamentals behind our amendments.
Whilst we are disappointed, we think there are several aspects of this bill that remained flawed—and I have discussed a number of those flaws in this place already. I am disappointed that Infrastructure Australia will not be able to be independent, particularly with regard to being able to actually scrutinise Labor’s election promises—which is really important. We know that those election promises in the area of infrastructure are there, but what we would like to know is: are these appropriate? Is it the right infrastructure? Is it the right time? Is it actually an appropriate investment or just another cost to be foisted on the Australian people? Those are the sorts of questions that Infrastructure Australia could well have asked. It is unfortunate that that amendment has been rejected by the government. Clearly transparency is only part of their rhetoric and not part of their action.
I should not really be surprised, but it is a matter of regret, that the government have rejected an amendment that would protect them from that terrible temptation of jobs for the boys. They seem to have failed on the issue of jobs for the boys at pretty much every hurdle. The first hurdle was what to do about the car industry. It was a case of: ‘I know. Steve Bracks is a bit of a mate. We’ll toss him the job.’ Now I am not cynical, but I do speak to people in the wider Australian community and I know that they think that perhaps Labor need to be protected from some of those temptations. Our amendment was to simply provide protection from temptation.
The opposition have always said that we will not oppose the establishment of Infrastructure Australia. We are prepared to give it a go and see how it will work. We will continue to be rigorous to bring Labor to account and ensure that the establishment of Infrastructure Australia helps rather than hinders infrastructure. It is for these reasons that we will not be insisting on the amendments. Again I am very disappointed and somewhat surprised, when the rhetoric is all about transparency and accountability, that these amendments the opposition put forward, whose fundamentals go to the heart of providing transparent and accountable government, have not been supported by Labor. Labor have failed at their very first hurdle.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-03-20,"—The Democrats will not insist on the amendments of the opposition. I do not think, Senator Scullion, that you can justify those amendments on the grounds that you have just suggested. In fact what your amendments did was to remove—and I do not have my notes in front of me but I think I can recall enough of them to say this with confidence—the minister’s ability to request that Infrastructure Australia conduct an investigation and/or advise on various matters. We would be with you in insisting on this amendment were it really the case that this would improve accountability, but sadly I fear that is not the case. What would have been highly desirable would have been for you to support Senator Milne’s amendment—it was not my amendment, but it was one that we certainly strongly supported—to see climate change as being a key priority for Infrastructure Australia. But you did not do that.
I will admit that we did make a rather clumsy attempt to amend your motion to remove the worst of its effects—that is, to not allow the minister to request that Infrastructure Australia do anything. We think that, all in all, the bill is in a better shape without your amendments. It would have been much better had it accepted the other amendments which would have fixed up some of those priority issues.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-03-20,"—The Greens will not be insisting on the acceptance of the opposition amendments. I do not wish to delay the Senate unnecessarily but I do want to make a couple of points. The Greens moved for any direction that the minister made to Infrastructure Australia to be a legislative instrument so that it could have been disallowable. What the opposition did was actually weaken that and say they wanted it laid on the table of the House. Laying it on the table of the House is better than doing nothing; making it a disallowable instrument would have been a more powerful case for accountability, but the opposition were not keen to support that. Whilst I recognise that the opposition wanted the direction laid on the table in the House, they voted against the ultimate method for really looking at transparency in terms of private-public partnerships, really looking at accountability and really looking at efficiency by refusing to allow the times when Infrastructure Australia made a recommendation for a project worth more than $50 million to be referred to the Public Works Committee. The opposition failed to support that.
So, in terms of real accountability, what I was moving to do was to give the public an opportunity to really have a look at what infrastructure projects were being recommended before they were considered by the minister. That was not allowed either. Of course, as Senator Allison said, the really disastrous part of this legislation is the fact that the greenhouse gas implications of any infrastructure project will only be considered and advice will only be sought at the minister’s discretion. What this allows the government to do is to choose not to have the greenhouse gas implications considered when they want to expand the coal port infrastructure all down the eastern seaboard and not to look at the greenhouse gas ramifications when they want to support a desalination plant, a new coal fired power station or something of that kind. They will have the discretion to choose when and how they use that greenhouse gas emissions power, and that is completely unacceptable if you are serious about dealing with greenhouse.
I did hear the government say yesterday that, in saying that Infrastructure Australia will bring out a strategic plan, it is implicit that they will consider greenhouse gas emissions, but it is not, in my view, implicit at all. It will be obvious when the government announces the membership of Infrastructure Australia whether any of the people on the board have expertise in determining infrastructure in an age of climate change and oil depletion and whether they have any expertise in transport, planning and policies related to a low-carbon economy. If we get an Infrastructure Australia board that does not have at least one person on it with that kind of expertise, it will be very clear that there is no intention whatsoever to look at an infrastructure strategic plan with a view to incorporating climate change.
I would hope that the government now has a serious look at this and fixes it up when it comes to appointing the members of the board, because at this point the only mechanism for having greenhouse gas emissions considered is through the discretion of the minister. Many of the projects which the Labor Party have put forward have appalling greenhouse gas ramifications and long-term ramifications for more car use and bottlenecks in cities and no consideration of how those road projects, in particular, are going to lead to urban sprawl and even greater long-term impacts from transport emissions. I would hope the government has taken on board the real criticism, because it is on a collision course.
Infrastructure Australia was an opportunity to deliver on greenhouse gas emissions commitments. It was a mechanism through which the government could have started to seriously address long-term greenhouse gas emission reductions and it has failed to do so. On the one hand it is going to bring out the Garnaut report, it is going to develop an emissions trading system and it is going to commit to a cap—and they are good things; on the other hand, it is setting up Infrastructure Australia with a capacity to deliver a strategic plan. In that strategic plan, unless they take into account the greenhouse gas emissions, they are going to be approving projects which will make the task of reducing greenhouse gas emissions even harder.
To me, it is a serious blow to those of us around the country who are serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I think the government needs to recognise that it is on a collision course with two of its key policy platform objectives by its failure to incorporate in the legislation. However, I am pleased that, by not insisting on the opposition amendments, we have at least retained the discretion of the minister to seek that advice. Had the opposition amendments been insisted upon, we would have ended up with no capacity at all even to have them considered. At least this way there is a discretionary power, but it is not enough. I hope the government will take it on board and I hope it will also take on board the fact that we are not satisfied that cutting out parliament from an assessment of the major infrastructure projects that Infrastructure Australia may recommend is an appropriate way of going about it.
I do not believe the current parliamentary process is adequate. If it were adequate, we would not have had the rorts under the Regional Partnerships program where ridiculous projects were funded for pure electoral pork-barrelling and we would not have the Tasmanian Community Forestry Agreement partnerships rorting, which I note Labor supports in government—there is disgraceful rorting going on there. The parliamentary processes have not allowed for adequate scrutiny of those projects. Even the Auditor-General’s report has come out saying, in the case of the Tasmanian Community Forestry Agreement partnerships, that they have allowed a person to put in an application for money for machinery which is second-hand and they have allowed the person applying for the grant to say what the market value of that machinery is with no independent verification. They have then paid the money on the basis of a tax invoice only, with no proof that any machinery was actually purchased. They have paid the money and there has been no ground truthing to establish whether machinery ever changed hands. They are the current parliamentary practices and that is the level of scrutiny. I do not think that is good enough when public money is being used to purchase infrastructure of any kind. I would like to think the government would take that into account, if its agenda on transparency and accountability is genuine.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-03-20,"—I thank all speakers for their contributions. Senator Milne, I draw to your attention the fact that Sir Rod Eddington is the chair of the committee. If you look at his body of work over many years, you will see that he has made recommendations internationally in these areas. He has always examined the climate issues and I do not think you will be disappointed this time. I hope that gives you some comfort. I thank you for pointing out that being lectured by those opposite on the issues of infrastructure, building, transparency and accounting is a little rich. I mean, fair dinkum! This is the mob which thought infrastructure building when you have a ports crisis is to dredge Tumbi Creek. They used to have committees in the backrooms of all their members and senators deciding on which electoral rort, on the marginality, they would pull this week. As detailed yesterday by Senator Sherry, the discretionary expenditure which was just tossed out the door, in a naked attempt to buy votes to get re-elected, was obscene.
We have a transparent process, which will take into account the national interest and the infrastructure we need in this country. So I rise to support the motion that the committee not insist and I appreciate the positions put. The original formulation of the bill allows the creation of Infrastructure Australia as a statutory advisory council and the creation of a position of Infrastructure Coordinator.
Infrastructure Australia will perform important functions to address Australia’s infrastructure bottlenecks, which are holding back the nation from achieving its full potential. It will help guide billions of dollars of investment to priority infrastructure projects. The creation of Infrastructure Australia is a key part of the Prime Minister’s five-point plan to address both demand-side and supply-side pressures on inflation. But Infrastructure Australia is also about good social outcomes. As leaders, we must never lose sight of the fact that infrastructure has the capacity to improve the quality of life of each and every Australian. Importantly, efficient and well-planned infrastructure helps us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and tackle climate change.
Infrastructure Australia is about nation building, which requires coordinated solutions and leadership. Nation building is the stock in trade of the Labor Party. The government must get back in the business of nation building. The passage of this bill, unamended, will achieve that, and I welcome the indications from those opposite that they are not insisting on the amendments.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-03-20,"—I do not want to delay the debate much longer, Minister, but we did not have the benefit of your presence in the debate yesterday. We had a series of other very worthy senators, but it would be useful, I think, for you to put on the record something which was raised in the debate yesterday—and that is, the question of why it is that greenhouse was not in that first set of priorities for Infrastructure Australia. Can you assure the Senate that when decisions are being made about setting priorities for funding—whether it is road or rail, port facilities, housing, the building of universities and schools or any other major infrastructure—greenhouse emissions specifically, not just the implications of global warming on, for instance, coasts, sea levels and the like, will be front and centre of the work which Infrastructure Australia does in making its recommendations and giving its advice to government? Can we have your absolute, clear, unequivocal assurances that this is the case?",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-03-20,"—Could I give you something better than that. Could I give you the fact that it is in the bill. It is absolutely front and centre. You should not for a moment think that Infrastructure Australia will not be considering this as one of the key considerations in making the decisions they are going to make. It is absolutely key. It is there. It is listed.

Senator Allison interjecting—

—I will happily read it to you so, as I said, you can have something better than my word. You can have it actually in the legislation. We will have it for you in a moment.

Senator Milne interjecting—

—We acknowledge it is not in the position that you would want it, but it is clearly set out in the bill as one of the considerations. It has the same legal status, whether it is on this page—which I appreciate Hansard cannot reach—or listed here. It is clearly listed here: ‘to provide advice on infrastructure policy issues arising from climate change’. It is here—it is in the bill. It is better than my word on my feet here. We are voting to make this legislation, and it is here in black and white. It is absolutely part of our considerations. I can give you my word if you think that is better than the bill, but I promise you the bill is better than my word any day. I appreciate it may not be on the page that you want it on, but it is utterly critical to the considerations of this committee.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-03-20,"—This is what happens when you send in a whole range of people and you are not here for the whole debate. Yesterday we had Senator Carr, we had Senator McLucas, we had Senator O’Brien and we had—

Senator Allison interjecting—

—Yes, but it was somebody else.
—Senator Ludwig.
—Senator Ludwig, and now we have Senator Conroy. When you do not have one person handling the bill, this is what happens. I have put it on the record and I am putting it on again: it has nothing to do with whether it is on page 3, 4, 5 or anywhere in the bill. The point is climate change is one of the additional functions; it is not a primary function. In the next paragraph of the bill it says quite clearly that this additional function, climate change advice, can be given not even at the discretion of Infrastructure Australia but only at the request of the minister. So it is not about whether it is an additional function or a primary function in the sense of where it is in the legislation; it is the fact that Infrastructure Australia is required to give advice on the primary functions, but it performs the additional functions only at the discretion of the minister. That is my point. That means the government can pick and choose as to when it seeks advice in relation to greenhouse gas emissions and can choose not to do so.
So, Senator Conroy, I thank you for that. I do appreciate it is in the legislation. I have read the bill. We argued it for several hours yesterday. I want to put on the record again that it is that point—that it is a discretionary consideration and not a core consideration—that has been our issue, because it allows the government not to consider it. It is a function that Infrastructure Australia cannot choose to perform if it wants to. It specifically says ‘at the discretion of the minister’, and that is our point. That is why Senator Allison was just trying yet again, as we both tried to do yesterday, to get a commitment from the government that it would be a core consideration. We now have your word for it, even though it is not in the bill, so we will be coming back to you, Minister. Let me assure you: we will be coming back to you since you have given us your personal assurance.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-03-20,"—There is just one other point, Minister. We were worried about the wording too. Infrastructure Australia can advise on matters ‘arising from climate change’. That is quite different wording from ‘can advise on reducing greenhouse emissions’. We hope that the wording was not intended to reflect something other than reducing greenhouse emissions because, as you know, the task ahead for this country in doing just that is massive. You might like to consider whether the wording is appropriate and to add to it from your statements to give us that assurance.",SENATE,<title>INFRASTRUCTURE AUSTRALIA BILL 2008</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-03-20,"—I appreciate that, after 11½ years of what we have all been through, there are times when the mean, tricky and deceptive words that have been used by others may resonate with you, but the wording of this bill is in no way intended to do the things that you would be worried about if another government had been introducing this bill. We have clear, unambiguous commitments in this area. This is designed to dovetail with our climate change agenda; it is not designed to just be a few words on paper to get you to vote for it. This is about dovetailing our infrastructure and our climate change agendas.
Again I can reassure you that the wording is not designed to try to take it out of the debate; it is there because we believe it should be in the debate. Sir Rod Eddington has a track record in considering these issues, and I think you will find that this government’s track record in this area will stand up. I appreciate your comments and I appreciate your concerns. I do apologise that I was not able to have carriage of this yesterday, when we might have been able to debate it at greater length than I understand you did. I do welcome your contribution.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2008-03-20,"—I congratulate the previous speaker, Senator Webber, on that very important contribution to allow me time to gather my thoughts. I understood there was to be somebody speaking before me on these appropriation bills, but it is nice to see that priority has been given to the government representative.
The speech given by the Governor-General on 12 February 2008 at the opening of parliament was truly remarkable. It was a speech which reflected the hopes and aspirations of the millions of Australians who elected the Rudd Labor government—such an emphatic victory—on 24 November last year. At the beginning of his speech the Governor-General said:
On 24 November 2007, Australians voted to elect a new government.
As one of the world’s oldest democracies, it is easy for us to take elections for granted and to fail to appreciate how fortunate we are to live in a nation where governments change hands peacefully as a result of the free expression of the will of the people.
We have just witnessed a change of government, an event that has happened on just six occasions in the past 60 years.
Regardless of any partisan affiliation, all Australians can celebrate the success of our democracy when such changes can occur so seamlessly and with such goodwill.
Those words of the Governor-General are very apt. We are fortunate to live in one of the most peaceful and prosperous nations of the world. We can change governments at the ballot box without incurring the sorts of situations that have occurred in a number of countries around the world in recent years and have done so for many years. I am going to come back to that theme later in my speech.
On 23 November, the day before the election, despite the prosperity that this country should have been enjoying and some were enjoying as a result of the minerals resources boom, housing was the least affordable it had ever been, inflation was at a 16-year high, Australia had not signed the Kyoto protocol, the federal parliament had not apologised to the Indigenous Australians for the stolen generations and for past wrongs done to them and working families were faced with Work Choices industrial legislation—a system which stripped many employees of long-held protections and entitlements. Without wanting to labour the point, almost all of the current members of the coalition leadership team and shadow ministry were members of the government that let that build up. Even though John Howard is no longer a member of the parliament, having lost his seat, the record of the Howard government is also the record of Brendan Nelson, the current Leader of the Opposition. It is the record of Julie Bishop, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is the record of Senator Nick Minchin, who was Leader of the Government in the Senate in the previous parliament. It is the record of Malcolm Turnbull, the now shadow Treasurer and a minister in the former government. I could go on and on. These are the same people who sat in the last parliament and cheered so loudly when the Work Choices legislation was passed by parliament.
That legislation was the realisation of John Howard’s dream, and I have spoken about this before. I can recall when John Howard was shadow minister for industrial relations many years ago when the Hawke and Keating governments were in power. I have to say, he never made any pretence about it. He always believed that, if he ever got into power and got control of both houses of parliament, he was going to dismantle as far as possible the system of industrial award protection and industrial justice in this country. He also had two other objectives. One was to introduce a goods and services tax and the other was to privatise just about anything that the government owned or operated. He had many other agendas, but those three in particular were the most important. It is a fact that he pretty much achieved each of those.
Of course, his crowning glory, or so he and his supporters and fellow ministers such as Brendan Nelson, Julie Bishop, Malcolm Turnbull, Joe Hockey and Tony Abbott thought, was getting the Work Choices legislation through the parliament. They all thought that was their greatest achievement. How wrong they were. One of the great tragedies of the previous government’s time in office is not only that that legislation proceeded to hurt ordinary working Australians and their families but that the government at the time never understood what was happening or they were prepared to ignore what was happening. They blindly went on running advertising campaigns costing hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars trying to convince the Australian public and indeed themselves that somehow Work Choices was a good thing.
Whilst we have seen the commencement of the dismantling of Work Choices this week with the legislation that was passed regarding AWAs, the only virtue in this for the opposition is that they were humiliated in the last election and consequently had to support the repeal of this terrible legislation. They did not want to, of course. They did not want to accept the verdict of the people on Work Choices. They wanted to continue on and oppose this, as we know. Wiser political heads in the opposition prevailed, but in their heart of hearts I think they still wanted to see it continue.
The Governor-General’s speech outlining the agenda of the Rudd government was an affirmation of the Australian people’s faith in electing the Rudd Labor government last November. From day one, we started doing the things we had promised to do—such as repealing Work Choices and signing the Kyoto declaration. The very first act of the Rudd Labor government was to sign the Kyoto protocol. That was a single administrative act of the new Labor government that was applauded around the world.
Yet we had Mr Howard, only the second Prime Minister in the history of the country to lose his seat, over in the United States last week or the week before making speeches condemning the Rudd Labor government for implementing what it promised the Australian people at the election.
—He is a private citizen.
—Senator Brandis says that Mr Howard is a private citizen. I have a great deal of respect for Senator Brandis and the fact that he is prepared to have regard to conventions and the principles of government. From time to time, he speaks very eloquently in this parliament about how there has to be consistency. I have sat in this Senate since 1994 and since 1996 in opposition—long hard years—and I have heard time and time again comments by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Howard, about how members of parliament should not go overseas and denigrate the Australian nation.
Senator Brandis said that Mr Howard is now a private citizen. Mr Howard is the immediate former Prime Minister of this country. He lost office only a few months ago. He was in the United States as a guest because of the fact that he had been Prime Minister of this country. He made speeches about his own record in government. I think it is completely wrong for a former Prime Minister of this country to go overseas within the first one or two months—and he has not done this in Australia—speak to a foreign audience and dump on the new Australian government. If he had any sense of patriotism, if he had any sense of respect for the people’s decision of last year, he would have kept his mouth shut. But, no, he sneaked off to his far right wing friends in America and, after a nice dinner and a few ports, no doubt—maybe even a cigar—he decided to trash the Australian government that had been in office for just over 100 days. How much respect does he really have for this country if that is his approach?
The fact of the matter is that Mr Howard and many in the opposition still cannot accept that they actually lost. I have enough memory of political history to know that I have never seen a situation where a former Prime Minister has gone overseas within the first month or two and trashed the new Australian government. You could at least wait a little while.
—He just criticised them. What’s wrong with that?
—Oh, criticised! Anyway, let’s get back to the fine speech of the Governor-General. One of the important reforms that the new government is of course undertaking is in the area of electoral reform. I note that the minister responsible, Senator Faulkner, is in the chamber.
—I’m here to listen to your speech.
—Thank you, Senator Faulkner. I know you will listen with great interest to what I am about to say. I sat on both the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiries which looked at the changes made by the Howard government on electoral laws—some of the most disgraceful changes ever implemented, disenfranchising hundreds of thousands of Australian voters, because they closed the rolls the day the election was called. Previously, of course, people could have up to a week to regularise their enrolment. The previous government—
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman, could you draw these people to attention to listen to these fine words that I am now speaking? They should listen.
 (Senator Chapman)—Order! Opposition senators should understand that interjections are disorderly.
—At least I want to hear what I have to say. The previous government of course scandalously increased the limits from $1,500 to $10,000 before you had to disclose the identity of political donations. I believe it is a great achievement that the Rudd Labor government is already moving to correct those scandalous changes and I congratulate Minister Faulkner for doing that. I think it goes back to what the Governor-General said at the start about this great democracy that we have, where we can have elections where governments can change by the will of the people. I appreciate that it does not happen that often at the federal level, but they do change and it can be done peacefully. I think it is because of the strength of our electoral system, and creating opportunities for these massive political donations to be given to political parties of whichever persuasion undermines that system.
I note that, at the same time that we had our election last November, there were elections held shortly after in a range of other countries around the world and questions were asked about the efficacy of them. We saw the tragedy of what happened in Pakistan where Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in the lead-up to the election campaign. Questions have been raised about the recent elections in Georgia and in Russia. We need to ensure that our electoral laws are appropriate and not undermined in any way, and I believe that the legislation of the previous government which disenfranchised so many people undermined the integrity of the electoral system.
One of the other important aspects of the new Labor government’s program that we are moving to implement is in the area of trade and multilateral negotiations. The previous government had a policy of withdrawing from multilateral negotiations. They paid lip-service, really, to the Doha Round. They preferred the approach of seeking to negotiate free trade agreements with individual countries at the expense of trying to participate fully in the multilateral system. That was clear, of course, with respect to climate change, where we did not really even have a seat at the table until the new Rudd Labor government signed the Kyoto protocol. The previous government did not really think it was an important issue.
It is the same with trade. I think one of the standout features of the new Rudd Labor government will be that it will lift the profile of the Australian government and the Australian nation around the world. Once again, we will be in there forcefully arguing to reinvigorate the Doha Round and endeavour to get an outcome, something that was one of the great achievements of the Hawke and Keating governments through the establishment of the Cairns Group and APEC, through the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations and so on. At the end of the day the prosperity of Australians depends, obviously, on the economic policies of the Australian government, but it also depends very much on our ability to trade, to negotiate and to punch above our weight in the international arena. I applaud the fact that the Prime Minister will shortly be visiting the United States and Europe to promote that objective.
—What about Japan?
—He will get to Japan. The Governor-General’s speech was one of the best Governor-General’s speeches that I have heard. I think it is the best one I have heard since 1996, and I compliment the Governor-General on that speech and wish him well.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2007-2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-03-20,"—Well, there we have it on the record: it is unpatriotic to criticise the Australian government, especially if you are overseas—perhaps only if you are overseas—a very interesting new test. I must make sure that, if I criticise the Australian government, I do it at home. I will be doing plenty of that in the next few years, I can assure you.
—Two and a half years.
—Two and a half years at least, yes.
—You are anticipating debate; that is disorderly!
—That is just foresight, Senator Faulkner. I have to say, though, that I was struck by the fact that, in Senator Forshaw’s speech—in which he addressed bills which are about the future and about the plans of this government for the next 2½ to three years—he spoke almost entirely about the past. What that suggests to me is how wafer-thin the vision of this government actually is—how much you need to talk about the past because what you have in store for the future is not really clear even to you at this point in time. What you as a government are laying on the table at the moment is a large succession of fairly thin platitudes and motherhood statements about where you want to go, in a very impressionistic sense, but the detail is not really much at hand at this stage.
In fact, the only detail which is at hand at this stage—to everyone’s great regret, I have to say—is the detail of the many cuts which this government is making, entirely contrary to the impression created before the election that many of the initiatives of the former Howard government would be retained and built upon. That is very different to what is actually happening in that they are, in fact, being cut. This government’s approach to a large number of important projects which had built and enriched the Australian community has been quite a horrendous one. I want to talk today particularly about one project which represents the future of this city, and that is the Griffin Legacy, the plan for the revitalisation of a large and important part of the Parliamentary Triangle.
We have heard announced by this government a succession of cuts to a number of areas, particularly a direct and violent attack on the infrastructure, and investment in the Public Service, in this city. Included in these cuts—some $643 million in savings—is a planned reversal by the government of a number of decisions made by the former government with respect to the planning of Canberra. One of those was the decision, overseen by the National Capital Authority and supported by the Australian government—and, I thought at the time, by the then Labor opposition—to establish the Griffin Legacy, which was embodied in publications like this one here by the National Capital Authority, outlining a plan to complete the vision for Canberra outlined by Walter Burley Griffin almost a century ago.
In May 2007 the former government announced that it would provide more than $70 million over four years to fund the redevelopment of Constitution Avenue and the replacement of the Russell roundabout as part of that plan. These works were several years in the planning, having grown out of the National Capital Authority’s 2004 review of the Walter Burley Griffin plan for Canberra. This review examined how much of Griffin’s original vision had already been accomplished and what was yet to be fulfilled.
Constitution Avenue was identified as a key part of the Griffin plan which remained incomplete. Over several years, the NCA worked with architectural and town planning experts to put together a design which was faithful to Griffin’s original vision but met the city’s contemporary needs. Because the former coalition government had the foresight to recognise the significance of this project, those funds were committed. But with a single stroke of the pen the new government dashed this vision and, with it, years of painstaking work. On 8 February the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Mr Tanner, announced that $46.5 million would be slashed from the project as part of the government’s round of spending cuts. Just enough money would be allocated to develop the Russell roundabout—which, no doubt, the minister would use on his way to the airport—but not a cent more. The grand plans for the development of Constitution Avenue would be shelved indefinitely and with them any sense of vision for our nation’s capital.
I would like to describe, for the benefit of those philistines in the government who make these kinds of decisions, exactly what this $46 million cut will mean to the continuing development of the national capital. Currently, Constitution Avenue is a potholed, single-lane road which runs from City Hill in Civic out to the Defence hub at the top of Russell, passing through the heritage suburbs of Campbell and Reid. In the mornings and evenings overflow traffic from Parkes Way sits bumper to bumper along its entire length, spewing fumes into the old oak trees which line it. On one side, dirt car parks overflow with commuters from Canberra’s outer suburbs, creating a dusty jumble of bikes and cars. On the other side, the fading 1960s architecture of the Canberra Institute of Technology jars against the elegant silhouette of St John’s Church at Reid, Canberra’s oldest church. As the cars inch up the hill towards Russell, their drivers are tantalised with a brief glimpse up Anzac Parade, towards the solemn architecture of the War Memorial, and down the boulevard across Lake Burley Griffin to Parliament House beyond. But upon crossing Anzac Parade they are again surrounded by car parks, empty lots, and chain link fences all the way to Defence.
Contrast this reality with the vision laid down by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin in their original plan for Canberra, which was faithfully developed by the National Capital Authority through its Griffin Legacy project. Griffin envisaged Constitution Avenue as the third arm of the parliamentary triangle, combining with Kings Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue to link the city centre with the seat of government. He drew Constitution Avenue as a grand boulevard, wide enough for vehicle and pedestrian traffic, lined with shady trees, and dotted with cafes, shops and cultural facilities. Cars would be ferried quickly away from the city by the overpass at the Russell roundabout, clearing Constitution Avenue of heavy traffic. As with the great boulevards of Europe, the avenue would become a destination—a place for people to meet, socialise, live and work.
Griffin intended Constitution Avenue to be Canberra’s vibrant city heart—the heart which visitors to Canberra, some members of this parliament amongst them, so often claim is missing. But thanks to the scorched-earth budgetary approach of this government, Griffin’s vision will not now see fulfilment. Short-term penny pinching has triumphed over strategic vision. In pointing out what a great loss this really is I would like to quote from the Australian Planning Institute, which in 1955 stated:
Griffin’s plan of 1912 won the international competition for the design of the Federal Capital City of Australia because it embodied, above all others, a central idea in civic design which would express in the finest possible way the heart of the new nation. The idea was derived from a ... deep sympathy with the national and aesthetic aspirations of the founders of the Commonwealth ... half a century of planning experience since can add nothing to its quality.
What the institute has so neatly captured in these few lines is the fact that Griffin’s plan for Canberra was about much more than just streets and roundabouts, bridges and lakes. It was about building a city which expressed through its design the best characteristics of Australian democracy—openness, egalitarianism, and freedom of communication and movement. In short, it was about building an ideal city.
Now, of course, something like that does not necessarily come cheap. But having invested as much money as this nation has in Griffin’s vision since 1927—not just in the last 10 years—surely it is worth protecting that investment. Surely we cannot just turn around one day and say: ‘Well, we’ve finished the national capital. The work’s done; the job’s done; what’s next?’ The work of building a truly great city is ongoing.
Obviously this government does not think so. Apparently clawing back financial savings is more important, no matter what the cost to our national city’s development might be. It is worth pointing out that this investment by the Commonwealth was not the only money required to make the Griffin Legacy plan come to fruition. It was designed to leverage a very large amount of private sector investment, as well, in the national capital. That is investment which now cannot take place. That augurs very badly for the financial future of this city in the next few years.
The government has also decided to compound this lack of vision by silencing the keepers of the legacy, the National Capital Authority, by cutting deeply into its budget and staff resources. There is a debate to be had about the role of the NCA, and about its relationship with the ACT’s own planning bodies. That is a debate which is going to take place in an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, in which I will enjoy participating.
But the fact remains that the government has put the cart before the horse by ripping out a significant proportion of the NCA’s funding and staff without any analysis whatsoever of the agency’s capacity to bear this. Until this parliament decides otherwise through legislation, the NCA has a statutory responsibility to protect and promote Griffin’s vision for Canberra, yet it is hamstrung in that task by the loss of significant funding and 33 of its 89 staff.
That demonstrates once again, and powerfully, that this government simply has no vision. This is a government which is too busy counting its pennies to think and plan for the future. It is a government which is needlessly ripping money out of very valuable projects, like the project on Constitution Avenue, to create the illusion of fiscal toughness.
I do not object to the passage of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008; I do object to the complete lack of vision displayed by a government which is prepared to cut funding for short-term political gain at the expense of long-term visionary planning. Our nation’s capital would not be the international marvel that it is today if it were not for successive governments having seen fit to invest in Walter Burley Griffin’s vision. I think the new government should seriously consider whether it wishes to be known as the one government—in a long succession of Australian governments of both political persuasions—which lacked the vision and the foresight to invest in a decent long-term plan for the national capital.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2007-2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-03-20,"—I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008 and seek the leave of the Senate to have other remarks concluding the second reading debate incorporated in Hansard. The usual courtesies of providing these comments have been extended to the opposition.
Leave granted.
The remarks read as follows—
I rise to bring the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2007-2008 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2007-2008 to a close, and I thank those members who have made a contribution.
The Additional Estimates Bills seek appropriation authority from Parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last Budget. The total additional appropriation being sought through Additional Estimates Bills 3 and 4 this year is $3.3 billion.
This proposed appropriation arises from:
changes in the estimates of program expenditure, due to variations in the timing of payments and forecast increases in program take-up,
the reclassifications of certain appropriations; and
policy decisions taken by the Government since the last Budget.
The Government has promised to apply sensible fiscal restraint to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates, and boost investment in the productive capacity of the Australian economy. The Additional Estimates Appropriation Bills deliver a modest first instalment on these objectives.
I want to speak first about the Government’s savings initiatives and their effect on the Additional Estimates Appropriations. The appropriations proposed in these Bills reflect the effect of part-year savings in estimates resulting from the Government’s election promise to identify savings in budget outlays. A comprehensive review has commenced and has achieved initial savings from a number of sources, some of which I outline below.
The Government has decided not to proceed with some measures announced by the previous Government; for example, we will not be proceeding with are contributions to the Rugby League Hall of Fame and the Australian Rugby Academy producing a cash saving to the Budget this year of $35 million.
The first part-year instalment on the Government’s election promise to deliver an additional two per cent efficiency dividend will be achieved this financial year, with an estimated saving in expenses against annual departmental appropriations of around $100 million in 2007-08. These savings have served partially to offset an increase in departmental appropriations in the Additional Estimates. Efficiency dividend savings are estimated to increase to around $430 million in 2008-09.
In addition, the Government is also requiring a 30 per cent reduction in Ministerial and opposition staff, yielding a net saving of $15.4 million this year.
More efficient administration will also arise this year from the transition from Australian Workplace Agreements to collective enterprise agreements and statutory individual contracts. The Workplace Authority will achieve a funding reduction of $30 million in 2007-08 as a result of the simplified administration.
The Government is also redirecting savings in annual appropriations to superior policy outcomes including, to name but a few:
Redirecting the savings from cancelling the previous Government’s Skills for the 
Future program work skill vouchers to fund our better plan for more Vocational Education and Training places as part of our Skilling Australia for the Future program. A part-year saving of $16.3 million will be achieved this year;
Abolishing the Access Card project providing a saving this year of $250.6 million; and
Abolishing Australian Industry Productivity Centres, saving $10.2 million this year and redirect the savings to a better targeted program.
A review of a number of programs has identified savings, including:
a saving of $33 million this year for the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program;
a review of the Ethanol Production Subsidy and Ethanol Distribution Programs has identified scope to reduce funding by $15.8 million while still meeting the objectives of the programs of increasing the availability of ethanol in the community;
an examination of the Child Support Reforms communication strategy has identified a saving of $4.9 million for some activities that do not need to proceed, or can be delivered more cost effectively;
a saving of $45.0 million has been identified for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority due to delays in the Authority’s establishment arising from delays in the passage of the Water Act 2007; and
a saving of $5 million in departmental funding for the Bureau of Meteorology resulting from delays in recruitment arising from delays in the passage of the Water Act 2007 and the Bureau taking on its new water information functions.
These modest savings, which are a harbinger of more substantial savings to come, have served to contain the additional appropriation sought in these Bills.
I now take the opportunity to outline the more significant measures contained in the Bills.
The Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will be provided with additional funding including:
$100 million to establish the National Secondary Schools Computer Fund, which will provide grants of up to $1 million for schools to assist them to provide for new or upgraded information and communications technology for secondary school students in years 9 to 12; and
$33.3 million for the Government’s Skilling Australia for the Future program which will provide a total of 450,000 additional training places over four years at a cost of $1.3 billion. Funding in 2007-08 will deliver 20,000 Vocational Education and Training places that are aimed at people currently outside the workforce.
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government will be provided with $2.5 million to establish Infrastructure Australia to ensure genuine rigor and accountability in infrastructure spending.
Additional funding is proposed for the Department of Health and Ageing for investing in hospitals and community health under the Better Outcomes for Hospitals and Community Health program. This includes funds for specific commitments announced during the election such as:
$10 million for the Flinders Medical Centre clinical teaching facilities upgrade; and
$15 million for the Launceston Integrated Cancer Care Centre.
The Department of Health and Ageing will also be provided with $33.1m to provide upfront capital grants and recurrent funding for the establishment of 31 GP Super Clinics around Australia, and to provide incentive payments to GPs and allied health providers to relocate to these clinics.
The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will be provided:
$57.9 million in Appropriation Bill No. 3 to provide: additional in-home support for people with disabilities being cared for by carers; additional supported employment places; and to ensure support is available to people in disability business services; and
an increase of $30 million for the Commonwealth State and Territory Disability Agreement, to allow grants to the States for people with disabilities and their carers.
These Bills are important pieces of legislation which underpin the Government’s new direction – in both spending priorities and fiscal restraint and deserve widespread support.
I am not convinced, after listening to the members of the Opposition in the Senate Estimates hearings, that they actually appreciate the importance of these Bills and this new direction.
Their questions and comments suggest that the Opposition members have not only failed to grasp the seriousness of the inflation challenge – a headline inflation running at a level not seen in 16 years – but they are also in denial about their own responsibility for delivering this risk to the Australian economy and the Australian people. And this is after 10 interest rate rises, and 20 plus warnings from the Reserve Bank about critical capacity constraints in our economy.
In government, the Coalition had no regard for the budget process, no regard for the ERC and was about as familiar with a budget savings process as it was with a fair AWA. It showed no fiscal restraint during its 11 years in government and during the election campaign this record blew out even further.
There is no clearer picture of the Coalition’s fiscal record than the former Prime Minister spending a record $9 billion in the campaign launch – just weeks after the first time the RBA was forced to raise rates during the election campaign.
There is no clearer record of the Coalition’s fiscal record than their legacy of big government, with the cost of running government almost doubling over the ten years to 2007-08. This supposed party of small government was responsible for delivering:
the most regulated and expensive industrial relations system this country has ever known;
the biggest spend on advertising;
the biggest spend on consultants even though public service employment has grown much faster than overall employment since 2000 (excluding Defence, ASI4 and AFP personnel, public service employment has grown by 25.3 per cent over that time – total employment growth has been 15.1 per cent);
an increase in the number of senior public servants by 44 per cent; and
an increase in the number of ministerial staff by 30 per cent.
Labor must now confront the serious task of re-focusing government on fiscal policy. We cannot rely on monetary policy alone to protect the Australian economy and its households from the inflation challenge.
Labor will confront the inflation legacy of the previous government by delivering a budget surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP. To meet his task spending will need to be cut by $3 to $4 billion on top of savings announced during the election campaign.
Fiscal restraint and tough decisions on spending are required to ensure that the government does all it can to combat inflation. Choices must be made to ensure that downward pressure is placed on inflation – this means that lower order priorities or priorities of the previous government will be subject to close scrutiny.
This task has already commenced in these additional estimates bills. We stand by the difficult decisions we have had to make to start delivering on our promise to rein in inflation. We do not falter in the face of questions from Opposition Senators – particularly those who were on the staff of the former Treasurer or those who were former Sports Ministers and accustomed to taking the easy options and showing no restraint – the so-called “cheque was in the mail” culture.
The Government does not oppose the Second reading amendment moved by Senator Murray on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The Government has a clear policy to enhance budget transparency. This was set out in our Operation Sunlight policy document which complements the recommendations of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee in its March 2007 report. Much work has been done on improving budget transparency and the Government expects to respond to the Senate Committee shortly. The Government is also committed to dealing, as soon as practicable, with the issue raised by the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee about the treatment of the ordinary annual services of the Government in the appropriation Bills.
I commend the Additional Estimates Bills to the Senate.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2008-03-20,"—I rise to respond to the Governor-General’s speech in the address-in-reply debate. I think it is important to recognise that for over 100 years of Australia’s industrial relations system there were awards and safety nets, and wages and conditions were collectively negotiated between employers and employees. But, unfortunately, around 1996 there happened to be some major shake-ups. I would be the first to admit that no system is ever unflawed or perfect, and there is always an opportunity to improve any system. I know that because I played an integral part from 1991 trying to improve award conditions and take-home pay for truck drivers and transport workers in Western Australia.
It is important to have a brief look at the history going back to 1996 and the election of the Howard government. The Howard government had a mandate; they clearly won the election by the will of the Australian voters. But part of their shake-up in industrial relations set the scene for a very rocky road over the following 10 years. In 1996, with the help of the Democrats in this chamber, major changes were made, and Australian workplace agreements were brought in. With the greatest of respect to the Democrats and Senator Murray—I know the contribution he made to try to improve the lot that was confronting the Senate at the time—the Australian workplace agreements had this no disadvantage test. That was introduced as part of the workplace relations reform back in 1996. With the greatest respect to the Democrats, who were trying to do the best thing, there was a government department called the Office of the Employment Advocate that was charged with making sure that when workplace agreements were negotiated there would be no disadvantage, as I said, and workers would not find themselves going backwards. Sadly, it was a disgraceful part of our history. The Office of the Employment Advocate clearly was just another annexure to the Howard Liberal government. I know this because on many occasions Australian workplace agreements came across my desk and had it not been for the ability of employees to use their union to try to negotiate a better outcome there would have been a greater number of workers disadvantaged.
At the same time, running in parallel across the other side of the country, we had the Court Liberal state government, and we had a certain minister who had an absolute—I don’t know—disregard for workers and who introduced individual workplace agreements. These individual workplace agreements were disguised in what were called the first, second and third waves of IR reform, which saw some of the most abhorrent workplace agreements that you could ever imagine, where workers lost numerous conditions. To make it worse, it really was on a take it or leave it basis.
When we talk about individual workplace agreements there is a misconception on the other side of the chamber that it is all about flexibility and what is best for both parties. Sadly, that could not be further from the truth. And we witnessed this. In fact, we witnessed it to the stage that it got so bad in Western Australia that we had some 20,000 workers filling the streets of Perth and marching up to Parliament House. I remember attending that rally. To those from Victoria, 20,000 people on the street might not seem like a lot. Twenty thousand workers on the street protesting against archaic industrial relations legislation in Sydney might not be a lot. But, coming from that great state of Western Australia, 20,000 people on the streets is a lot—they were probably on their way to a West Coast Eagles-Fremantle derby or to the Perth Cup. So there were a significant number of workers protesting. Finally, it led to the demise of the Court Liberal government. And that election was very clearly fought on industrial relations.
We saw the same thing happening here. In 2004 the Howard government took control of the Senate. There was no mandate to tip industrial relations on its head. There was absolutely no mandate in the 2004 election yet the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the minister for industrial relations said they were going to tip industrial relations on its head. There was absolutely no mandate at all. Unfortunately, Mr Howard could not help himself; he had control of the Senate and he could do what ever he liked. So in 2004 along came the Work Choices legislation.
We have had all the arguments for and all the arguments against. Every senator on this side of the chamber spoke against Work Choices. Sadly, on the other side, not all senators spoke in favour of Work Choices. Deep down in their heart of hearts there were senators opposite who knew this system was flawed. There were senators opposite who knew that Work Choices would disadvantage those in the community. Sadly, it would disadvantage those who did not have a profession and those who were not tradespeople. Women were affected by this and so were those who had English as a second language. But the worst part about the advent of Work Choices—after the 1,620 pages of explanatory memoranda and legislation—was the $121 million of taxpayers money that was spent. The amount of $121 million rolls off the tongue very easily. God help us! I know what we could do with $121 million if we put it into hospitals, dental care, child care or police stations. It cost $121 million to tell the people of Australia what a great thing Work Choices was. The rest is all history, but we will never get back that $121 million. That will not be rightfully returned to the taxpayers of Australia.
I am one of the first people to stand up and say that change is not necessarily harmful. Change can be good and we must always change and be evolutionary, whether it is in industrial relations or anything else we do. In my journeys as a Transport Workers Union official, as a truck driver, I met some fantastic employers. Make no mistake: I met some very, very genuine people. They were people who got up in the morning and worked damn hard. They put their family homes on the line to build their business. They put their family homes on the line and they lost hours with their children and their spouses. They worked seven days a week to create a business and a better future for their children. By the same token, they also gave employees an opportunity to share in that common wealth or that prosperity. As a TWU organiser, I always used to say to the employers, ‘I really want your business to be successful, because I want your employees, who chose to be members of my union, to share in that.’ Over the years we have seen an array of employers—and I say ‘employers’—who were unfairly treated through the advent of Work Choices. We knew the rule book was thrown out with Work Choices. We knew that decency and fairness could be consigned to the scrap heap if there were unscrupulous employers who would take advantage of that shocking legislation.
In my home state of WA it is no secret that the mining industry is a major driver of our economy. Those employed in the mining industry share in that productivity and that prosperity. I would be the first one to admit that those on Australian workplace agreements in the mining industry had no reason to feel that they had been shafted. They had no reason to feel that they had been disadvantaged, because they were rewarded—there is no doubt about that. At the same time, there was a host of workers who were not employed in the mining industry—workers in contract cleaning, contract security, hospitality, retail and transport, to name a few—who were, for want of a better word, shafted, because unscrupulous employers had the Work Choices legislation at their hand where they could belt those who did not have the power to negotiate collectively or those whose skills were not in great demand, as they were in mining and construction.
This will not surprise anyone: when the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations toured the country over the past few weeks, we had employer bodies, namely the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the mining and metals industry—surprise, surprise!—who claimed to be representative of all industry. When they were asked whether Work Choices had unfairly disadvantaged a host of their members, because of unscrupulous employers who chose to use it to undermine their competitors, they would not have a bar of it. They said their members supported it or that everyone was in favour of it.
It has been only three years since I first sat in the Senate. It has been three years since I sat in the boardrooms of numerous trucking companies who used to say to me that the worst thing that ever happened was when awards or collective bargaining started breaking down without the true safety nets that could protect not only their employees, their future employees and other road users but also, just as importantly, the truck drivers behind the wheels of those juggernauts. They were undermined. They could be undermined in major contracts, because unscrupulous employers would do the wrong thing. With my hand on my heart, I sincerely hope and pray that they are the minority. But they are out there.
Fortunately, with the election of a Rudd Labor government, we have the chance now of righting the wrongs. We will right the wrongs. Senators opposite who did not oppose the bill—they did not support it, but they did not oppose it; I have heard some mealy-mouthed words over the years, but that was a beauty, an absolute classic—knew in their heart of hearts that there was not the flexibility in every workplace for employers and employees to negotiate, one on one, to improve their lot.
During our inquiries around the country, BGC, a major construction company involved heavily in mining in WA, put a submission to us. We asked BGC what they thought about patent bargaining. The employers all wanted to raise the bogy of the unions who might pattern bargain, because we cannot have a level playing field, and that is fine. When we asked BGC and other employers in the Perth hearings, and employers in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, about the difference between individual and collective workplace agreements that were between the employer and the employee, they all gave the same answer. They all told us very categorically that they were not any different; they were the same agreement. The only difference between them was the expiry date. So one has to ask this question: where is the flexibility? What it really boiled down to was that these agreements were pattern agreements. BGC even confessed—and these are not the precise words of BGC, but they can be checked on the Hansard—that when they interviewed their future employees it was take it or leave it. ‘That is what you will be paid. If you do not like it, find something else.’ Where the heck is flexibility? Where the heck is the individual choice? Where is the ability to improve your lot if you are presented with take it or leave it pattern agreements?
I have listened to some of the input from senators opposite. There has been some very good input from senators opposite. And, my God, there has been some rubbish. They sit there and try to have us believe that the worst thing that Australians could confront is the fear of a worker daring to call his or her union in to negotiate on their behalf when you have major employers who have flouted these laws and owned up and said on Hansard: ‘Yes, we do use these agreements. No, there is no difference; they’re all the same, and it really is take it or leave it.’ Fortunately, a lot of things came out of those hearings.
—And you are keeping them.
—Senator Fisher, you were there. Some of your performances were talked about, too. We enjoyed listening to your input.
—Memorable.
—Memorable is the word that I will use, Senator Hutchins, for fear of a glass flying across the chamber at me. Senators opposite said that they would die in a ditch over these fantastic Australian workplace agreements. Senator Johnston, the last time I looked at you you looked alive and well, and you certainly were not in a ditch. Western Australian Liberal senators said that they would die in a ditch to keep these and that the employers being represented by ACCI would all die in a ditch to keep them. But what came out of the Senate estimates through the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations was—wait for this—that their figures show that probably five per cent to seven per cent of Australians are on Australian workplace agreements.
I have already said that they were very popular in mining. They are popular in construction. And they were also supposedly popular in those other industries such as contract cleaning, contract security and hospitality. If they were that damn popular, why are only five per cent to seven per cent of Australians on them? That just sends the message home—in my interpretation—that not all employers wanted them. A host of employers were quite happy having collective agreements. A host of employers were happy having union negotiated agreements. A host of employers were happy to have the award system. For those five per cent to seven per cent who used them, the arguments do not stack up.
While I am on this, there was overwhelming evidence once again from those industries that were not directly employed in mining that they grossly undervalued the workers. Some of the employers could not help disadvantage not only their employees but also their clients. I support improvement. I support moving with the times. I support taking conditions and wages and moulding them to suit not only the employee but the employer. Employers employ Australians who may choose to be a member of a union and those who do not.
I will present one reason why we need an umpire, fairness, laws and rules. In the West Australian newspaper on Friday, 14 March there was an article that talks about a very high profile builder in Western Australia. He is high profile for a number of reasons. One is that he loves to come out and fight with the CFMEU. That is between him and the CFMEU—I am sure that they will sort that out between themselves. His notoriety is highlighted here. Low and behold, he got caught exploiting foreign workers—migrant workers from the Philippines. This is a very high profile builder who happens to be a donor to the Western Australian division of the Liberal Party. There is nothing wrong with being to a donor to the Liberal Party, but here we have people saying that they will die in a ditch to keep Australian workplace agreements while a major employer gets caught red-handed exploiting foreign workers. I will quote from the West Australian:
Migrant workers claim controversial builder Gerry Hanssen, who has been fined a record $174,000—
How do reputable employers get fined $174,000? For exploiting workers. It goes on:
... lured them to Australia with false promises of free airfares, accommodation and tools.
The article goes on to say that the migrant workers:
... claimed that six months after they arrived in Perth, Mr Hanssen, who is a Liberal Party State councillor—
yes, he is a state councillor—
gave them only one day to consider a new Australian Workplace Agreement which removed the benefits, despite being aware they would sign anything for fear of deportation.
The article goes on:
Outside the court on Wednesday, Workplace Ombudsman Nick Wilson accused Mr Hanssen of threatening the workers with dismissal and deportation unless they agreed not to date their AWAs.
Further:
The workers, who did not want to be named—
and I can understand why—
said yesterday they had paid back their airfare and bought their own tools. They said they lived in constant fear of deportation, which one described as a ‘psychological war,’ and that they were too scared to decline being rostered to work 12-hour days for six or seven days each week.
It all goes back to this. I say once again that there are a host of very decent Australian employers out there. But they are being undermined by the ratbag minority who were given the chance to exploit anyone using laws that those on the other side passed. I know that some of the senators opposite could not hold their heads very high. I know that some of the senators opposite had the same fears that Labor had. (Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,19,1,speech
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2008-03-20,"—I note Senator Sterle’s speech and congratulate Labor for retaining a form of individual statutory agreement, subject to a safety net, in Australia’s workplace relations system. I rise to comment on the Governor-General’s speech in this address-in-reply debate and in particular an interesting line—a claim made by the Governor-General about the Commonwealth establishing a new framework for cooperative Commonwealth-state relations. While the Prime Minister has trumpeted cooperative federalism, so far during his time in office there has been very little evidence of it. More than 100 days of the Rudd Labor government and where are we at on a national water plan? It has stalled. In fact, tragically, I would say that it is drying up. Where are we on a national workplace relations plan? Grounded. What about a national plan for genetically modified crops? There simply isn’t one. What about a new health funding agreement across Australia? That has been labelled ‘blackmail’ by Labor’s own. What about a national deposit scheme for drinking cans? You would think a Rudd Labor government could manage that. Indeed, we have seen legislation introduced on that topic by Family First.
Cooperative federalism is nothing new. It has been high on the new Prime Minister’s agenda for a number of years. Mr Rudd gave a speech to the Don Dunstan Foundation, Queensland chapter, back in 2005. It was called ‘The case for cooperative federalism’. In that speech the now Prime Minister reiterated that Labor was the party of nationalism. He went on to wax lyrical about the history of cooperative federalism under Labor and what could happen under a future Labor government led by the Prime Minister. It is too bad, but it seems that the states and his state colleagues obviously missed that speech because they are launching into a new round of complaints, accusation and very open threats.
Cooperative federalism as a concept can of course have benefits for all Australians. Governments working together in the national interest are to be welcomed, especially when state governments have been derelict in their duty of representing their constituents. In themselves, savings coming from removing duplication of services and agreement on how to treat national issues so that no state is left behind. They are important in ensuring that Australia continues to enjoy the prosperity that we have been able to enjoy and achieve over the last decade.
After last year’s election we saw glowing newspaper headlines, such as ‘Brumby predicts ends to feuds with Canberra’ and ‘A new era of cooperative federalism says Rudd’. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma stated, ‘For the first time in 15 years we are in a period of cooperative federalism.’ Queensland Premier Anna Bligh stressed the need for a more cooperative approach to Commonwealth-state relations. Well, it is more than 100 days since then and where are we at now? Almost four months after the election we have noted there is no consensus on issues that have been labelled as urgent by the new government on issues that have been labelled their ‘first priorities’. We find the states are still fighting for their own slice of turf.
What about water? Water, of course, continues to be a critical issue for my home state of South Australia. The lack of rainfall and continuing low flows from the River Murray are continuing to cause South Australian irrigators and households major problems. Yet what progress have we seen on a cooperative national plan since 24 November last year? Well, colleagues, we have had a headline from the Adelaide Advertiser on 22 December entitled: ‘Missed Chance to Break River Murray Deadlock’. That was of course after COAG left the river off the agenda for its first meeting. Since then we have seen a meeting of Australian premiers completely ignore the issue again. What was their reasoning? Because the federal government did not attend the meeting. So progress on any Murray-Darling Basin agreement remains incremental at best, with the Victorian Premier warning that an agreement could take months, at least. This is not a very good start to cooperative federalism of unheralded proportions.
To top it all off we had the Prime Minister come to South Australia late last month and urge us all to be patient, because the Minister for Climate Change and Water had to do the hard yards of negotiation before Mr Rudd would step in and take over, as we learn he will. We seem to be lurching from one talkfest to another, but on this critical issue the Prime Minister is going to China, isn’t he? So he obviously does not see this issue as important over the next seven or so weeks, because we know that there will be no significant progress on this issue without him there to control it.
Meanwhile we see incremental steps on water. These get celebrated while the major questions and issues remain. It is as if the progress is a trickle but the government continues to ignore the major blockage up the line. There is a press release from the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Penny Wong, claiming that cooperation on the Murray-Darling is a step closer. Independent water commentator Professor Mike Young, who is a professor in water economics and management at the University of Adelaide, said on Adelaide radio, ‘Look, it’s too early to say that any progress has been made.’ So after four months a water crisis continues to hit South Australia, in particular, and the eminent independent expert in the field says it is too early to say what progress has been made.
The concept of an independent national commission to control the Murray-Darling water system has gone out the window, effectively, with the states putting forward a position that they will have a say in the selection of chairs and commissioners. This does not strike me as being very independent. Pandering to state self-interest is not progress, and it does not strike me as cooperative federalism either. Indeed, it will not solve the fundamental problem.
In South Australia we are struggling continually with the issue of a sustainable water supply. We have just come out of a record-breaking heatwave, and the South Australian resources minister refused to allow an extra one-off day of watering for household gardens to help them through the heat. So South Australia can enjoy being a barren gateway. Water security through the Murray-Darling Basin is not something that South Australians can continue waiting for Victoria to move forward on. It is not an issue that has just occurred. A deal was first put on the table over 14 months ago, so why do we continue to wait while cooperative federalism on this issue moves at glacial place?
Just as foolish to me seems to be the issue of not removing a moratorium on genetically modified crops across Australia. I was somewhat taken aback by the South Australian government’s recent announcement that our state would join Tasmania and Western Australia—sadly, Senator Johnston—in continuing to have a moratorium on genetically modified crops. Going against the South Australian experts and the advice sought by the South Australian government and with agriculture minister Rory McEwen himself appointed to independently review the relevant act, the South Australian Premier and Minister McEwen announced that the moratorium would continue. So what do we now have in this country? We have New South Wales and Victoria looking to push forward on the issue of genetically modified crops, with new research and technology which will benefit farmers and the community in lifting their moratorium; we have Queensland, which never had a moratorium in the first place; and South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania keeping a moratorium.
There are very significant questions about genetically modified technology that need to be asked and debated. These include legal questions posed by the technology and health and scientific issues, but we will not be answering them from a South Australian base in a hurry, particularly in a country where some people can grow genetically modified crops and others cannot. As one of my very wise South Australian colleagues asked about the issue recently in a speech in the South Australian Legislative Council:
Will there be roadblocks at the border—
of course we are talking about the South Australian-Victorian border—
to ensure that no farmer from the South-East gets a bag of seed from his neighbour in Victoria? Will a farmer who has half his farm on either side of an imaginary line be forced to grow our old redundant canola on half of his farm but be able to use the new technology on the Victorian side? Does this then prevent free trade between the states for grain or seed? Does it also mean that contract harvesters and carters who work across the border will no longer be able to do so? And, if they are able to, will they have to have certification?
She finally asked:
Who will carry out the inspections?
These are all issues that need to be addressed if our governments cannot get together and work out a nationwide policy on the issue. In the face of the lifting of moratoriums and the ability for the eastern states to grow and produce genetically modified crops, what value does a South Australian Premier, what magic does a South Australian Premier, think exists in a border? What is a border going to do, for example, that industry self-management and industry self-segregation cannot do? What value is there in a state border which is not already being achieved—it must be—in respect of some 21 experimental plots for genetically modified crops in the south-east of South Australia? If those experiments are able to be carried out with the blessing of the South Australian government then clearly genetically modified crops must be able to be grown with management of the issue. What value is there in a state border to then continue to have a moratorium on the growth of genetically modified crops state wide, particularly in a country where some can grow and some others cannot?
ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope said that he would have preferred a national approach to any lifting of the moratorium. Sadly, instead of that we have seen a frantic push by states to try to mark their individual territory on the issue. South Australians and South Australian farmers in particular deserve to be able to debate the important aspects of genetically modified crops. The really important issues that must be debated include the right to plant and seed rights, challenges that may be faced by those who consider themselves to be the owners of those plants and seeds, and the ability for farmers to compete into the future if we are to keep abreast of where the rest of the world is going—that is, essentially producing genetically modified crops. But as South Australians, for example, how can we engage with any credibility on that issue when we are not even allowed to grow the crops in the first place? How can South Australia continue to attract talented scientists and talented researchers to research the future of genetically modified crops, or not, if we cannot even credibly engage in the debate in the first place because, whilst others can grow them, we cannot? Where is the Rudd government leadership on this issue?
Health is a pretty prickly topic for cooperative federalism these days. It was supposed to be the major issue where the state premiers and the federal government could find common ground. Throughout 2007 Kevin Rudd proudly went on television and radio to proclaim that the election of a Labor government would lead to better health services for all Australians. But again, just as with water, incremental moves get made and they get celebrated as a major milestone.
Debate interrupted.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL’S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Governor-General's Speech,19,1,speech
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-03-20,"—The purpose of the Tradex Scheme Amendment Bill 2008 is to decouple Tradex from duty drawback, thereby removing unintended consequences to Tradex of changes made to duty drawback in September 2006. It is also designed to strengthen the regulatory procedures surrounding Tradex. Tradex is a coalition government initiative which commenced on 24 June 2000. It was introduced through the coalition government’s 1997 ‘Investing for Growth’ industry statement. Under Tradex, duty and GST are exempted upfront for imported goods intended to be re-exported or used in the manufacture of goods destined for export. Importers are the focus of Tradex. Tradex is closely related to and coupled in legislation with duty drawback, under which exporters can make a claim for reimbursement of the duty and GST on goods imported into Australia and subsequently re-exported. Exporters are the focus of duty drawback.
This bill will do two things. Firstly, it will decouple Tradex from duty drawback. Changes made to duty drawback in October 2006 specifically restrict to exporters and their assignees eligibility for a duty drawback refund. Since Tradex is aimed at importers, this prevents importers from claiming if they import the good but are not the ultimate exporters of a good or value added good—for example, if they have on-sold to a manufacturer who then exports the product. Secondly, the bill improves the administration of Tradex, most specifically in increasing the powers of the Secretary of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and in issuing and revoking or suspending Tradex orders. The bill also introduces an increased burden of proof on Tradex claimants that the nominated goods will be re-exported.
Having said that, I do believe that more can be done to improve this scheme, and I would urge the government to consider these suggestions. While I support the tightening of procedures regarding claiming for Tradex, it has been brought to my attention that there remains a possible loophole which may need to be addressed. As the scheme stands, there is nothing in place, I am informed, which would prevent an importer from importing, say, brand-name handbags and then selling those very same handbags to international tourists, who would then take those handbags—that is, export them—back out of the country. The importer could, under Tradex, claim an exemption for duty and GST. I am sure that the minister and the government would agree that, if my information is right, this is very much against the intent and spirit of Tradex. The goods have not been value-added in any way, nor have they been used in manufacturing in Australia. I urge the government to advise on my suggestions and, if they are found to be correct, I would ask Labor to consider closing this loophole. At the same time, I would also ask the government to consider streamlining the administration of the scheme from the importer’s point of view. The scheme should be as easy as possible to access, without compromising its rigour.
Currently, importers are required to get very specific licences to import under Tradex. This could be much broader—that is, it could give an importer a licence to import generally under Tradex. This would greatly reduce the required paperwork, and it would not necessarily weaken the scheme as, under the amendment bill before us today, importers will be required to prove the product will be re-exported anyway.
The issues I have raised need assessment and possible addressing at a future time. These issues have been raised with me since the coalition’s original bill was tabled. I would be surprised if Labor has not received similar feedback. Nevertheless, since this is a bill of the former coalition government, the coalition supports its passage.",SENATE,<title>TRADEX SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,,Bills,20,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2008-03-20,"—I thank the Senate for its consideration of the Tradex Scheme Amendment Bill 2008. This is an urgent matter that requires the attention of the chamber and I thank the opposition for their consideration in ensuring that this matter is treated as non-controversial. With regard to the matters that Senator Abetz has raised with me, quarters that know a great deal about these questions have suggested to me that in terms of the ‘Louis Vuitton issue’, where tourist shopping operators are able to use the scheme, the decoupling of Tradex from the drawback regulations will clarify these circumstances and the eligibility of other tourist shopping operators for Tradex refunds without impacting on that eligibility. The changes apply to existing Tradex users. They will be able to ensure that the new arrangements will have no material effect on existing operators and that the eligibility will become more certain. I am advised that the requirements of this scheme allow for the secretary to approve the concessions that are available and to ensure that requirements are met to the best interests of the users of the scheme. Again, I thank the Senate for its consideration of the bill.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-03-20,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister seems totally unaware of estimates that emissions trading could generate up to $20 billion in additional revenue for the new government. Even by the minister’s standards, the lack of detail there was very poor. But will the minister provide a guarantee that no individual consumer will be worse off under such an emissions trading regime?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,question
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2008-03-20,"—Thank you, Senator Birmingham. Emissions trading will drive the most significant economic transformation in Australia since the trade liberalisation of the 1980s. As I understand, a policy brief has been released which refers to revenue which will result from emissions trading. The whole government is interested in all contributions to the discussions about emissions trading, but it would be premature to speculate about revenue from emissions trading. This will depend on a range of inputs, including Treasury modelling, advice from the Garnaut review and detailed design decisions following the government’s green paper to be released in July. The government has committed to measures to address the impacts of carbon price on households, particularly low-income households. We have also committed to addressing competitive challenges associated with emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries and are dealing with other strongly affected industries. The government is taking a very careful approach to designing the emissions trading scheme and will be consulting stakeholders exclusively.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,answer
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2008-03-20,"—As I indicated in my primary answer, it would be premature to speculate about revenue from emissions trading. That will depend upon a range of inputs, and there will be a range of factors affecting likely revenue from any scheme. Senators would be only too well aware of the enormous cost to this society and to this economy if we do nothing about climate change. The government’s approach is to move quickly but carefully to ensure that Australia is best placed to build a society and economy able to cope with the effects of climate change. I am advised that Professor Ross Garnaut will release a discussion paper on emissions trading shortly. (Time expired)

The government takes workforce safety and security very seriously.
May I offer my personal sympathies to the woman who was subjected to this attack. According to a Queensland health report, there have been significant long-term problems with regard to maintenance and security of the medical premises, the nurse’s accommodation and phone services. Minister Roxon’s department has been in contact with the Queensland chief nurse to offer assistance and support in addressing the issue. I am advised that the Queensland government has instigated urgent action on repairs and maintenance work to improve security across all island health facilities and initiated a review into departmental procedures in support of managing critical situations involving staff working on distant islands.

Notes
1.     Recipient numbers include those receiving small rebates for renewable energy water pumping applications, rebates for stand-alone power systems and rebates for major projects.
2.     Other businesses include community organisations, not-for-profit organisations, government facilities, retail/roadhouses, tourism facilities and utilities.
3.     Aboriginal Communities include outstations where there may only be one house.  Outstations where there are 2 to 4 houses, each with a renewable stand-alone power system, are counted as 2 to 4 recipients.
4.     This table does not include RRPGP Industry Support projects.
(3)  What is the estimated level of displacement of diesel fuel due to the program.
Projects completed by the end of June 2007 are estimated to displace the consumption of approximately 21.7 million litres of diesel per year.
Notes
1.     In 2004, program eligibility was expanded to include renewable generation projects displacing any fossil fuel in remote areas, for example, petrol, LPG, natural gas, fuel oils.  The above figure represents a power generation diesel equivalent.
2.     Some rebate applicants do not provide an estimate of diesel savings, (for example, new facilities or sites where power was previously not available).  For these sites, diesel savings have been interpolated from the average of the sites in that state that do estimate diesel savings.
3.     Diesel savings for the installation of 1 kilowatt of photovoltaics can vary depending on the type of power system used prior to the installation of renewable generation.  In some cases, there may be no actual reduction in diesel consumption but rather a change in power availability from 10 to 24 hours per day and increased electrical load due to the replacement of old kerosene and LPG fridges with electric fridges and other new electrical appliances.
(4)   What is the estimated level of greenhouse abatement due to the program a) to date;
and b) to 2010.
(a)   The estimated greenhouse gas savings for installations completed as at 30 June 2007 is about 65,000 tonnes per year, ongoing over the lifetime of the technologies installed.
Notes
1.     A full fuel cycle figure of 3kg/litre of diesel has been used for this estimate. 
2.     It is difficult to estimate the exact level of cumulative greenhouse abatement from the program to date because of the different commissioning dates for each of the more than 4000 installations.  The estimated level is in the order of 230,000 tonnes to June 2007, however, the annual greenhouse abatement noted above is more commonly used.
(b)   Based on installations to date, the forecast greenhouse gas savings for installations completed as at 30 June 2010 is about 100,000 tonnes per year, ongoing over the lifetime of the technologies installed.
Notes
1.        It is difficult to predict the amount and mix of fixed photovoltaics, tracking photovoltaics, concentrating photovoltaics, wind, hydro and biomass generation technologies that will be installed in the period to 30 June 2010.  The amount spent on essential enabling equipment and the scale and location of the projects will also influence the amount of annual greenhouse gas abatement.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Question No. 92</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,26,1,speech
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2008-03-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked today.
It all sounded so very simple. The government was going to bring schools into the 21st century, apparently from the Stone Age. They developed this glib promise: a digital education revolution. You might remember during the election campaign Mr Rudd turned up at a school surrounded by adoring teachers and students, grabbed hold of a laptop and said, ‘This is the toolbox of the 21st century.’ He was half right. It is a toolbox, but without any tools. What we now know about the digital education revolution is that the way that Mr Rudd is going to play it is this: he will turn up at the school gates and he will dump some shiny new objects, some shiny laptops, at the school. He will stay there for the media conference, smile benignly and then jump in his Comcar and head overseas again, and the ongoing maintenance costs will be borne by both government and independent schools. These are ongoing costs that will last for years.
What are these costs? For a start, there is co-financing the broadband rollout, because we now know after estimates that the $100 million allocated for that purpose by the federal government will not be enough to provide all secondary schools in Australia with a broadband connection of up to 100 megabits per second. The ongoing costs of broadband access—who will be paying for that? Not Mr Rudd. Rewiring the schools to give them a sufficient number of outlets to power all the computers is a cost of over $100,000 for the average school—who will be paying for that? Not Mr Rudd. The ongoing costs of all the extra electricity consumption, the air-conditioning to keep the computers at the right temperature, the insurance and the security—who will be paying for all that? Not Mr Rudd. The maintenance of all the hardware; repair and replacement of broken, damaged and stolen units; the maintenance and repair of the broadband connection; the software and software updates—who will be paying for that? Not Mr Rudd. Almost 120,000 secondary school teachers will have to be retrained to be able to teach in the new digital education environment—this wonderful, glorious revolution—and who will be paying for that? Not Mr Rudd.
This reminds me of one of those mobile phone deals. Remember Crazy John? He gives you the free mobile phone and what do you do? You get a free mobile phone and then you pay forever for the ongoing costs. The digital education revolution works like this: we give you a shiny new laptop, and Crazy Kev’s education revolution is that you pay the ongoing costs forever.
—Senator Mason, you should refer to people in the other place by their correct title and not those that you might construct on the spur of the moment. Thank you.
—Mr Deputy President, when I said ‘Crazy John’ I was not referring to you, sir.
—No, you used the Prime Minister’s name in a way that was not fitting—and it would not matter who was the Prime Minister; I would ask you to correct that.
—I apologise, Mr Deputy President. In the case of state schools that means that state governments will bear the costs. Who here would charge state Labor governments with looking after our schools? I know in my home state that the state Labor government cannot even air-condition the schools for the students. How can we trust them to look after all those ongoing costs? When it comes to independent and Catholic schools, who is going to be—
—Working families.
—Working families will be footing the bill—those schools and those parents will be footing the bill, not Mr Rudd. And, of course, what we now know after the embarrassment of estimates is that the deception goes much deeper. In fact, the minister confirmed this today. Initially the argument was: there will be one computer for every student. Now we know from estimates and today’s answer that at best it might be one computer for every two students. This was a deliberate deception at the time of the election—a very glib phrase, it sounded great, but an absolute deception. What we now talk about, apparently, is access. That is now the new argument, that is the new terminology, not ‘one computer each’. And we learnt yesterday that apparently broadband may not be unrolled to schools until next year. Senator Coonan uncovered that atrocity. So we now know these great laptop computers may not be fed from broadband. So what have they got? Nothing better than typewriters. This education revolution is a glib sham and it is typical of the first 100 days of the Rudd government: all symbolism and nothing below it. (Time expired)

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2008-03-20,"—This government is concerned that, as we lead into the Easter break and families are preparing to head off to country and seaside locations, or interstate to visit friends and relatives, they may end up paying more for their petrol. But, as I say that, I look at those opposite and think: do they really believe that this is the first time that Australian families have had to pay more for petrol at Easter time, on weekends or during the Christmas holidays? They had 11 years in government. Are they saying that that did not occur during their reign?
But there is a difference. The Rudd Labor government has put in place mechanisms to assist in addressing this issue. The first point is that we have introduced greater transparency into the petrol market in Australia in the last four months than the previous government managed to do in 11 years. Since its election the government has moved to appoint a full-time petrol commissioner. Patrick Walker has spent 10 years as Western Australia’s Consumer Protection Commissioner. He will keep a continual watch on the industry and regularly report to the government. The government has also asked the ACCC and the new commissioner to commence a renewed focus on LPG and diesel prices to advise it on whether any further powers for the ACCC in this area are necessary or desirable. Pat Walker is due to start on 31 March.
Formal monitoring powers are also being given to the ACCC on unleaded petrol prices. This gives the ACCC the power to seek documents and to subpoena witnesses about decisions at any point in the supply chain to ensure that there is no anticompetitive conduct. The government and the ACCC have also agreed that the commission will undertake a more detailed examination and ongoing monitoring of buy-sell arrangements; will complete an audit of terminals suitable for importing refined petrol into Australia, covering terminal capacity, use, leasing and sharing arrangements; will provide ongoing monitoring of the use, leasing and sharing of terminals suitable for importing refined petrol into Australia—and it goes on.
We have always fessed up to the Australian people on the key factors that drive Australia’s retail petrol prices. However, we depart from the coalition on what the government can and should be doing in promoting competition and transparency in the petrol market. Members opposite need to look at what they did in 11 years of government. Over Easter we will have ACCC inspectors and officers for fair trading in New South Wales and Queensland on the ground investigating petrol prices and taking action against any companies which are engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct.
The Rudd government take both consumer affairs and competition policy seriously. We take seriously the plight of working families and small businesses, both of which would bear the burden of high petrol prices. The Rudd government is committed to making a difference for consumers. Indeed, it wants to empower consumers by making markets fairer. As well as working for retail price transparency in the petrol market, we on this side will crack down on cartels which defraud consumers and we are instituting a significant inquiry into the grocery industry. The Rudd government is doing everything it can to put downward pressure on petrol and grocery prices, to help ease cost-of-living pressures on working families, together with its five-point plan to win the war on inflation.
I cannot move on without looking at education, another issue that was raised by senators over there, and computers in schools. The Rudd government made an election promise and the government is keeping that promise. The government policy promises access to a computer for every student in years 9 to 12. We are on the way to delivering this promise. The first $100 million of the $1 billion for the digital education revolution will be rolled out this financial year. We have already opened round 1, inviting 937— (Time expired)

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-03-20,"—What a remarkable performance we witnessed today in question time from Senator Carr. It was truly remarkable. At one stage today the minister asked those opposite whether we found his performance humorous. Well, it was humorous to a degree—humorous in the like of a tragic comedy. It was a true comedy of errors that we saw taking place opposite. As Senator Carr flailed around, shuffling his notes, shuffling his folders and struggling to find a brief, he was given only brief respite by the occasional point of order that allowed Senator Faulkner to whisper some advice in his ear.
—You called the points of order.
—It truly was a remarkable performance. Senator Carr should have been grateful for the points of order because they did help him out remarkably. We found it funny. Of course, I noted not everybody on the other side found it funny. There were senators with their faces buried in their hands. Senator Ray had to leave the chamber during one of Senator Carr’s remarkable performances, such was his lack of humour at the performance we saw put on.
We saw Senator Carr flail from issue to issue to issue today. When asked up-front about the news that is across all the newspapers today about the estimated windfall revenue gain that the government may get from its carbon emissions trading scheme—the government may receive up to $20 billion—Senator Carr had no idea. He clearly had not read his clips, had not been briefed or could not find the brief. Whatever it was, he had no idea that there could be $20 billion coming the government’s way and could not tell us whether they were going to pocket that or whether they were going to give it back to households, to working families and to Australians to meet the increased costs that will come with climate change. Indeed, when asked directly by Senator Milne about the Labor Party’s policies and how they might go about helping working families adjust to the costs of climate change, once again Senator Carr could not answer. That was not a question about somebody else’s comments; that was a direct question from Senator Milne, who I see has entered the chamber, about Labor’s policies that they took to the election. We saw Senator Carr with no idea. He had no idea on their policy, no direction at all.
When asked about petrol supply, which Senator Wortley just talked about, the best he could do was talk about petrol prices because that was the brief that he could find. He looked up ‘p’ for petrol, found something on petrol prices and thought, ‘This will do.’ Nothing on petrol supply was uttered—nothing, because he could not find a brief to refer to, quite clearly. He was hapless and hopeless without finding such a brief. It really was a remarkable performance.
Then when questioned about plastic bags he repeated the ‘no Commonwealth levy’ assurance given by Mr Garrett, after some flip-flopping on the issue, of course, and after overturning what had been said in Senate estimates evidence. The minister for the environment had already changed where the government was going on this. Senator Carr today was asked not about a Commonwealth levy—because we will take the government at its word that there will not be a Commonwealth levy—but about the government’s position on any levy on plastic bags. Indeed, what I suspect will occur when the environment ministers meet is we will see an agreement to have a uniform national levy implemented by the states and territories. It will be a national levy by backdoor mechanisms. They will be able to say it was not a Commonwealth levy, but it will be a national levy and it will hurt working families. It will hurt working families just because this government wants glib headlines about plastic bags rather than seriously tackling issues of waste management.
Senator Carr has another six or seven weeks now to sweat it out before he has to face question time again. And sweat it out I have no doubt he will. We will no doubt see, if these performances continue, that one day the Prime Minister will have to say to Senator Carr, as they do in the TV show The Weakest Link, ‘You are the weakest link—goodbye!’ and welcome somebody else to the front bench to replace the unable Senator Carr.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2008-03-20,"—Mr Deputy President, you and I were sitting next to each other in question time and you may recall that I commented to you that I thought it was ‘pensioner day’ today because Senator Kemp got up and then Senator Lightfoot. I am not sure whether to categorise Senator Ian Macdonald that way. I do not know whether he has one foot in the grave or not. That is for his own side to work out.
I want to comment on the silly strategy that the opposition conducted today. The minister in charge of petrol pricing is Chris Bowen, the Assistant Treasurer. Not one of the opposition’s questions was to the Assistant Treasurer.
—It wasn’t about prices.
—It was about prices. Then there was a question to a minister representing a minister representing a minister. Senator Carr attempted to answer the questions they were giving him, but in fact they should have been sent to the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer. This is Eric’s first day of taking over the leadership of his party in the Senate and already their strategy is in a shambles. On his first day of taking over, the first thing Senator Abetz did was let the pensioners off the leash and let them have a go.

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—I have already expressed my view to you privately about Senator Birmingham and Senator Brett Mason. They are B1 and B2—
—Senator Hutchins, your comments should be directed to the chair, and those interjecting on my left should cease.
—As I said, the strategy today seemed a bit pointless. If you want to know about petrol prices, you ask the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, not Senator Sherry, not Senator Carr and not a minister representing a minister representing a minister. You should ask the Assistant Treasurer, because that is the area that involves this portfolio.
You asked what the government is doing in relation to petrol prices. Let me tell you what we have been doing. We have been doing more than you ever did in 11½ years.

Senator Abetz interjecting—


Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—

—You were both ministers in that government and you did bugger all.
—Excuse me; withdraw that.
—Withdraw that.
—Senator Abetz, I do not need you to adjudicate as the chair. Senator Hutchins, you should withdraw that.
—I withdraw that. As you are well aware, and you were advised of this in question time, Mr Graeme Samuel, the head of the ACCC, has written to the oil companies and put them on notice about unfair prices at the bowser. He has asked them to justify themselves to him if anything happens over this Easter break. A hotline has been set up by the ACCC to monitor prices so that if anybody believes that the oil companies or the petrol stations are ripping them off they will be able to go straight to that hotline and, as Senator Sherry said, cooperate with the inspectors from the departments of fair trading in New South Wales and Queensland in particular to ensure no ripping off goes on.
As I said, you lot were in power for 11½ years. Both Senator Abetz and Senator Ian Macdonald were ministers in the former government and they did nothing at all. We are now acting. In the 100 days that we have been in power, we have said that we will set up a petrol commissioner. That will be Mr Patrick Walker, as Senator Wortley has outlined. We have also advised the oil companies in writing that, as well as the fines at the moment for collusion, we will criminalise cartel conduct. There will be no few hundred thousand dollar fines which they can cover; we will criminalise it so that those oil company directors or people who cooperate in trying to push up the price of fuel may find themselves spending a few years in jail if cartel conduct is proven. We have done that; what did the opposition do while they had the opportunity to do anything about it? Nothing at all.
I do not know what they expect the government to do in relation to this. Are they really suggesting that we should nationalise the petrol companies? I know Senator Brandis and Senator Mason like to travel around the world, popping in on the odd communist dictatorship, like they did in Cuba. I know they would like to nationalise that in Cuba and I think they have in Venezuela or Colombia. Maybe that is the solution. Maybe that is what Senator Ian Macdonald will get up and advise us we should do: take a leaf out of George’s and Brett’s book and go over to Cuba and see what Fidel would do. That is what they want us to do: just nationalise.
We have acted, and we have acted swiftly. The oil companies know that they are on notice. Petrol stations know that they are on notice. If they misbehave over this weekend— (Time expired)

—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I did not want to interrupt Senator Hutchins during his speech, but I want to rise on a point of order about Senator Hutchins’ language. He made a derogatory comment about pensioners. Senator Birmingham, Senator Kemp and I do not care if he is referring to us, but it was a derogatory slur on pensioners in Australia and I think that Senator Hutchins should be invited to apologise to pensioners for being derogatory in the way in which he referred to them.
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. That is an outrageous proposition. There was no attempted slur on pensioners in this country. This is an attempt to verbal Senator Hutchins in relation to what he said. He was suggesting in a colourful way that there are certain senators here who are not going to be in this chamber for very long. I think everyone understood that.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2008-03-20,"—It is quite obvious that the talent pool within the Labor Party is very shallow. We on this side thought that the performance of Senator Carr was such that people like Senator Hutchins and Senator Wortley might be champing at the bit to replace him, but I must say that their performances were even more abysmal than Senator Carr’s, hard as that is to believe. We had the hapless Senator Hutchins tell us about the issue of prices for petrol. He made exactly the same error as Senator Carr. The question that was asked was: is there a petrol supply shortage in Australia? Senator Carr, not having a brief on the matter but having a brief on petrol prices, spoke all about petrol prices. Even in taking note of answers, Senator Hutchins, having no idea about petrol supply, talked about petrol prices. It was completely irrelevant to the issue that was actually raised.
Senator Wortley raised petrol prices. She said, ‘What did you do about petrol prices during your 11½ years?’ One thing we were was honest with the Australian people. Prime Minister Rudd went to the election last year promising that he could do something about petrol prices—like King Canute, saying that he could turn back the tide. At the time King Canute said it, people rushed around him and said, ‘What a great idea. We like this King Canute fellow,’ and they went and followed him. But, of course, as time went by, King Canute realised that he could not turn back the tide. I understand in that fable that King Canute at least was honest enough to say that he had become too arrogant and sought an apology. I think that is what Prime Minister Rudd ought to do, because he went to the Australian people saying: ‘I hear you on petrol prices. We will do something about it.’ But what has happened with petrol prices? In Sydney they are already at $1.50. One of the issues confronting Australia is the supply of petrol. It was a very large article in the Sydney Morning Herald. That Senator Carr should come in here not briefed on the topic was an absolute disgrace.
For Senator Hutchins to somehow say that this was an issue being asked of a minister representing a minister representing a minister of course is also wrong, because the supply of petrol falls very neatly within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Resources and Energy, who he represents in here on a regular daily basis. He should have been fully briefed on the matter, but he was not. So no matter where we go with Senator Carr, be it on a free trade agreement, be it on plastic bags, be it on schools, be it in any area whatsoever of the responsibilities that he has in this chamber, he is unable to give a coherent answer. It is either because of his overblown sense of self-importance or it is because of his incompetence. I unfortunately fear it may well be the latter. But, of course, when incompetence is there then the arrogance comes in to try to make up for the incompetence.
—But I tipped him off on the question!
—You are quite right, Senator Macdonald. In relation to the question that Senator Macdonald asked, he actually rang Senator Carr’s office and said, ‘I’m going to ask you a question about this particular dam.’ So what did he do? He comes in here and reads out a brief—I think the only brief he had at question time, the one that he was warned about—but he had the wrong brief. What do you have to do to assist a minister? Indeed, Senator Faulkner and Senator Conroy were trying to assist him during question time as well. Senator Faulkner unfortunately let out some words that Senator Kemp misunderstood as having been said by Senator Carr. But really, Senator Carr had no idea. It was an embarrassment. The people of Australia clearly deserve better ministerial representation in this place.
Prime Minister Rudd made a promise to the Australian people that there would be accountability, that there would be transparency and that ministers would give full and proper answers. What we saw today from Senator Carr was obfuscation writ large in relation to every single area that he was asked about. Senator Carr has dismally failed on all the counts that Mr Rudd says that we as the Australian people can judge him on. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-03-20,"—I wanted to say first of all that I was disappointed that Senator Carr did not pick up more quickly the import of the question I asked about energy efficiency. It was basically to recognise that we are going to have a carbon price, that a carbon price is going to increase the cost of energy to Australian consumers, and that that will have a disproportionate impact on low-income earners. I think we all accept that that is the case. The Garnaut report out this afternoon on the emissions trading system acknowledges that as well.
The point I was making to Senator Carr was to say that cash payments and low-interest loans do not work and that a far more desirable option is to use money from the auction of permits to pollute to invest in energy efficiency. It is the old saying: if you give people a fish, you feed them for a day; if you teach them how to fish, you feed them for life. The proposal with energy efficiency is this: if you assist people to upgrade their homes to be more energy efficient then their energy bills are going to be less and it is going to be less permanently over time because you have fully insulated their house and you have reduced the cost of their hot water by installing solar hot water. The Greens have thought about this for a long time. We have the EASI policy initiative to upgrade the whole of Australia’s existing housing stock—7.4 million houses—and that takes into account of course all rental accommodation, because there is no incentive at the moment for landlords to upgrade when their tenants are in a position where they have to pay regardless. This would allow us to spend money up-front retrofitting the country and reducing people’s power bills permanently. Do you give them a small amount of cash in their hand, which is inflationary, or do you invest the money in giving them lower power bills permanently?
I am pleased to say that Professor Garnaut in his report today acknowledges that investment in energy efficiency is one of the ways that you can help low-income households. I really welcome the fact that he has said that. I welcome the fact that there is a recognition of the importance of energy efficiency, but now I am delighted that Senator Carr said this afternoon, ‘I would have to agree,’ when I asked him if the government would consider implementing the Greens’ Energy Efficiency Access and Savings Initiative, or EASI, for investment in retrofitting 7.4 million households across Australia. I am very pleased that the minister has said that they will consider implementing it, that they agree in relation to energy efficiency, and I look forward to working with the government to see if we can roll out energy efficiency. The other advantage of it, above cash payments, is that it helps with the structural adjustment to help declining communities. There are going to be some communities that are losers in a low carbon economy, but they can be made winners if you introduce new industries. If we made solar hot water compulsory and if the government paid up-front then there would be a whole new industry, a massive expansion in energy efficiency technology. That would mean rolling out that technology, employing people in those fields, in those jobs. And, of course, that would mean not only the manufacture of those energy efficiency technologies but also their initial installation and their maintenance. There would be jobs around that whole new low carbon economy. It is also a support for public infrastructure, because you would not only do it for private housing but also move into the commercial sector. It has the advantage of being anti-inflationary, it gives you long-term lower energy prices and it assists in new job creation in the new low carbon economy. It is a win all around.
There is no disadvantage to the scheme of using money that you get from selling the permits—and Professor Garnaut is recommending 100 per cent auctioning—and I hope that the government will agree with him and recognise that, for this system to have integrity, auctioning the permits is the way to go. I also welcome it dovetailing with international emissions trading schemes so Australia is not out on its own, that we are ready to dovetail with other schemes. I also recognise the importance of Professor Garnaut saying that we should not be taking agriculture and forestry in straightaway because the data is not good enough to have integrity in the scheme as yet. But I am concerned about shifting the burden to the future. I do not want to have a scheme which is tightened up later. We should be taking the tightening now and tightening further later on. Because the science is moving very fast, I am concerned that if we think we have it right to start with we are going to leave future generations with a terrible burden. (Time expired)

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Answers to Questions</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,27,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-20,"—This legislation was introduced in the Senate by me on behalf of the Australian Democrats nearly two years ago and reinstated to the Notice Paper after the recent federal election. It proposes the establishment of a new category of visa, known as a complementary protection visa. It seeks to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of a significant category of visa applications under the Migration Act. There are around 150 different visa classes and subclasses, and I am on record calling for a significant rationalisation and reduction of them—so it might seem a bit strange that I am proposing legislation to add a new category of visa to the existing ones, but this mechanism would deal with what is a serious ongoing inefficiency and, I might say, a very non-transparent process that affects thousands of people each year.
The purpose of a complementary protection visa is to deal with those claims made in Australia by people whose circumstances do not meet the refugee convention definition of a refugee but nonetheless have compelling humanitarian or safety reasons why they cannot return to their country of origin and do not have any other place or any other country that they can go to. This gap is due to the fact that the protection of the refugee convention does not cover every possible humanitarian situation. So, whilst in general parlance we might use the term ‘refugee’ to mean somebody who has fled a dangerous circumstance, in a legal sense the definition of ‘refugee’ under our Migration Act, as reflected in the refugee convention, is actually fairly narrow. It does not necessarily deal, for example, with cases where people are stateless, cases of people who have come from a country enveloped in civil war, cases of people who have been subject to gross violations of their human rights for reasons other than those in the refugee convention, cases where people would face torture upon returning to their country, or other sorts of circumstances where people have come from a country where general law and order no longer exist. All of those circumstances can apply without somebody falling into the category of ‘refugee’ under the convention.
I believe, and the Democrats believe, that a clearly defined statutory model of complementary protection would provide a fairer, far more consistent, far more transparent, far cheaper, far more efficient and much quicker system for determining and resolving the situations of people in Australia who have clear and strong humanitarian reasons why they cannot be returned to their country of origin. It should also be emphasised that, particularly at a time when we still have mandatory detention existing under the Migration Act, it is people in this category that have often been amongst those who have been in long-term detention. I note the new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, has, to his great credit, indicated his desire to finalise and resolve the circumstances and claims of people who have been in detention for prolonged periods of time. He identified 61 people who have currently been in detention for a period longer than two years—not all of them are in this situation, I might say; but some of them are.
In addition to those, there are many others out there in the community—on return pending bridging visas, removal pending bridging visas and other forms of bridging visas—whose refugee claims have not been successful but who are, nonetheless, not realistically able to be returned. This includes people who are stateless. I know of some circumstances of people who have been in detention for four, five or six years, and who have been refused—correctly, in a legal sense—a protection visa because they have not met the refugee convention criteria but nonetheless clearly cannot be returned to their country of origin. These people are stateless and have nowhere else they can go. We know that. They know that. They have actually said, ‘We will go anywhere—any country that will take us, please.’ But there is nowhere that will take them. So, as a consequence, they have stayed in detention for very long periods of time. Some of those people are now out in the community, but they are still in the community on temporary visas—temporary humanitarian visas, bridging visas, removal pending visas. All of these sorts of visas have differing entitlements attached to them but have one thing in common, and that is a lack of security, a lack of certainty, and they leave the circumstance unresolved. This is particularly stressful for the person but it is also unsatisfactory for the department and our migration system, because it leaves a case that is still pending. It is inefficient, it is expensive, and it is frankly inadequate.
The other big problem with the existing system is that all of these people have no direct, clear process to make an application to deal with their circumstances. Even people who know they do not fit the refugee criteria, and who are quite honest about that but believe they have a compelling humanitarian case—people who, for example, may face torture for other reasons if they are sent back—have no alternative but to apply for a visa they know they are not entitled to. They do this—even where they know they are not entitled to the visa —so that their application can be rejected and they have to appeal to the tribunal. At that stage, they can put in a specific request for the minister to make a personal intervention. This is because, under the current legislation, the minister cannot intervene to make a decision about a visa until somebody has had their application for a specific reason rejected, and had it rejected again on appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal or the Migration Review Tribunal.
So we are forcing people to apply for visas they are not eligible for, forcing them to appeal to a tribunal when they know they are not eligible for it, wasting the resources of the department, wasting the resources of the tribunal, and then going into a ministerial discretion process that is completely arbitrary, totally nontransparent and unpredictable. This process is also grossly overloaded for precisely this reason—or at least in part for this reason. People have no other avenue.
It is an absurdly inefficient system and one that is not codified, which leaves a real risk of it being inconsistently applied, and not transparent with regard to the reasons behind why some applications are accepted and others are rejected. I can certainly attest to that fact, as can a number of parliamentarians who make requests to ministers. There are many people in the community who make requests to ministers to intervene in humanitarian cases. They have been doing this sort of thing for years—as I have—and have no idea why one person is successful and another person is not. At least, with a normal visa statutorily defined, if you are rejected you will get reasons why you were rejected and you can see if the reasons make sense. If they have any errors of fact, you can appeal if necessary on the basis of a mistake, an error in law—any of those sorts of things. You cannot do that with ministerial discretion; it is completely at the discretion of the minister. It is not appealable, not compellable and not transparent. It is a very inefficient system.
I should emphasise that this is not a new problem; this is not some recent frolic or little quirk that the Democrats are trying to identify. This has been identified a number of times in Senate committee inquiries. As long ago as June 2000, a report entitled A sanctuary under review: an examination of Australia’s refugee and humanitarian determination process was tabled in this chamber by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The committee, which was then chaired by Senator Jim McKiernan from Western Australia, a Labor senator, brought down an almost unanimous report; it was certainly unanimous in this regard. It recommended that the government examine the most appropriate means by which Australia’s laws could be amended so as to explicitly incorporate the non-refoulement obligations of the convention against torture and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights into domestic law. I was a member of that committee and the rationale behind that recommendation was, in part, because of the inefficiencies of having to go the circuitous and opaque route of ministerial discretion. That was, as I said, a unanimous report, including from the Liberal Party members of the committee, which at that time were Senator Payne and Senator Coonan. It also included me and three Labor senators, one of whom was Senator Ludwig, who has now gone on to greater things.
I urge the new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, to examine that report and, even more so, to examine the report of the Senate Select Committee into Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters, which reported in 2004. By that stage, sadly, migration issues had become much more partisan and politicised, so the Liberal members of that committee did not sign on to the recommendations, but nonetheless the Labor and Democrat members did sign on. That committee was chaired by the aforementioned Senator Ludwig, as well as having Senator Wong and Senator Sherry—and those three Labor members are all now senior members of the ministry. The report included a recommendation that the government consider adopting a system of complementary protection to ensure that Australia no longer relies solely on the minister’s discretionary powers to meet its non-refoulement obligations under various international conventions, such as the convention against torture, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights. For those who are not aware, ‘non-refoulement’ basically means ‘non-return’—not returning people to face torture, persecution or other serious circumstances.
The report—and, again, I urge the minister to examine the material and the rationale put forward in that report, supported by all of the Labor members of the committee, all of whom are now ministers in the new government—examined and agreed that we needed a system of complementary protection. From pages 138 onwards of that report is evidence from the human rights commission proposing these sorts of things. Other material was put forward that pointed to the proposals by the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees program, EXCOM, talking about the need to operate and have an effective system of complementary protection. The Refugee Council of Australia put forward proposals in that regard and had a paper presented to the inquiry, entitled ‘Complementary protection: the way ahead’. I know that some of those bodies working in this area—the Refugee Council of Australia, A Just Australia and others—are continuing to explore and propose ways to implement a system of complementary protection.
This legislation is based on a recognition of a longstanding need to improve the efficiency and fairness, quickness and transparency of our migration system. I do believe that it is a simple and effective way of doing it. I know the new minister is examining, as is understandable, the way the Migration Act as a whole works now and areas where he can make improvements. I understand that he wants to take time to do that and to look at the best ways to do it, so I urge him to look at the model that it is put forward in this legislation and some other similar models.
I note from today’s Age newspaper that the minister is looking at trying to streamline and fast-track the operation of the temporary skilled worker visa program. I very much support him in doing that and making it work more efficiently and effectively—not putting in place lots of pointless red tape that costs enormous amounts of money and makes the whole system work less effectively and makes it harder. This is one of the key reasons for these things; I think it is often forgotten. It is against our own interests as a nation to make it harder for people to get a clear, quick, understandable, consistent decision on a visa application. The same principle applies whether you are talking about a visa application for a skilled worker, an engineer coming here from India or somebody who is already here and seeking a decision on whether or not they can stay on humanitarian grounds.
It is in the public interest to have quick decisions made and to have them made fairly, consistently and openly. That saves enormous amounts of money. It means that people who do get a successful decision are able to contribute economically and socially to the Australian community much more effectively. We all know that the longer people live in a state of uncertainty, the longer they have to struggle on without proper opportunities to get support, the harder it is for them to settle. They develop difficulties in regard to mental health issues and the like from the stress and that diminishes their potential for contributing effectively to the Australian community.
It is not just some bleeding heart measure to say, ‘We need to help these poor people; let’s be nice to them.’ It is not just to make us feel good. It is actually in our own interests economically, as much as anything else, to have people receive quick, open, fair decisions so that those that are accepted on valid grounds are able to contribute effectively as quickly as possible in the Australian economy, community and culture and those that are rejected are given clear reasons why. They do not have to go round and round in circles and then get a letter back from the minister saying, ‘I just choose not to exercise my discretion,’ but giving no reasons. Then nobody is clear why this person is rejected and the other person is not. It is precisely the sort of uncertainty that leaves people in a situation where they keep fighting, dragging it out year after year at great stress to themselves and great cost to the taxpayer.
Overall, it does not really help the effectiveness and coherence of our migration system and laws. If people get a decision with clear reasons as to why they are rejected, they are much more likely to say: ‘Okay, I’m not happy but I understand; I’ll look for other options. I’ll return, if that’s possible, or I’ll do other things’. I am not saying that will happen automatically all of the time, but the evidence shows that that is what happens. If people are actually given open, clear reasons that they can test, they feel like they have had at least a fair go and a fair hearing and they are much more likely to accept the decision than if they feel they are getting the run-around.
I support the new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in his attempts to streamline the skilled visa program and expand it. I support the minister for, as it says here, considering allowing climate refugees to resettle in Australia and allowing unskilled workers from Pacific islands as well. It might seem like it is a separate issue but it all links to having a clear and coherent system based on rational reasons which operates as quickly and as clearly as possible.
I might say in regard to climate refugees that that is another example where we use the word ‘refugees’ in a general sense. We all know what it means, but it is actually not and it is never going to be part of the refugee convention. There is no way the refugee convention is going to be reopened and redefined to include climate change refugees. It does not come under the current criteria of the refugee convention, not surprisingly. But it does come under precisely the sort of criteria that would apply in regard to complementary protection. This would actually be a very clear-cut, simple way for climate change refugees, as we use the term in the general sense of the word, to be accepted in Australia. There are clear humanitarian circumstances where people cannot return as a direct consequence of severe environmental degradation, for example, and they could fit under this category. That would be much better than having to just use ministerial discretion or have set up some specific things just for climate change refugees. It allows flexibility within the context of a clear set of statutorily defined guidelines.
I support the minister in what he is doing in the Migration Act more broadly whether it is in the area of skills or other areas. But I would also urge him to look at it in regard to this area. Even under the previous government a number of ministers clearly acknowledged that the ministerial discretion system is broken. It is not the job of the migration minister to be micromanaging thousands of individual migration visa requests. You employ a department to assess claims. There is a whole section set up that deals with these now but the power can only be exercised by the minister, and dealing with individual claims is not what our migration minister should be doing.
This legislation would significantly reduce the dysfunctionality of the ministerial discretion system that currently operates, and that is needed. I think all sides of politics would agree on that. It puts in place a scheme that is clearly defined and therefore contained. It does not just open up open slather for anyone we feel sorry for, but it removes the inconsistency and the lack of transparency that currently applies. Any change to the Migration Act that means it will operate at less taxpayer cost, at greater efficiency and quickness and with fairness is something that we should seriously consider and I hope the government and the new minister does.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. It is a point of order that I do not expect a ruling on now, but I would seek to draw to your attention that the official tape of the Hansard does disclose Senator Carr saying the words alleged by Senator Kemp during question time through his point of order. I therefore ask the President to consider whether that language was in fact unparliamentary and should be withdrawn.
The second matter that I would raise for consideration by the President is this. On that point of order being raised by Senator Kemp, Senator Evans asserted that Senator Kemp’s statement was untrue, was verballing the minister and vexatious in circumstances where the tape now clearly bears out every single point made by Senator Kemp. In those circumstances, I believe Senator Evans should be asked to withdraw making that allegation against Senator Kemp. I do not need a ruling now, Mr Acting Deputy President, I realise it may put you in a difficult position, but I think that the matter should be dealt with after review of the tape.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Abetz, I will bring to the President’s attention the remarks that you have just made.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPLEMENTARY PROTECTION VISAS) BILL 2006 [2008]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2008-03-20,"—I stand to speak to Senator Bartlett’s Migration Legislation Amendment (Complementary Protection Visas) Bill 2006 [2008]. Before addressing specifically different provisions of the bill and the comments made by Senator Bartlett, I want to say at the outset that I am very proud of the good record of the previous coalition government when it comes to having a sound immigration policy and a sound immigration system that is relevant to Australia—not just to the economic development of our great country, but to the expression of compassion and care, specifically to those who are refugees. Over the 11 years of the coalition government, we welcomed more than 100,000 refugees and humanitarian entrants. I notice that in the past 12 months or so we increased the size of our offshore humanitarian program from 12,000 to 13,000 places, and that included an increase in the refugee component from 4,000 to 6,000. You can compare the record in different ways, but Australia’s record of welcoming refugees to this country is certainly very good. It has been said that Australia has the second-best record in the world, second only to Canada, for refugee intake.
In any event, the commitment by the previous coalition government of around $500 million a year was made. It was made to support resettlement services, including the Adult Migrant English Program, which included 510 hours of English language training plus a special preparatory program providing an additional 400 hours of English training for eligible people with high needs. I want to commend those involved in the various ethnic groups and other groups around Australia, particularly in Tasmania. Barbara Blomberg, for example, who is based in Hobart, has showed leadership and advocacy for those who need it and has supported those in need—those coming in with refugee status or on some sort of humanitarian program.
The previous government provided 13,000 places for 2007-08 in that humanitarian program and an additional $209 million spent over four years on a series of programs designed to assist humanitarian migrants to thoroughly integrate into Australia’s broader society. That included $128 million additional support for newly arrived humanitarian entrants to learn English. The point I wanted to make at the outset is that the record is strong, it is good, and that it is not just for the purposes of economic growth to this country, but in terms of showing compassion and care and some humanitarian objectives—not just for our country but across the globe.
In turning specifically to Senator Bartlett’s bill, it is not something the coalition can support, for a number of reasons. It is because, at the moment, we do have a system in place. The system says that the refugees are assessed in accordance with the refugee convention, as specified under the Migration Act. It is a convention which our government and our country is a signatory to. That visa can be obtained, as Senator Bartlett has noted in his comments, through ministerial discretion. The concern is that if you set up a separate system—a complementary protection visa system is referred to in the bill by Senator Bartlett—then you are affecting the lives of those people who would otherwise have obtained refugee status and entered our country through the current arrangements. By handing out the visas to people who do not meet the criteria assessed against the refugee convention as specified under the Migration Act, then you are creating what I would term a queue-jumping arrangement. That is not something we would want to support on this side of the Senate chamber. And if that arrangement did come into place, somebody out there is going to miss out. The queue will be jumped under the system that would be established under the Democrats’ regime. That is something we would not wish to support.
Senator Bartlett and the Democrats have said that the current system does not cater sufficiently for those in an arrangement where there is torture or civil war, but I am not sure that is entirely true or accurate. Under the current arrangements, certainly those situations can be addressed and those applications can be successfully made through the discretion of the minister. Under the system, it sets up a fast track approach, a fast track legislative regime which provides complementary protection mechanism for refugees. But as I said, it is unnecessary and the concern is: would it open up the floodgates? What sort of arrangements are in place in terms of the numbers and the quantity of potential refugees coming into this country? As I said, we have a very good record and I hope that we can maintain that. And I call on the government to maintain the very good and strong record that we do have. In short, it would certainly allow for some refugees to be fast-tracked and get that fast-tracked visa at the expense of others. That is what we do not want and that is why we cannot support this particular bill.
I want to empathise with Senator Bartlett and his objectives. He has had a longstanding interest and concern in this area and has expressed care in different ways through different committees. He has referred to the legal and constitutional affairs committee and a report dating back to 2001 or thereabouts, which did make reference to the need for streamlining the processes of bringing the various refugees that we have into this country. I know that Senator Payne has chaired that committee and it is a committee that I am currently deputy chair of. I thank all of the members of that committee for their very valuable contributions over many years. But my understanding of that report is that it was recommending an examination of the processes. As I said, the recommendation that has been put forward and the objectives put forward by the Democrats in this bill are not something that we could support.
I noticed that the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, Senator Chris Ellison, has demonstrated and expressed the views of the coalition, particularly over the last week, with respect to section 457 visas, and he certainly has demonstrated great leadership and advocacy for continuing the very strong record of a sound immigration system in Australia. What we need is an orderly entry system into this country. It is true that, since 1996 when the Howard government first came to power, something like 30 per cent of the migration intake was from skilled migration and that percentage has now shifted to 70-odd per cent. Last year, something like 102,500 of the total came from skilled migration. Of course, that is important because that is a key ingredient to building a strong economy. On the other hand, we have had a very good record with respect to our humanitarian regime and our efforts to care for and look after refugees—as I said, second only to Canada. I just hope that under the Rudd Labor government that strong record can continue.
In conclusion, I want to address the comments that Senator Bartlett made with respect to the Refugee Review Tribunal and some of the litigation that occurs with respect to the immigration system. It is true that some of these matters were addressed at Senate budget estimates, not only in the February hearings but also last year and, I am sure, in previous years. It is true that there is much litigation with respect to some of the processes, and perhaps there could be some reviewing and streamlining of the processes with respect to the applications that are made and considered. Certainly the Refugee Review Tribunal has a role and, of course, other courts, whether they are other federal courts or indeed the High Court. I think the senator does have a point in terms of the importance of streamlining the processes and making it clear to not only the refugees, potential refugees or potential applicants to those particular tribunals but to the community in general that we do not want months and years of litigation in front of us, with, of course, the community footing the bill in each case. We want a streamlined, clearer and more orderly approach wherever possible. In conclusion, I commend Senator Bartlett on his objectives and efforts. I empathise with his approach, but say that on this occasion it is not possible to support the proposed legislation.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPLEMENTARY PROTECTION VISAS) BILL 2006 [2008]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2008-03-20,"—I rise this afternoon to also speak on Senator Bartlett’s private senator’s bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Complementary Protection Visas) Bill 2006 [2008]. Before I begin my remarks, I would also like to formally recognise Senator Bartlett’s longstanding interest in refugee and humanitarian issues, thank him for raising this issue of complementary protection and acknowledge his contribution to this debate and to the debate more generally on these matters. I would also like to say—and it has been acknowledged by some of the previous speakers—that the new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, has indicated that complementary protection is one of the issues that he is considering as a part of a broad-ranging review into the operation of the Migration Act.
The minister has in fact indicated that he is favourably disposed to looking at how we might advance the matter of complementary protection. However, before going ahead, jumping straight into it and trying to make the changes immediately, which would be the effect of this bill if it were supported, what Labor wants to do is consult very broadly. We want to have a conversation with the community; we want to speak to stakeholders, people who are interested in the issues and academics who have an interest in the topic; and we want to consult with groups such as the UNHCR, who of course have a very relevant interest in this matter. It is also important to realise that complementary protection itself raises very complex issues and these require careful consideration. It is not a matter that can be dealt with in a short space of time; nor can the complexities be glossed over for a broadbrush result. It is as a consequence of these concerns, which I will outline in more detail, that we are not able to support Senator Bartlett’s bill in the form it is currently in.
A number of speakers have already talked about what complementary protection is. It is of course used generally to provide protection to persons who do not fit within the terms of the refugee convention but who cannot be returned to their country of origin due to non-refoulement obligations under other international treaties or on more general humanitarian principles, such as providing assistance to people fleeing from generalised violence. Of course, these other international obligations to which Australia is a party include the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. So, as I indicated, Australia has an obligation under the refugee convention to not return a person where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group. We also have an obligation under the convention against torture to not return a person where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be subjected to torture if they were to return to their own country. A similar provision exists under the ICCPR.
These obligations that I have referred to recognise that people should not be returned to a situation where they are likely to face very serious violations of their human rights, but it is important to recognise that a broad range of rights are covered by these treaties, such as the ICCPR, and not all of them give rise to an obligation to allow people to remain in Australia, particularly where there is a risk that the right will be breached in the person’s home country. It is the complexities and implications of this that I mentioned before that give rise to our concerns with the bill and our reasons for not being able to support it.
Senator Bartlett’s bill before us today, as I read it, would entitle anyone at risk of having any of their rights under the ICCPR violated to be able to remain in Australia. It is not clear, when you look at the bill itself, whether or not their entitlement would be to a permanent visa or to a temporary visa, but they certainly would have some entitlement to remain in Australia. If this were to occur then it would have the result of going well beyond Australia’s international human rights obligations. Labor does not believe that this is a step that should be undertaken lightly and without some thought and investigation. Our international obligations do set the benchmark for what we as a country should and must do, but when we are going beyond those obligations in a way that gives people an entitlement to live in Australia—potentially permanently—it is not something that we could endorse lightly in the terms that are presented in the current bill.
There are also a number of practical issues that need to be considered. There are, of course, strong parallels between complementary protection and refugee status. If we are to have a different system of complementary protection then there may be advantages to these types of claims being considered in a single process, with some administrative and resource savings. But under the bill as it is currently drafted this is not possible. It seems that under the bill there is a possibility for chain applications: first an application for a complementary protection visa and then one for a protection visa under the refugee convention. It would make better sense, in our view—with all due respect to Senator Bartlett—to assess a person seeking non-refoulement first against the refugee convention, which in many respects provides a broader or lower set of tests to be identified for those in need of protection, rather than against some other instruments like the convention against torture or the ICCPR. We also think that it would be better if this were to be done as part of a single process.
The other thing that is unclear is what type of visa we give people approved under this process. As I said before, it is not clear whether or not it is a temporary protection visa or a permanent visa that is intended to be granted to these people. So, as I said before, the bill does raise a number of complex issues, not all of which have been adequately covered by the bill, and these issues certainly deserve further attention before rushing ahead and accepting it in its current form.
There is another really important issue as well which the government needs to be able to manage. This goes to the issue of the character of some individuals. We have to think about how we deal with situations where our international obligations are engaged but the people involved may pose some kind of danger to the community, whether it be for national security reasons or other reasons, and therefore we consider them to be undeserving of protection. Under the ICCPR there are no exclusion grounds in our non-refoulement obligations, so according to this private member’s bill—if it were to be enacted—the persons I have referred to would be entitled to be granted a visa to stay in Australia and, presumably, would be released into the community. Obviously, this would cause problems. This is another complexity that the bill simply does not address.
Another area that is not addressed is the review of decisions. As we know, the RRT only has jurisdiction to review protection visa decisions. We are left wondering whether or not those people not granted a complementary protection visa would be entitled to review of the decision and, if so, what form this review would take. So this is another matter that is simply not addressed in this legislation. The other problem is what form of complementary protection should be afforded. Throughout the world, in different states and different jurisdictions, countries deal with the matter of complementary protection in different ways. These can include either permanent or temporary residence based on humanitarian concerns and other matters. So the situation we have is that there really is no clear, fixed model or standard which can be pulled out and applied in the Australian context. If we were going to look at a system of complementary protection then we would really need to examine and compare what other states are doing and work out what is going to be best for us in Australia.
Senator Bartlett referred to the fact that currently these matters more generally are dealt with by the ministerial intervention powers that exist under the Migration Act. Of course, there has been a great deal of criticism of this ministerial intervention power. It has been the subject of numerous inquiries, including Senate inquiries in 2000, 2004 and, most recently, 2006. In fact the minister himself, Senator Evans, has acknowledged that he is uncomfortable with the powers that exist under the act, and he is taking advice on how things might work differently. The difficulties that exist with the ministerial intervention power have been outlined: it is a non-compellable power, it is non-reviewable, there are no strict guidelines as to how it ought to be exercised, there is no avenue of appeal from a bad decision and there is a lack of consistency in decision making. So it is quite clear that there are a number of problems, and it is something that has to be addressed. The minister himself has acknowledged this and said that he is concerned about the lack of transparency and accountability surrounding these decisions. He has said himself that he is inclined to support an independent, transparent and appealable decision-making process in order to resolve these types of matters.
Labor does acknowledge that the current ministerial intervention power is in need of review, and we are in the process of moving this forward. We acknowledge that complementary protection is one of the matters that ought to be considered, and the minister has said that he is in the process of considering it. He has said that he is favourably disposed towards advancing the complementary protection agenda. But Labor and the minister want to be able to consult much more broadly before taking any decision, and we want to be able to see how things are done internationally and what is the best way to do things here in Australia. As I have said, complementary protection raises very complex issues, and the bill as currently drafted gives rise to a number of problems: there are quite a few gaps and there are a number of matters that still need to be addressed in more detail. So, while Labor and the minister are interested in looking at the issue of complementary protection, we are not prepared to rush into doing this. If we are going to do it, we want to do it correctly. As a consequence, unfortunately, Labor is unable to support the bill in its current form.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPLEMENTARY PROTECTION VISAS) BILL 2006 [2008]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech

"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2008-03-20,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Australian Greens support the Migration Legislation Amendment (Complementary Protection Visas) Bill, and commend Senator Bartlett for introducing this Bill.
The need to institute a complementary protection scheme for Australia’s migration system is obvious and urgent. The absence of complementary protection has led to unnecessary burdens on our refugee processing system, unmeritorious cases clogging up the Refugee Review Tribunal and a huge burden being placed on the Immigration Minister to intervene.
Bureaucratic inefficiencies have been caused by the lack of a complementary protection system and this has led to suffering by real people caught up in the protection visa system. Delays in processing claims have led to people being stuck in detention for many months or years at a time. For those lucky enough not to suffer immigration detention, the processing inefficiencies mean they suffer years of uncertainty and destitution on a bridging visa where they are often denied work rights and access to basic services such health care.
The definition of a refugee in the United Nations Refugee Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees was framed in the aftermath of the Second World War. Although the Refugee Convention has served the world well, as the Refugee Council of Australia notes: “the Refugee Convention is not and was never intended to be a mechanism to cover all people in need of protection”.
There are many displaced people in the world who do not meet the strict definition of the Refugee Convention, but are in need of protection. This protection is ‘complementary to the Convention’.
Australia has dealt with these protection needs in an ad hoc way, relying on the power of Ministerial Intervention under section 419 of the Migration Act. This power is ‘non-reviewable and non-compellable’.
Over the years the reliance on Ministerial Intervention to prop up a failing system has become greater.
The Senate will be well aware of the short comings of the Ministerial Intervention system. At the recent Senate Estimates hearings it was revealed that the previous Minister for Immigration, Kevin Andrews, had 1,846 requests for Ministerial Intervention, which resulted in 479 intervention acts.
Figures supplied by the Department of Immigration to the Senate Inquiry into the Administration of the Migration Act further reveal the number of cases the Minister for Immigration must deal with.
In 2001-2002 there were 4472 humanitarian requests for Ministerial Intervention. In 2002-2003, 4489 requests. In 2003-2004, 4138 requests and in 2004-2005, 2802 requests.
This is a heavy workload for any person, let alone a Minister with many other responsibilities. When you take into account that the Minister should give due consideration to each case and the complex nature of many of these cases with their many supporting documents, then it is a virtually impossible burden.
Of course, much of the work is done by departmental officials. This is however, problematic in itself given the lack of transparency and review.
I am glad that the new Minister has recognised this issue. I would like to quote his statement at the recent Estimates.
In a general sense I have formed the view that I have too much power. The act is unlike any act I have seen in terms of the power given to the minister to make decisions about individual cases. I am uncomfortable with that not just because of a concern about playing God but also because of the lack of transparency and accountability for those ministerial decisions, the lack in some cases of any appeal rights against those decisions and the fact that what I thought was to be a power that was to be used in rare cases has become very much the norm.
There is an industry in appealing to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, I have noticed.... there is a real sense of the appeal to the minister becoming very much part of the process. Rather than being a check on the system it has become institutionalised.
The lack of transparency and accountability of the Ministerial Intervention power left many applicants and advocates with a feeling that justice and fairness had not necessarily been afforded their applications.
Indeed the results of Ministerial applications in the past seems to change with the amount of media interest in certain cases and the political landscape of the day.
The problems of Ministerial Intervention have been investigated by three Senate Committees now. A Sanctuary under Review in 2000, the Select Committee on Ministerial Discretion in Migration Matters (2004) and the Inquiry into the Administration of the Migration Act (2006).
The 2000 committee report recorded concern about the Ministerial Intervention process and recommended “the government examine incorporation of the non-refoulement obligations of the Convention Against Torture and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.” This was rejected by the Howard government.
The 2004 Select Committee report made the following recommendation:
The Committee recommends that the government give consideration to adopting a system of complementary protection to ensure that Australia no longer relies solely on the minister’s discretionary powers to meet its non-refoulement obligations under the CAT, CROC and ICCPR.
There was not a government response to this Select Committee’s recommendations.
Finally, the 2006 report of the Inquiry into the Administration of the Migration Act made the following recommendation.
The committee recommends that the Migration Act be amended to introduce a system of ‘complementary protection’ for future asylum seekers who do not meet the definition of refugee under the Refugee Convention but otherwise need protection for humanitarian reasons and cannot be returned. Consideration of claims under the Refugee Convention and Australia’s other international human rights obligations should take place at the same time. A separate humanitarian stream should be established to process applicants whose claims are in this category, including a review process.
The Howard government made a practice of ignoring Senate Inquiry reports and recommendations. This is unfortunate, given that the thorough study and sounding of expert opinion on these issues by the three inquiries concluded that complementary protection was a solution that should be pursued by the government.
The current situation means that applicants who wish to apply for protection on humanitarian grounds, but do not fit the Convention definition of a refugee, must apply for a protection visa under the Refugee Convention definition anyway and fail. They must then appeal to the Refugee Review Tribunal and fail. Only then can they apply for protection under proper humanitarian grounds in an application for Ministerial Intervention.
Not only does this leave the applicant in limbo, and possibly in detention for months or years, but it clogs up the system with unmeritorious applications.
This Bill would introduce a complementary protection visa class to the Migration Act. This would allow officers processing protection applications to not only consider whether they are owned protection under the Refugee Convention definition, but also whether they should be given protection for humanitarian reasons.
Specifically this Bill lists the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as two international Conventions to which Australia is a signatory and which should be taken into account when an officer is assessing whether an applicant should be given protection under the complementary protection visa class.
I’m sure all Senators would subscribe to the articles of these two Conventions and would want Australia to give protection to those facing persecution or abuse in their countries of origin.
Implementing a complementary protection visa as a separate and parallel stream would also mean decisions could be subject to review by the Refugee Review Tribunal or similar body. Appeal rights are an important check on departmental decision making and essential in providing applicants with natural justice.
Complementary protection systems have been implemented overseas. Canada has broadened its official definition of a refugee. The European Union has created a Qualification Directive as a supranational instrument to seek to harmonise complementary protection systems in its member states.
The Australian Greens support the creation of a complementary protection system and therefore support this bill.
The Greens urge the Rudd Labor government to follow through some encouraging statements from the Minister and establish a complementary protection system. Such fundamental reform will not only ease the Ministerial Intervention workload and result in efficiencies for the protection visa processing system, but more importantly, it will provide a clear, transparent and fair framework for people needing Australia’s protection on humanitarian grounds.
I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (COMPLEMENTARY PROTECTION VISAS) BILL 2006 [2008]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-20,"—I thank the Senate, particularly because Senator Nettle expresses support for the bill. I am pleased to hear that. I understand the rationale of the Labor Party in not supporting the bill, as was outlined by Senator Kirk. I appreciate the indications she gave that the minister, Senator Evans, is examining some of the issues that are raised around complementary protection and the current inadequacies and quite enormous inefficiencies in the ministerial discretion system. I recognise that the minister would want to consult widely and do everything properly, because it is not simple to get this right, but it does need to be done. The purpose of this legislation—and, I might say, a number of other private senators bills relating to migration that I have on the Notice Paper—is to advance the agenda and put forward the case as to why change is needed.
Frankly, if the government can come up with another way of doing it that they think achieves the goal more effectively, I would be pleased. I do not have any great sense of my way being the only way. I do think that action needs to be taken to address these issues and if the government can find a better way then I am quite happy about that and supportive of it. So I welcome the indications that have been given that the minister is examining this area along with a number of others. I think the basic point needs to be made that it is about getting a migration system that is fairer; more efficient and therefore cheaper for the taxpayer; less bureaucratic and less full of red tape; and less opaque than what currently operates for people in these sorts of circumstances.
I think it has been valuable to have this debate, despite my not being successful in getting support for the legislation from either of the major parties, and to get some of these things on the record. I think it has been valuable to hear some of the arguments, including the arguments put forward by Senator Barnett. I appreciate some of the comments he made, but I think the suggestion he made—and I am sure this is what he has been told—that this equates to a mechanism that enables people to jump the queue, is wrong. It does not do that. I think some of those misunderstandings need to be corrected. When the government does make a move in this area—as hopefully they will, in six or 12 months time—these are the sorts of potential misunderstandings that could be put forward, either in good faith or perhaps with less honourable intent. I am certainly not suggesting that in terms of Senator Barnett. Obviously this is an area that has been politically contentious in the past. I think we need to try and take the political point-scoring out of it and look at the substance and facts of the issues.
One of the things that have become very apparent to me while working on this issue for the last 10 years or more is that we are dealing with human beings here; we are not dealing with faceless people who can be used as a political football. The decisions that this parliament makes, and even the words that we use in coming to those decisions, can have—and have had—direct and, in some cases, extremely harmful impacts on innocent people, some of whom have been through horrendous circumstances, and some of whom go through further horrendous circumstances as a direct result of the decisions made, and the words spoken, in this parliament and in the political arena. So we need to try and get the debate as fact based as possible. Adopting complementary protection does not automatically mean that a bunch of people can jump the queue. A quicker decision does not equate to someone jumping the queue; it means that everybody has a clearer circumstance. Those who are successful obviously get a positive result quickly but those who are not successful also have a quicker and clearer result. That is important and desirable in any area of public administration, but certainly with regard to visa applications and the migration system.
It was the decision of the previous government, quite early on in its time, during Minister Ruddock’s period as migration minister, to link the offshore humanitarian program and onshore asylum claims, which were previously dealt with separately with regard to the numbers of people. Frankly, I think that should be looked at so as to reverse that decision because the offshore humanitarian program is something that Australia has had a good record on, even during the Howard years. Despite my very severe criticisms of many aspects of the government’s actions in the migration and refugee area, with regard to the offshore program, broadly speaking it continued to be a positive. It is a program that we quite rightly hold up as something that more countries should seek to emulate. But it is a determined program under which the government decides who they will select. I might say, in the first place, that people are not selected in the order of a queue. One of the reasons that you cannot jump the queue is that there is no queue. People who come here through the humanitarian program do not line up in a nice orderly process, even in terms of a bureaucratic list in the migration department. People do not get refugee visas or offshore humanitarian visas in order of application. It is not a matter of, ‘Well, you’re the next on the queue.’ It does not work that way.
The government makes a decision about where they will take people from, and amongst people in a particular area they then make a smaller decision about who within that group they will take. There is a whole range of criteria that are used in coming to those decisions. Quite a number of those criteria are not related to humanitarian circumstances at all. Some of them are, but some of them are not. It is simply false to say that there is a queue, in the sense that those who have been waiting longest now get their turns; it does not work that way at all. But, even if it did, implementing a complementary protection visa for people who apply in Australia is a different matter, and it would not mean taking anyone else’s place unless the program was structured deliberately to make it that way. That would be a deliberate decision of government, not a consequence of people making a visa application here. It would be no more jumping the queue than somebody coming here on a skilled visa is jumping the queue in relation to a person offshore in a refugee camp.
It is just as absurd to say that someone applying for a complementary protection visa would be taking the place of somebody waiting in a refugee camp as it is to say the same thing about somebody applying for a parent visa, a skilled visa or any other type of visa, unless the government decide to link the two—and then, frankly, that is their decision. It certainly should not be a cause for taking it out on people who are applying for a humanitarian visa here. That misunderstanding needs to be clarified for the purposes of future debate on this issue.
Whilst the majority of the Senate obviously does not support this legislation as it stands—although I recognise some degree of in-principle support with the goals, from the government at least—this debate is not going to go away. As has been made clear by the comments of Senator Kirk, there will be a need to continue to examine this. It is a simple fact. You can talk about the proud record of the previous government as much as you like. I do not particularly want to get into the areas where I disagree and the areas where I agree—that is not the purpose of this debate—but one area where clearly things were not working efficiently is in the area of ministerial discretion. You cannot have a system where an immigration minister has to examine thousands of individual visa applications. It is ludicrous and it is horrendously inefficient. It is just bad public policy. You get inconsistencies, lack of transparency, enormous delays and great cost to the taxpayer and to the applicants and the people supporting them. It does need fixing. This would not fix it in totality but it would go to a clear part of it, particularly the part that makes people apply for visas they know they are not eligible for and go all the way through an appeal process that they know they are going to fail just so they can then seek ministerial discretion.
Once again, I point to the Senate committee reports that I referred to earlier on which highlighted that serious problem and that absurd inefficiency. It is not just chewing up the resources of the minister in having to examine all of those requests for intervention but also chewing up the resources of the tribunals. Every time somebody has to go through this process, because we do not have a clearly defined visa such as a complementary protection visa, means a delay for everybody else. If all of those people were taken out of the system and did not have to go through what is by definition a futile process before they could access ministerial discretion then that would obviously mean that things would flow through more quickly for all the other people who are waiting for decisions from the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal. There would be significant savings and efficiencies to the taxpayer, and increased speed of decisions for everybody in the migration and appeals system. That is something we should be aiming for.
I welcome the indications from the government through Senator Kirk that the new minister is looking at these things. I believe from my own understanding that it is something he is doing, and he does recognise the need to make our system work more fairly and more efficiently. There are a lot of reasons why it does not work as well as it should and could, and they are not all the fault of the previous government. It has built up over a long period of time for a lot of reasons. But it does need fixing and I urge the government to do that as promptly as possible. The sooner it does do that the better the outcome will be for a lot of people who have compelling humanitarian grounds. It is also better for the taxpayer, the economy, society, the community and the overall effectiveness, transparency, fairness and efficiency of the migration system.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-03-20,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I know people are keen to get home, so I will not speak to most of the documents, but I will speak to this one. There are a lot of documents here and many of them are reports that are required to be tabled in this chamber by virtue of amendments made by the Senate. This is one example of a report that has been required to be produced as a result of an amendment made to the Research Involving Human Embryos Act 2002 by this chamber in 2006. As I say, the least we can do, if we agree to amendments requiring reports to be tabled, is to actually note the reports when they do get produced, rather than create a lot of work for people that then gets ignored.
This report is derived from the debate in this chamber regarding the Prohibition of Human Cloning for Reproduction and the Regulation of Human Embryo Research Amendment Act 2006, known colloquially as the stem cell debate and the cloning debate. It was an interesting debate and it was one of the rare occasions when there was a conscience vote and people voted across party lines. It was legislation that passed through this chamber by one vote. As I was one of those votes that supported the legislation I am constantly conscious of the fact that if I had been slightly less persuaded than I ended up being of the merits of supporting the legislation it would not have passed. That is something I do think back on from time to time.
One of the things required of this report, which is only a few pages long, was that a report be produced on the establishment of a national stem cell centre and a national register of donated excess assisted reproductive technology embryos—embryos that were surplus to requirements from IVF processes. One of the arguments that was used as to why we needed to allow cloning for stem cell research was that there were not enough embryos available for research through surplus IVF or ART embryos. That was an argument that was made repeatedly as part of persuading people. I would say, in passing, that it was a debate I was actually a bit disappointed in, in the sense that it became so polarised. In a sense, a lot of the time you got the impression that, if you supported the legislation, you were accused of not caring about the sanctity of human life but, if you opposed the legislation, you were accused of being heartless and not caring about people with terrible diseases who were being denied a potential cure. There was a huge amount of emotional blackmail on both sides, which tended to cloud the substance of the issue on occasion, I might say, without suggesting that those views were not sincerely held.
One of the arguments used was that we have to allow cloning for research because, if we do not, there are just not enough embryos available; we have got to allow some to be created through cloning. So I was interested to read in this report that a survey commissioned by the NHMRC, through the National Perinatal Statistics Unit of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, showed that there is not an undersupply of excess ART embryos for research. There are currently 117,000 ART embryos in storage, of which nearly 6,000 had been declared excess and donated to research. Of those, the NHMRC Embryo Research Licensing Committee had issued 10 licences authorising the use of up to 2,015 excess ART embryos for research, and, of those, only 443 embryos had been used by researchers. So it indicated that only around one-third of available embryos are being sought for use by researchers.
It is worth noting and putting on the record that there are actually plenty of surplus embryos available from ART processes for stem cell research. I thought that was an interesting fact. That then led to the proposal here that we actually do not need to set up a national register, because there are plenty of spare embryos. I thought that information was useful and it would have been nice to have had that information at the time of that debate, but that is a separate matter. I would encourage people to continue to follow the progress of this issue, because it is something that will continue to come up in public debate and, I am sure, will come before this chamber again in one shape or another some years down the track.

The incorporated speech read as follows—

Introduction

Tonight I want to talk about the very serious issue of homelessness in our society. And I am very proud to say that this is an issue that the Rudd Labor Government has already set about tackling head on following a decade of neglect by the former government.
I believe that access to safe and secure housing is one of our most basic human rights, and yet on any one given night 100,000 Australians are homeless. We believe this is unacceptable.
However, from meeting with local community groups with an interest in this issue, it has become absolutely apparent to me that homelessness is not just about housing. Homelessness fundamentally affects the lives of those individuals and families experiencing homelessness. They are denied many of the rights and privileges others take for granted; such as missing out on eduction and social security, being subjected to discrimination and unable to participate fully in the community.
One of the community groups I met with gave me a collection of pictures and quotes from children who had experienced homelessness called `No Place But Home’. The collection of stories from a child’s perspective really highlighted the fundamental way homeless effects a Childs life, from broken friendships, feeling unsafe and lost opportunities.
An 8 year old girl reflected that “you do not get to play with your friends when you move”
Many of the stories also talked about lost education opportunities. A 21 year old male was quoted as saying:
“From when I was homeless with my Mum till now I’ve never been at school. From when mum took me out of school when I was like 9—I’ve never been back”
The Rudd Labor Government has a comprehensive plan to address homelessness across Australia —I will outline some of these initiatives later.

Homelessness in the ACT

Although Canberra is commonly perceived by the rest of the nation as being a relatively affluent, this image masks the poverty that many individuals and families are experiencing here in Canberra.
This image of relative affluence leaves out the 120-315 people who sleep rough in Canberra on any given night and the recorded 5,300 Canberrans that experience homelessness every year. Of course, in reality even these concerning figures are grossly understated as the Census is unable to accurately count the homeless and many don’t seek the support of local services.
In 2005-2006 SAAP services in the ACT supported 1,950 clients with 1000 accompanying children, but many more homeless people and families were turned away from SAAP services as there were no available beds.
From discussions I have had will local crisis accommodation service providers and community groups it is clear that the sector is simply unable to accommodate the high levels of demand for crisis accommodation. Of particular concern in the ACT is the availability of crisis accommodation for indigenous people, families and women, as shown by high turn away rates from crisis accommodation services.

Housing Affordability

Closely linked to the problem of homelessness, is housing affordability.
In the ACT, the lack of housing affordability presents a particularly difficult problem to those facing homelessness, or trying to escape homelessness. Despite the efforts of the ACT Government through its Housing Affordability Strategy housing affordability remains a critical issue in the ACT. Canberra’s median house rents are the highest in Australia with 35.9% of ACT renters spending more than 50% of their income on rent in 2005-2006.
With 18% of homeless people reporting to ACT SAAP services that they had issues maintaining tenancy at their previous accommodation, the serious lack of affordable rental accommodation Canberra is clearly having an effect on individuals and families becoming homeless and those trying to re-enter the housing market.
The Rudd Labor Government has a number of plans to address the long term affordability of housing in Australia. The National Rental Affordability Scheme will create 50,000 new affordable rental properties by providing tax credits to build affordable homes. Also, a new National Affordable Housing Agreement will bring together community, public and crisis housing to create pathways for people to leave homelessness and get a home for the long term.

Why is This Problem Persistent?

While the rates of homelessness across Australia is very concerning, what is worse, is that it appears that homelessness in may be getting worse. Preliminary data collected from the 2006 Census suggests that there is an overall national increase in the number of people sleeping rough.
Rather than addressing the very serious and pressing issue of homeless, the former government cut funding from crisis accommodation services to the tune of cutting $3.1 billion in real funding to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. This disgraceful act forced the States and Territories to target the provision of social housing even more tightly to those in greatest need.
Nationally, ABS data shows that in 1995, 22 per cent of applicants for social housing were accommodated. Ten years later, only 14 per cent were able to move off waiting lists and into housing.
The previous government’s decade of neglect means that now the most disadvantaged Australians are waiting longer than ever just to get a roof over their heads.
We need a new approach that prevents homelessness, improves crisis services, helps people to get long term secure housing and stops the cycle of homelessness. This means Government, business, community and charitable groups – a whole of community effort.

Labor’s Plan

Unlike the previous government, we understand that homelessness is serious problem. It is serious for those who experience it and for the community as a whole. We also understand that this problem won’t just go away, and that it is the role of the Federal Government, in cooperation with the States, to have a plan to address homelessness in the ACT and across Australia.
We also understand that more can be done to reduce homelessness in Australia, and the Rudd Labor Government is committed to developing a comprehensive, long-term plan to tackle homelessness as a matter of national priority.
We will build on our $150 million election commitment to construct new homes for Australians in crisis accommodation by developing a White Paper on how Australia can systematically reduce homelessness over the next decade.
Given the urgency the Rudd Government attaches to reducing homelessness, the Prime Minister has directed that the White Paper be completed by August.
The Prime Minister has appointed Tony Nicholson, Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, to lead a Steering Committee of experts to oversee the process.
The paper released by the Government earlier this year `Homelessness: A New Approach ‘ recognises that the best responses to homelessness provide more than a bed. Providing an individual or family with comprehensive services including access to eduction, employment and counselling.
Already we have made specific commitments to tackle homelessness including:
Working with the States and Territories to build an additional 600 houses for homeless individuals and families over the next 5 years
Working with the states and territories to expand the reach of homeless services across the country, and
$2.8 million to expand cultural and sporting programs for homeless people providing essential life skills and social networks

Conclusion

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2008-03-20,"—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
Malignant brain tumours are notifiable by law to the state and territory cancer registries. Data on incidence and incidence rate trends for malignant brain tumours are published online by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (www.aihw.gov.au).
Non-malignant brain tumours are not notifiable by law. Therefore, reliable and comprehensive data on incidence and incidence rate trends on this kind of tumour are not readily available.
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Hospital Morbidity Database holds data on all admissions to hospitals in Australia, including surgery for brain tumours.
Outcome indicators of treatments such as mortality rates provide a proxy for treatment outcomes.
There are no clinical practice guidelines for the management of non-malignant and malignant brain tumours which are specifically developed or approved by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC).
However, there are Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Psychosocial Care of Adults with Cancer endorsed by the NHMRC in April 2003 which cover issues relating to cancer care generally.
Cancer Australia, the Australian government’s national cancer agency is managing or implementing a suite of initiatives aimed at improving outcomes for all cancer consumers, including those with malignant brain tumours.  These initiatives include: the development of educational resources for cancer professionals; the establishment of seven Cancer Service Networks (CanNET) across Australia which support a multi-disciplinary team based approach to best practice care; the establishment of a Cancer of the Central Nervous System National Reference Group involving specialists, researchers, allied health professionals and cancer consumers to help identify opportunities to improve cancer care and outcomes for people affected by these cancers; supporting the establishment of a new national Cooperative Trials Group for Neuro-Oncology; and implementing the new Boost Cancer Research measure from 2008-09 which will support research relating to cancer treatments generally.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Brain Tumours</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,38,1,answer
