"Reid, Bruce, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I present the committee's report entitled A sea of indifference—Australian industry participation in the North West Shelf project , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The North West Shelf is a large-scale gas extraction and processing project by world standards. In expenditure terms, it is the largest project ever undertaken in Australia, with the potential to provide significant opportunities for sustainable growth in Australian industry, particularly in terms of project management, design, fabrication, manufacture and installation.
There is a general consensus that oil and gas developments in the north-west will increase considerably in the coming decades. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics predicts that gas exports from Western Australia will reach 20 million tonnes per year by the year 2010, requiring significant expenditure for plant expansion. Such an increase would add $1.5 billion to $3 billion a year to Australia's export earnings.
However, the contribution major projects make directly to export earnings is only one part of the picture. It is the committee's view that major resource projects which exploit a non-renewable national resource should contribute to the economy in more ways than simply through direct revenues such as royalties and taxes. Ideally, projects should also play a large role in developing the capability and experience of Australian industry and the skills base of our people.
The committee has serious doubts about the way in which local content in this major project is currently measured. It does not adequately focus on the amount of value added in Australia, and it rarely involves an examination of what happens below the primary contract level. The figures on Australian industry participation levels come virtually exclusively from the developers. In calculating those figures, the developers first exclude from the calculation work which they decide Australian contractors would not be capable of carrying out. Australian participation is then measured as a proportion of what remains. This method would throw up quite different levels of actual participation, depending on what Australian contractors are deemed to be capable of providing.
The federal departments of Primary Industries and Energy, and Industry, Science and Tourism apparently accept developers' figures for local content without any independent examination. Without suggesting that the developers have inflated local content figures, it remains true that there is no adequate mechanism at present to provide independent verification. An important question is: to what extent do Australian firms who are successful tenderers procure the goods and services they require from domestic or overseas sources? In other words, to what extent is there leakage of Australian content below the primary contract level? DPIE and DIST had little to contribute to the inquiry on the question of leakage of local content or on possible improvements to the methodology for measuring local content.
Local content levels are often quoted in an aggregated form and, without further analysis, may be misleading. Ideally, local content data should give information about the nature of the contracts won by Australian industry. Such a breakdown would show local participation levels in the more specialised and skills intensive areas which are so important to the development of Australia's industrial and technological capability. Local content data should also allow analysis of possible lost opportunities—that is, areas where local firms have the ability to supply goods and services but do not win contracts.
The effectiveness of current policy and the desirability of alternative policy options cannot be evaluated properly without comprehensive information about contracts which have been let and the amount of value added in Australia in the performance of those contracts. For that information to have credibility, it should be collected in a transparent manner which eliminates any perception of bias or distortion.
The development through industry consultation of an agreed method of calculating local content should be a high priority. This should include an examination of leakage of Australian content below the primary contract level. The data should be reported by industry for analysis by DIST and Isonet.
The committee received evidence supporting the role played by the Oil and Gas Consultative Group on local content—a group established in 1990 to facilitate communication between the various players in the industry. The committee discovered that DIST had ceased to provide secretariat support to the group which, consequently, has had only one meeting since August 1994. This information was not volunteered by DIST but came to the committee's attention from other sources. DIST stated that the Oil and Gas Consultative Group was not an effective mechanism but could not indicate the use of any formal evaluation procedures in making this judgment.
The committee believes the re-establishment of such an informal information channel would be beneficial to all parties. The committee recommends that the Oil and Gas Consultative Group be reactivated and properly resourced by DIST with the minister as chairman.
There is broad agreement that, if Australian industry is to compete more readily with South-East Asia, a world-class waterfront engineering facility must be created. Modularisation is now the preferred method of constructing and delivering parts of platforms and plants for remote locations. The absence of such a facility has precluded local industry tendering for prefabricated modules.
The committee is pleased to note the recent announcement of a $200 million redevelop 
 ment at the Jervoise Bay-Henderson Industrial Estate on the eastern shores of Cockburn Sound near Perth. This development will be funded by the federal and Western Australian governments and the private sector.
In 1990, all state and federal industry ministers agreed to a policy on participation by domestic industry in major projects. This included a statement that local industry should be given full and fair opportunity by developers to participate in major projects. It was suggested to the committee that a number of project developers deliberately ignored the policy. Evidence was tendered to the committee that, where developers had pre-existing alliances with overseas firms, Australian industries were not given the opportunity to tender for work. The committee's report details the development of the Laminaria field in the Timor sea where this kind of alliance arrangement precluded any significant Australian industry involvement.
The committee recommends that there should be an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of whether alliances between developers and overseas firms for goods and services to be used in Australia have resulted in anticompetitive behaviour. The title of this report, A sea of indifference, reflects what the committee considers to be the attitude of the federal bureaucracy to the  significant opportunities for Australian participation in the sustainable growth which offshore gas and oil developments should provide to Australian industry.
We are told that the federal bureaucracy is characterised by inertia and lack of coordination. Indeed, both the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology should play a more active and significant role in promoting and fostering local industry content in major projects.
A primary responsibility of the federal government in relation to offshore gas and oil projects is the issue of exploration permits. Ten years ago, the primary criterion for issue of exploration permits was to maximise the assessment of petroleum potential in the permit area. Secondary criteria came into 
 effect if no applicant could be identified as superior when assessed against the primary criterion. These secondary criteria included the intent to source goods and services in Australia, the willingness of foreign companies to transfer skills and technology to Australians and the intention to undertake research and development in Australia.
DPIE informed the committee that the secondary criteria had not been used in the 10 years to 1996 and had since been dropped. It appears to the committee that, by never considering the secondary criteria for the grant of exploration permits, DPIE successfully avoided a broader commitment to Australia's national interest.
The committee believes that at the very least DPIE officers should promote the national content policy actively and early in discussions with explorers and developers. The committee has therefore recommended that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy direct his department to require those seeking exploration permits or production licenses to commit themselves to: maximise opportunities for local industry involvement, provide details of how this will be achieved, provide data which will allow analysis of value added in Australia, maximise the transfer of skills and technology to Australians and undertake research, development and design in Australia to the maximum extent possible.
In concluding, I would like to thank the members of the committee staff, Mr Paul McMahon and Ms Lexia Bain, and members of the committee. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Industry, Science and Technology Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Beddall, David, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I rise to speak on the tabling of the report entitled A sea of indifference  by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on the North West Shelf gas project. I had the honour of being the deputy chair of the committee in this parliament.
As we have heard, during the 37th parliament the committee commenced an inquiry into Australian industry participation in major projects. I was delighted to see that the committee decided to take a case study approach with the first project being the North West Shelf gas project. After the 1996 election, the committee sought re-referral of the 
 terms of reference so that the inquiry could be completed.
I have had a long association with this project, in particular as the chair of the committee back in 1989 and subsequently as resources minister in the Keating government. Back in 1989, I had the privilege of chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology which inquired into the North West Shelf and presented a report entitled A sea of lost opportunity. At that time, the construction of phase III was just beginning, that is, the Goodwin project. The committee reviewed back then local industry participation in both phases I and II and made recommendations to the then minister aimed at maximising opportunities for local industry development.
The North West Shelf gas project has been described as the biggest resource project ever undertaken in Australia. The estimated investment in the project is over $12 billion. For some time now, there has been a general view held that the resource development in the north west will expand considerably in the coming decades. This is good news for the local and Australian economies.
The committee found that significant factors affecting participation in the project by local industry included the technology changes in petroleum extraction, a trend towards alliances and the way in which the federal and state bureaucracy perform their roles within this important industry. ABARE predicts that gas exports in Western Australia alone will reach $20 million tonnes a year by the year 2010. This will provide somewhere between $1.5 and $3 billion a year to Australia's export earnings.
A number of companies have already queued for development off Western Australia over the next few years. This will mean a doubling of investment in Western Australia's oil and gas infrastructure. Companies like Woodside and Shell have begun a joint venture feasibility study involving their existing permits.
The committee has made a number of key recommendations which I wholeheartedly support. Like most government decisions, the committee believes there must be a clear 
 indication as to when the government intends to implement the committee's recommendations. In particular, recommendations like 3.4 will greatly assist the project. That recommendation states:
That the Committee recommends industry assistance programs be delivered by a single administrations unit within the relevant agency which would be responsible for consistency of approach within the agency.
This will be assisted, we hope, by the new agency, Invest Australia, being established by the Howard government.
Since the 1989 report, the committee has found a trend towards alliance arrangements. As a result, local firms have felt that they have not received fair access to tendering or that key contracts did not go to tender at all. The committee felt that there were sufficient grounds for an investigation to be held into the preference of petroleum developers to use overseas firms with whom they already have arrangements. The question is: does this fit into the government's policy of fair opportunities for Australia's suppliers to compete?
This is an important industry for Australia, and I am sure that all members of the House will look forward to the government's response to this report. I caution the government that there will be difficulties in getting the Public Service to accept some aspects. I can say from personal experience that many people in the department of primary industry think their role is only to assist exploration and not to make sure that Australian industry gets a reasonable go.
I thank all the people on the committee, and particularly the secretariat. This is an unusual report that has gone over two parliaments—from the 37th and into the 38th parliament. It is a great challenge for the government to come up with policies. As more and more gas and oil is discovered off the north of Australia, there is opportunity for a very significant Australian industry to be developed. If the government takes this report seriously, that opportunity can be realised. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Industry, Science and Technology Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Evans, Richard, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—This is a very significant report, because it is the follow-up of the 1989 report 
 that was spoken about by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall)—a report called The North West Shelf—A sea of lost Opportunities . This one is called A sea of Indifference , and everything in it relates to the title—the sea of indifference when it comes to people getting excited about the entire project.
First, I wish to extend an appropriate thank-you to the secretariat of the committee. Lexia Bain, for instance, has spent a lot of time writing this report, along with Paul McMahon. I also thank Frances Wilson for her assistance. It has been difficult to perform this task over the last two parliaments. Second, I think we should also thank Woodside for inviting the committee out on two occasions to their North Rankin set-up, which we found very significant in our understanding the whole project and what it meant. Third, I also express thanks to the previous committee in the last parliament, because they did put in a fair bit of effort.
As I said, this report limits itself, because in the past there has been an indifference to the North West Shelf. Not many in this place or in Australia would know much about Western Australia and the North West Shelf as a development. For those who do not know a great deal about Western Australia, I would like to list a couple of things that have happened with non-renewable resources in Western Australia. For instance, Western Australia has the biggest diamond mines in the world, producing 38 million carats of diamonds annually. Western Australia produces billions of dollars of iron ore exports every year. For instance, for the 1996-97 financial year, Western Australia exported $3.1 billion worth of iron ore, which is 99.9 per cent of Australia's total.
Western Australia is the fourth biggest producer of gold in the world. It exported $2.9 billion worth of gold last year, 62 per cent of Australia's total. We also have natural gas which amounted to $1.5 billion worth of exports, which is 100 per cent of the Australian total because we are the only place which has national gas at the moment. Western Australia is the biggest exporter of alumina powder in the world and is the fifth biggest 
 producer of nickel in the world. In Western Australia, ore minerals totalled 7.4 billion worth of exports, which is 32 per cent of the Australian export total.
What I am saying is that Western Australia in particular is where a lot of our major projects are happening. There is also anecdotal evidence that a lot of people come to Western Australia because the opportunities are great there, specifically for engineers. But they are coming from overseas; there are not many local people getting involved. At a party in the last 12 months I was talking to an American who worked for one of the major companies in Western Australia. He said, `It is great. We come in here. We pay little for the licences. We drill and take out all this stuff, and all we pay is a very minor royalty.' This report is confirming that—that there needs to be a greater benefit to the broader community of Australia than just royalties and licences. So in the report we are asking that the government, through its negotiation prowess or through other commitments, gets involved with the development of Australia through major projects, in particular in Western Australia and certainly with the North West Shelf, as our case study shows.
The chairman of the committee also talked about Jervoise Bay. We took a lot of evidence in Perth about Jervoise Bay, and I think that the announcement that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the state government made recently about Jervoise 	Bay was significant, because the union movement and most businesses over there are very supportive of the Jervoise Bay development. We took a lot of evidence of materials being sent in from overseas not being appropriate.
In conclusion, this is a very significant report. It requires the government to act by way of getting the public servants—or the bureaucracy, if you like—on line and attuned to these major projects. If we do not, we are going to lose significant benefit in Australia from handling major projects. We have a great future in Australia with our natural non-renewable resources. Unless we can tap in with our technology, with our people and with the broader community, it will be a lost opportunity. We cannot see the situation 
 represented in a report such as A Sea of Indifference continue. We need action, and I will be looking forward to the government's response to our report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Industry, Science and Technology Committee</title>",Committees,0,1,speech
"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—Like the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), I took part in the inquiry in 1989, during the previous parliament, as well as this one. At the outset, I express my appreciation to Paul McMahon and Lexia Bain from the secretariat. Lexia took over the inquiry only in this parliament, so she had to catch up on the previous hearings and so on.
I also want to make it clear that when the committee sought the renewal of the terms of reference from the current government the minister chose to limit those terms of reference. The current inquiry is actually much narrower than the one which was initiated previously. I particularly want to make that point, because the previous committee actually visited Port Hedland and talked to BHP about their hot briquetted iron project, which many of us saw as being a major project in terms of Australia's future development, of adding value to its resources and to its infrastructure. The revised terms of reference effectively excluded the continuation of that line of inquiry. Of course now we all understand that that particular project is probably the one that will destroy, if it has not done so far, BHP as we know it. Unfortunately, the committee could have been part of understanding what went wrong there and why and how, and it is quite tragic that that was excluded.
This whole issue of the exploitation of our resources, the building of infrastructure, how much of it there should be and how it impacts on Australia is one of the great longstanding issues this nation has had and will have way into the future. It may still have it long after the resources have gone and, quite frankly, many of us are worried that in years to come people will see this generation as having squandered the opportunities that were presented to us. The report expresses great alarm at what is not being done. Rather than thinking about what politicians are saying, I will quote a couple of aspects of the report. On page 34 of the report Richard Dowe, from the 
 Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association, says in relation to the federal government:
. . . no departments work with each other. If there is a cross-referencing, it is minimal. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy is not concerned with industry policy: It never has been.
Mr Geoff Suttie from the Western Australian Department of Resources Development says in terms of federal government involvement:
Where there is not a lot of activity . . . is in Canberra . . . There is virtually no activity that I am aware of at all: in fact, there is negative activity . . .
In other words, two extremely important people—one from the national body of companies that invest and have heavy engineering capacity and one a state bureaucrat—are saying that there is a real problem.
The report puts forward a number of recommendations to the government to try to encourage and urge, yet again, a more pro-active effect, but the fact is that it requires more ministerial commitment. We can say all we like, departmental staff can say all they like, but a government must be committed to action, and that is where this report is aimed. It is not aimed at the bureaucracy, it is aimed at the government and at the ministers of the day. These gaps in communication and liaison are fundamental. Dr Evan Jones from Sydney University, who has been a regular contributor to this inquiry and to others and has a vast knowledge of Australian industry involvement, says:
Constant vigilance and political toughness from all levels of government are thus in order down the track.
In other words, he is saying it is not good enough to have policies, it is not good enough to have reports; there has to be political toughness. Ministers have to be out there pushing the agenda because, quite frankly, the forces that are ranged against us are enormous. When one asks Shell, for example, as I have at times, `Who is your main competition for your North West Shelf gas?' the answer is `Shell Dubai.' Similarly, ask Rio Tinto where their main competition comes from and the answer is Rio Tinto Indonesia. In other words, these companies are located in a number of countries and they are compet 
 ing with each other. So the same company is using our resources in competition with Dubai's resources. These companies are much bigger than us, they are much bigger than most countries, and we are very small players with very large resources. We have to be particularly tough. We need good policies, great strength and pro-active government. The report simply starts the process. It is important the ministers take it on. (Time expired)

"Reid, Bruce, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I present the committee's report entitled A sea of indifference—Australian industry participation in the North West Shelf project , together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—The North West Shelf is a large-scale gas extraction and processing project by world standards. In expenditure terms, it is the largest project ever undertaken in Australia, with the potential to provide significant opportunities for sustainable growth in Australian industry, particularly in terms of project management, design, fabrication, manufacture and installation.
There is a general consensus that oil and gas developments in the north-west will increase considerably in the coming decades. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics predicts that gas exports from Western Australia will reach 20 million tonnes per year by the year 2010, requiring significant expenditure for plant expansion. Such an increase would add $1.5 billion to $3 billion a year to Australia's export earnings.
However, the contribution major projects make directly to export earnings is only one part of the picture. It is the committee's view that major resource projects which exploit a non-renewable national resource should contribute to the economy in more ways than simply through direct revenues such as royalties and taxes. Ideally, projects should also play a large role in developing the capability and experience of Australian industry and the skills base of our people.

An important question is: to what extent do Australian firms who are successful tenderers procure the goods and services they require from domestic or overseas sources? In other words, to what extent is there leakage of Australian content below the primary contract level? DPIE and DIST had little to contribute to the inquiry on the question of leakage of local content or on possible improvements to the methodology for measuring local content.
Local content levels are often quoted in an aggregated form and, without further analysis, may be misleading. Ideally, local content data should give information about the nature of the contracts won by Australian industry. Such a breakdown would show local participation levels in the more specialised and skills intensive areas which are so important to the development of Australia's industrial and technological capability. Local content data should also allow analysis of possible lost opportunities—that is, areas where local firms have the ability to supply goods and services but do not win contracts.

The development through industry consultation of an agreed method of calculating local content should be a high priority. This should include an examination of leakage of Australian content below the primary contract level. The data should be reported by industry for analysis by DIST and Isonet.
The committee received evidence supporting the role played by the Oil and Gas Consultative Group on local content—a group established in 1990 to facilitate communication between the various players in the industry. The committee discovered that DIST had ceased to provide secretariat support to the group which, consequently, has had only one meeting since August 1994. This information was not volunteered by DIST but came to the committee's attention from other sources.

Modularisation is now the preferred method of constructing and delivering parts of platforms and plants for remote locations. The absence of such a facility has precluded local industry tendering for prefabricated modules.
The committee is pleased to note the recent announcement of a $200 million redevelop 
 ment at the Jervoise Bay-Henderson Industrial Estate on the eastern shores of Cockburn Sound near Perth. This development will be funded by the federal and Western Australian governments and the private sector.
In 1990, all state and federal industry ministers agreed to a policy on participation by domestic industry in major projects. This included a statement that local industry should be given full and fair opportunity by developers to participate in major projects. It was suggested to the committee that a number of project developers deliberately ignored the policy. Evidence was tendered to the committee that, where developers had pre-existing alliances with overseas firms, Australian industries were not given the opportunity to tender for work. The committee's report details the development of the Laminaria field in the Timor sea where this kind of alliance arrangement precluded any significant Australian industry involvement.
The committee recommends that there should be an investigation by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission of whether alliances between developers and overseas firms for goods and services to be used in Australia have resulted in anticompetitive behaviour. The title of this report, A sea of indifference, reflects what the committee considers to be the attitude of the federal bureaucracy to the  significant opportunities for Australian participation in the sustainable growth which offshore gas and oil developments should provide to Australian industry.
We are told that the federal bureaucracy is characterised by inertia and lack of coordination. Indeed, both the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology should play a more active and significant role in promoting and fostering local industry content in major projects.
A primary responsibility of the federal government in relation to offshore gas and oil projects is the issue of exploration permits. Ten years ago, the primary criterion for issue of exploration permits was to maximise the assessment of petroleum potential in the permit area. Secondary criteria came into 
 effect if no applicant could be identified as superior when assessed against the primary criterion. These secondary criteria included the intent to source goods and services in Australia, the willingness of foreign companies to transfer skills and technology to Australians and the intention to undertake research and development in Australia.
DPIE informed the committee that the secondary criteria had not been used in the 10 years to 1996 and had since been dropped. It appears to the committee that, by never considering the secondary criteria for the grant of exploration permits, DPIE successfully avoided a broader commitment to Australia's national interest.
The committee believes that at the very least DPIE officers should promote the national content policy actively and early in discussions with explorers and developers. The committee has therefore recommended that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy direct his department to require those seeking exploration permits or production licenses to commit themselves to: maximise opportunities for local industry involvement, provide details of how this will be achieved, provide data which will allow analysis of value added in Australia, maximise the transfer of skills and technology to Australians and undertake research, development and design in Australia to the maximum extent possible.

That the Committee recommends industry assistance programs be delivered by a single administrations unit within the relevant agency which would be responsible for consistency of approach within the agency.
This will be assisted, we hope, by the new agency, Invest Australia, being established by the Howard government.
Since the 1989 report, the committee has found a trend towards alliance arrangements. As a result, local firms have felt that they have not received fair access to tendering or that key contracts did not go to tender at all. The committee felt that there were sufficient grounds for an investigation to be held into the preference of petroleum developers to use overseas firms with whom they already have arrangements. The question is: does this fit into the government's policy of fair opportunities for Australia's suppliers to compete?
This is an important industry for Australia, and I am sure that all members of the House will look forward to the government's response to this report. I caution the government that there will be difficulties in getting the Public Service to accept some aspects. I can say from personal experience that many people in the department of primary industry think their role is only to assist exploration and not to make sure that Australian industry gets a reasonable go.

Third, I also express thanks to the previous committee in the last parliament, because they did put in a fair bit of effort.
As I said, this report limits itself, because in the past there has been an indifference to the North West Shelf. Not many in this place or in Australia would know much about Western Australia and the North West Shelf as a development. For those who do not know a great deal about Western Australia, I would like to list a couple of things that have happened with non-renewable resources in Western Australia. For instance, Western Australia has the biggest diamond mines in the world, producing 38 million carats of diamonds annually. Western Australia produces billions of dollars of iron ore exports every year. For instance, for the 1996-97 financial year, Western Australia exported $3.1 billion worth of iron ore, which is 99.9 per cent of Australia's total.
Western Australia is the fourth biggest producer of gold in the world. It exported $2.9 billion worth of gold last year, 62 per cent of Australia's total. We also have natural gas which amounted to $1.5 billion worth of exports, which is 100 per cent of the Australian total because we are the only place which has national gas at the moment. Western Australia is the biggest exporter of alumina powder in the world and is the fifth biggest 
 producer of nickel in the world. In Western Australia, ore minerals totalled 7.4 billion worth of exports, which is 32 per cent of the Australian export total.
What I am saying is that Western Australia in particular is where a lot of our major projects are happening. There is also anecdotal evidence that a lot of people come to Western Australia because the opportunities are great there, specifically for engineers. But they are coming from overseas; there are not many local people getting involved. At a party in the last 12 months I was talking to an American who worked for one of the major companies in Western Australia. He said, `It is great. We come in here. We pay little for the licences. We drill and take out all this stuff, and all we pay is a very minor royalty.' This report is confirming that—that there needs to be a greater benefit to the broader community of Australia than just royalties and licences. So in the report we are asking that the government, through its negotiation prowess or through other commitments, gets involved with the development of Australia through major projects, in particular in Western Australia and certainly with the North West Shelf, as our case study shows.
The chairman of the committee also talked about Jervoise Bay. We took a lot of evidence in Perth about Jervoise Bay, and I think that the announcement that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the state government made recently about Jervoise 	Bay was significant, because the union movement and most businesses over there are very supportive of the Jervoise Bay development. We took a lot of evidence of materials being sent in from overseas not being appropriate.
In conclusion, this is a very significant report. It requires the government to act by way of getting the public servants—or the bureaucracy, if you like—on line and attuned to these major projects. If we do not, we are going to lose significant benefit in Australia from handling major projects. We have a great future in Australia with our natural non-renewable resources. Unless we can tap in with our technology, with our people and with the broader community, it will be a lost opportunity. We cannot see the situation 
 represented in a report such as A Sea of Indifference continue. We need action, and I will be looking forward to the government's response to our report.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,0,2,speech
"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—Like the member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), I took part in the inquiry in 1989, during the previous parliament, as well as this one. At the outset, I express my appreciation to Paul McMahon and Lexia Bain from the secretariat. Lexia took over the inquiry only in this parliament, so she had to catch up on the previous hearings and so on.
I also want to make it clear that when the committee sought the renewal of the terms of reference from the current government the minister chose to limit those terms of reference. The current inquiry is actually much narrower than the one which was initiated previously. I particularly want to make that point, because the previous committee actually visited Port Hedland and talked to BHP about their hot briquetted iron project, which many of us saw as being a major project in terms of Australia's future development, of adding value to its resources and to its infrastructure. The revised terms of reference effectively excluded the continuation of that line of inquiry. Of course now we all understand that that particular project is probably the one that will destroy, if it has not done so far, BHP as we know it. Unfortunately, the committee could have been part of understanding what went wrong there and why and how, and it is quite tragic that that was excluded.
This whole issue of the exploitation of our resources, the building of infrastructure, how much of it there should be and how it impacts on Australia is one of the great longstanding issues this nation has had and will have way into the future. It may still have it long after the resources have gone and, quite frankly, many of us are worried that in years to come people will see this generation as having squandered the opportunities that were presented to us. The report expresses great alarm at what is not being done. Rather than thinking about what politicians are saying, I will quote a couple of aspects of the report. On page 34 of the report Richard Dowe, from the 
 Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association, says in relation to the federal government:
. . . no departments work with each other. If there is a cross-referencing, it is minimal. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy is not concerned with industry policy: It never has been.
Mr Geoff Suttie from the Western Australian Department of Resources Development says in terms of federal government involvement:
Where there is not a lot of activity . . . is in Canberra . . . There is virtually no activity that I am aware of at all: in fact, there is negative activity . . .
In other words, two extremely important people—one from the national body of companies that invest and have heavy engineering capacity and one a state bureaucrat—are saying that there is a real problem.
The report puts forward a number of recommendations to the government to try to encourage and urge, yet again, a more pro-active effect, but the fact is that it requires more ministerial commitment. We can say all we like, departmental staff can say all they like, but a government must be committed to action, and that is where this report is aimed. It is not aimed at the bureaucracy, it is aimed at the government and at the ministers of the day. These gaps in communication and liaison are fundamental. Dr Evan Jones from Sydney University, who has been a regular contributor to this inquiry and to others and has a vast knowledge of Australian industry involvement, says:
Constant vigilance and political toughness from all levels of government are thus in order down the track.
In other words, he is saying it is not good enough to have policies, it is not good enough to have reports; there has to be political toughness. Ministers have to be out there pushing the agenda because, quite frankly, the forces that are ranged against us are enormous. When one asks Shell, for example, as I have at times, `Who is your main competition for your North West Shelf gas?' the answer is `Shell Dubai.' Similarly, ask Rio Tinto where their main competition comes from and the answer is Rio Tinto Indonesia. In other words, these companies are located in a number of countries and they are compet 
 ing with each other. So the same company is using our resources in competition with Dubai's resources. These companies are much bigger than us, they are much bigger than most countries, and we are very small players with very large resources. We have to be particularly tough. We need good policies, great strength and pro-active government. The report simply starts the process. It is important the ministers take it on. (Time expired)

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The motion before us today calls in part for the House to condemn the practice of child labour. On behalf of the 250 million children between the ages of five and 14 working in developing countries, I believe the House should do so. Of those 250 million children, 120 million are in full-time employment, 130 are in part-time employment; 61 per cent or nearly 150 million are in Asia, 80 million are in Africa and 17½ million are in Latin Ameri 
 ca. Unfortunately, child labour also exists in many industrialised countries and is emerging in eastern European and Asian countries which are in transition to a market economy. Studies on outworkers in the garment trade in Australia indicate that children of some of those outworkers are well and truly involved in that work. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states:
. . . the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from  performing any work that is likely to be hazardous, or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, spiritual, moral or social development.
That is the type of child labour that we should concentrate on in debating this question.
The motion before us also goes on to call on governments to do all in their power to outlaw child labour and calls on governments and the private sector to boycott products of child labour. Over the last four years, I have had the opportunity on a number of occasions to discuss and debate the question of child labour in this place. I must admit that early on I had the rather simplistic notion that social clauses in trade agreements or trade boycotts might simply be the answer. But the more I study, the more I understand that this is a very complex question and that, when we put up proposals, we have to put them in context.
In the United States there was the Harkin bill, the child labour deterrence bill. The experience post the Harkin bill in a country like Bangladesh was that some 50,000 children were forced out of predominantly the rag trade. What happened, in the absence of any alternatives, was that they were forced out onto the streets. Some of them took up things like prostitution but certainly we did not get, simply because of the Harkin bill, the type of outcome that perhaps that piece of legislation was designed to achieve.
If we are to become signatories to important international agreements—and I note that Australia is still to become a signatory to ILO Convention 138 on the minimum age for admission to employment, and I hope that at some stage the government will see its way 
 clear, even if just for symbolic reasons, to enter into that agreement—we really need to do so to give the signals.
Also, if we are going to take the actions, I think there is merit in adopting a type of trade boycott, or a boycott through educating consumers. At the end of the day, if consumers want children to be educated and not forced into work for economic reasons—and, therefore, to be replaced by adult workers—they may have to pay higher costs for articles. They have to understand in that context that they are doing that for a positive reason.
If we are going to have schemes such as the Rugmark Foundation scheme, where rugs are certified as not being produced by child labour, an element of that scheme should be that children displaced from work should be encouraged into education. Secondly, such programs ought to be undertaken in conjunction with the many aid agencies that work in those countries and amongst those people, because this measure will have detrimental economic effects on the families of those children. We must ensure that things are done with aid programs, NGOs and governments cooperating.
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mrs Sullivan) is at the table. I acknowledge her great commitment to the area in which she has policy responsibility—aid issues. I hope that she is able to continue a determined fight to increase funding for aid in  totality, but also to ensure that we are involved in the types of schemes that are put forward by the ILO through IPEC and other such schemes. The aim of those schemes is to reduce child labour, but to reduce it in a way that does not overly affect the economic situation of the families of those children, and which also gives the children opportunities to go into education and to be trained for other careers.

"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—I rise today to condemn the practice of child labour and endorse the call from the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) for all governments around the world to do all in their power to outlaw child labour. Children are our most precious resource—and, indeed, they are any country's most precious resource. They are 
 our future and they deserve to be cared for, nurtured and given every opportunity to achieve their very best. This is a premise which we take for granted. It is something on which there is universal agreement in the Western world.
Here in Australia, we have education requirements and industrial relations laws which ensure that children have the benefit of substantial education and that, when they do enter the work force, they are protected by workplace health and safety regulations. That is something which, once again, we rightly expect. May I take this opportunity to reaffirm the Howard government's unshaken commitment to providing even better education and even more work opportunities for young Australians. Improving literacy standards and increasing overall education funding is the hallmark of our approach.
However, sadly, around the world there are children working whose wages and workplaces could not be described as fair by any stretch of the imagination. The governments of the nations which have widespread child labour very often have little or no commitment to education. In areas where child labour is prevalent, often there are no schools at all. We all recognise that poverty is at the heart of child labour. The Director of the International Child Labour Study Office at the US Department of Labour, Sonia Rosen, told the Congressional Human Rights Caucus forum on the international exploitation of children:
The most common explanation given for persistence of child labour in all parts of the world is poverty. As segments of the population get poorer, children are often compelled, or required, to work in order to contribute to their family income. Although poverty may be one determinant for whether a child works, it does not end the life of poverty for a family. Indeed, it may only perpetuate the cycle—children do not complete their education, nor are they taught skills which enable them to leave an industry for higher-wage occupations. The vicious cycle continues to trap poor working children.
Even worse than the fact that very young children have to work is the conditions under which they have to work. As Sonia Rosen said:
Some of the abuses inflicted on children in the workplace are truly horrible. For example, children 
 work in unventilated glass factories where furnaces reach 1400-1600 degrees Celsius, as we found in India. In Indonesia, boys aged 10-18 work on fishing platforms off the coast of Sumatra, where they are held as virtual prisoners for up to three months at a time. In many countries, young girls are sold into prostitution, often trafficked long distances. This is simply intolerable.
I am sure that every member of this House would agree that the conditions they live under are insidious and barbaric. We need to encourage the nations which allow child labour to take positive steps to address the root causes and to assist families which feel compelled for financial reasons to send their children to work.
As a mother of eight, I wholeheartedly condemn the practice of child labour. Children everywhere deserve the very best possible start and, beyond any doubt, this should include the opportunity to be educated. I would agree with the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) that Australians have joined the rest of the world in being far more preoccupied with the soap opera antics of the royal family and the US President than with the injustices done to children who are underfed and are the victims of slave labour.
As a country and as a government, we need to show that we care about the needs and wellbeing of children, regardless of what country they are born in. We need to become more involved, and to share our skills and knowledge to encourage countries in poverty to break the cycle. This does not necessarily mean sending more money their way. Supplying resources, manpower, education and tools would greatly improve the chances for the 100 million children between the ages of six and 11 in poverty-stricken countries to be educated, and thus to increase their chances, through education, to break the poverty cycle.
I commend the mover of this motion, the member for Dickson, and I join both sides of this House in strongly supporting this motion. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate each and every Australian who gives of their time overseas, and the Australians at home who are supporting and sponsoring education for children in impoverished countries.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I was honoured to be asked to officially open the Mount Druitt-Blacktown Learning Difficulties 
 Support Group's annual conference last Saturday. This group provides information, advice and assistance to parents who have children with various forms of learning difficulties and attention disorders. The conference attracted over 100 parents and teachers and was a great credit to Mrs Terry Driscull and her marvellous band of committee members.
The conference was addressed by such authorities on the subject as Dr Paul Tait, consultant paediatrician; Val Badham, Director of SPELD, lecturer at Sydney University and co-author of the Jacaranda maths books; Ilona Bruveiis, Special Education Officer of the Department of Education; Brenda Inglis Powell, co-author of Raising Difficult Children; and Jenny Ruge, lecturer in special education at the University of Western Sydney, to name a few of the contributors to this important conference.
The Mount Druitt-Blacktown Learning Difficulties Support Group receives valuable assistance from the Blacktown City Council and financial support from the New South Wales government. Unfortunately, the federal government has not yet recognised the need to support this group, despite my submissions. I am sure the conference widened the awareness of the parents and teachers in attendance and will contribute, with the assistance of the Mount Druitt-Blacktown Learning Difficulties Support Group, to making a major contribution towards ultimately alleviating the problems this group experiences.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Mount Druitt-Blacktown Learning Difficulties Support Group</title>,Statements by Members,2,1,speech

Does the Prime Minister recall saying last week that he defended `every action taken by the member for Higgins, when he was shadow Treasurer, to expand employee share ownership'? Does the Prime Minister defend the `root and branch opposition', led by the then shadow Treasurer, against Labor's 1995 crackdown on abuses of the employees' share plans? Is the Prime Minister aware that Senator Parer utilised an employee share ownership scheme, set up through QCMM, that enabled him and five other executives to strip $1 million out of the company for a $10 outlay? Is he aware that no worker who actually digs coal out of the ground, loads it on to trucks and ships it out to markets was allowed to benefit from this amazing employee share ownership scheme? How can you defend that rip-off?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—My recollection is that, at all times since he has been a member of parliament, the member for Higgins has fought for the rights of people who want to participate fully in employee share ownership schemes—and he will continue to do so. It is a very proud boast of my government that we have done more in two years to expand the opportunities of employees to buy shares in the companies that employ them than you did in over 13 years. In the context of another matter that is very much in the news at the present time, I would remind those opposite that the generosity of the employee share ownership scheme in relation to the sale of 
 one-third of Telstra was absolutely unprecedented.
—On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the question was highly specific to a share ownership scheme that allowed Senator Parer to take $1 million for ten bucks.
—The Prime Minister's answer is in order. The Prime Minister has answered entirely within the context of the question.
Mr Crean interjecting—
—The honourable member for Hotham!
—The Leader of the Opposition asked me about a statement I made in support of what the Treasurer had said. I am more than happy to remind the parliament that the Treasurer, along with the minister for finance and the minister for communications, was one of the architects of the legislation that led to the sale of one-third of Telstra. It was because of the influence of many of us, who believed that—
Mr Crean interjecting—
—I warn the honourable member for Hotham!
—the battlers of Australia ought to be able to own shares in the companies that employ them. I know it sticks in the craw of the Labor Party that 92 per cent of people who work for Telstra bought shares in the company. They bought shares in the company because they believe in employee share ownership. I will tell you what: when the Australian people have the opportunity to buy the remaining two-thirds of Telstra, I can assure you that you will get killed in the rush of employees who will want to buy shares in that company. I predict now that, instead of it being 92 per cent, it will be closer to 95 or 96 per cent. You may think that they are indifferent to it, but when the opportunity arises I am sure that the men and women of Australia who are employed by Telstra will welcome with open arms the opportunity to buy shares in the company that employs them.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Minister for Resources and Energy</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer

Does the Treasurer concede that, when this cost is extrapolated across the entire finance industry, it translates into a hefty imposition on financial institutions, financial intermediaries, superannuation funds and other fund managers?

Will this discourage domestic and overseas investment in Australia?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Superannuation</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Costello, Peter, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—I thank the honourable member for Curtin for his question. I say to him: I am not aware that the AMP has estimated that compliance with those particular proposals would cost in the vicinity of $50 
 million, but I take his word that that may well have been the case. What the honourable member refers to is a discussion paper which was put out in December 1996 on the taxation of financial arrangements, or TOFA. That discussion paper was put out by officials and released for public comment. A number of submissions have been received on it since its release. These are currently being evaluated by officials of the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury. The government will consider the future of those proposals after we have considered the feedback.
In relation to the broader question of the taxation of financial services and financial intermediaries, I would point out to the honourable member that this government has been very active in getting down the costs associated with compliance of the taxation system and very active in encouraging new financial products and a reduced cost of funds. I think the proof of that is seen in the fact that not only mortgage rates and business rates are historically low but also margins are historically low.
Let me go on from that and say that I think it is very important, as Australia looks out into its region and sees a great deal of instability in it, that Australia be now seen as a site which is stable, well-regulated and, with the Wallis reforms, engaging world's best practice in relation to financial regulation. The last piece of the jigsaw that we need to put in place to make Australia a major financial centre is tax reform. If we put that piece of the jigsaw in place, we can make Australia, after Tokyo, the financial centre of the Asia-Pacific region.

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—I want to add to an answer that I gave to the Leader of the Opposition to a question he asked me about guarantees. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, amongst the special measures that will apply for regional users, the ones that have been introduced by the government will continue to apply. For example, local call prices in regional areas may not exceed the revenue weighted average local call price in the major capital cities, and the most remote 17,000 Telstra customers now receive a rebate on their pastoral call spending of up to $160 a year as a means of giving them a benefit equivalent to being able to make untimed local calls to essential services.
They are part of a very extensive number of guarantees which are well known to those in this parliament who represent rural and regional areas. They will of course be entrenched in the community service obligations to be contained in the legislation to be introduced this week by the government.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 notes that the current dispute between Patrick's Stevedoring Company and the Maritime Union of Australia is not in the national interest; and
(2)	 calls upon the Government to urgently bring together all the players on the Australian waterfront, namely exporters and importers, stevedoring companies, the Maritime Union of Australia, the shipping companies and the port authorities to constructively and collaboratively recommend actions required to achieve world's best practice.
The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) ought to be soundly condemned for his disgraceful and outrageous actions in promoting a strategy of confrontation, misinformation and fabrication about the situation on the Australian waterfront—not for reasons of productivity or efficiency, but simply as a distraction to the main issues leading up to the next election. What confirms this destructive strategy is none other than the minister's fabricated comments on the port of Adelaide when he made a complete idiot of himself.
The port of Adelaide is the most efficient in Australia. It is a very good story, and the relationship between Sealand and the Maritime Union of Australia is harmonious, productive and constructive. It is built on trust and goodwill. What the port of Adelaide did not do, however, was fit into the minister's fabricated comments. The minister could have used, if he was genuine, the port of Adelaide as an example for others: crane rates in September 1993 were 19.8, crane rates in September 1996 were 22.7 and the latest crane rates are 24.8. I think that is about efficiency and productivity.
But that did not fit the strategy and so, on a visit to South Australia to prop up his skittish backbench, he launched himself into a lather and furiously fabricated a nonsense about the port of Adelaide. Mr Reith was outraged. How dare Captain Andy Andrews 
 from Sealand—someone who actually knows a few things about the waterfront, unlike that merchant banker from Patrick's, Chris Corrigan—not only refuse to be a lap-dog for the minister but also have the gall to correctly refute outright the claims made by the minister. When the Adelaide media followed up the minister's comments and checked their authenticity, they soon realised they were a total fabrication—a total beat-up—and killed the story stone dead.
It is not generally appreciated by the general community that, unlike the rest of the Australian workplace, the Australian waterfront operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The government, which should play a conciliatory problem-solving role, decides instead to be involved in the disinformation campaign to destabilise the Australian waterfront. For example, take the misrepresented comparisons trumpeted out by the minister comparing port productivity and efficiencies with the huge hub ports of the world, such as Antwerp, Rotterdam, Singapore and Hong Kong. In the main, Australian ports are regional ports, they are not hub ports, and where comparisons are made at least apples ought to be compared to apples.
Let me give an example of why those container rates per hour can vary so greatly. If a ship with 3,000 containers calls into Singapore and all the containers are unloaded conveniently to a wharf space and transport mode alongside, obviously you will get an optimum rate of containers per hour. Contrast that situation with what so often happens in Australian ports. If a ship wishes to unload not thousands but hundreds—maybe only 100 or 300 containers—which is a very common occurrence in Australian ports, such an optimum rate as gained in the Singapore example simply is not possible.
That is further complicated by the following situation oft repeated in ports all over Australia: a ship calls into a regional port to off-load 100 containers but, because of stowage provisions and the number of slots available, you have to get 200 off the ship in order to get to the 100 and another 100 have to be returned. However, these and many other factors are totally ignored by a minister for 
 whom misrepresenting has become commonplace for him.
Further productivity and efficiency on the Australian waterfront should be a major goal, and I have no problem with that whatsoever. It seems that this government and this minister clearly want to take this country back to the ugly times of the mid-1950s that I remember as a child when many wharf labourers and their families lived on rations for month after month.
—You're too young to remember that.
—Yes, I can remember 1954 and 1956. I can remember very clearly deliberate confrontation, deliberate provocation, deliberate peddling of misinformation, deliberate inflammation of disputes and deliberate untruths.
There are a number of players on the Australian waterfront: the exporters and importers, the shipping companies, the stevedoring companies, the Maritime Union of Australia, the port authorities and the government. Instead of playing a constructive role, this government has become an agent provocateur. As the federal member for Port Adelaide, I do receive complaints concerning the Australian waterfront, but in 10 years I have never received one complaint about the waterside worker. The complaints generally come from exporters and importers. What do they complain about? They complain about the Australian quarantine system not being available at appropriate hours, they complain about warehousing and available hours, but they say their biggest complaint is about transport facilities—or, more accurately, the lack of them.
In Port Adelaide, we need a further river crossing—an opening bridge for road and rail—that, if delivered by the state government, which is responsible, would give the city of Adelaide the best transport hub in Australia and one of the best in the world. That is when productivities and efficiencies would improve, particularly if available information technology were also introduced.
The government's agenda and its complainants are well known, and they have nothing 
 whatsoever to do with productivity or efficiency. The agenda and the complainants are the following: they are the union busters; they are the proponents of the casualisation of labour; they are the proponents of eroding workers' conditions; they are the proponents of no sick leave for workers; they are the proponents of no holiday leave for workers; they are the proponents of reducing the benefits of occupational health and safety; they are the proponents of reducing workers compensation for death and injury in the workplace; they are the proponents of having workers work more for less remuneration.
A lot has been said by the minister about the remuneration of wharf labourers. In Port Adelaide, you work 15 weeks on, one week off, but you need to be available 24 hours a day. You are involved in a whole multitude of often very dangerous activities. I always thought high wages were part of a strong economy, a strong work force with high skills, and I thought that that was something we ought to be aiming for, not reducing—
—Not if you're blue collar, according to them.
—I thank the member for Throsby. The proponents think that the only things worth pursuing are the personal rewards of a chief executive officer and to hell with the people who actually do the work. You can see similar instances of it with teachers, nurses and perhaps even the policemen on the beat.
Reforms have been achieved on the Australian waterfront, and Labor was at the forefront of those reforms in the late eighties and early nineties. This was because the Labor government, in stark contrast with the Howard government, actually worked towards solutions in the national interest and did not use the waterfront as a convenient dispute leading up to an election. Ship turnaround times have halved. Rates of container lifting increased dramatically. I simply point to the earlier figures I gave for Port Adelaide. Certainly there was a significant cost to those operations of over $400 million, but they created benefits of more than $200 million a year to the Australian economy. The key point I make is that under a Labor government these 
 changes were implemented without any industrial action by the Maritime Union.
Labor also reformed port authorities and achieved new investment by stevedoring companies. Productivity gains have been achieved, and I acknowledge further improvements can also be achieved. However, the Howard government's approach is deliberately divisive and will cost business dearly in the long run and, in all probability, will not succeed.
The government, mainly through this minister, has used an approach that abuses waterfront workers, fabricates false comparisons on productivity and wages, gets involved in crackpot schemes like the Dubai mercenary exercise and spends money on its mates for those very doubtful consultancies on waterfront reform. What an appalling indictment of the government. Given the choice of constructive engagement or intimidation, it chooses the latter. History will record very accurately the folly of this government and its supporters on the Australian waterfront and the role of the destructive elements within the government.
I find it terribly ironic that one of the ports continually used by the minister as a comparison, Antwerp—which, incidentally, I visited last year—has a totally unionised work force and has not had a strike for 30 years. Instead of simply comparing the container rates per hour, the government could have examined how and why that was achieved in Antwerp. I can tell you very simply, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it was cooperation, not confrontation. It was sitting down at the table in calm negotiation, not deliberate inflammation of disagreement. It was respect for all the players on the waterfront—all the players, not deliberate abuse of one section. This demands, of course, that the government possess the necessary intellectual skill and rigour and the intelligence to apply that skill and rigour. Unfortunately, that framework is beyond the capabilities of this government and, in particular, the minister for workplace relations. This dispute on the waterfront is a deliberately manufactured one. (Time expired)

"Cobb, Michael, MP",NP,1998-03-30,"—The wording of this motion on the waterfront is indeed strange in its ambiguity. In the first section it says it is not in the national interest to have a current dispute between Patrick's and the MUA. It seems to me there is only one side that is causing that dispute, and that is the Maritime Union of Australia.
—Patrick's.
—The other side interjects `Patrick's'. How is Patrick's causing a dispute? It is in Patrick's interests to be out there working to get things rolling, and that is exactly what they are trying to do. Everybody in this country knows that the only reason we are having disputes in this country at the moment is that Patrick's has leased spare space at Webb Dock to the National Farmers Federation to set up a new interest. That is the only reason.
John Coombs is out there trying to destroy Patrick's, doing everything within his bailiwick to sool his members onto Patrick's and to cripple them financially. He may be successful one day, but if Patricks closes down perhaps the situation will be reopened with a greenfield site and a non-unionised work force. So Coombs may cut off his nose to spite his face if he pursues that action.
The second part of the motion says that the opposition want to recommend actions required to achieve world best practice. The previous government were in government for 13 years and what did they do? At the end of the 13 years we still have world's worst practice on the Australian waterfront. The previous government had 13 years to do it. Presumably they were going to do it in the 14th year. Other governments in this country, stevedores and others have been trying for a hundred years to improve things on the waterfront and nothing has happened.
We have had a shocking situation on the waterfront in this country for that time. The stories are legend, including those about what used to happen in World War II when strikes took place holding up vital material destined for Australian troops overseas. If we just go 
 back over the last 13 years, the previous government spent $420 million trying to tidy up the situation, paying out excess labour, and at the end of it all we are still running last in the world. That is the fact of the matter: we are running last in the world. TEUs, 20-foot containers, are moving 17 and 18 boxes an hour—the Australian average across our waterfront—when the rest of the world is doing at least 25 or 30.
 How can we in this country hold up our heads when countries like Thailand and the Philippines and our neighbours next door, New Zealand, let alone Mozambique, achieve 25 to 30 containers an hour and our average is 17 to 18? It is an incredible situation. To take a sporting analogy, it is a bit like the world's best athletes running a mile in three minutes and 45 seconds while in Australia the best runner is doing six minutes and 30 seconds. It is unbelievable. If that were happening it would be a cause for national shame. People would be having conferences and saying, `What can we do about this? Let's correct the situation.' Can you imagine, in the year 2000, the Australian runner in the 1,500 metres being lapped not once but twice? That is what is happening on our waterfront today.
—Rubbish!
—It is! If, according to official statistics, we are moving 17 and 18 boxes an hour and the rest of the world is moving from 25 to 30, we are being lapped twice. How can people like John Coombs head up the union movement on the waterfront in this country when other union leaders in other industries have got their act together to a far greater degree than he?
The union uses the most incredible excuses. We have all received in our offices a folder with a personal letter from John Coombs. It includes a question and answer sheet saying that the reason for the situation is that the equipment is 20 years out of date—20 years out of date! P&O and Patrick's have, I think, spent $400 million upgrading the equipment in the last five years. I can guarantee that our equipment is as good as, if not better than, the equipment in Mozambique, the port of Auckland or other comparable docks around 
 the world, yet we are running the mile in six minutes and 30 seconds! That is the fact of the matter.
It is not as though waterfront workers have to have miraculous equipment these days. The equipment is pretty standard around the world. It is not as though one company or one country has to have some whizzbang equipment. Australia's equipment is the equivalent of that of Mozambique and New Zealand, and we are still running behind. That is the fact of the matter. They also go on to say in this brochure:
Q. Why does what's been happening at the Webb Dock matter?
A. It means non-unionised wharves and ships can become the norm.
That is the rub of it all. They are terrified that if workers are given a choice they will not all join the union.
—They have a choice now.
—They have a choice? We all know that the docks around Australia are 100 per cent unionised. All the NFF is doing with P&C Stevedores is starting up another company, just as a person can go out here in Canberra and start up another fish and chip shop or a newsagency or whatever. Nobody goes off their brain about that. But the union on the waterfront is so terrified that they will lose their 100 per cent monopoly and they are so insecure—because they know they are running the mile in six minutes and 30 seconds and they cannot compete with the rest of the world, let alone with the others in Australia who want to have a go—that they pull on all these strikes and they try to cripple Patrick's.
One of the excuses they use in this document is to say that safety standards will slip. For heaven's sake, the worst safety record of any industry in Australia is on the waterfront now. We have a number of reports to show that. A recent report by Michael Easson, a Labor Party person, is absolutely damning about what is happening with occupational health and safety on the waterfront. He said that the Australian stevedoring industry:
. . . is performing very poorly compared to other major industries in Australia. 

The number of work related injuries and diseases per 1,000 employees in stevedoring in 1994-95 was 160.0 whereas the next highest figure among major industries was 64.3 for the mining industry. In the same year the all industries figure was 29.1.
I would have thought that by any commonsense standard the mining industry was far more dangerous than being on the waterfront. These days most of the time wharfies are sitting in airconditioned cabins and yet they have 170 per thousand employees compared with a rate in the mining industry of 64. I think that says it all. The reason for this is the work hiring practices. The stevedoring companies, which are not blameless, cannot hire and fire who they want. As a result of that, safety standards have slipped. It is a very poor situation indeed.
The strike record for the waterfront is 10 times that for the industry record for the rest of Australia. On things like reliability, time taken and value for money, again on any survey we are running last in the world. We are probably not even running a 6 minute 30 second mile. We are probably running a 7 minute 30 second mile. Brisbane, Burnie, Adelaide, Fremantle, Melbourne and Sydney came last, in that order, on ports that were surveyed around the world. Other cities like Singapore, Oakland, Osaka and Auckland were beating us. Auckland was three times more efficient than Sydney, using the same or less equipment. What an incredible situation.
They are trying to say that P&C Stevedores, the new operator that intends to be at Webb Dock, is a non-union operation. Again, that is not true. Anybody there who wants to join a union can if they so wish. There are no restrictions one way or the other.
They say that this is a union busting exercise. It is not a union busting exercise. It is simply another company that wants to set up and work. If they are any good at all, they will succeed. If they are not, they will fall over and someone else can have a go. They complain about people being trained overseas. Is there a person in this chamber who does not have a member of the family who has not been partially trained overseas?

"Hollis, Colin, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—It is interesting that of the government speakers not one has a port in their electorate. Of course the government members, like the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), who does have a port in his electorate, would not come in and speak on this because they know that what the government members are saying is nonsense. At least the member for Hinkler and others have a bit of an understanding about the ports.
The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) made much of the sporting analogy of running around the track. If anyone were running around a track that was not surfaced or that had ruts and so on, of course they would be lapped. And that is exactly what is happening here. We have not got the equipment on the ports.
He also mentioned Mozambique. The honourable member for Parkes and I both visited the port in Mozambique some years ago. We both know that when we were there they were modernising it. They were getting equipment. I happened to have a personal interest in that because it was a group from the University of Wollongong that was responsible for it. The port of Mozambique today is one of the most modern and efficient ports in the world, with proper equipment. So of course they have that record. That is what we want here.
There is no argument that Australia needs best practice on the waterfront. As an island continent with international trade mainly realised through seagoing transport, it is essential that we have a modern, efficient waterfront. My argument with members of the government, and especially the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith), is that provocative actions, distortions, myth making and demonisation are not the way to achieve industrial harmony on the waterfront or to achieve world's best practice.
What I find most frustrating about the whole debate is the way this government, and particularly the minister, try to portray this issue. The government would like us all to believe that all of the problems on the waterfront are the responsibility of only one sector—the waterside worker. An inquiry by the 
 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in 1992, of which I was a member, identified many of the problems on the waterfront. The report found—and every member of the government should read it—that there were a whole host of issues on the waterfront which cause problems, and the waterside workers are but one.
We have heard much about farmers wanting to establish their own stevedore, yet in many cases it is the farmers' themselves, as users of the waterfront, who are among the main contributors to the inefficiency that exists on the waterfront. We hear much too about the low productivity rates at Australian ports. Yet what we do not hear at all is that when it comes to bulk commodities such as grain, coal and iron ore we are productive by a long shot. Australian ports which handle bulk commodities are achieving world's best practice.
I can recall reading the daily commercial news here in Canberra last year and the leader was all about the bumper crop of wheat—19 million tonnes—all loaded in record time, and Port Kembla made a contribution to that. But perhaps we should ask the question why bulk handling ports are efficient. The answer is a simple one: the receival of products has been streamlined and modern equipment has been used.
Quite frankly, if stevedoring companies in Australia—the big two—gave their ports the same tools as ports handling bulk commodities, there is no question that productivity would increase. To hear the minister come into this place and endlessly complain and rubbish the waterfront, one could be forgiven for thinking that no change has taken place on the waterfront in years. But the fact is that few workplaces in Australia, indeed around the world, have experienced more dramatic changes over the last decade than the waterfront.
The waterfront work force in Australia has been significantly and substantially reduced—by 60 per cent in the eight years from 1989. The volume of cargo handling has increased and container lifts have also increased by around 20 per cent in the five years to 1997. 
 I said at the outset that productivity is determined by a number of factors, and again I urge all government members to get a copy of the 1992 committee report because all of the factors are there.
It is fashionable to give the wharfie and the MUA a bit of a clipping, but the fact is that many of the factors determining productivity are not controlled by the MUA at all. In many terminals around Australia—where too many are controlled by the two big stevedores, Patrick and P&O—the equipment used is almost 20 years out of date and there are too few cranes to dream about, let alone achieving world's best practice. I suspect, too, that many of the government members have never actually set foot on a wharf anywhere in Australia. I invite any of my colleagues opposite to come to Port Kembla any time they please. You show an interest and I will arrange a suitable tour so that the next time your minister sprouts his so-called facts you will actually know for yourselves.
The size of ships and stowage areas are limiting factors on productivity. Port economies of scale are achieved in many Asian ports because they service hundreds of millions of people. Australia's container trade services only 18 million.
The minister has a manic hatred of two unions—the MUA and the CFMEU (Mining Division). These are the two unions which the minister wants to drive out of industrial relations. Their continued existence and participation in workplaces around the country drives him spare. We on this side know that the MUA and CFMEU drive the minister crazy. The minister's all-consuming hatred of the MUA is behind the continual, mad, half-baked ideas like Dubai of stoking the fires of industrial disruption, of being up to his neck in pushing the boss to take on workers.
The minister's manic hatred of the MUA is what drives his unfavourable view of wharfies and is why he makes daily attacks on the workers, ridicules them and abuses them. The minister hates the MUA and the CFMEU because they are two very strong unions. It is that simple. He knows if he can defeat the two strong unions in Australia then he can ensure that the weaker unions are walked over 
 too. It all fits into the strategy of destroying Australia's industrial relations system, built up over a century.
We have heard much about the earnings of the wharfie. I know wharfies, unlike too many of those opposite, and I have seen their pay slips. The minister is great at distortions and myth-making, but he never comes in with the final prize—the proof, the paperwork. I do not believe that wharfies at Port Kembla are any different from wharfies anywhere else. I have seen the pay slips and they do not support the claims of the minister or the honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash). Here she was on radio last week in the Illawarra hosting the ABC Illawarra program—why I do not know, given that she supports the savage slashing of the broadcaster.
I was listening rather intently to the whole program and then came the talkback. On the other end of the line was the wife of a wharfie. She was one angry woman. Here was a wharfie's wife arguing with the honourable member for Gilmore about how much her husband took home in pay. Needless to say, the honourable member for Gilmore quickly became the John Laws of the ABC and cut the woman off. What is so offensive about a blue-collar worker earning $50,000 or $70,000 a year for work that is done? Why, having worked nights, weekends and other times, is it so offensive to be paid for the work performed?
There is a contradiction in the feigned and foaming anger put on by the minister about wharfies. He constantly parades the big wage and bags them for the overtime, but he does not mention that Patrick's and P&O refuse to employ more workers—wharfies have no choice to work overtime because it is a management decision—but when the wharfies do something outrageous like place a ban on overtime the minister screams again and completely oversteps his responsibilities as a minister of the Crown, instructing Patrick's not to pay workers for work performed. There is a catch-22 situation: if wharfies work the overtime as employers demand, the minister stands up and attacks them, ridicules them and abuses them, but if they put on a ban he instructs Patrick management not to pay them 
 anything. So it is work and cop the ridicule and attacks, but if you place a ban on the very thing the government attacks you with you cop it again and you also get no pay into the bargain. The waterside worker just cannot win.
The waterfront is enormously complex and interlocking, with many parties using it. The media never goes into the detail of waterfront reform. They want a simple 30-second grab. I recall early this year standing on No. 6 Jetty at Port Kembla being interviewed by a journalist from one of the local TV stations. I started to explain the term `crane lifts', that it could mean one lift or a double lift, double stacking or piling. The journalist asked his cameraman to stop recording, telling me, `Colin, this is too difficult to understand. Keep it simple.' He was putting a story across on productivity rates on the news that night and he did not want the story—he wanted a quick 30-second grab, not the whole detail. It is the same with the radio talkback gurus. They have all the answers but have never seen a wharf—let alone the poor caller who knows substantially less.
It is time for reason and realistic negotiation involving all waterfront parties and examining and assessing each individual port's capabilities. It is only through this long-term, backbreaking process of negotiation that we will ensure an efficient waterfront and world's best practice. The real issue is whether the government and the minister have the ability to embrace this approach. The performance to date is not an encouraging indicator at all.
Frankly, this minister and this government do not want waterfront reform. They are in a manic struggle to smash the Maritime Union of Australia and they think that, by doing that, by getting rid of the wharfies, they will get world's best practice. They are deluding themselves because they are not tackling the real problems as they face the waterfront, and many of them are issues that they will just not face up to because too often it affects their mates.

"Hicks, Noel, MP",NP,1998-03-30,"—The motion moved by the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) is an acknowledgment that the current dispute between Patrick Stevedor 
 ing Company and the Maritime Union of Australia is not in the national interest. Knowing the member for Port Adelaide as I do, I know that he would want to have world's best practice on our waterfront. I suggest he perhaps talks to his leader, to his Labor Party colleagues and to friends in union movement about the fact that, if all Australians are to benefit from an efficient waterfront, the MUA's monopoly control must be removed.
The Labor Party must come to realise, and quickly, that union engineered delays, inefficiencies, excessive costs and bullyboy tactics do not adversely impact only on importers and exporters; they impact on workers and consumers generally and, equally importantly, on jobs, the Australian economy and investment opportunities.
If significant savings are to be passed on to the broader Australian community, it is imperative that waterfront workers become more productive and achieve world's best practice in the movement of containers. It is common knowledge, both nationally and internationally, that Australia's ports are notoriously inefficient and this reputation is damaging to our national interest. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) touched on that.
This is the core issue that the Labor Party and its union mates are failing to confront. They are unwilling to face up to the reasons why our waterfront is notoriously inefficient. They talk about the national interest, but their new-found concern for the national interest is nothing more than a camouflage for their real objective, which is to protect the interests—the rorts—of their mates in the MUA, the union of silvertails. The 4,500 MUA members employed as waterside workers receive pay and conditions which belie the lingering battlers stereotype. Their average annual wage is $74,000, with the highest earning $110,000 per annum for what is effectively a 30-hour week maximum.
I heard the previous speakers from the Labor Party and, like them, I believe that people who work hard should earn as much as they can and take home as much as they can, but there is one thing about Australians—and I found this when I was out in the work force—and that is that if you were 
 working hard and someone alongside you was not working hard, and you were both taking home the same wage, you resented it. This ought to be kept in mind.
Unfortunately, time does not permit me to go into the detail of all the rorts built into the award, but they are well documented. The silence of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in this dispute only serves to further highlight his leadership inadequacies. He has not had the courage to speak out in the interests of all Australians to repudiate the senseless standover tactics adopted by John Coombs and the MUA against Patrick Stevedores, a company that is working within the law and which should be allowed to get on with its business.
The Leader of the Opposition has failed to support the resolution adopted at the Labor Party National Conference which called for new stevedoring competition on the waterfront. The only conclusion you can draw from this is that he is frightened to criticise the MUA. This is further evidence—if further evidence were needed—that the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party are the puppets of the union movement and are especially fearful of the MUA.
The Labor Party only springs into action when the likes of John Coombs and Jennie George pull the strings and determine the course of action to be taken. It is a captive of the unions. This is not new. Over the period that I have been in the parliament, I remember things like the taxation policy of Paul Keating which, with a phone call from the ACTU, changed almost overnight.
The Labor Party is not concerned about waterfront efficiency. It has had 13 years to put genuine and lasting reforms of the waterfront in place. What did it achieve? Exactly nothing. We heard today about the inefficiencies of the system because of the cranes and other technology inefficiencies. I do not know what has been done in that 13 years. The Labor Party's idea of waterfront reform under Bob Hawke was to fork out something like $420 million of taxpayers' money to enable workers to take redundancy payouts of hundreds of thousands of dollars each. A big 
 majority of those people are still working on the waterfront.
What happened about the rip-offs, rorts and unlawful industrial strikes which tear the heart out of our ports in terms of efficiency? Once again, exactly nothing. All the rorts and inefficiencies are still in existence. The Labor Party has allowed them to flourish. It has allowed the MUA to retain its monopoly of labour on the waterfront and to hold the rest of the Australian population to ransom.
For 13 years the Labor Party ignored the need for cost and productivity efficiencies, flexibility, innovation, reliability and investment on our waterfront. What did we get today? The member for Port Adelaide and his Labor colleagues called for a conference of all parties. How many conferences do we need? The one thing I would say about it, though, is that it shows that there is a need for everyone to get together to obtain world's best practice, but the way it is going on the waterfront at the moment I cannot see that happening. To use the words of Richard Prebble, the former New Zealand minister responsible for waterfront reform in that country, which has left Australia well behind in the efficiency stakes:
Port reform in New Zealand has added millions to the incomes of its farmers and exporters. It has also improved the everyday lives of ordinary New Zealanders. My advice to Australia is simple: you do not need another expert report or conference.
The Labor Party should take note that he said that we do not need another conference. What does the honourable member think another conference will achieve? Does he honestly and sincerely believe that the MUA is prepared to enter into negotiations over productivity? This is the union that has repeatedly refused to accept a crane rate of 25 movements per hour in line with world's best practice. This is the union that walks out of talks with the government simply because it is not prepared to trade off any of its rorts or its monopoly over who works on the waterfront.
The Labor Party is locked in a time warp. It is back living with the dinosaurs when it comes to tackling the hard task of reforming the waterfront and getting rid of the excessive 
 costs and the disastrously low levels of productivity which compare favourably only with developing Third World countries and which lag well behind our major trading partners around the globe. The challenge for the Labor Party is to support the coalition government's waterfront reform strategies aimed at increasing levels of productivity and allowing non-union labour to work on the Australian waterfront. It is too weak to accept the challenge.
The reason for the current dispute is the fact that it is impossible to work on the waterfront unless you are a member of the MUA, because the union insists that all wharfies belong to it. The MUA, in its arrogance and contempt for all other hardworking Australians, refuses to accept that the National Farmers Federation has the legal right to start a new business on the waterfront and to employ its own non-union labour.
The Labor Party shadow minister for industrial relations has even put forward the ridiculous proposition that the NFF is entitled to go into the shipping business, but not into the waterfront business. I thought we lived in a country where individuals and organisations were within their rights to develop any lawful business enterprise and were, indeed, encouraged to do so. However, the Labor Party sees it quite differently. It is saying that you can start a business—providing it is not in direct competition with the union dominated enterprise and providing you employ only members of a union. The Labor Party will support a new waterfront operation but only if the MUA continues to effectively dictate the terms and conditions under which the new operator can start.
Waterfront reform is of tremendous importance to country people, including those living in my electorate of Riverina, which is in the centre of one of Australia's biggest food bowls. The rorts and inefficiencies on the wharves impact on their export opportunities and the returns they receive on export products. This situation is the nub of the problem. The silvertails of the MUA are out on a limb in this current dispute and do not have the support of the majority of people living in the bush and the cities. I notice that a bro 
 chure sent to all members of the parliament lists the people who are supporting the MUA in this action. As you go through the list, you will see those you expected to be there. There are only four farmers out of about 80 in the union movement. I would say that four out of 80 is not a very high number. Farmers know exactly what happens to them on the waterfront.
People recognise the need to break the union's control of the waterfront, to introduce greater efficiencies and productivity in order to make our exporters more competitive as they battle for export business in the global marketplace in the 1990s. Union domination of the waterfront has existed for decades, and this domination was evident during the Second World War and the Vietnam War when the actions of wharfies threatened our war effort.
With general public support for the Holt government and the Vietnam commitment, these conflicts showed up the ACTU and discredited the unions and their political allies in the Labor Party. Nothing has changed, and the actions of the Maritime Union of Australia in 1998 are also un-Australian in the extreme, in that they threaten the livelihood of all Australians who rely on growth in our export industries to boost the economy and maintain our standard of living. The people of Australia are saying enough is enough. They are saying the national interest should take precedence over the tactics of an inefficient and monopolistic union which puts itself above the law. These are the same old tactics which have given the MUA the dreadful reputation it already has in the Australian community.
The waterfront is rife with salary packages and rorts which are only dreamed about by other people in the work force. I congratulate the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) on his daily expose of these shocking and unrealistic rorts during question time in this House. His exposes make the community aware of these ridiculous rorts and how firmly entrenched they are on the waterfront, to the detriment of all Australians. They have been well documented in Hansard, so I will not repeat them. 
The waterfront needs an injection of competition and the creation of a new culture that is focused on developing a reliable, efficient and rort-free workplace that will benefit all Australians—including the families and friends of those people who work on the wharves—rather than a handful of highly paid unionist elite.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Waterfront</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Brown, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I join with my colleagues in support of this motion which has been moved by the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). This motion urges the House to call upon the government to `urgently bring together all the players on the Australian waterfront' to bring about what are identified as desirable outcomes. So why is it that members of the government are making references to the unions and to the Labor Party's position, in questions of this kind, as adopting bullyboy tactics?
The bullyboy tactics are not being adopted by us; they are being adopted by the government, by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) and all those people with whom he conspires out in the community—all of the organisations and all of the private businesses, including overseas corporations, which operate in Australia. It is the workers and trade unions who are seeking intelligent and civilised approaches to industrial relations. We have indicated, as have they, support for negotiation, for conciliation, for arbitration, for legal agreements, for enforceable, honourable and honoured awards. It has been the minister for workplace relations who has refused the opportunity for arbitration to be brought into play. It is the minister for workplace relations, representing this Liberal coalition government, who in effect said to Patrick's, `If those employees of yours on the waterfront in Melbourne, despite the fact that they are putting in a full week's work, don't work overtime, don't pay them'—emphasising to them as well that that `Don't pay them' provision is a specific provision of the workplace relations legislation of this government.
How reprehensible that any government would not only make the provisions and lock them into its legislation but also serve notice 
 on private employers by saying: `Act within this legislation and if your employees won't work overtime but otherwise put in a full week's work then don't pay them.'
I have no desire to see a return to the circumstances that prevailed, for example, in the 1920s or, more recently, when conflict in areas of industry like coal mining or on the wharves reached the stage that it did. We are dealing, in a sense, with the situation on the Melbourne ports at the present time. I refer in particular to the shooting of Allan Whittaker, a wharfie who in 1928, together with other waterside workers—his colleagues and comrades—were attempting to protect their employment against scabs that had been brought on to the waterfront in Melbourne. Allan Whittaker was a Gallipoli veteran. He survived the bullets of the Turks; he did not survive the bullets of the powers of the state that were brought against him and his colleagues, four of whom were injured. He died. He was there protecting his family and protecting his job. It was the following year that Norman Brown at Rothbury was shot and killed during an illegal lockout by the forces of the state as well when those coalminers on the northern field were protesting and demonstrating against scabs. They were locked out in order to starve the families and in order to force those coalminers into submission—back into the coalmines—to adopt worse conditions than they had before.
This government have put together industrial relations legislation which aims to reduce workers' rights and conditions and assist employers to attack unions. They have conspired with private mining and stevedoring companies to develop union bashing strategies. They have allowed serving army personnel to be conscripted for training in Dubai, to act as scab workers and strike breakers on the waterfront. They have instructed stevedoring companies not to pay workers who refuse overtime but who otherwise provide a full week's labour. They have refused to allow disputes to be arbitrated. The minister for workplace relations said to the union and to the employers, `Fight it out.' They have also urged employers to take on the unions.

"McArthur, Stewart, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—Improving Australia's waterfront is in the national interest. Australia has tolerated 100 years of union waterfront monopoly and unreliability. It is interesting that the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce in December released a report prophetically entitled Turning the tide: waterfront reform in Australia . This report demonstrated that Australian business was losing $1 billion every year because of our abysmal waterfront performance.
Let me refute the comments made by the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) when he talked about the negotiation process that took place under the Hawke government. What simply happened under the Hawke government and the WIRA process was that $450 million was spent on redundancies and there were no productivity improvements, fewer people worked on the waterfront with better equipment and there was no real change in output. In reply to the comments of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) who suggested that the productivity of the bulk grains ports were good, let me remind members of the House that the union involved in the bulk grains ports was the AWU. No wonder there has been better productivity there.
The Maritime Union of Australia's monopoly on the waterfront should be broken. The current action by the government aims to ensure that Australia's reliability, productivity and competitiveness on the waterfront are improved. If Australia does not have a reliable and competitive waterfront we will be lacking as an international trading nation. The MUA said in the publication that they circulated to all members today:
Australia is an island continent and our international trade is mainly realised by modes of seagoing transport.
How right they are. However, we must get it right. Until now the MUA and its predecessor, the Waterside Workers Federation, have abused their monopoly power on the waterfront. The MUA have made the waterfront their domain and have bred a work force which receives an average of $74,000 but up to $90,000 to $120,000 per annum for a 30- 
hour week, plus five weeks annual leave and 27½ per cent leave loading. Surely these conditions are out of step with the rest of the Australian work force in terms of the work done, the skills employed and the responsibility undertaken by those in this job.
Australia's stevedoring companies are not a jobs service for the MUA, which some of those opposite may have come to believe. The new Australian stevedoring companies such as Patrick's, P&O and the NFF are in the business to get a return on capital and service their ports. I remind members of the House that the increasingly competitive environment developing on Australia's waterfront will benefit the stevedoring companies and the Australian economy. A more reliable waterfront will increase trade and jobs Australia wide rather than reduce them.
However, the profits and the survival of some of our stevedoring companies are under threat. As reported in the Financial Review on 26 March, Patrick's chairman, Mr Chris Corrigan, who has his own money in this company, said that Lang Corporations, the owner of Patrick Stevedores, was quite close to going under. The company's stevedoring operations barely broke even last year and the company had more than $200 million worth of debt. The union stranglehold on the waterfront is a key factor in the company's difficulties, according to Mr Corrigan. He had his own money in the operation. If Patrick's could improve the productivity of the company it could save up to $80 million a year in operating costs. Mr Corrigan stated:
Under the current workplace arrangements with the workers the company can barely service its interest bills, let alone provide a return to shareholders.
The National Farmers Federation and their company, P&C Stevedores, have the first non-MUA work force on Australia's docks. The federation's President, Mr Don McGauchie, claims that his company can run 30 per cent cheaper than other  stevedoring companies in this country. At least he is having a go and providing genuine competition.
The Reith-Howard government industrial relations legislation under section 127 of the Workplace Relations Act ensures that it will provide a more reliable waterfront. The 
 legislation which came into effect in January 1996 limits industrial action, requiring employees to return to work as directed by the employers. While the MUA are doing their best to circumnavigate this legislation, the changes do give the stevedoring companies some direction over their own employers. We note that the MUA are not able to run a national strike as they have historically done. The key argument is in the BIE report which stated:
The BIE acknowledged that some ship operators are prepared to pay for reliable, but said: ""It is precisely in this area where ship operators perceive the largest deficit in Australia's performance relative to other countries. Indeed, 80 per cent of ship companies . . . consider that their turnaround times have improved faster overseas than in Australia in the last five years. Therefore, despite all the recent efforts to improve waterfront performance, the gap between Australian and overseas ports has widened.

"Lawrence, Carmen, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I am very pleased to speak in the debate on this motion today, proudly representing, as I do, the port as well as the seat of Fremantle. I have been disgusted by a lot of what I have heard from members opposite, not least from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) who leads the charge. It is clear that the government's so-called `reform agenda' for the waterfront is no such thing. It is a poorly disguised attempt to deny workers on the waterfront and the shipping industries the right to be represented by an effective and well organised union. It is also designed to distract other workers from what is happening to their own wages, conditions and rights to organise under this government's new legislation and IR policy. The government is setting up a bit of a circus on one side so that people perhaps will not look at what is happening in their own workplaces.
We have now in the minister one who is pathologically obsessed with engineering a confrontation with the Maritime Union of Australia. It is clear that his actions are not guided by a genuine desire to achieve a productive and harmonious waterfront, but instead by a malicious campaign to manufac 
 ture a dispute which the government will `win' at the expense at those that they have depicted as undeserving and greedy. It is clear that if Australia's trading reputation, the workers' and their families' needs and the companies and consumers are damaged in this process this government and the minister do not give a fig.
In the process of their hysterical attack on the maritime workers they have, first of all, already caused unnecessary unrest and disputes on the waterfront. They have deliberately engineered them. They have engaged in what can only be described as bizarre cloak and dagger ventures first in Cairns then in Dubai, using mercenaries, and now at Webb Dock with the National Farmers Federation organised by Maxwell Smart clones formerly from the minister's office, and he is at the centre of this circus.
They have been prepared to vilify and abuse hardworking men and women and their families. These are people I represent. I know that they are decent people and they have been vilified. In the process, what we have also seen is that this government and the minister have so lost their sense of humour that they do not know when their legs are being pulled. We see the minister stand up in this place and suggest that crane rates had improved because the workers in Fremantle had gone off to see a strip show. They do not even recognise Australian humour when they hear it. I think that is an extraordinary reflection on them.
They have used parliamentary privilege in this place to misrepresent the actual performance and productivity data on the waterfront. They set it aside. They ignore and misrepresent it. There have been corrections issued by the Fremantle Port Authority to some of the claims made by this minister. They are a very staid body but they felt that they had to come out and defend their own workers.
This government, of course, has deliberately ignored the very substantial and sustained reforms that have been achieved in the waterfront industries. I want to go through a couple of those. We have seen in Australia already—at least before this government came in—substantial improvement in labour produc 
 tivity at container terminals. It has almost doubled. Indeed, in my own state of Western Australia the WA Department of Commerce and Trade's Internet site says that Fremantle Port Authority's ship turnaround time improved 17 per cent between 1990 and 1991, between 1994 and 1995, and the authority's costs per unit cargo were 45 per cent less. You cannot get that without an increase in productivity. Cargo handling rates generally have improved by as much as 50 per cent and there have been annual savings, estimated a couple of years ago as being at least $300 million, from the reduced work force size and the faster turnaround of container ships. The stevedoring work force, as we have heard, since 1989 has almost halved. So there have been substantial improvements on the waterfront.
Looking at my own state in particular, just recently, at the grain handling terminal in Kwinana, a new 24 hours a day, seven days a week agreement without overtime penalty has been struck. The workers there have worked to reach world's best practice.
Opposition members interjecting—
—It should not be denied. You should encourage people when they are doing well, not denigrate them. Indeed, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia, headed currently by Mr Barry Court, have actually told the National Farmers Federation to butt out because they have very good relations with the MUA in Western Australia and they are satisfied with the current state of affairs. I would like to draw members' attention too to the P&O newsletter called Chatter Box , which shows figures on crane handling rates and includes many thanks from customers and shippers in the Port of Fremantle.
For instance, recently they showed that a recent voyage of the Kasuga 1, when it visited Fremantle, experienced the same crane rate, 26.8 TEUs per hour, as it did in Singapore, even though there is only one crane available compared with Singapore's four. If you look at the turnaround time, it is very respectable indeed when you consider that there are four times as many cranes in Singapore. The number of moves they made is very 
 respectable. In fact, you would have to say it is world's best practice. So leave the Maritime Union alone. It is only doing its job and defending its workers. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Waterfront</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1,speech
"Andrew, Neil, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—I actually owe the member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) something of an apology because, before he concluded his remarks, I had to leave to execute some of the responsibilities I have as the Chief Government Whip. I therefore did not do his speech justice, and I only came in on the tail end of the speech of the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence). Nonetheless, let me reassure her that the exercise of the government in pursuing reforms at Webb Dock is certainly not an exercise intended to persecute the Maritime Union; quite the contrary. There seems to be a view on that side that the government should be in some way offended by improvements in crane loading rates referred to by the member for Port Adelaide.
I am very pleased that Port Adelaide, the principal port in my own home state, has gone from, according to the member for Port Adelaide, 19 movements to 24 movements, and is improving. I welcome that. I welcome the changes that have occurred at any one of the docks around Australia that indicate improved cargo handling. What I face, as a member of the government, is the simple reality that there are in fact opportunities for even further improvement and that one organisation in Australia, namely the National Farmers Federation, has said, `We will set up in competition.' As a member of the Australian parliament, and as an Australian taxpayer, I laud that competition.
What are the National Farmers Federation doing? Are they saying, `We will bring in Brazilian operators in order to work them for $3 an hour?' Not at all. The National Farmers Federation accept the pay rates and conditions applying around Australia and say, `We will pay them.' They say, in fact, to the MUA, `We stand here offering competition, and competition that recognises all of the existing Australian award arrangements.' I am not offended by that. The legislation that we have put in place allows a group to come in and say, `We will offer a competitive practice.' 
 Why should we apologise? Why should the MUA be offended when all they have to do is match the performance of the National Farmers Federation in order to retain all of—
—It will be very easy.
—Precisely; the member for Port Adelaide agrees with me. If all they have to do is match the performance of the National Farmers Federation, they will not in any way be threatened by what is currently happening, so why all of the confected theatrics?
—No, that is coming from your side.
—I am saying we are standing for competition under the arrangements that have already been agreed. You, in fact, are unable or unwilling to accept competition, Australian to Australian.
—Not true!
—I find this extraordinary. Take any other area of government action: I sat on that side while you in government proposed that, for example, every primary producer in Australia should face the competition of the Brazilians, the Chileans, the Argentineans, the Asians, and all of those with cut-wage markets, and I agreed. Now I propose simply that an Australian company working under Australian conditions should in fact offer competitive rates with another Australian company, and you have expressed indignation.
—With soldiers?
—There is nothing wrong with what the National Farmers Federation is doing. It is nonsense for the member for Port Adelaide to suggest that the army is in some way involved, as he well knows. All that exists here is competition between two Australian companies. The opposition are not prepared to accept it because their agenda is dictated by the trade union movement. Accept the fact that this is nothing more than the same sort of competition as exists between Woolworths and Coles or any other group of companies that you care to nominate; competition that obliges every one of the employers and the employees to abide by Australian conditions.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The Howard government's tendering process for employment services has received an enormous amount of attention over the past month, and rightfully so. The picture that is forming in the offices of opposition members and also in the offices of government members I would imagine, particularly if they would like to be truthful about it, is that this ill-conceived reform will result in many unemployed people having their job prospects severely handicapped. Day after day we hear cases of successful employment agencies having lost out to groups with no links or knowledge of the communities they are expected to serve and no understanding of the individual problems faced by the unemployed people they are there to assist.
As hundreds of community based employment agencies close or deploy their staff elsewhere, thousands of unemployed Australians are filled with apprehension and confusion as they face losing contact with their regular case managers. Many are prepared to spend hours travelling on the train or bus simply to receive the help and the individual assistance they need from their regular job trainers. Unemployed people are seeking approval from Centrelink to go ahead with these arrangements, but Centrelink staff are as much in the dark about what is going on as everybody else.
 Meanwhile, those private organisations which are successful in tendering for employment service contracts are laughing at the 
 Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Dr Kemp) for asking them to assist unemployed people not on social security benefits into work. Considering these businesses only get paid for finding jobs for clients who are receiving social security payments, their mirth is understandable. These companies are not charities. They are incredulous that the minister is suggesting that they become one. It shows both an incredible naivete on his part and I believe is a tacit admission that he recognises the failure of his own system even before it has got off the ground. The minister has made his bed; he must either lie in it or make some immediate changes to it.
 The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Minister Kemp, along with the various pundits who support this policy's implementation, say we must give it time to work. They say it is a revolutionary system that must be allowed a few kinks at the beginning before it bears fruit. Just how long do they expect that to take may we ask? Who will be the ones suffering while those teething problems are sorted out? It is the unemployed who will suffer, that is who. As unemployed people lose their case managers and are assigned new ones unaware of their particular problems or difficulties, the disruption that will follow will undoubtedly handicap their attempts to find work.
Unemployed people do not have the luxury of waiting while the Prime Minister sits, fingers crossed behind his back, hoping for these problems to work themselves out. As each day passes, job prospects become slimmer and feelings of self-respect decline. The system that the Howard government inherited was, on the whole, if they would admit it, working well. It was them ripping out over $2 billion of that system as a government when they came to power that has caused the problems. As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, assisting the unemployed is costly but not assisting them is more so. There is no cheap way to go about reducing unemployment. The privatisation of employment services by the Howard government is an attempt to get people into jobs on the cheap and it will not work. I say with no 
 satisfaction at all that, come 1 May, the chaos that presently reigns in this sector will intensify.
 Another privatisation reform that will prove equally as damaging, especially in areas like mine, but which has received less publicity relates to the adult migrant English program. It is a policy that will have serious consequences not only on my community's large migrant population but also on our efforts to reduce unemployment. In New South Wales the Howard government divided the provision of the adult migrant English program, or AMEP, into five geographical regions, each of which had to be separately tendered for.
The Adult Migrant English Service, or AMES—a public education institution that has provided English as a second language course for migrants and refugees across New South Wales, and especially in south-western Sydney, for over 50 years—was granted preferred provider status in only two of the five regions. The other three went to a private consortium headed by the Australian Centre for Languages. Of the two regions AMES was successful in tendering, neither are considered areas featuring large ethnic populations. Come 1 July, AMES will no longer have a presence in south-western Sydney.
 The Adult Migrant English Service now stands to lose over 500 of its 600 teachers in New South Wales, teachers who, like the many employment professionals losing their jobs as a result of the job compact tendering process, will take with them a wealth of expertise and experience that communities like mine can ill afford to lose. The Australian Centre for Languages, while a reputable company, I am sure, has no experience in providing English as a second language course for poorly educated migrants or humanitarian refugees. Its background is teaching English to business people, to highly skilled and educated migrants and students.
There is an enormous gulf in the approach needed to teach English to those two distinct groups of people. They have different needs. They often have vastly different aptitudes and learning abilities. AMES understands these differences. It needs to be questioned whether 
 ACL is equipped to deal with any of them. The Adult Migrant English Service wrote the book on teaching English as a second language to migrants—literally. It was part of the guidelines governing the tendering process in that those submitting proposals agreed to use the teaching methods that had been developed and implemented so successfully by the Adult Migrant English Service in the past.
 Yet the government does not give a second thought to getting rid of AMES from some of the communities that need it most. For a community like mine where unemployment is almost twice the national average, a problem that is made more acute by a large population of migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds, the assistance AMES has provided has been invaluable. Close to 100,000 migrants in the south-western Sydney region have benefited from AMES's English tuition and settlement services. Losing that assistance will place another obstacle in the way of local migrants and refugees attempting to find employment. The longer they remain unemployed the longer it will take before they can make a contribution to our community. Not one extra migrant or refugee will be eligible for English language tuition through privatisation. Not one extra hour of English will be available for eligible migrants and refugees through privatisation.
 The citizens of Prospect and south-western Sydney are livid about the attitude and actions of this government. It has come into our communities and has created confusion and upheaval where there was once order and security. And for what? That is the question I ask the government. For savings that will be lost tenfold as the long-term unemployed stagnate on the job queues desperate for the assistance that the new system cannot provide? For efficiency and better service? That is a cruel and bitter joke.
These policies are ripping communities like mine apart. I know they are having a similar effect in some electorates represented by government members. I say to those government members that they have a duty, both to themselves and to the people they purport to represent, to make these problems known to their senior colleagues so that we can try to 
 bring back some semblance of order and sanity to our communities. The longer this insanity reigns the longer it will take to put these dislocated and shell-shocked communities back together.
I feel very strongly about this. I have people continually coming to me saying that now they are eligible to learn English they have been told that the services which were going to be provided from 1 July will no longer be there. Where do they go and what do they do? I do not believe the government has the answers. All it is doing is providing them with uncertainty. Yet at the same time it is saying to them, `We expect you to contribute to your community at large. You must learn, have a command of, the basic English language.'
I have in my community people who have not even been taught to read and write in their own language. The difference we can make is in the provision of services, the teaching of conversational English and work English. Through the Adult Migrant Education Service we have provided trained teachers who have been teaching migrants who have fled as refugees to this country of Australia. We have welcomed them here, sheltered them and given them assistance. The government is now saying that it is no longer going to allow you access to the experts who are especially trained in that field to teach you working English. We cannot expect contributions from people making Australia their second home when they do not have a command of English, our language in this country.
I believe this is going to be one of the greatest disasters for migrants who have come to this country as refugees under special humanitarian programs. They have had to flee their homelands, standing at most times in only the clothes they had on their back and have been assisted in this country—and rightfully so. At the same time, the government is saying to them, `You will not be able to make a contribution because we believe that those who have been teaching you for the last 50 years are not good enough now to provide English as a second language tutoring to you.' I believe that the Howard government 
 and those who purport to represent it will go down in shame when this filters through to their communities. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Unemployment</title>,Grievance Debate,10,1,speech
"Rocher, Allan, MP",IND,1998-03-30,"—The Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill 1997  seeks to correct a series of unintended consequences that have resulted from amendments to both the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. In all, there are changes to some 13 provisions being sought. While the government describes them as nothing more than minor technical amendments, there seems to me to be an awful lot of corrections being addressed here, minor or otherwise.
Only a fool or idealist would delude themselves into thinking that our system is a perfect one in which only perfectly crafted 
 legislation comes through this place. The reality is that tight legislative schedules and an extraordinarily complex taxation system collude to ensure that some of our tax legislation will contain unintended faults. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that we have the opportunity to correct deficiencies which threaten to undermine the original intent of legislation in a bill like this.
That said, there is a lot of room for improvement in the attitude of the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, in its public and private determinations and rulings and in the consultation process that governments variously pursue with professionals in the tax industry. There is also a very good case to be argued for the guaranteed introduction of a technical corrections bill into this parliament on a biannual basis to correct flawed legislation that may result in unintended disadvantages to taxpayers.
It has been suggested by one reputable tax adviser that the mind-set of the ATO in the rewrite or correction of tax legislation is now so geared towards resolving problems which it perceives to be detrimental to the revenue that its claim that the changes from the 1936 to the 1997 acts generally favour taxpayers is highly questionable. This contrary view was confirmed by Mr Stanley Droder, a member of the TLIP consultative committee, in his evidence to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, the JCPAA, in only January last. Mr Droder argued that the relentless review of legislation by a Taxation Office obsessed with catching tax cheats means that the risk of error and the lack of certainty that an unintended error detected sometime in the future will mean a reinterpretation of the law with adverse consequences to taxpayers generally.
If the ATO has such a monopoly over the rewrite and interpretation of the 1936 ITAA, why should any of the professional tax bodies have confidence in the final drafting of legislation like this? The fact is that our principal tax act is now nearly unintelligible because of the manic way in which the ATO proceeds to `chase down in legislation every possible loophole', to quote one leading tax expert. Yet it is the ATO that continues to 
 grip the tax law improvement project by the proverbial short and curlies.
In presenting evidence on the Tax Law Improvement Bill No. 2 (1997) to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit on 28 January 1998, Mr Droder said that the `indecent haste' with which that particular bill was introduced into the parliament `opens the possibility of even more errors than would be normally acceptable and increases the risk of unintended changes', as well as causing a decline in the confidence in the output `not only in this bill, but also with successive bills yet required'. While Mr Droder was speaking directly to the TLIP No. 2 bill of 1997, his comments are worth reflection in the light of this technical amendments bill.
A submission made to the JCPAA by an elite team from the Australian Taxation Institute of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants on the TLIP No. 2 bill outlined a multitude of possible technical errors in the rewritten legislation. In fact, one member of that team states that dozens of potential technical errors exist in the rewritten legislation as it now stands, which surely undermines the entire purpose of having a rewrite of the tax act in the first place.
If these concerns are not taken into account by the tax law improvement team, we could well find ourselves back here, once the rewrite is complete, debating another technical measures bill and trying to overcome shortfalls in what is supposed to be a new and improved tax act. The same argument has also been waged against this bill.
Mr John Kirkwood, partner at Ernst and Young in Sydney, has criticised the bill, not so much for what it contains, but for what is lacking in its 30 pages of corrections. Mr Kirkwood noted:
There are literally dozens of provisions in respect of which the ATO has agreed that there is an unintended outcome, but which are not mentioned in this bill and are not yet corrected. In this light, the bill can be seen as part of a highly selective process which leaves the `hard ones' out of the picture. Why is it not more expansive?
Why, indeed, Mr Deputy Speaker?
The coalition has repeatedly patted itself on the back about its commitments to consulting widely with interested parties in the drafting of legislation generally. Certainly there are examples of consultation in other legislation coming before the House. One that comes to mind is the Corporate Law Review Bill 1997, but this bill does not fall into that category. It is another instance of tax legislation that needs a whole lot less sizzle and much more sausage when it comes to the ATO and Treasury taking on board the concerns of experts.
One of the more serious consequences of a government dismissing the legitimate concerns of professional tax bodies is an increase in the compliance costs for taxpayers. The coalition suggests in its explanatory memorandum that the bulk of the corrections sought in this bill will have either no impact or only a minimal one. It may well be true that compliance costs will not significantly increase for taxpayers as a result of this legislation, but there should be no doubt that valuable advisorial time is consumed in coming to grips with each and every change to our tax acts. These costs, no matter how slight, will at some stage trickle down the tax food chain and hit the average small business proprietor or the PAYE taxpayer, if only in the form of higher professional fees.
Apparently, inquiries have been made of the ATO about identified and recognised deficiencies in our tax law and why they have not been corrected in this bill. The reported response has been that there is no certainty that a parliamentary slot will be made available for the debate of such amendments. That is a totally unacceptable non-excuse.
No wonder doubt was expressed to the JCPAA on 28 January last as to whether `those who have been consulted'—that is, about ways to improve our taxation regime—`actually feel satisfied with the final product or that their issues have been adequately considered'. It was suggested by another witness before the committee that, `Those making submissions need tangible evidence that their work is not being dumped into a black hole and ignored.' Clearly, many in the tax fraternity feel that there is little of sub 
 stance in this legislation to assure them that their input has not been for nought.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—I wish to comment briefly on two specific amendments in this bill, including the amendment to section 318 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936—that dealing with foreign source income and the amendment to the tax treatment of provisional tax credits.
The government is proposing that provisional tax credits cannot be applied against provisional tax that is not due and payable notified for a later year. As Mr Kirkwood correctly pointed out, some 30 years after the introduction of the provisional tax regime, the Australian Taxation Office is still using every method possible to `garnish entitlements of taxpayers against expectations of further tax liabilities'.
Clearly it is not the taxpayer who benefits from the practice of holding back refunds where a probable future tax liability merely might emerge—and I emphasise `might'. There is only one winner in such cases, and that is the ATO itself. As far as the corrections sought to foreign source income, Mr Kirkwood noted:
Years of discussions with the ATO regarding the faults and unintended consequences in section 318 have resulted in only this minor amendment, which has a purpose only of protecting the revenue.
He goes on to say that section 318 has such a broad application that any Australian company investing in offshore joint ventures with a foreign company, which foreign company has a subsidiary in Australia, is deemed to be an associate of the foreign company merely by virtue of the foreign company's investment in Australia. Mr Kirkwood described this as an `extraordinary and unintended outcome' and asks, `Where is the correction in the bill?'
This bill does nothing to improve the workings of section 318 because it is not in the interests of the Australian Taxation Office to do so. The bill also seeks to make minor technical amendments to the definition of private and public tax rulings. On 11 September 1996, I commented in some detail in this place about the treatment that I believe these 
 rulings and determinations should receive, and I wish to revisit those remarks.
Public rulings and determinations should be subjected to the same parliamentary scrutiny as regulations because, while those rulings are not law or delegated legislation in a strict sense, the ATO applies them as if they were law. If the ATO holds up its rulings as law—and it does—then those rulings should be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny to which regulations are subjected. They should be treated as regulations, face disapproval by either house of the parliament and have five-year sunset clauses.
In its November 1993 report, the then JCPA recommended that all public tax rulings should go through a formal approval process. It is the responsibility of the parliament to make the laws of this land and, more particularly in this context, our taxation laws. All public rulings and determinations should be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny to ensure that they comply with the parliament's will and the parliament's interpretation of the meaning of how its laws should be interpreted and applied. The Commissioner of Taxation should not have the unfettered right to draft tax rules at his sole discretion, but this is precisely what our current system sanctions.
Only the week before last, the ATO was questioned about the total number of tax rulings and determinations being fielded by the Taxation Office at that time. As I understand it, the response from the ATO was along the lines that no accurate estimation could be provided because new public rulings and determinations were added to the list on a daily basis while others were deleted regularly.
It is a sad commentary on the ATO's grasp of the quantity and volume of law it effectively makes as distinct from statutory law passed by this parliament that it fails to be able to provide a reasonable estimate of even the number of current public rulings and determinations made by the Commissioner of Taxation. If it cannot or will not disclose the quantity of its rulings or determinations, we can be damned sure it does not have a working knowledge of the contents. The taxation commissioner should not have the ability to 
 bypass accountability to the parliament, and binding rules of a tax nature should be established only with the approval of parliament or, at the very least, with the parliament having the right to disallow.
While I support the passage of this bill, I remain unconvinced that the government is doing everything it can to facilitate a speedy correction of other technical errors that plague our tax legislation. It is lamentable that the practice of legislation by press release now seems to be the norm rather than the exception.
In the likely event that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) continues to announce changes to our tax act in this manner, it is suggested that, at the very least, more time should be spent by those drafting the legislation to minimise the incidence of technical or unintended errors. World's best practice in the drafting and management of tax legislation processes and procedures should obtain, just as it should in all sectors of the economy.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS (TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Main Committee Report</title>,Bills,12,1,speech
"Miles, Chris, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—in reply—I will be brief in my summing up. I thank those members who participated in the Main Committee and the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who participated in the chamber.
The Taxation Laws (Technical Amendments) Bill contains a number of minor amendments and technical corrections. The government is making best efforts to tidy up the technical errors that cause uncertainty in the law. The amendments will make sure the tax laws operate as intended. The technical correction aspect of the bill makes some wording changes and other minor corrections. The bill corrects deficiencies in the tax law that have been found by the Australian Taxation Office or have been raised during consultations with professional bodies and tax practitioners.

"O'Keefe, Neil, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I rise to signal to the House that the opposition concurs with the legislation and with debating it cognately. As was made clear in the second reading speech, these are administrative amendments to tidy up the legislation and to give effect to the carrying out of the process of the national residue survey. We are quite supportive of this process.
I might just take a couple of minutes of the time of the House to mention that at the ALP's national conference in Hobart earlier this year, in approving our platform for the future of agriculture, there was specific reference in that platform to the broader policy issue of guarantees to consumers about food quality and safety assurance and, within that general context, a recognition of the fact that residues—if they are not already a major consumer issue—are very rapidly moving onto the agenda and that we, as a nation 
 which takes some pride in presenting ourselves to the world as a producer of high quality food products, must be conscious of the growing need to guarantee both residues and all the other matters that relate to food quality and food marketing.
As I said in the more substantive discussion of this topic when the legislation first came through the House, the Labor Party completely supports the establishment, management and administration of the residue survey. We will be insisting that best practice standards of science and analysis are maintained because we hold the view that at some point in the not too distant future access to markets will depend very much on being able to demonstrate the `clean green' basis behind which we make our claims.
Having said those few words, I will facilitate rapid passage of this legislation through the House by indicating that the opposition supports it. We do not have any amendments or proposed changes.",REPS,<title>NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY (CUSTOMS) LEVY BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1,speech
"Andrew, Neil, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—I will follow the good example of the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) and ensure that I too do not delay the House for long, but I must mention that the legislation is before the House partially because the onion industry faced a situation where whether or not it was paying the national residue survey had not been clearly determined because the onion industry is one of those industries where the payment of the levy was dependent on the payment of other primary industry levies. In the case of the onion industry, the other primary industry levies had been set at zero.
The legislation before the House ensures that even though other levies may be set at zero, horticultural and viticultural industries and industries with a vegetable emphasis such as the onion industry will still have an obligation to meet what is necessary under the national residue survey levy.
The member for Burke has made the point that the opposition does not oppose the legislation. Clearly, the government does not oppose it or it would not have introduced it. I have an electorate in which a large number of onions are produced. I felt I should say, on behalf of the onion industry, that while some 
 producers clearly saw this as an additional charge the reality is that every Australian industry has an obligation to ensure that its obligations to meet the cost of the national residue survey are met.
I restate the comments made by the member for Burke and point out to the House that if we are to see the sort of economic recovery that each of us would seek for this country then clearly that economic recovery will have to be generated entirely by export production. The capacity for us to have adequate export production depends entirely on our ability to maintain our reputation overseas as a producer of clean and green produce.	It is self-evident that that reputation largely pivots on the way in which we are seen overseas not only as people who claim to have clean and green produce but as people whose produce will stand any survey and can prove on paper that their produce is beyond doubt residue free. The National Residue Survey Authority ought to be commended on the work it has done in maintaining the reputation of Australian primary industry overseas. Much of the success of our exports has been built on this clean and green image.
Quite frankly, not only do I represent an electorate with a reputation for growing onions but, oddly, it is also an electorate with a reputation as a wine producer. The success of Australian wine overseas has also been built on this clean and green image. It is not coincidental that the boom in wine exports to Europe followed the Chernobyl disaster when Australia was able to capitalise on that because of our clean and green image. I as a member of the government am very happy to support this legislation, to recognise the constructive remarks made by the member for Burke and, in keeping with those remarks, to seek the rapid passage of this legislation.
—Any olives in your territory?
—I do not wish to delay the House, but I do want to respond to the member for Burke by indicating that my territory, as he calls it—more accurately described as the electorate of Wakefield—is a veritable fruit bowl, in which olives, almonds and grapes are grown. It is in fact a garden of Eden. Thank you for the legislation.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—There have been a number of amendments made in the Senate which I understand have been agreed to by the government, and the opposition welcomes those. I want to touch on some of those amendments briefly because they certainly have improved the operation of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 .
The first is that a number of amendments have been made to the provisions about 
 notification. We had some problems whereby there were a range of different notification provisions in the original bill. Some required written notification; others allowed the secretary to notify recipients of the youth allowance verbally. Some required the notices to contain details of the requirements and to set out the consequences of failure to comply with the notice; others did not. Some gave the recipients seven days to comply with the requirement; others did not set any notice period.
I am pleased that the amendments ensure that all notification must be in writing, must give details of the requirements and set out the consequences of non-compliance, and give 14 days notice. It is very important that people who are in receipt of or are applying for the youth allowance have very clear requirements in doing so. I am pleased that the government has seen fit to agree to these amendments.
Another area is where people will be defined as being independent if both parents are serving a prison sentence. The amendment removes the requirement that the prison sentence be of at least 10 years. So that is a more realistic situation for young people who find themselves in that circumstance.
Another area of considerable disagreement between the major parties is about the age of independence for students, and there was considerable debate in the Senate about this issue. We do know that the government significantly increased the age of independence for students to 25 and I am very pleased that an amendment moved by the Labor opposition was successful in the Senate and has been accepted by the government so that the age of independence will be progressively reduced over time. Students will recall that Labor in government did get the age of independence down to 22. That would be much more acceptable to students than the age that the government has increased it to, which is now 25 years.
Another important amendment is that in relation to the nature of the work attachment required if a person is to be found to be independent. What we have now is that a person only needs to have earned the lower 
 amount represented by 75 per cent of the maximum Commonwealth training award, rather than the previous amount which had been in the bill, which was that young people would be expected to earn 50 per cent of average weekly earnings during a previous 18-month period to be deemed to be independent. We were of the view that that was too harsh a requirement on young people, particularly given the opportunities for work that exist out there in what is a very tough work environment, and that it represents a more realistic assessment of the independence of young people, given the wages and the work opportunities that are available to them.
Another area that we were pleased about the government accepting is the extension of exemptions in relation to those who are under 18 years of age. Members would recall that the government, when it first introduced this legislation, was determined to see that young people who did not attend school under the age of 18 would not be eligible for unemployment benefits.
We took the view that this was too harsh a measure and that there were more positive ways of encouraging young people to stay at school. We certainly are of the view that it is in the interest of young people to stay at school for as long as possible. (Extension of time granted) However, we take the view that there are positive ways to do that rather than just taking the stick to young people. We moved an amendment that would enable young people to receive their unemployment benefits if they were willing to enter case management and seek employment rather than being in full-time education. I am pleased that the government has agreed to this, because it would have been a very serious state of affairs if young people who, for whatever reason, would not or could not go back to school were unable to have any form of support. It is a very important change.
There are two issues on which we are very disappointed that the government has not seen fit to support the amendments of the opposition. One is very significant: the age of independence for unemployed adults. The age of independence is now 21 for unemployed people. We think this is a very backward step. 
 In every other walk of life, when you are 18 you are considered to be an adult—you can vote, go to war or get married. To all intents and purposes, people at the age of 18 are considered to be adults. As far as this government is concerned, that is no longer the case if they are unemployed.
This is a very backward step. It will have a significant impact on low income families, which will have to take considerable responsibility for the incomes and living standards of their adult offspring. If families on average incomes—I am talking about family incomes of $35,000 a year—have an unemployed adult living with them, that family will be $55 a week worse off because this government has decided that young people are no longer independent at the age of 18 if they cannot find a job. It is, as I said, a very backward move.
Another issue on which the government, for reasons that are beyond me, failed to accept an amendment from the opposition was the proposal to extend the income bank to young people other than students. We welcome the government's proposal to have an income bank for students. It recognises that getting access to employment is not easy for young people and that often they can get casual work, save a bit of money and keep themselves going for a while. Labor sought to have this opportunity extended to young unemployed people as well as to young students. Unfortunately, the government did not accept the amendment. That will mean that young people who are unemployed will see their living standards reduced as a result.
As I said, we are pleased that the government has accepted some of our amendments. They will improve the legislation to a degree. However, Labor will be voting against the bill again, most significantly because of the intention of the government to continue to increase the age of independence from 18 to 21 for young unemployed people. This will impose considerable burdens on their families and on the young people themselves, and it is something that we will not support.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—I rise to join the debate on the common youth allowance. As I meet with groups around my 
 electorate of Gilmore, I am greeted by a wave of support for this measure, once again demonstrating the community's support for the policies of the coalition government. There have been two public meetings in Gilmore—one in Ulladulla and one in Nowra. Both were poorly attended. In Nowra, there was only a handful of parents, and no young people were present at all, despite the meeting having been organised by local youth workers and advertised in the local media, with plenty of publicity from anti-government areas.
I say once again that, if you go beyond the hype, the facts about how such a policy will affect people in the community are basic. In my electorate, approximately 595 young people aged under 20 years of age are on newstart allowance, eight people are on sickness benefits and 232 under 20-year-olds currently receiving youth training allowance. The total number of unemployed young people which this policy may affect is 835. Many of them will receive higher payments, most will receive no change at all and some will receive smaller payments.
Aside from these people, there is another group of young people in Gilmore who will feel the impact of the introduction of the youth allowance—those who are currently students and will finally receive more funding from the youth allowance. Nationally, of the 560,000 young people throughout Australia who currently receive income support, including Austudy, 378,000 will receive the same amount of money as they currently do, 137,000 will receive more and 33,600 will receive less money. Currently, people who study receive some support under the archaic policies of the previous government, but they receive less money than those who do not have work, with no access to rent assistance and little by way of encouragement from governments in terms of financial support to continue improving their education or training.
I draw attention to the results of the Clemenger report, The silent majority, a study of the attitudes of Australian people which is conducted every two decades. These results were released recently. The comparison is startling. It supported the idea that we have a 
 pessimistic view of what is happening. Some 20 years ago, the issues of most concern to people in Australia included the length of power chords on domestic electrical equipment and the short lifespan of school textbooks. If that was all they had to worry about, no wonder people yearn for the good old days. Now, 20 years down the track, the main issues of concern include so-called dole bludgers and immigrants receiving welfare.
The Clemenger report highlighted the fact that the majority of people believed that the government was making it easier for people not to work. This is something we are addressing with our two major programs, work for the dole and the common youth allowance. I also draw attention to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Youth employment: a working solution. The report highlights the fact that the wider community these days needs to recognise that young people who do not go on to tertiary education, like the 30 per cent who do, also need the encouragement and challenge of a career.
Only 30 per cent of all Australian students go on to tertiary education, and that is where the primary focus of mainstream primary and secondary resources are still focused. That is why this government is allocating many more millions of dollars for vocational education and training, including an extra $7 million for 2,800 apprenticeships and traineeships in the Illawarra alone, to assist those who wish to follow alternative courses of employment and training. The government's common youth allowance was introduced with the intention of simplifying income support for young people and removing the disincentives in the system which stop young people from continuing their education. This, understandably, is a major contributing factor to young people successfully gaining employment.
The introduction of the common youth allowance follows concern from throughout the community, especially from young people, with regard to the discrepancies within the current system that allow young people on unemployment benefits to be treated differently from young people who receive subsidies 
 while they are studying. We received submissions from welfare groups, from community organisations, from youth groups and from parents, who were consulted when we formulated what we hope will be an answer to these concerns. The common youth allowance will simplify income support for all young people and it will replace five different payments. But, more importantly, the common youth allowance will encourage young people to continue further education. We can no longer tolerate a situation where young people drop out of school or tertiary education or training because they get more money on the dole. The community does not support it, and we certainly do not want to encourage it.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—I want to make it clear that the bill that we are addressing is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997 , which has been returned from the Senate with a number of amendments. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) spoke about those amendments that she believed had improved the bill and the number of respects in which that had occurred. She spoke on two matters which I will address—the age of independence and the access to the income bank arrangements by unemployed young people. She spoke about the extent to which this legislation does not permit the same arrangements that apply to students, and I will address that in time.
The important aspect to recognise in relation to this bill was highlighted in part by the comments of the honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash). She may have intended her speech to address the subsequent bill, for which we will be having a second reading tonight—the  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998 .
—If the honourable member rises in her place on the next bill, she may be able to speak.
—She will be heard again. That will be very welcome. The important point to note in the context of this bill which we are dealing with is that it is a big win for 
 young people. It provides a simplified system of income support which caters for the various circumstances faced by young people, while ensuring that the incentives for education and training are maximised. The measure involves very considerable additional expenditure in the social security budget, involving something of the order of $212 million over a period of four years.
—Not if you're unemployed.
—Well, it is a very considerable and large additional amount of money that is being spent that would not otherwise have been spent. That is the point that I am making. The arrangements provide positive incentives for young people to take up education and training to improve their long-term job prospects. It removes the financial incentives for young people to be on unemployment benefits rather than undertaking skills acquisition. I do not apologise for this. When I was shadow minister in the same position as the member for Jagajaga, it seemed to me that we needed to have a system in which the range of support that was given to young people in education was the same as we were giving to young people who were unemployed.
—You didn't tell them that you were going to do this.
—What we told them was that we were going to move to have an integrated system in which the range of payments would provide the same opportunities for support but would assist in encouraging young people to take up education and training. The fact is that 153,750 young Australians will receive more money under the youth allowance arrangements and 358,600 will continue to receive the same amount of money that they do now. There will be a reduction in payment for 33,250 and no payment for 12,800 due to the introduction of the parental means test, which has been raised from 18 to 21 years for unemployed.
The introduction of the parental means test means that 18- to 20-year-old unemployed people will be treated the same as other young people of the same age who are in education and training. In that sense, it is a fairer deal. It recognises that moving the age 
 of independence from 18 to 21, in effect, conforms to the modern reality. Teenagers today do not suddenly become independent at 18. More and more are staying at home longer and are taking a graduated path to independence as they move into their early twenties. The effect of increasing the age for young job seekers is to bring them closer in treatment to their student peers. I think that is the important point that needs to be understood. It was a perverse system when, to be involved in study and to prepare yourself to take up employment opportunities, you were disadvantaged.
Criticism has been made of the parental means test that applies to these young people. The most important point to note is that the threshold of $23,400 is the current threshold that applies to the youth training allowance and Austudy parental means tests; that is, the ALP when it was in government, agreed that it was reasonable for a phase-out payment to start at $23,400. It is also important to reiterate that a family does not lose all payment at $23,400; it phases out at the rate of $1 in $4. (Extension of time granted) If the parents earn around $30,000, the child still receives a reasonable amount of income support. The payment does not cut out completely until the parents earn at least $41,000. The threshold increases for every additional child in the family. If there are two older children, it increases to $27,100, meaning that income support does not cut out until $45,000. If rent assistance is payable, payment does not cut out until parents earn $58,000. So low to middle income families are not cut off as a result of these measures. They receive a payment that recognises their ability to contribute to their children's upbringing. It is a win-win situation for young people in general, and it is a vast improvement on the situation that pertained before.
In relation to the income bank, I think it is important to recognise that students do have a different pattern of earnings. They are very often only likely to be in work for limited periods—often in vacations and other holidays. So it is fair that they get special treatment under the income testing arrangements. Young unemployed people, on the other hand, 
 have an opportunity to work throughout the year. The current income testing arrangements give them an incentive to pick up casual work. They do not need to have the same special treatment that students do. That is the reason for the distinction that has been made.
We are prepared to support the bill with the amendments that have been made and approved by the Senate. I am very surprised that, having obtained some of those amendments, the opposition are intent on opposing this measure. If they intend to do so and vote on it then so be it. To us this is a very important measure. It provides a vastly simplified system and caters for the various circumstances faced by young people. It does ensure that people are not encouraged to move out of education and training in order to obtain income support through the social welfare system that they could not otherwise obtain when they were involved in the education system.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998  is the second of a two-part package which will significantly hurt families on low incomes with young unemployed adults. The first part of the package, which we have just discussed, has just passed through the parliament despite Labor's opposition to it. I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:
(1)	 forcing poor families on as little as $23,500 per annum to support their young unemployed adults following the introduction of a parental income test on unemployment benefits for 
 those aged between 18 and 21 from 1 July 1998;
(2)	 completely abolishing unemployment benefits for young unemployed adults living in families earning more than $42,000 per annum and forcing parents to find an extra $87 a week to support their adult offspring;
(3)	 adding insult to injury by labelling families caught in the parental income test, `well-off';
(4)	 cutting funding to the nation's secondary schools at the same time as young people under 18 will be forced back to school to receive the Youth Allowance;
(5)	 failing to provide the same incentives for young unemployed people to work part-time as it has provided to students;
(6)	 failing to reduce youth unemployment; and
(7)	 handing responsibility for the costs of youth unemployment back onto the nation's parents making them pay the price for unacceptable levels of youth unemployment"".
The essential points of the second reading amendment are that the Labor opposition is very concerned, even if the government is not, that the changes involved in this common youth allowance will see low and middle income families—those on incomes as low as $23,500—having to support their young unemployed adults. If the minister at the table, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), thinks as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) does that these people are well off then that just demonstrates how out of touch this government actually is.
It shows that the government has no concept of how hard it is for families in Australia to make ends meet and how much it actually costs to raise teenage children. They are not children by any other definition once they are over the age of 18. If they are out looking for work, what does it cost in public transport? In most capital cities these days people have to pay fares of $20 or $30 a week. The government has no idea of what it actually costs young people to be properly dressed and to be well organised to look for work. To say to families on incomes between $25,000 and $40,000, `You are well off, you can support your young unemployed people,' seems to be completely out of touch with reality. It is the case that families on incomes of $42,000 a year are going to have to find an extra $87 a 
 week. Nobody could say, as the Minister for Social Security has said in her public comments, that those families on incomes of that level are well off.
It is also the case that this government has been seeking to cut the benefits for those who are the least well off, who have the worst opportunities, who are unemployed. They are also being affected by this government's cuts both to secondary school and tertiary school funding. They are being forced by this government wielding a big stick to either go back to school or to seek further training. At the same time, this government is taking money away from essential services.
As my second reading amendment says, this government has done absolutely nothing to reduce youth unemployment. There has been no movement at all in the level of youth unemployment in this country since this government came to power. It does not matter how much hot air there is on it, the government is basically handing over responsibility for youth unemployment to low and middle income parents. That is really the essence of what is happening with the common youth allowance.
It seems parents around the country are going to have to cop the introduction of this youth allowance, given the votes in the Senate a few weeks ago and in the House again tonight. It will mean that the families who are struggling will be the losers. Those families are already having to come to terms with the penalty of youth unemployment. If this youth allowance goes ahead, as it now seems, from 1 July these families will face a double penalty. Families on low and middle incomes with young unemployed people will see their incomes reduced.
As if the experience of youth unemployment is not bad enough both for the young people themselves and for their families this government is intent, as we have heard from the minister tonight, on imposing another penalty on them. It is a financial penalty which will be worn by the parents of the young unemployed people. They are the ones who are actually going to bear the brunt of the cuts to unemployment benefits that this government has decided to pursue.
It is the parents who will have to make up the difference. The difference might not sound very much to the Minister for Social Security, but $55 a week for a family on average weekly earnings of $35,000—or $87 a week for families on family incomes of $42,000—is a lot of money when you have got adult offspring that you are going to have to support. It is an important point to emphasise because, as yet, families do not know what is going to happen. They do not know that after 1 July their family incomes are, all of a sudden, going down by $50 a week or $80 a week depending on their situation. You will have to fully support your child to the tune of $87 if your family income is over $42,000 and young people between the age of 18 and 21 will get absolutely nothing. There will be no assistance whatsoever for your young unemployed adult.
If you decide that you will not support your young unemployed adult, what is the government going to do about it? Absolutely nothing. As far as the government is concerned, it is the parents' responsibility. Whether those young people cannot find work has nothing to do with the government. As far as the government is concerned, this is the incentive to go and study. There are plenty of young people out there who want to actually work, who want to find work, who cannot find work because of this government's incapacity to actually improve youth employment and to get the economy going for young people. What is the government's approach to dealing with this problem? Take people off benefits; reduce family incomes. That is exactly what is going to happen.
The place at which this youth allowance starts to cut out is certainly not at a relatively well-off level, as Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security, said. Families with an income of $23,500 are poor by any definition. Certainly, if families have young unemployed people in them, they are very likely to be poor families. They are struggling to put food on the table. We are not talking about families that have a lot of choices. We are talking about families that are struggling, that do not have enough money to pay for the help that young job seekers need.
I have to say it is so hypocritical of this government. We heard so much before the last election about how this government was going to help battling families. Its cry was: `We are going to reduce unemployment and reduce youth unemployment. We are going to help battling families.' What do we have today? We have a double-barrelled attack on those battling families that have young unemployed people in them.
This government has failed to have any impact on youth unemployment. It is absolutely stuck at around 26 per cent. What is the government doing with this piece of legislation? Is it going to do anything to help youth unemployment? Absolutely not. It is handing back the responsibility for youth unemployment to the nation's parents and saying quite literally to those parents, `You pay the price for your young unemployed person being unemployed.'
On average, young people are unemployed for about five months. That means that families on average weekly earnings—that is, around $35,000—will have to find $1,100 over that five-month period to support their young adult. Of course that is just the average. There will be many young people who will be unemployed for longer than that and who will of course require even more support. But what the Howard government says to these young people is, `Bad luck if you are young and unemployed. You are not going to be considered to be independent until you are 21, so you will have to go to your parents, even though you consider yourself to be able to go out there and make decisions for yourself and try to seek your own living.' As far as this government is concerned, that is not the way it is going to be any more.
Members of the government are saying that people are welcoming this decision. They must be talking to different people from those who are writing and ringing Labor members. We have been receiving calls from all around Australia from parents saying that the government is not in touch with the way that young people and their families are living their lives. For example, a father from Tasmania said to me that his 19-year-old son was in employment but he was worried that it was not 
 stable. The minister does not seem to understand that employment for young people, just as it is for students, is very unstable. They have to take whatever they can and make the best of it. It would have been a jolly good idea if they could have had access to the income bank to stretch their money that little bit further. But that was not to be.
As this father said, he is concerned that the employment that his son has is not stable and that he may be unemployed at some time in the future. His son has actually moved out of home and has been taking the first steps towards independence. However, if his son loses his job in the first 12 months, he will not be able to get any unemployment benefits and he will have to move back home. His father cannot understand how this helps young people get on their feet to find their own way in the world. His view is that the government is simply out of touch with the way that families are living their lives.
A mother of five sent me a note the other day saying that she wants to go out and get a job herself. She has raised her children. She is saying that, if she gets a decent income, as a result of these changes she is now going to be liable to support her unemployed adult sons until they are 21. She says, `As a woman, I feel more discriminated against now than I ever have and utterly trapped by a set of inequitable and absolutely family-unfriendly policies.' But the Howard government is not listening. It is certainly not listening to the mothers and fathers of unemployed children. It is not listening to unemployed young people. It is certainly not listening to struggling families.
 It is very important to have a look at how much this government is saving as a result of this measure. When summing up in relation to the bill we have just completed, the minister said that the government is spending money. But let us go behind that statement. It is important to see who the government is spending money on and who it is taking money from. The government has been very sneaky about this. It does not give us the full treatment. It is certainly giving the parents of Australia the full treatment. They are the ones who will realise that this government is 
 saving money at the expense of the young unemployed and their parents.
 It is true that more money will be spent on students, but it is also true that the government has cut unemployment benefits to young people. You can be sure that the young students who gain are not the same people as the young unemployed who lose. That is what is so worrying about the legislation we are debating today. They are not the same people. Young students and young unemployed have very different opportunities in life.
This government is advantaging students, which is a very positive thing. We do want to see students helped to stay at TAFE or at university for as long as possible, but, goodness me, not at the expense of the young unemployed, who are the most disadvantaged in our community. By punishing the young unemployed, the impact will be felt most harshly in those areas with high youth unemployment. It will not be felt in those areas where we have a high proportion of young people at university. It is not as if these things are spread evenly across our suburbs or across regional areas. That is just not the case.
 There will be 47,650 young people who will lose as a result of this government's cuts to unemployment benefits to young adults. We do know that those benefits will be cut in very concentrated areas in the cities and in the regions. We all know that unemployment is concentrated in particular parts of this country. It is those parts of our cities and those parts of regional Australia that will be so hard hit by the changes. We also know that it is in those high schools in those areas of our cities where we are struggling hardest to keep young people at school. In this area as well this government tried to take a big stick approach to young people rather than a positive, encouraging approach.
 Figures in this area really tell the tale of what can happen when you have a positive approach. When Labor came into government in the early 1980s, school retention rates up to year 12 were just over 36 per cent—that is, 36 per cent of young people were staying on till the end of school. We put an enormous amount of encouragement into keeping young people at school. We did not take the big 
 stick to them and tell them that if they did not go to school they would not get any form of income support. That was not the approach we took.
We took a positive approach. We made it clear that you would get enormous benefits by staying at school. Ten years later, school retention rates to year 12 were over 77 per cent. That is a massive improvement in keeping young people at school. This government has only been in power for two years and we have already seen school retention rates fall to just under 72 per cent. It is already coming down because of the attitude of the Howard government, aided and abetted by many of the state governments, certainly the government in my state of Victoria.
That is a massive reduction in school retention rates in two years alone. What was this government's response to this reduction in retention rates? It was to just get out the big stick and cut the funding to government schools, reduce the opportunities for young people to stay at school and then threaten to take their unemployment benefits away from them if they refused to go to school. That approach will not be one that will see retention rates at school improve. It will have a negative effect.
 As I said in summing up the previous bill, we are pleased that the government finally saw sense and recognised that, for some young people, school is just not the place they want to be. It does not matter what size the stick might be that the government takes to them, they will not go to school. Certainly, if the government is not prepared to put the money in to help them stay at school, it is not the place they should be. It is fortunate that the government saw sense and agreed that young people could be in case management and that, where they were actively seeking work and in case management, they would be able to get unemployment benefits.
Thank goodness the government did see sense in that regard. We can only hope that, in considering future allocations to education, the government sees sense in that regard and realises that the only way it is going to encourage young people to stay at school to get the benefits of education is to put a decent 
 level of funding into secondary and tertiary education so that the opportunities that these young people need are there.
This will mean that, with the case management amendments having been agreed to, at least there is a safety net available to protect young people from falling through the net completely. What we would have had is these young people disappearing from the statistics altogether. They would not have been counted as unemployed. They would not have been counted as school students. We would not have known where they were or what they were living on or what their situation would have been.
We still have a tragic situation, though, with this bill, because it will be the case that over 47,000 young people will lose as a result of the changes by this government to the youth allowance. The government is saving money at the hands of the nation's parents and young adult unemployed people: 12,800 young people will have their benefits cut completely. They will get nothing even though they are unemployed and actively seeking work. Some 33,600 will lose some of their payment. These are young people from low to middle income families for whom, if their parents do not step in and plug the gap, the real risk and the hidden costs—because this government is not going to want to acknowledge—will be rising rates of crime, poverty and, I am sorry to say, increases in abuse.
This will be the reality of this government forcing the responsibility of youth unemployment back on to the shoulders of the parents of this country. It is a retrograde measure, particularly when we tie it together with huge concentrations of unemployment in particular places. It will lead to increases in disadvantage and, hopefully, at the next election the parents of these young unemployed people and the young adults themselves will make very clear representations to the government about it at the ballot box.

"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—It is with significant pleasure that I rise to support the government's Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998 . In terms of the principle of the government's approach, it is worth while revisiting what our priorities are as a government. The government's priority is jobs. The government's highest priority is to provide young people with jobs. Both sides of politics know that early school leavers are almost three times more likely to be unemployed than those who persist and stay on in school and go on to further training, tertiary studies, et cetera.
The new youth allowance will make it more attractive for young Australians to study and train rather than be enticed, if you like, onto the unemployment benefit. Under the coalition, there will be 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships this year. It is clearly not a savings measure, and I note the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) acknowledged that in her speech. In fact, more will be spent on young people to the extent of $25 million on this program in the first year.
As of 1 July 1998, the single youth allowance will provide income support for young people, including students, those looking for work and those who are sick. Rental assistance will be paid to 60,000 students who have to live away from home to further their education or training. This will be a particular benefit to students from rural and regional Australia. Some 10,000 young people who are genuinely homeless or independent will receive the allowance plus rent assistance. The youth allowance replaces Austudy, newstart allowance, youth training allowance, sickness allowance and more than the minimum rate of family payment for secondary students in a variety of age groups.
Looking at Labor's record, Labor provided financial incentives for young people to leave school and go on to the unemployment benefit. Regrettably, there is a very strong belief in the community, regularly brought to my electorate office, that Labor's policy actually encouraged youth unemployment. Under the previous government, youth unemployment increased to a staggering 32.3 per 
 cent. That was more than five per cent higher than when they came into office.
I presume the New South Wales government was involved with the states and the Commonwealth endeavouring to have a look at what these statistics comprise. There is little point in this place taking political points on youth unemployment because we have used it against each other—that is, both sides of politics. I have not done any research in detail, but I am particularly interested in what the Commonwealth and the states are looking at in terms of assessing the youth unemployment figures. There cannot be anything much more demoralising than young people in Australia constantly hearing these rather pathetic figures.
Moving on, it is worth looking at the reaction. I will give a few quotes which I think are very worth while. The Herald Sun on 9 June 1997 stated:
The federal government's reforms to youth welfare payments are welcome. This age group is much too young to begin life in an environment which could lead them into the mistaken belief that the world owes them a living.
The Daily Telegraph , 18 June 1997, stated:
The federal government's new youth allowance program will end the rorting of using the dole as pocket money for a few months and possibly a few years of loafing around.
The Financial Review  from a similar period in 1997 stated:
The federal government's decision should be vigorously applauded. The changes are weighed toward solid Australian values of responsibility and hard work. The existing system has clearly not worked.
I will finish with a quote from the Sydney Morning Herald . The Brotherhood of St Laurence stated:
We have been asking for better support for this group of young people for many years and finally their needs are starting to be recognised.
There we have the youth allowance, Labor's record, and the public response over the last six to nine months. Obviously it has been out there in the community and much discussed in that period.
In the brief period remaining to me, I will just give a few personal observations. I have 
 four children, all of adult age. My eldest child, after a couple of years at university, found that the direction was not quite what she was looking for. She came back home to refocus and worked and became an enrolled nurse for no pay. She took a job as a barmaid in the community, working up to 80 to 90 hours a week. There was quite a remarkable transformation in my daughter in that she suddenly found a focus, a clear direction, and she discovered her independence, her self-reliance and her self-respect. I would suggest that it was really a turning point in her life.
The next I will mention is my eldest son, who had a couple of false starts. He became unemployed and then gradually rebuilt his life. He developed skills in journalism with some self-employment thrown in. Now he is doing quite well in his journalism at a city newspaper. Once again, he basically built it from his own determination.
My second son had limited support from his parents—that is, his mother and me. He got work as a bouncer—he is a fairly big lad, so he was able to do that all right. He played a bit of football and gradually built his life to where he is now, which is in steady employment. My third son is currently at university. He has created a lot of his own resources by doing the night fill at Bi-Lo, a local Adelaide metropolitan store.
I guess that is the picture for many Australians. We talk a lot about low income earners. I suggest to the House that there are many of us who have been low income earners as parents who have watched, and agonised over, their children growing up to see what they might become. For me, there is absolutely no substitute for seeing my children get their independence, their self-reliance, through actually getting out there and having a go from the age of 15, 16, 17 or 18. I am sure this package of youth allowance does offer many positives to young people, but there is still that sense of independence and sense of self-reliance that I am sure the government is trying to encourage in young people which will develop those young people with the sorts of values that will serve Australia well in the future.
The bill is well structured. The principles that I have indicated are well known. As has been said by the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash)—I will not repeat it, but I will say it in percentages to remind people—of the 560,000 young Australians who are recipients of income support from the Commonwealth new youth allowance, 64 per cent will receive the same level of payment, 27.5 per cent will receive more, six per cent will receive less, two per cent will receive no payment because their parents earn above the cut-off point and 0.5 per cent will receive no payment because they will opt not to return to study, will seek work and will not qualify for an exemption. In all of that, remember that 416,000 of the 560,000 are students and 144,000 are unemployed or receiving an unemployment benefit.
In the very brief time available to me, I would like to congratulate the government on its preparation of this legislation, its presentation to the House and the widespread community support that it is receiving. In the context of the budgetary situation we inherited, it is quite a remarkable performance to actually be in here tonight looking at the fact that many young Australians are going to see a far brighter future by this policy, considering that we inherited that $10 billion debt in 1996.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I should touch, firstly, on the comments of the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). They really do reflect so carefully and so accurately the hypocrisy that we are hearing from this government. Let us think through what he just said. He said that unemployment benefits were an incentive to leave school, that unemployment benefits encourage youth unemployment. Yet he knows, as well as I do, that when we came to government the retention rate was 36 per cent, just over a third. In other words, two-thirds of young people left school at year 10 or before. When we left government, that had been reversed. Where was the incentive? What cant and hypocrisy are we talking about? We doubled the number of people staying at school, and somehow he suggests that we gave them incentives to leave school.
That is the kind of pedagoguery we are getting in this government. That is the kind of hypocrisy, deceit and dishonesty we are seeing. We are seeing it day after day, week after week. They think that, if they keep repeating it, it will make it true. It does not make it true. That is not just false, it is malicious.
There are similar things about the extra money. He did not say how much the government cut previously. How much was saved in Austudy by extending the age of independence to 25, so a young person starting a university course at 24 would be dependent on their parents until they finished perhaps four, five or six years later? How much did they save on that? The 100,000 apprenticeships they are talking about have been rebadged, given a new name; therefore, it makes it a new program. It does not increase the numbers. This is the kind of gross cant that we have become so used to.
What the government is doing is not just dishonest and it is not just a bit of fudging around the edges; it is massive deception on a massive scale. I am quite frankly sick to death of it because what it says is, `Here is one more group we can victimise. Here is one more little group who can be got at and whom we can blame.' 
In other words, government members are saying that youth unemployment is all the fault of young people. Government members are saying that these kids would all have jobs if they got off their butts and did something. That is what the previous speaker, the member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), was saying. Government members are saying, `It's the fault of the unemployed young people and, worse than that, it is the Labor government's fault because it gave them some money.' We attempted to give them some self-respect, some sense of dignity. Unemployment is a matter of choice, according to the government members. Tell that to the 900,000 people out there without jobs. Tell them it is a matter of choice, and particularly tell those young people who are the most vulnerable.
I think it is interesting that last week we were debating the aged care and residential care legislation and this week we are debating 
 the youth allowance legislation. Someone once said—and I forget the wise person who said this—that the best way to judge a society is how they treat their young and their old. I tell you what: how this government treat their young and their old is pretty abysmal.
Western society has gone through massive changes in the last two or three decades. The nature of work has changed, the kinds of jobs people do have changed and the nature of families has changed. Across the globe, we are seeing countries and governments grappling with the speed of change, and it has been difficult. We have been forced to refocus our education systems, forced to rethink what we mean by society and forced to understand the alienation that is taking place. We have watched family breakdowns occur at an increasing rate, and that has generated instability. We have seen the relatively recent phenomenon of homelessness, the issues of drug and substance abuse and a whole range of other social changes. This is not just in Australia; this is across the globe. Whether one reads the English press, the German press or the American press, one sees similar phenomena occurring. They are occurring in different manifestations, but the kinds of changes that are taking place are remarkably similar.
We in government took the view that these changes needed to be understood and accommodated so that the sense of impermanence was not made permanent, so that these changes were seen to eventually be absorbed and accommodated by a stable society. In that context, unemployment benefits are still seen by this side of the chamber as a temporary matter. They are not and must not be accepted as a permanent state. Society's objectives must still be to actively and fully engage all of its people who wish to work. That must be the objective. The day we start to accept that unemployment is a permanent situation—particularly for young people—and that there is no support available to correct it is the day that this society starts to devour itself, and that is what this government has just done with this legislation. It is saying to these young people, `It's your own fault. There is no help. You and your parents can look after 
 yourselves. You are not part of our society.' They are being rejected. There is no sense of responsibility for what is occurring. There is no sense of acceptance that society creates the jobs, not the family. The responsibility has been transferred from society back to the individual, and it will be putting individual against individual and family against family. The generation of hate-mongering and scapegoating that is going on now has substantial long-term consequences.
In the same way, the government are saying to old people and their families, `If you need a nursing home, bad luck. You've got to pay for it.' Only a small number, less than half the number who need access to nursing home care, will get it. For the rest of them, it is up to their families. The government are saying that it is not their responsibility. In the same way they are telling that to old people, they are saying to young people, `If you can't get work, that's your own problem.' For a very small number—those in a very low income household, which is classified as below $23,500 for 16- and 17-year-olds in full-time education and training—there will be help. The idea somehow that that is, therefore, a reasonable income is preposterous, and we know it.
The numbers show that 12,000 young people left school at age 16 and 17. The idea somehow is that they left school because there was some incentive and that they are unemployed because they want to be. The idea that school or full-time education is the right place to be for every 16- and 17-year-old has never been put forward by any government in the past. Never. In fact, we were being criticised in government for encouraging people who perhaps should have been leaving school to stay at school. Full-time education and training means either being at school or being in full-time TAFE. So if this government were in any way genuine, they would be associating this program with the other side of the program—which is providing places for those 12,000 16- and 17-year-olds who are in a low income household. For them, there will be no funding at all unless they are in full-time education or training.
But do we see any programs at all to actually accommodate them? Do we see extra money for schools? In many cases, these young people are problematic. You can take the incidence, for example, of the early onset of schizophrenia, and let me quote some figures. The average age for the diagnosis of mental illnesses is below 20. The mean age for the diagnosis of many mental illnesses is 16. The percentage of young people having mental health problems is not high. It is not sufficient to warrant them being treated as a medical problem, but it is certainly enough to cause difficulties in a school context.
The idea that somehow every young person under 16 or 17 should stay in full-time training or at school has never been put forward. In fact, the government itself does not even say that. It does not even pretend that; it just ignores it. What it does say is that, unless they are in full-time education and training, there will be no programs at all and, for the programs that are there, the funds will start to cut out when the income reaches $23,500.
We are going to see a massive problem for parents with 16- and 17-year-olds who are unable to access education and training because of their personal circumstances, whether it be a learning disability, a behavioural problem, a mental problem or the fact that they have been the victim of a family breakdown, which traumatises so many of our young people in so many cases. Whatever the reason, the fact is that there will be no program at all, full stop. For those who can access education, there are no places anyhow because the government has no funding out there to make sure that these people are picked up. So it cuts out the support and locks the door on access.
Then the government starts to tell us what a wonderful new innovation this is, how good this is and how this is going to help. This legislation is designed to create non-persons. Those families in this situation with children who are 16 and 17 years of age are going to face great problems at a time of great family stress. Anybody who has had children go through that age knows how difficult it can be for so many young people, both male and female. 
We look at the figures on youth suicide and to a person in this place we all express our horror and shock. We say, `What's happening to our young people? What's causing it?' I chaired a parliamentary inquiry into youth homelessness and I have a fair idea of what causes it. This will not help. This kind of rejection and alienation will not help. Saying to a 16-year-old, `You are on your own. If your parents won't feed you, tough luck. If your parents can't afford you, that's your own problem and theirs,' is great for their self-esteem and for making them feel confident and optimistic!
These problems are caused by a sense of helplessness and hopelessness. They are being induced by a hapless and heartless government. From now on, every time I hear one member of the government talking about youth suicide, I will be saying, `Hypocrite, hypocrite, hypocrite and poppycock!' How dare they come in here and start talking about the problems of youth when they are the cause. They will be causing, increasingly, problems in our families now.
Of course, the other group affected by this legislation and these changes is the 18- to 20-year-olds. Again, they have a similar problem, but in some ways it is of a worse nature because, by the age of 18, 19 or 20, most younger Australians have a fair sense of independence. They have a fair idea of who they are, what they want to be and, in many cases, they are still living at home. The average age of children leaving home is increasing; it is now almost 18. But the majority of them will not want to live at home. They will want to express their independence in some form. If they are not in full-time training and education and under Austudy, they will be looking for work. And they would love a job.
There are very few Australians who do not want to have a decent living standard, a decent car, a decent set of clothes and to eat decent food. I always find difficult the idea that people somehow choose to live in poverty. I do not know many people who want to live badly. I do not meet many people who say, `I live in poverty by choice. It's a great idea and I think it's wonderful; I recommend 
 it to all my friends.' I do not meet many people like that. I do meet some people who say, `I have spent the last year looking for a job. I make the most of what I've got. I don't have much choice about it, but I make the most of it and put a bright face on things.' But I do not recall meeting anybody who chose to live in poverty. Yet the implication here is that people make that kind of choice.
Families with offspring of 18, 19 or 20 years of age who are earning more than $23,500 will start to find a decreasing level of community support. In other words, they are no longer young Australians; they are still dependent kids. The government is telling young people that at 19 and 20 years of age they are still kids and that their parents will look after them. Let me tell members of the government: that will come back to haunt many families because both the parents and the children are trying to negotiate and develop a pathway to independence. That is what they are trying to do under difficult circumstances with a massive shortage of employment, but they are trying to negotiate a reasonable, sensible level of independence for those young Australians who then become the next generation. What the government is saying to those people is, `You are not part of our society; we don't feel responsible.'
This victim bashing, blaming and scapegoating has become so common, and we are seeing it across sectors. We have seen the cuts in funding to residential care for the aged. We have seen the cuts in funding to child care, and that has been horrific and will have long-term implications for the way in which we function as a society. We have seen the cuts in funding for employment support. Working for the dole, of course, has been one of the prime examples, and we note from the figures that a substantial number of the relatively small number of people who are being piloted are in fact being forced to participate because it is undignified and demeaning. We have seen increases in HECS charges for education. We have seen cuts to university funding, and we have seen cuts to TAFE. We have seen cuts in the very area we are hearing about.
We are seeing the increasing exploitation of young people in the work force. We all know about it. I defy anybody in this parliament to tell me that they are not aware of a case of a young person who is working for below the award or not getting overtime or not telling the taxation department or still getting some social security. I defy anybody in this place to tell me that they have not heard of that happening. Let me tell you that exploitation is increasing. The more we make young people vulnerable, the more they will regard our laws as stupid and the more they will defy them. You make them defy the laws on taxation and then they start to defy the laws on property. Laws are all the same and we are the ones who make them.
If this parliament makes stupid, uncaring, thoughtless and insensitive laws and tells young people they should respect it, we know what their answer will be. The increased exploitation in employment of those young people by their elders, and in many cases respected business people, should be a source of real concern to this parliament. This government says, `It's their own fault. They can negotiate their own wages.' The government's whole body language and the message it gives to both young people and employers is that employers should pay them as little as they need to. Young people get as much as they can negotiate. That is what this is about. We are seeing here the working poor, but it is unofficial. In America it is official. Here it is still under the counter, but it is happening and in increasing numbers.
What is the long-term effect of all this? We have changed the structures. We are changing CES. On 1 May we will see a massive change there. Hundreds of thousands of people will no longer have access to income support. We are seeing cuts to things such as AYPAC, the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition. This organisation is being defunded so it cannot help coordinate, guide and advocate policy on behalf of young people. We are seeing cuts in all the support systems out there that are trying to negotiate, argue and understand the problems of youth. We are seeing access to the homeless program and the various other schemes that were available 
 to try to help families in difficulty being chopped around. We are seeing cuts in the Family Court. We are seeing charges being placed on counselling and a whole range of activities that were supposed to help families. We are seeing cuts in funding for mediation services that, again, were helping families in difficulty. On one hand we are cutting direct funding and, on the other, we are removing the structures that help hold our families together, albeit insufficiently.
What this government is about is dismantling, piece by piece, both the social structure and the collective responsibility for our individuals—it is saying, `We share with you your problems'; it is saying to a family with young people, `We share with you. If they can't get work, we take some responsibility.' This is a government that says, `We have no responsibility. It's all their own fault.' Speaker after speaker has said that we should blame the victims—sheet it back home to them—and that is disgraceful.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Marek, Paul, MP",NP,1998-03-30,"—I took a few notes as I listened to the speech by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), and I have to question some of the points he made—whether he was actually informed or whether he spoke merely to pass the time. What concerns and worries me about this place is that people come in here and comment on various issues and, ultimately, they are absolutely wrong. The previous speaker broached a few topics, particularly the extra money for schools. What he said was misleading. We announced last year $42 million extra to assist schools to absorb the extra students. His statements and comments were baseless. One has to question people when they speak on these topics.
Regarding the youth allowance, the previous speaker indicated basically that if the parents of young people would not feed them it was tough luck. Again, that was completely misleading. A safety net is in place to secure these things. Irrespective of whether youth are disabled, have left home or have been kicked out of home—whatever it is—there is a safety net in place and they will receive support. The member's statements were baseless. 
 People like that should be condemned for taking such a line.
I have encouraged many local communities in Capricornia to present me with options or the concerns they have regarding the introduction of the new youth allowance. As a result, I am in receipt of a number of submissions from the communities detailing their concerns. I have a letter listing the concerns of both parents and young people. Many of them come from the township of Moranbah, which is a mining town in the north of my electorate. These people said that, overall, they considered the introduction of the youth allowance to be a step in the right direction. However, they did raise concerns about the impact and effect the youth allowance will have on families—the educational system and the social impact on rural areas. I think that fair is fair: they are prepared to bring these points forward and I have an obligation and a responsibility to raise some of them today.
—Hear, hear! Vote with us.
—I certainly will not be voting with the Labor Party on this. Ultimately, it gets down to the fact that we can keep doing the same thing all the time and we do not go ahead. That was the problem with the previous Labor government's 13 years in office. It did the same thing over and over. I guess it comes back to the point made by the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) about painting rocks. We have to put new initiatives in place. We have to give new incentives so that the youth of this great nation have an opportunity to move ahead. We cannot keep doing the same things over and over again. We have to give them new opportunities. That is what this government is all about.
Some of the concerns expressed included the effect the youth allowance will have on families with young people, those experiencing family difficulties. It was felt by the group that many 15- to 17-year-olds will be severely disadvantaged if the youth allowance is to be paid to their parents, and/or if they are no longer assessed as independent they may be forced to return to a difficult family situation for financial reasons. I will go through all the points that these people have 
 brought forward. I am more than sure that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), representing the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), has broached these topics, but I will put them on the record so the opportunity for them to be addressed is there.
We must have a contingency plan in place to deal with this type of problem because some people could get caught out. We have to make sure that a safety net is in place. It was suggested that the government should take this factor into consideration and look at ways to assist members of these families, especially in rural areas.
—Hear, hear!
—That is right; thank you very much. Youth in rural areas in particular could have to return to a difficult family situation.
Concern was also expressed about the further drain of young people from rural areas to the cities—because of the lack of jobs, training facilities and volunteer activities—and in particular about the effects on the towns as a result of this drain. Our rural towns are struggling to retain people in their midst. When jobs go, so do the people. A number of towns in Capricornia have survived simply because of the mines. But, as we all know in this House, the mining industry is facing a downturn because of the Asian financial crisis and the deflated price of commodities, and workers are being laid off.
Unfortunately, there are no other jobs in these areas because they are basically straight-out mining towns. That is what they do. When the mine is gone, the town is gone. It is as clear as that. There are no other industries; they are strictly mining towns. As we see a downsizing in the mining industry, we see some of these towns start to fall away as well. Parents have to stay because that is their place of work, and the youth obviously have to move away. As I said, there are no other jobs, so the miners sell up and move to a town where they can get a job. When hundreds of workers go this way, the town suffers. Of course, the other businesses in the township close down due to lack of trade. In the end, you end up with a ghost town scen 
 ario, and it is very difficult to keep young people there or even to attract anyone to the town.
Concern was raised about the actual financial capability of ordinary and lower income families with several children to support and how they might support all of their children adequately, especially those wishing to undertake tertiary study. It was felt that these families will be less able to support their children financially due to relocation costs, costs of accommodation, assisting with the purchase of text books and living expenses, as well as the increase in HECS fees. They feel that the result may well be that the education will be elitist and that these people will not be able to access a reasonable education for their children.
Another point made by the people of the mining town was the possibility of discrimination against young people whose parents are higher wage earners, such as the people in the mining industry. Even under the increased income allowable under the youth allowance, higher wage earners will continue to be discriminated against, despite their higher tax contributions. While wages are high, the level of debt is equally high. Most miners cannot afford to support their children to relocate initially and cannot assist with everyday expenses to undertake training or jobsearch activities. I raised this matter during my last speech on the youth allowance when I said that I would like to see the income allowable raised to $50,000 instead of the $41,000 proposed. At least this would provide some relief for the higher wage earner.
With regard to the education system, they had negatives as well. Concern was raised about the stress and emotional effects during the transition period of re-entry into the education system by young people, particularly those returning to complete school to year 12 to fulfil their mutual obligation. These young people have already chosen to leave the schooling system. Together with their fellow students and their teachers they will need extra assistance to cope with these changes. This could take the form of education sessions for existing students and extra training or behavioural management training 
 to include more discipline to help teachers cope with disruptive students.
Concern was also raised about the effects within the classroom and school situations themselves when students aged 15 to 18 years attend school solely to obtain the youth allowance. It was felt that further means of managing difficult behaviours and more disciplinary measures will need to be implemented for the benefit and safety of both students and teachers.
I could not agree more with my constituents as far as some of those points are concerned. They are valid points that were raised. As I said, we will put them on the public record. Then we will have the opportunity to address the issues and take some of the heat out of the debate. I guess that is one of the biggest problems with any of these issues: once something new is introduced, particularly in relation to change, people are somewhat concerned about what they will end with. So the idea is to answer all the questions and take the heat out of the debate. I congratulate the minister on having the goodwill to be able to do that.
There was also a suggestion that the education system employ specialist teachers to teach living and budgeting skills, especially to those students who are not academically minded. In relation to teaching respect, discipline and self-discipline, there was a suggestion that all young people under the age of 18 undertake two years of military training or the like—
—Ha!
—in order to learn respect for themselves and others and the importance of discipline and self-discipline. This could become a category under the youth allowance. It is interesting to hear the member over here comment on that. I find it absolutely amazing that you are laughing when it is the people from the mining town who have brought up these points. These are not my points of view; they are their points of view. I think it is absolutely disgraceful to think that you would not give the people—and some of them may even be from your side of politics—the time of day to be able to have their points of view 
 heard. I find that a bit distasteful, but what more can you expect?
Once again, I raised this matter last year. I believe all young people aged 18-plus who do not have a job, are not studying at school or in further education, are not in a work for the dole or Green Corps project, should be eligible for some form of national service.
—Compulsory?
—Ask the member for Werriwa.
—That's interesting. We actually have a situation where the member for Werriwa is interested!
—I ask members to direct their remarks through the chair.
—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate the fact that I am being heard in silence. I do not want to see a lot of young people running round with guns and packs on their backs, but I do want to see a more disciplined society and believe that this is one way to achieve that goal.
Concern was also raised about how the government will ascertain the level of unemployment among young people after the youth allowance has been introduced. Although this is neither here nor there as far as the other problems raised are concerned, it is something the government should consider.
In closing, I have similar concerns to my constituents. On their behalf, I call on the government to note some of these concerns and put in a form of safety net to make sure these concerns do not deteriorate to the detriment of our communities. I and the people of Capricornia believe that we must do something to address the current problem of youth unemployment and the general progression we see today of youth on to unemployment benefits. We must make a significant change or ultimately nothing changes. As I said before, we must do something. I ask that we be sharp enough to address any issues that arise during the implementation of the youth allowance so that, if some youth do become disenfranchised, they do not fall through the safety net. This government does have a strong social policy. It does work closely to 
 community obligation. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—I rise to oppose the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance) Bill 1997  in spite of the fact that the government has accepted some of the Labor Party amendments which have improved the bill from the first time it was in this House. I think that measures such as removing the independence age for young unemployed from 18 up to 21 is a regressive measure and is one which I cannot support.
There has been discussion here tonight, including some from the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), who has articulated over a period of 10 to 15 minutes a critique of the problems with this government's legislation. The member for Capricornia pointed out that it would bring about particular disadvantage to young people from rural areas. He pointed out that it might force some young people back into unacceptable family situations. He pointed out that young people, particularly in disadvantaged communities, could suffer from this program. He pointed out that the level of income—$23,000 is the cut-off rate for making the parents look after their young adults from 18 to 21—was too low and that it should be increased. Indeed, he put forward a number of reasons why this is rotten legislation.
I say to the member for Capricornia that he is right in all those criticisms and that he should, therefore, vote against this legislation because it is bad legislation, it is discriminatory legislation and it is unfair legislation. Unfortunately, though, the member for Capricornia did put up his alternative, which was to introduce compulsory conscription for a period of two years for people who were not in education or in employment from 18 to 20 years.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I did not say anything at all about putting forward compulsory conscription. That is his view, not mine.
—There is no point of order.
—I think that the member for Capricornia said that he would be very happy with the alternative vision of a society, led by the member for Capricornia, of young people who did not have a job or were not in education and training goosestepping up and down the streets of Rockhampton, in their army fatigues, with their backpacks on, all marching to the tune sung by the member for Capricornia. I put it to the member and I put it to this House that that is not an acceptable way to go.
Earlier tonight, the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) said, `There've been a couple of public meetings in my electorate and the young people are not out there demonstrating; there's not this massive movement against this legislation.' That is possibly the case, but what we are talking about is that the young people most discriminated against by this legislation are the disenfranchised in society. They are those who have been left behind, who have not been able to secure a job or have not been able to secure an ongoing place in education.
The ideological view which permeates and underpins this legislation is that somehow, if you just force young people to stay in education through economic means, then they will be better educated and therefore will stay off the unemployment list and in a fake way bring down the level of unemployment. They will also save the government money because the government will not be supporting these young Australians; it will be up to struggling parents, some of whom might be on only $24,000 a year.
After examining the provisions contained in this and in the government's previous bill, it has really dawned on me what the major difference is between the Labor opposition and the coalition government. We believe in an inclusive society. We believe that not all members of our nation are born with the same privileges. Labor seeks to redress inequality and privilege so that all Australians can have equal opportunity. Labor believes that the way to ensure equal opportunity is for the government to play a legitimate role. We believe it is the government's responsibility to provide 
 resources for education, training, infrastructure and jobs.
Government members interjecting—
—The mob over there believes in an exclusive society. In their model world, trust accounts flourish as the wealthy avoid tax. People who are born with less money and less access to resources are not helped by the government. The coalition government believes that certain people must fend for themselves—young Australians, people from non-English speaking backgrounds and indigenous people.
The government likes to pretend that most ordinary Australians come from the North Shore of Sydney, have easy access to education and training, and have family trusts to look after them so that they do not need parental assistance. If they are not immediately employed, they can always fall back on that trust account to see them through the hard times—and 17 members of the government frontbench have family trusts. The fact is that this is not the case for ordinary Australians. They do not have family trusts. Ordinary Australians contribute in a positive way to society.
—On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: in terms of relevance, I am not sure whether the honourable member realises that we are discussing the youth allowance. So far, I have not heard him mention the term. He is going off on all sorts of tangents. I ask you to bring him to order.
—I thank the honourable member. I am sure the honourable member for Grayndler will address the bill.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am certainly addressing the bill. This bill would mean that parents on $24,000 a year who have a young unemployed Australian will have to support that young person. I am pointing out to the government that not all parents will have family trusts to fall back on. In the original bill brought before the House in November last year, the government initiated changes that would leave without an income all 16- and 17-year-olds who leave school without completing year 12. This was 
 one of the most cold-hearted actions to date from this government.
—On a point of order: the member for Grayndler is mentioning family trusts. This is a bill relating to youth allowance.
—What is your point of order?
—His comments are irrelevant.
—I thank the honourable member for Dawson. Resume your seat. The honourable member for Grayndler will speak to the bill.
—I will certainly continue to speak to the bill. Maybe the member for Dawson has a family trust as well and is upset with this.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order—
—Order! The member for Dawson will resume her seat. There is no point of order.
—There is. I do not have a family trust. I demand an apology, Mr Deputy Speaker.
—No, I am not going to insist on that. It is the role of the chair to decide whether anything is unparliamentary. That is not unparliamentary. I suggest that the member for Dawson should not raise trivial points of order.
—I certainly feel sorry for the member for Dawson if she does not have a family trust. She is out of step with her frontbench—you need a family trust to get on the frontbench of this government.
This government has totally failed to understand the reasons why young people leave school. In evidence tendered to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, the Salvation Army had a lot to say about why young Australians leave school early. Contrary to government opinion, it is not because they want to have a good time at public expense. According to some people on the other side, the Salvation Army is a radical organisation, but the fact is that it is more in touch with young Australians than this 
 government. The Salvation Army said to the Senate inquiry:
They flee the school system because for them school has for some years been an experience with which they are not coping. More young people flee the school system because . . . they feel they do not belong there and because they feel they are not wanted there then they flee the school system seeking income support.
The minority report of the Senate committee concluded that early school leaving was caused by a number of contributing factors which included:
. . . young people's family and emotional problems, violence and sexual abuse, alcohol and other drugs, alienation and depression, inappropriate curriculum and pedagogy and unsuitable learning environments.
As the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and other members of the Labor Party reiterated so often throughout the passage of this bill last year, the coalition government seems hell bent on hurting those in our community who most need support. The federal government's plan was to force young people to remain at school, whilst at the same time refusing to spend any money on additional resources to help the school system cope with an estimated 20,000 additional students.
It appeared that the government's only measure of success was how much money it could save. It was going to cut unemployment benefits for 16- and 17-year-olds, whilst continuing to cut education and training programs. No attention was to be paid to why young Australians left school early. No attention was to be paid to how the government could play its important role of assisting young Australians rather than hurting them.
Some of the weakest members of our society—the young unemployed—were destined to receive absolutely no help from this heartless government. It was morally imperative that the Labor Party had a victory on this point. The Senate successfully amended the legislation, providing some exemptions under the act for 16- and 17-years-olds. The government now exempts young people from the requirement of being in either full-time education or training if there are exceptional circumstances which make it unreasonable for the young person to participate in full-time 
 education and training—and this includes instances of case management.
Although this is a small victory for those who believe in an inclusive society and who believe that the government has a role in helping people in society, it is still a far cry from a system that treats young people fairly. The exemptions that have been forced upon the government are still at the discretion of the secretary. Add this to the government's slashing of the case management program, and the future for Australia's young unemployed looks very dim indeed.
The second major inequity that the government's youth allowance changes have brought is the decision that most young people are not independent under this legislation until the age of 21. This means that the government will impose parental income, assets and means tests for young unemployed people under the age of 21. As the shadow minister for social security, the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), has already pointed out, this means that the government is effectively forcing parents to pay unemployment benefits for their children. The government is trying to shift the responsibility for supporting the unemployed to the unemployed person's family.
It can be argued that this amounts to privatising unemployment benefits by stealth. Instead of `user pays' it has become `family pays'. For a government that so heartily supports the idea of the family unit, this seems an unbelievable financial and emotional burden to place on the families of Australia. I would have thought that the members of the Lyons Forum opposite would have joined me in supporting the family structure by opposing the erosion of support for the family that this bill represents.
The Howard government is relinquishing its responsibility. It has slashed $4.2 billion from education and training. It is slashing the very programs that help create and maintain employment in this country. At the same time, it is reducing benefits available to those who are unemployed. This government is not about creating jobs, and it is also not about supporting the jobless. Under the government's new legislation, 12,800 young people will lose all 
 their income support from the government; 33,250 will have their benefits reduced; and 1,600 under 18s will get no payment whatsoever—zero—from this government.
The difference between this heartless government and the Labor Party is that we believe that young people deserve better. We believe that all young Australians, regardless of wealth, deserve equal access to jobs, education and training. The shadow minister for education and training, the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), stated that an ALP government would:
Reinstate and expand the Students at Risk (STAR) program, which was specifically designed to identify and assist young people at risk of leaving school early.
Secondly, Labor would:
Restore the specific equity programs for disadvantaged schools, with a commitment of additional resources, specialised programs and Labor's initiatives for a Parents as Educators program.
We would also guarantee funding for the jobs pathway program beyond the current fiscal year. We would facilitate school and industry partnerships at a local level, so that employers work with young people and with teachers, schools and structures, and the community work with local job creation to ensure that young people have somewhere to go when they leave school if they choose not to go into higher education. Further, Labor would resume the pattern of growth funding for TAFE established by the previous Labor government, which has been undermined by those opposite.
The Labor Party believes in a fair Australia with equal opportunity for all. We also believe in an inclusive society, where all young Australians have access to employment, education and training regardless of wealth and structural disadvantage. This government does not believe in an inclusive society. It believes in a Darwinian image of survival of the fittest, where government sits back and allows the free market to reign supreme.
Free market economics does not lead to a just society, or a fair one. The government has a role to intervene and assist people, particularly young unemployed people, to find their place in society. A completely free 
 market approach leads to a society where inequality flourishes, and where most people never gain access to the privileges enjoyed by the few. Tonight's debate has been very robust. The attitudes of the member for Capricornia, the member for Dawson and others who have been angered by my comments tonight are examples of what the division is about in this House. On the one hand the Labor Party argues for government intervention; argues for support for young Australians; and argues for job creation and income support. On the other hand, this legislation argues that young people of 20 years of age are not independent and should rely upon their parents; and that parents of 20-year-old Australians should provide income support until they reach an age of 21.
The income cut-in point is just over $23,000, so if parents are on $24,000 they miss out. They are seen to be somehow too wealthy—and this from a government which has been defending a minister who forgets about $2 million worth of shares here and a couple of hundred grand made there. They forget about that. At the next election I would be quite happy to argue our vision of society as opposed to that of the member for Capricornia, who advocated tonight young Australians in army fatigues being forced to goosestep up and down the streets of Rockhampton for a compulsory two years' conscription. That is their alternative. I believe that governments should do much better.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,1998-03-30,"—I appreciate this opportunity to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998  tonight. In my view, the youth allowance is a significant and positive social reform. From memory, it was the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) who summed up the spirit behind the youth allowance reforms. He said that it is not about putting the unemployed down; it is about bringing students up, giving them incentives to stay in school, providing training courses and maximising their skills and qualifications before they tackle the job market. I think that it is a simple but accurate way of describing what this reform package 
 is all about. For the first time, income assistance for students will be brought up to the level of unemployment payments. Students will also, for the first time, be able to access rent assistance.
The Labor Party does not like to admit this, but the level of income support or unemployment benefits young people can potentially access acts for a small but significant number as an incentive not to pursue further or higher education or training but rather to drop out and go onto the dole. Whether we like it or not, there are some people who make unemployment a way of life. There are some people who find it easier to pick up a fortnightly social security payment rather than work hard to find a job.
The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) outlined some of the Liberal Party's principles in this regard at the national convention in Brisbane earlier this year. Among other things, he said:
We believe that the family unit is the bedrock of our society. We believe in the work ethnic. We believe in rewarding hard work and achievement.
I believe that each of these principles is tied up in what this government's youth allowance reforms are all about. We do believe in rewarding hard work, but at the same time we recognise that we have a responsibility to encourage people, particularly young people and young adults, to contribute and to engage in hard work. That is why we are tightening the activity retirements for job seekers, increasing the penalties for not adequately looking for work and introducing the job seeker diary.
Conversely, this is also why we have consolidated and simplified voluntary work provisions, allowing and even encouraging people to undertake voluntary work as part of their activity test. This is also why we have introduced the youth allowance reforms which remove the disincentives that exist in the current system which can actually encourage young people to stay on the dole rather than take up study or engage in rigorous job search activity. The Herald Sun newspaper got it right in their editorial of 19 June last year when it said:
Not the least of the anomalies in the system today is the fact that, in some cases, young people are 
 paid more to stay on the dole than go on Austudy. This absurdity ignores the reality that young people with the least education face the biggest hurdle in getting jobs.
We want to reward hard work, as the Prime Minister said. We also want to move away from the culture of welfare dependence and encourage self-improvement. One way of doing that is to make sure that income support for people engaged in further education and training is brought into line with what people can access through unemployment assistance.
Access to rent assistance removes one of the key differences or imbalances between assistance for students and assistance for the unemployed. It is estimated, as I understand it, that about 70,000 students throughout Australia, particularly those from rural or regional areas like Townsville, will directly benefit on average by about $31 a fortnight from the extension of rent assistance.
I have some more comments to make about the rent assistance aspects of this bill and the overall youth allowance reforms. But, firstly, this consequential and related measures bill specifically addresses the needs of students aged 25 years and over who fall outside the youth allowance framework. On 2 October 1997, the James Cook University Student Union wrote to me regarding aspects of the youth allowance and, in particular, how reforms would affect students over 25 years of age. They wrote:
Since the Common Youth Allowance was announced, there has been increasing concern among mature age students as to what support measures shall be available to students over the age of 25 years.
The Government must take into consideration the changing face of student populations. University is no long dominated by school leavers. Due to the changing employment market and the breakdown of `single breadwinner' families, many adults are forced to retrain themselves in order to effectively compete in the labour market.
This bill addresses the income assistance needs of students aged 25 years and over. As we know, the youth allowance is replacing Austudy as well as other income support payments. The bill sets up a new payment for over 25-year-old students who fall outside the 
 youth allowance system. I believe that this is widely welcomed by the students of James Cook University in Townsville and their union. It too is an Austudy payment with rules and guidelines which largely replicate the current Austudy living allowance system it replaces. I am pleased the government has not forgotten the needs of these students.
Just as the government has recognised there needs to be equity between income support for students and the unemployed, down the track I would like to see the government consider taking this further so that there are clear distinctions in favour of income support for students. Once we start to positively discriminate in favour of students we will start to see the beginning of the end of a system of welfare dependence that has built up in Australia.
There are also some points I would like to raise with respect to the extension of rent assistance to students. This is certainly a very important and welcome part of the youth allowance reforms and one which is long overdue. My understanding is that students presently cannot access rent assistance under current Austudy arrangements or, if they can, only under very limited and tight arrangements. Under the youth allowance system we are putting forward, students will be able to access rent assistance if eligible. This will also apply to students who are already 25 years or over engaged in full-time study and in receipt of Austudy as of 1 July 1998.
However, I note that rent assistance will not be available under the proposed Austudy payment provisions—the new assistance payment this bill sets up for over 25-year-olds who are not eligible for youth allowance. While this is not new, I am concerned that we are creating something of a division saying, on one hand, some students can access rent assistance as of 1 July while, on the other hand, others cannot. I note that it is currently next to impossible for students to access rent assistance and that, in this respect, students who fall outside the youth allowance net will be none the worse off. This is a valid argument.
I also note that financially, at some point, a line must be drawn in the sand. Considering 
 the extent of the budget deficit upon coming to office, the government, with respect to these reforms, has achieved worthwhile and valuable reforms. There is only so much we can do with one hand effectively tied behind our backs by the former Labor government. The youth allowance reforms are clearly not cost saving measures. The government is actually spending more money—an extra $25 million in the first year—than the former government. In many respects, the opposition has excluded themselves from the debate by default. They would never have contemplated these reforms, particularly in relation to rent assistance. The extension of rent assistance to students is a tremendous step forward and I congratulate the government and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) for this and fully support this reform.
If we are to extend rent assistance, then let us extend it to all eligible students, regardless of whether or not they are 25 years old and already in receipt of Austudy as of 1 July 1998. As a matter of fairness and equity, when the government is in a financial position to be able to extend rent assistance to students over 25 years of age who fall outside the youth allowance boundaries, we should do so. I would ask that this be given urgent consideration as soon as possible.
In conclusion, as I have said, in many respects the opposition have excluded themselves from the debate by default. Labor, to their shame, gave more financial support to the young unemployed than they ever gave to students. The measures we are introducing through the youth allowance reforms will target incentives for people to study and to complete their schooling, because students who complete year 12 are considerably more likely to find a job than those who leave school after year 10. The worst thing we can do is to allow our kids to get a taste of receiving unemployment benefits for a couple of months for virtually no effort in return. We should be rewarding kids for sticking with education and training, not rewarding them for staying on the dole. As I said at the beginning, this legislation is about bringing students up, not bringing the unemployed down. I support the bill and these measures.",REPS,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE CONSEQUENTIAL AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Zammit, Paul, MP",IND,1998-03-30,"—I am very pleased to enter the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Youth Allowance Consequential and Related Measures) Bill 1998  with, I must say, a growing degree of concern. I was very pleased to see some of the amendments that came before the House this evening accepted by the government, and that has made the bill a little bit more palatable; nonetheless, I do have some very serious concerns which I will relate to the House.
I believe little, if anything, has been said and done by the government to assuage these concerns other than a promise that families will be better off once the tax reform process is completed and comes into effect. That will prove to be of little comfort to those families who are affected, and they are the least able to afford further financial hardship and/or stress in their lives. The House will be aware of my concerns about categorical assurances in writing that have not eventuated, which resulted in my resignation from the Liberal Party on 9 February of this year. Therefore I place little faith in those guarantees. I can look only at what is before the House and I will detail some of these concerns that I have.
First of all, this bill will put added financial pressure on lower and middle income families with children or, more appropriately, unemployed young adult offspring who are unemployed up to age 21 and/or students up to the age of 25. I turn to the 153,750 who the government states will be `better off financially'. However, the fine print bears examination and there are too many unanswered questions. I look forward to having some of these questions answered and, if possible, clarified by the minister in his response at the conclusion of this debate.
The coalition government states that 153,750 young people will receive more money and around 47,650 will receive less money. I turn to those 47,650 whose families will be financially worse off through the intention of this bill. Quite simply, the government is transferring the budget responsibility to the families of Australia, and to those who can least afford it, to the tune of $125 million. I understand the theory behind 
 the bill: that parents who have children under 21 who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed have to take responsibility for their children. That is all well and good, but nearly 50,000 families will be worse off. No-one from the government seems willing to deny the fact that this is a cost shift from the government to the parents. Those parents who can afford it will grudgingly pay, of course. My concerns are with those parents who cannot afford it.
The real test for the government is whether they are facilitating and simplifying the current complex system or whether they have left it on purpose in such a complex state that many young people will just give up. Why not a simple payment for all who are over 16 and parental income testing for full-time students up to 21? Would that not have made it easy and less bureaucratically onerous?
There is no doubt the government is intent on encouraging young people to remain at school for as long as possible. There is no doubt that too many young people have left school at too young an age in the past, knowing that they can rely on the dole. No-one who has any feeling for these young people would want that situation to continue. However, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of parents who may be unable to afford the cost is unfair and unjust. The safety net will be removed and we will run a very serious risk of the creation of a new youth underclass.
I note there are only 2½ minutes or so before the adjournment debate starts, so I will try to complete my remarks in the next couple of minutes so that we have a smooth transition to the adjournment debate. However, I want to complete my comments by saying that I believe the editorial in the Canberra Times of 10 March 1998 put it best when it stated:
If a 15-year-old is not an adult in the eyes of the law (except when it comes to deciding whether to leave school or not) by 18 he or she most certainly is.
Eighteen-year-olds can vote, can be tried as adults in a court of law, drink and smoke, rent a house and drive a car. They can earn a wage and pay grown-up income tax on it. For the most part the government is happy to regard 18 and 19 year-olds 
 as fully fledged members of society, with the rights and responsibilities of adults. Yet when it comes to the proposed Youth Allowance, an 18- or 19-year-old is suddenly presumed to be a child, and their parents are presumed to be the primary providers, connected to their grown offspring by a financial umbilical cord. There are no compensating tax or other benefits by which Government could argue that there is no net increase in costs.
I reserve my right to be critical of this bill until I see what provisions the government proposes in the forthcoming budget to ensure our fellow Australians who are struggling with the cost of day-to-day survival are not forgotten.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"—In today's Daily Telegraph  there is a story regarding a submission prepared by the Penrith City Council for the Senate Community Affairs References Committee's inquiry into children's services. It makes for depressing reading. According to the council, the Howard government's demolition job on child care has had the following effects on struggling working families in Penrith—in the seat of Lindsay I might add. Fees have increased by approximately $6 a day; 47 per cent of families previously using the council's centres have resorted to caring for their child at home; 181 families have withdrawn their children from care altogether; 183 families have cut the number of days their children attended care; and the centres themselves are skimping on food and services and have cut staff by 10 per cent. My electorate is not far from Penrith, and I can tell the House that the child-care situation there is just as brutal.
Fairfield City Council, which covers the majority of my electorate, has also prepared a submission for the Senate committee on the state of its child-care services. I would like to read into Hansard some of its contents. They say that fees in centres have now increased by an average of 26 per cent, past the level of affordability for most families. Fees are 
 currently averaging $176 a week for nought to five-year-old child care. An indicator of affordability for Fairfield was when fees were $150 per child per week and the centres were full.
During the last two months, 123 children either exited council services or did not take up offered enrolment due to higher fees. In exit surveys, parents have indicated that, due to the effect of fee increases and changes in the child-care sector, they are either leaving the work force, have ceased looking for work, are returning to being on the sole parent's benefits or are working part time, at night or on weekends. Long day care vacancies have now increased by 93 per cent in one year. In 1997, there were 46 vacancies in 10 council long day care centres. Currently, there are 627 vacancies in the same 10 centres. There are 317 vacancies in family day care centres operated by Fairfield City Council.
In 12 of the centres, service delivery has been reduced dramatically. This has included a reduction in hours of opening, reduced staff numbers, the removal of cooks and reduced administration hours. Meals are now not prepared in two centres. Equipment replacement has been eliminated from budgets. Parents must raise the funds to purchase equipment, creating an even greater strain on family budgets.
When operational subsidies dry up for outside of school hours care on 27 April, fees will be increased by a minimum of 30 per cent, with some centres having to raise fees by a massive 130 per cent. As has been the case with the council's long day and family day care centres, families who cannot afford care at these new rates will seek alternative care arrangements. As they leave, the fees will need to be increased to cover costs, causing more parents to leave and bringing more centres to the verge of closure.
One vacation and before and after school care centre located at William Stimson Public School in Wetherill Park has now already closed. At least one other is about to be closed and other services in Fairfield City will be closing down components of their service such as before school or vacation care, which will in turn make that centre less viable.
No long day care centres have closed so far but three nought to five-year-old centres are operating at one-third of their capacity—an extremely critical level. Also, they do not have the funds to pay out equity in building or staff entitlements. The quality and frequency of interaction between staff and children have been reduced as staff numbers have decreased. The number of children attending on a part-time pattern has increased. Therefore, the staff are spending the majority of their time settling children and reassuring parents rather than providing a stimulating learning and social environment.
Staff training and development has all but been eliminated from budgets. Eight teachers' positions have been lost over the Fairfield local government area recently. Children have less continuity of care as some staff are now employed casually, working only when fluctuating child numbers require, in the place of permanent employees. The inconsistency of care has a negative impact on children's routines, particularly those under three years of age, and leads to unsettled behaviour and increased stress on staff and parents.
Staff have now been forced into focusing on marketing the centre in the local community to drum up business rather than working with the children. Less qualified and inexperienced directors have been employed to try to reduce costs. This is the predicament that the Howard government has brought about. It has brought this nation's once proud public child-care system to the brink of collapse. Sadly, the council's claim that none of its long day care centres have been forced to close should have been made with the caveat `until now'.
Tomorrow, the council operated long day care centre at Villawood North in my electorate will close its doors. I will be making sure that every parent who sent their children to that care centre—indeed, every family in my electorate and throughout the rest of my electorate—knows that it is the Howard government which is to blame for bringing about such a truly awful state of affairs. I will continue to remind them all the way to the election. ",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Child Care</title>,Adjournment,20,1,speech
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-03-30,"asked Mr Speaker on 12 March 1998:
Mr Speaker, in your capacity as having responsibility for the Joint House Department, I wonder whether you might look into the appointment of the manager's position of the parliamentary recreation centre. I understand that Alison Porritt, who has occupied that position as manager for four years, and who has been an employee for eight years, has been overlooked for subsequent appointment to that position.
Most members and senators who regularly attend that facility believe that Alison Porritt is an excellent officer of the department. I wonder whether you might investigate whether or not there is the opportunity, perhaps, for Ms Porritt to be reconsidered for that position.",REPS,<title>REPLIES TO REQUESTS FOR DETAILED INFORMATION</title>,<title>Parliament House Health and Recreation Centre</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,question
Mr SPEAKER,N/A,1998-03-30,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
A new position, Administrative Service Officer Class 6, Manager Health and Recreation was created in December 1997. The position was created to recognise the changing requirements and 
 enhanced responsibilities of the Manager of this facility.
Ms Porritt, who is an Administrative Service Officer Class 4 in the Health and Recreation Centre, occupied the position on a temporary basis from 22 December 1997 pending the outcome of its permanent filling.
The position was advertised in the Canberra Times  and Commonwealth Gazette . Ms Porritt was one of several applicants and her claims were considered along with those of other applicants through a competitive selection process, based on merit. The successful candidate was chosen after all applicants' claims were considered against the selection criteria for the newly created position. Ms Porritt's claims were assessed to be not as strong as those of the successful applicant.
Ms Porritt has an appeal avenue available and has been fully apprised of her rights in this regard. The appeal process is conducted under the auspices of an independent body, the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission.",REPS,<title>REPLIES TO REQUESTS FOR DETAILED INFORMATION</title>,<title>Parliament House Health and Recreation Centre</title>,Miscellaneous,21,1,answer
