"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-10-21,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, I shall move that the following delegated legislation, a list of which I shall hand to the Clerk, be disallowed.
The list read as follows—
1.	 Accreditation Grant Principles 1999 made under subsection 96-1(1) of the Aged Care Act 1997 .
2.	 Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.3), as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No.202 and made under the Customs Act 1901 .
3.	 Therapeutic Goods Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.2), as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No.209 and made under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 .
4.	 Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.5), as contained in Statutory Rules 
 1999 No.205 and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 .
—I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Accreditation Grant Principles 1999 made under subsection 96-1(1) of the  Aged Care Act 1997
The Principles establish a legal framework for the accreditation of aged care facilities by an accreditation body.
Paragraph 2.11(1)(a) requires an accreditation body, if it has decided to accredit a residential care service, to decide the period for which the service is to be accredited. However, subsection 2.11(3) provides that, once the accreditation body has decided to accredit a service, the period for which the services is to be accredited must be 12 months. It would appear, therefore, that 2.11(1)(a) might not serve any practical purpose.
Subsections 3.4(1), 3.12(1) and 3.21(1) allow an accreditation body to arrange for a review audit of a residential care service if it believes, on reasonable grounds, that there may not have been compliance with various Standards, or other responsibilities under the enabling Act. However, there is apparently no provision requiring the accreditation body to inform the provider of the service of the fact that it believes that there has been non-compliance.
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.3)Statutory Rules 1999 No. 202
The Statutory Rules introduce controls on the importation of the substance Erythropoietin.
The effect of new subregulation 5G(3) is that not only competitors in sports (within the meaning of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 ) but also anyone who comes to Australia as part of a competitor's entourage must obtain written permission from a Customs officer to import Erythropoietin (EPO). This requirement appears to apply even though the person is bringing in no more than has been prescribed for him or her by a medical practitioner.

Therapeutic Goods Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.2) Statutory Rules 1999 No.209
The Statutory Rules amend the Principal Regulations as a result of the establishment of the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee.
New Subregulation 42ZCK(1) permits the Minister to terminate the membership of those serving on the Committee on a variety of grounds, in the Minister's discretion. However, there does not appear to be any provision for the decision to terminate the membership to be in writing, nor to be accompanied by a statement of reasons which have led to that decision.
New subregulation 42ZCY(3) permits the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee to refuse to disclose, or provide access to, `information which it properly regards as requiring confidentiality for commercial reasons'. However, there does not appear to be any provision for external merits review of such decisions.
Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.5)Statutory Rules 1999 No.205
The Statutory Rules give effect to the Government's response to aspects of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters concerning the role of the Electoral Commission in conducting industrial elections.
New paragraph 60A(6)(a) of the Principal Regulations, inserted by item 1 of the Schedule to these Statutory Rules, creates a criminal offence of using information about voter rolls for `any purpose other than  a purpose in connection with the election'. Since that offence carries a maximum penalty of $1,100, it may be thought that the content of the offence might be more fully spelt out than merely by the reference to `a purpose in connection with the election'.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,0,1,speech

—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I believe that this is an outstanding report and that it reflects very clearly the evidence received from every state in Australia. The committee visited every state except the Northern Territory. This report underlines the importance of allowing the voice of ordinary farmers and small business people in country towns to be heard. This committee has a record of going to remote areas to visit people who would not normally have the opportunity of being heard within the national parliament of this country. We believe it is important to hear that voice. The committee is determined to listen not only to the peak farming organisations, even though their evidence is important, or to big companies, even though their evidence is important, but also to reflect upon and listen to the evidence given to us by the small farmers and the little people in this country.
I would like to thank the committee secretariat: the secretary, Mr Andrew Snedden; in particular Ms Robina Jaffray, the principal research officer, who was the main author of the report; and other members of the committee who assisted—Mr John O'Keefe, Ms Trish Carling, Ms Rosalind McMahon and Ms Jade Ricza. I would like to seek leave to incorporate the part of my speech that gives an overview of the contents of the report and recommendations, and then to make some general comments.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
On 23 March 1999, the Senate referred the deregulation of the Australian Dairy Industry to the  Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report. The specific matters included:
(a)	 future domestic and international marketing conditions facing the Australian dairy industry and those factors which are influencing Australia's competitiveness in these markets;
(b)	 the pressures on the current industry regulatory arrangements such as the introduction of new 
 technologies and competitor supplier countries such as New Zealand;
(c)	 the impacts associated with the removal of the Domestic Market Support scheme on:
(i)	 the dairy industry and rural and regional communities; and
(ii)	 state marketing arrangements; and
(d)	 measures which may be taken by government to facilitate the transition to a less regulated environment.
Following significant public response and 116 submissions, including many from individual farmers, the Committee undertook a series of public hearings in all states of Australia to hear first hand about the potential effects of deregulation and the options to be pursued.The major considerations for the Committee during its inquiry were:
.	 the drivers of deregulation;
.	 the impact of National Competition Policy on the deregulation of the dairy industry;
.	 the specific impacts of deregulation on individual farmers and rural and regional communities;
.	 whether deregulation could be delayed or whether deregulation was inevitable and what an appropriate time frame for deregulation might be;
.	 the adequacy of the re-structure package in the event of deregulation on 1 July 2000;
.	 the role of the Commonwealth Government and the States in setting the deregulation agenda.
Committee Findings
The Committee considers that the following threshold questions need to be addressed by Government in terms of the debate on deregulation:
.	Could a case be made on national interest grounds to continue or discontinue intervention?
.	 In any event, will market forces, sooner or later, force deregulation?
.	 If they do, is a managed outcome with a soft landing preferable to a commercially driven crash;
.	 Is the proposed adjustment package, big as it is, enough?
The Committee has concluded that at some point the market will force deregulation and that a managed outcome is preferable to deregulation cold turkey. On a personal note, I am disappointed that there is not more political will to confront those market forces which are so destructive of farmers' income and rural communities. Deregulation of the dairy industry will have significant impacts on individual farmers—both in terms of falls in income and in a drop in the value of capital assets—and the communities in which they live. These impacts must be addressed by Government. 

Drivers of Deregulation and National Competition Policy
Deregulation is principally supported by the large Victorian co-operatives, Murray Goulburn and Bonlac, and the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria. However, because Victoria dominates dairy production in Australia, producing two thirds of the total milk produced in Australia, Victoria's press for deregulation is of considerable weight. However, even within Victoria, there seems to be considerable disquiet amongst the dairy farming community about the advantages of deregulation.The Australian Dairy Industry Council has been proactive in alerting governments and the farming community of the consequences of deregulation and in proposing a means of dealing with those consequences in order that the industry will be able to withstand the fallout from total deregulation, if it occurs on 1 July 2000. The ADIC comprises industry and farmer representatives from all over Australia and their membership reflects the degree to which Victoria dominates the industry.
The Committee was also interested to undertake an assessment of the degree to which National Competition Policy was a driver for deregulation.
Committee concerns
The Committee has a number of specific concerns about the proposal to deregulate the industry, including:
.	 the application of the public interest test in the State based legislation reviews under the terms of National Competition Policy;
.	 the precise impact on farmers income and the adequacy of the re-structure package;
.	 the failure to date by state governments to address the issue of compensation for quota, where appropriate; and
.	 the impact on rural and regional communities.
National Competition Policy
The Committee's concerns in relation to the application of National Competition Policy principles, especially the interpretation of the net community benefit/public interest test and its application in the varying legislation reviews include:
.	 there has not been a thorough investigation of the national consequences of deregulation with State reviews being undertaken piecemeal;
.	 assessment of the public interest in the reviews has been less than comprehensive and appears to favour narrow sectional interests.
The re-structure package
The Committee is further concerned that the consequences of deregulation for individual farmers, their businesses and communities are not being sufficiently addressed. The impacts for farmers include: 

.	 an abrupt loss of income by farmers across Australia as farmgate prices drop;
.	 a reduction in the value of capital assets;
.	 a loss of the value of quota entitlement in some states;
.	 the disappearance of countervailing market power by farmers who will be subject to the force of the major processors and retailers.
Should deregulation take place on 1 July 2000, the adequacy of the re-structure package is problematic, especially:
.	 Whether the amount to be received is adequate to cover the loss of income the package is intended to address;
.	 The lack of any compensation by the States for loss of quota entitlement;
.	 The administrative arrangements for the assessment and dispersal of funds under the scheme.
The Impact on Rural and Regional Communities
The impact of deregulation will be felt severely in most dairying communities around Australia, given the flow-on effects which will manifest within those communities—the farmers themselves will be affected, as will be the businesses which rely on dairying. In the Committee's opinion, the social and regional impacts will be severe and will need to be given detailed consideration in terms of any structural adjustment assistance, once deregulation occurs.
Recommendations
The Committee has recommended a series of actions, including most importantly that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Government call, as a matter of urgency, a meeting of state Agriculture and Regional Development Ministers to determine a framework, and a timeframe, for the co-ordinated deregulation of the Dairy Industry.
The Committee considers that this is a critical action which must take place to promote certainty within the industry and an appropriate framework for continued operation.
The issues of quota compensation and rural and regional adjustment schemes are also critical. The Committee wishes to draw attention to the Bega Valley Social Impact Study, a study funded by the local community raising the funding and which developed a detailed snapshot of the community and was able to demonstrate in a highly specific way the impact that a fall in the farmgate price of milk of different degrees would have on the local community. The Committee considers that this is a fundamental piece of work, demonstrating very clearly the potential impacts of deregulation on a community such as the Bega Valley. 

—I would like to make some general comments that flow from this overview. The first comment I want to make is that I am appalled that we are once again faced with a decision which will further erode rural communities and reduce the profitability of farming businesses. I say I am appalled because it seems that there is little political will to resist the forces that are driving this process. It is a process that has been going on for decades and no political party, including my own, has been able to stop it. We have seen a decline in rural populations for some decades; we have seen, with some outstanding exceptions, the profitability of farms declining.
In the reports and the evidence which we received, these market forces were identified as national competition policy, the global market and commercial realities. I am concerned that we, as politicians, put ourselves forward to represent rural communities, and then we have to say that there are forces which we cannot resist. One has to ask the question: if that is so, if we are unable to resist forces which are driving a process of degradation of rural communities, surely we should question whether we should put ourselves forward. If these forces are irresistible, perhaps we should stop pretending that we have any solutions and allow the processes to simply continue.
However, I believe that there is political will in all of the political parties, particularly those that are most concerned about rural communities. I believe that the recent Victorian election showed that there was political will amongst ordinary country people who are prepared to change their vote if they believe that they are not being represented by those whom they have elected. Country people are understanding that they must take control of their own futures and that politicians must take account of the concerns they express. If politicians do not take account of those concerns, if we cannot resist the forces that are doing this to our country areas, then we should perhaps get out of the road. No wonder people ask, `What is the point of electing people to either the peak farmer organisations 
 or to parliament?', if we cannot do anything for them.
Let me underline, in the time I have left, what the committee report says about those commercial pressures. It is clear from the report that part of the pressure is coming from the big milk manufacturers—the processors. Our report indicates that much of the drive for deregulation comes from Bonlac and Murray Goulburn in Victoria, which have the majority of the market. I find it interesting to read a recent Weekly Times, which indicates that the Chief Executive of Bonlac, Mr Scanlan, is now a million dollar man. In other words, with his base salary and bonuses added to it, he now receives just over $1 million a year in salary. Yet he is asking farmers to live on welfare. I believe that is an obscenity.
There is no doubt that there is commercial pressure coming from the large processors. There is also no doubt that there is a transfer of income out of farmers' pockets into the pockets of the processors and the big supermarkets. I believe that we ought to indicate very clearly to this country where those pressures are coming from and whether or not that is the way Australia wants to go. It is about time we made very clear what is happening.
Another part of the commercial pressure is said to be the pressure from the global market, particularly the pressure for exports. Let me underline the fact that we are talking about exports of a low value product such as skim milk powder which makes up the bulk of the exports and in order to sell skim milk powder into a corrupt world market we are asking farmers to supply the milk for that product at below the cost of production. That makes no sense to me. It makes no sense at all and it certainly does not make any sense to those farmers who in some cases are now receiving below the cost of production for the milk they supply to the manufacturers in order to manufacture a bulk but low value product. A much larger proportion of the milk supply from states such as Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia goes into whole milk. There is no doubt that the premium price they receive is certainly under threat from the milk processors in Victoria, where 
 over 60 per cent of the total milk production in Australia comes from, and that those commercial pressures will continue.
This parliament needs to clearly indicate where that pressure is coming from. We also need to indicate that we believe it is about time the federal government and state agricultural ministers got together and recognised those pressures themselves and, if they cannot be resisted, put together a package which is more adequate than the package being offered. That package does not address the issue of the loss of quotas and their values and it does not address the regional impacts which in some cases will be very severe. In conclusion, I draw attention to the Bega study—which was paid for by people in Bega themselves—which shows that there will be a very significant impact on that community if deregulation does go ahead.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-21,"—First, I echo Senator Woodley's comments in relation to the activities of the secretary of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in the conduct of this inquiry and the preparation of the report, particularly the work of Robina Jaffray, whose work in coordinating the submissions, organising hearings and the compilation of the report has been absolutely essential to the efficient functioning of this committee. Let me pay my compliments. This work is a substantial reflection of the effort and diligence of Robina and other members of the committee secretariat in the performance of their duties.
Let me also say that this committee travels through rural and regional Australia and we are indebted to Hansard for the enormous effort they put in in carrying equipment to hearings, setting up, getting information from witnesses so that the record can properly reflect who is giving evidence, and generally doing the hard slog that is not apparent from the report that the committee lays down. Without the efforts of Hansard, the members 
 of the committee and the secretariat would be extremely hampered in the performance of our work. This report also reflects the diligence, the hard work and the professionalism of Hansard in the performance of its important duty as part of the Australian parliament.
There is always a temptation in areas such as this to tell people what they want to hear. There is also a temptation just to present both sides of the argument but not draw any conclusions. These approaches have not been a feature of this committee in my experience, and this report is no exception. This committee also has a record of bringing down unanimous all-party reports and recommendations, and again this report on the Australian dairy industry is no exception. I must say that we have tested the boundaries of our ability to reach agreement. In some respects there would be passages in this report with which I would agree but others might not and I am sure other senators would say the same thing. That situation has arisen in respect of many reports handed down by this committee. We believe that it is important to have a view that reflects the totality of the views of members of the committee rather than seeking simply to pursue a set of words that a particular senator wants.
We have considered 116 submissions, we have taken evidence from 99 witnesses and there are nearly 700 pages of evidence. The evidence is that the industry has performed exceptionally well over the past two decades. It has made considerable changes over that period and, with the support of government, it has managed the process very effectively. Over the last 20 years we have had the Kerin plan, the DMSS scheme, and the Crean plan, which varied that scheme. So this industry has been the subject of considerable interest from the Australian government.
 There is no doubt that there is a long-term future for the Australian dairy industry and in my view it will be a positive one. There is no doubt as well that the Australian dairy industry will be fully deregulated over time. As this report finds, the real issue is its timing and how that process is managed. It is essential that the process is coordinated and it is clearly the responsibility of the minister, Mr 
 Truss, to manage that process. This is not simply a matter for the industry or individual states. Unfortunately, to date Mr Truss apparently has not accepted that responsibility. I am advised that in relation to the government's approach to the industry package he has now told the industry that they need to go out and sell that package to the states and that it is not a job for the federal government. That certainly is not my view.
It is also the view that, while there may be some benefits from a staged approach to deregulation, the best approach is a one-off, properly designed, adequately resourced and fully coordinated approach. It is clear that in the short term farmers and the regions in which they live will suffer under deregulation and that the position of consumers at best will not improve. In the long term the industry as a whole will benefit if further reforms are achieved in the international marketplace and, I say again, it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth government to deal with these short-term costs and maximise the potential for long-term gains.
In relation to evidence that we have received that there is some support for a proposal that there be a national plebiscite of farmers to determine what course the government and industry should take in managing the dairy industry's future, the committee believes that a simple plebiscite would not be helpful at all. However, perhaps a proper survey covering a wide range of important issues may be helpful. I have to say that this inquiry has been exhaustive—and in some respects, exhausting—and we think that the body of information that has flowed from the inquiry is a sufficient basis for governments to properly develop and implement appropriate measures to manage the process.
It is my view that the Commonwealth government has failed in this regard. It has failed to act in a timely and proper manner and, as a consequence, the industry and state governments are now forced to address these important issues in a very short time frame. That is to be regretted. Unfortunately, I have had a very limited time—which is about to expire—in which to speak on this matter, and I will deal with it again later.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee</title>,Committees,15,1,speech
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-10-21,"—I support the opening remarks made by my colleague Senator O'Brien concerning the fantastic effort put in by our committee during this inquiry. I give my thanks in particular to Robina Jaffray. I have been involved in many committees and the work she did on this report was outstanding and of the very highest class. She has done a great deal of work on this report on behalf of the members of the committee and has produced a very comprehensive and fairly large report that really gets to the nitty-gritty of the key issues. I commend the spirit in which my colleagues on this committee have worked through the issues, because they are not simple or easy and go far beyond the dairy industry itself.
Before I walked into the chamber I was talking on the telephone to a friend of mine who is a dairy farmer in Harvey in Western Australia. They are now trying to work out how they will restructure the town because of the impact this will have on them. There is no doubt that over the next two or three years in rural dairy communities—as Senator Woodley said—there will be an enormous restructuring, not only of farms but also of businesses, support industries, service industries and schools. Sometimes people in this place do not have any perception of what happens when three or four children happen to leave an area. That area often loses a teacher or a nurse from the hospital or some other aspect of the service industry in the area is affected. I agree absolutely that the deregulation of the dairy industry is inevitable. In fact, I believe it is already here, even if the states do not deregulate. The DMS scheme is going and we will have across-the-border trading. The impact of that will be quite devastating to dairy farmers in the initial stages.
As a member of the government I will not accept everything that is said in this place, but, while I supported the recommendation in the report, there is some inherent criticism of the fact that the job has not been got on with quickly enough. There has not been enough attention given to it, but the states themselves, particularly New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia—although I do not list 
 them in any particular order; I can start with Western Australia first—have not been helpful. We have a conservative government in Western Australia and when we started this process Victoria had one too. The states have not been as helpful as they could have been.
As a matter of extreme urgency—as we reflect in recommendation 1—the states together with the Commonwealth must now pull their weight and get on with what is required to refine the package put on the table by the Commonwealth government and deal with all the other associated issues. One of the problems you have with a situation like this is when the states have the `head of power' under the constitution to deal with quotas while the Commonwealth has an overall responsibility. Some particular states have been tardy when it comes to dealing with their quotas and what they are going to do. You are then left with a situation which invariably ends up being totally unsatisfactory. I say to all the state ministers and to us in government that we need to put a lot of urgency into the next two, three or four months and come to conclusions that will meet the issues head on.
This has highlighted a chronic problem which we have with the agreement on competition policy. I could criticise the former government for that because they put it together with the state government, but I am not going to do that. I am going to set the challenge to this parliament that we must deal with competition policy or what I see as a gap in it, and that is looking at the national net benefit. When you go around the states individually and you get one report in one state and another report in another state, it confirms the status quo on what is happening, that there is a net public benefit. In one particular state—in this case, it happens to be Victoria by virtue of the fact that a different recommendation came out of that state—and that is not their fault; I think it is a weakness in the system—there is no consideration of the Commonwealth net benefit. That has to be addressed.
There are not many industries like the dairy industry in Australia in the way it is structured, where it has a joint responsibility. 
 Nonetheless I think it needs to be addressed and there needs to be some form of national test as well. Things might get handled a little differently if that were there.
Concerning the package, I want to raise a couple of concerns which I have. It is not the size of the package—I think it is enormous—but I am concerned about the distributional effects that that could well have in terms of what may happen regionally, within a state, and also nationally across the various states. If we analyse some of the figures which we received very recently, I think we will find that, unless there are some disciplines put around that particular package, the states—particularly Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales—are going to find it very hard to accept it because the effect will be that those states will be assisting Victoria to export milk across the border into bigger states and undermine the market milk operations there. That is a real concern which obviously the government and we in this parliament have to deal with so that we get the right result out of the package that has been put up and not one that merely shifts the problem across borders and creates further enormous social problems.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-10-21,"—This report on deregulation of the Australian dairy industry is very significant. It is comprehensive and, as previous speakers have stated—and I endorse their remarks—the comprehensive nature of the report is due very much to the hard work of the secretariat, particularly Robina Jaffray, who worked with the committee throughout its hearings and deliberations. The committee had the opportunity to visit regional areas of Australia, which provided us with first-hand experience of what can be the very serious and in some cases possibly devastating effects of unbridled deregulation and competition policy upon the people working and living in those regions. All colleagues on the committee were very impressed with the evidence that was brought before us, albeit that there were different points of view put from time to time.
Time is short and I am sure there will be much more to say about this report on future 
 occasions. The dairy industry is a significant industry, both domestically and internationally. It has been restructuring since the 1970s, when it suffered a major blow due to the entry at that time of the United Kingdom into the European Community, or Common Market as it was then called. Over those years through the various plans that Senator O'Brien referred to, such as the Kerin plan and the Crean plan, the industry has had to restructure. It has improved its efficiency, and unfortunately that has come at some cost. For instance, today there are some 30 per cent fewer dairy farmers in operation than there were in the 1970s. Still the industry is characterised by some 95 per cent of those farmers being family farmers. When you visit the regions and talk to those farmers, to community leaders and to other people, as we did, you experience first-hand the concerns that they have about future deregulation, particularly the impact that reduced farm gate prices for market milk will have upon them.
While there has been a feeling of inevitability about future deregulation because of the abolition of the domestic market support scheme from July next year, that does not lessen the impact of the problem. For instance, Senator Woodley has referred to the study that was done in the Bega area in my home state of New South Wales. I urge senators and others to look in detail at that study. It demonstrates the problems that can impact upon a regional community with decisions such as this which not only directly affect the industry but have a much greater multiplier effect throughout the community. That experience could quite possibly occur in other areas of New South Wales and in other states. That is why we have recommended that there needs to be a specific focus on regional adjustment assistance within a total package.
The package that has been developed addresses particularly lost income for dairy farmers as a result of deregulation, but there is a range of other issues which also need to be addressed. We have recommended that in particular there has to be consideration given—in fact, there has to be a commitment by state and federal governments—to finding 
 ways to assist those regional communities that will be affected by what happens in this industry. As we have seen, the impact of national competition policy is not confined to just this industry.
I have to say—and I agree with Senator O'Brien—that the federal government could have picked up the ball a lot quicker and run with it a lot harder than it has done to date. I recall, in a debate in this chamber on 29 September, Senator Troeth interjecting at one point in a speech of mine and saying, `This issue is a matter for the states.' It is not a matter just for the states. Whilst regulation of the market milk industry resides with the states, the fact is that this is a national industry and a national issue and it requires national leadership. Unfortunately, I think that has been lacking. You cannot expect to just leave it to the individual states, who have different competing interests, as we have seen, to try and coordinate the final approach. What we are urging as a matter of urgency is for the federal government to coordinate, develop and implement ultimately a nationally agreed package of measures that addresses these issues, not just those that are addressed by this package. In conclusion, I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

I would like to thank the committee secretariat: the secretary, Mr Andrew Snedden; in particular Ms Robina Jaffray, the principal research officer, who was the main author of the report; and other members of the committee who assisted—Mr John O'Keefe, Ms Trish Carling, Ms Rosalind McMahon and Ms Jade Ricza. I would like to seek leave to incorporate the part of my speech that gives an overview of the contents of the report and recommendations, and then to make some general comments.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
On 23 March 1999, the Senate referred the deregulation of the Australian Dairy Industry to the  Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report. The specific matters included:
(a)	 future domestic and international marketing conditions facing the Australian dairy industry and those factors which are influencing Australia's competitiveness in these markets;
(b)	 the pressures on the current industry regulatory arrangements such as the introduction of new 
 technologies and competitor supplier countries such as New Zealand;
(c)	 the impacts associated with the removal of the Domestic Market Support scheme on:
(i)	 the dairy industry and rural and regional communities; and
(ii)	 state marketing arrangements; and
(d)	 measures which may be taken by government to facilitate the transition to a less regulated environment.
Following significant public response and 116 submissions, including many from individual farmers, the Committee undertook a series of public hearings in all states of Australia to hear first hand about the potential effects of deregulation and the options to be pursued.The major considerations for the Committee during its inquiry were:
.	 the drivers of deregulation;
.	 the impact of National Competition Policy on the deregulation of the dairy industry;
.	 the specific impacts of deregulation on individual farmers and rural and regional communities;
.	 whether deregulation could be delayed or whether deregulation was inevitable and what an appropriate time frame for deregulation might be;
.	 the adequacy of the re-structure package in the event of deregulation on 1 July 2000;
.	 the role of the Commonwealth Government and the States in setting the deregulation agenda.
Committee Findings
The Committee considers that the following threshold questions need to be addressed by Government in terms of the debate on deregulation:
.	Could a case be made on national interest grounds to continue or discontinue intervention?
.	 In any event, will market forces, sooner or later, force deregulation?
.	 If they do, is a managed outcome with a soft landing preferable to a commercially driven crash;
.	 Is the proposed adjustment package, big as it is, enough?
The Committee has concluded that at some point the market will force deregulation and that a managed outcome is preferable to deregulation cold turkey. On a personal note, I am disappointed that there is not more political will to confront those market forces which are so destructive of farmers' income and rural communities. Deregulation of the dairy industry will have significant impacts on individual farmers—both in terms of falls in income and in a drop in the value of capital assets—and the communities in which they live. These impacts must be addressed by Government. 

Drivers of Deregulation and National Competition Policy
Deregulation is principally supported by the large Victorian co-operatives, Murray Goulburn and Bonlac, and the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria. However, because Victoria dominates dairy production in Australia, producing two thirds of the total milk produced in Australia, Victoria's press for deregulation is of considerable weight. However, even within Victoria, there seems to be considerable disquiet amongst the dairy farming community about the advantages of deregulation.The Australian Dairy Industry Council has been proactive in alerting governments and the farming community of the consequences of deregulation and in proposing a means of dealing with those consequences in order that the industry will be able to withstand the fallout from total deregulation, if it occurs on 1 July 2000. The ADIC comprises industry and farmer representatives from all over Australia and their membership reflects the degree to which Victoria dominates the industry.
The Committee was also interested to undertake an assessment of the degree to which National Competition Policy was a driver for deregulation.
Committee concerns
The Committee has a number of specific concerns about the proposal to deregulate the industry, including:
.	 the application of the public interest test in the State based legislation reviews under the terms of National Competition Policy;
.	 the precise impact on farmers income and the adequacy of the re-structure package;
.	 the failure to date by state governments to address the issue of compensation for quota, where appropriate; and
.	 the impact on rural and regional communities.
National Competition Policy
The Committee's concerns in relation to the application of National Competition Policy principles, especially the interpretation of the net community benefit/public interest test and its application in the varying legislation reviews include:
.	 there has not been a thorough investigation of the national consequences of deregulation with State reviews being undertaken piecemeal;
.	 assessment of the public interest in the reviews has been less than comprehensive and appears to favour narrow sectional interests.
The re-structure package
The Committee is further concerned that the consequences of deregulation for individual farmers, their businesses and communities are not being sufficiently addressed. The impacts for farmers include: 

.	 an abrupt loss of income by farmers across Australia as farmgate prices drop;
.	 a reduction in the value of capital assets;
.	 a loss of the value of quota entitlement in some states;
.	 the disappearance of countervailing market power by farmers who will be subject to the force of the major processors and retailers.
Should deregulation take place on 1 July 2000, the adequacy of the re-structure package is problematic, especially:
.	 Whether the amount to be received is adequate to cover the loss of income the package is intended to address;
.	 The lack of any compensation by the States for loss of quota entitlement;
.	 The administrative arrangements for the assessment and dispersal of funds under the scheme.
The Impact on Rural and Regional Communities
The impact of deregulation will be felt severely in most dairying communities around Australia, given the flow-on effects which will manifest within those communities—the farmers themselves will be affected, as will be the businesses which rely on dairying. In the Committee's opinion, the social and regional impacts will be severe and will need to be given detailed consideration in terms of any structural adjustment assistance, once deregulation occurs.
Recommendations
The Committee has recommended a series of actions, including most importantly that the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Government call, as a matter of urgency, a meeting of state Agriculture and Regional Development Ministers to determine a framework, and a timeframe, for the co-ordinated deregulation of the Dairy Industry.
The Committee considers that this is a critical action which must take place to promote certainty within the industry and an appropriate framework for continued operation.
The issues of quota compensation and rural and regional adjustment schemes are also critical. The Committee wishes to draw attention to the Bega Valley Social Impact Study, a study funded by the local community raising the funding and which developed a detailed snapshot of the community and was able to demonstrate in a highly specific way the impact that a fall in the farmgate price of milk of different degrees would have on the local community. The Committee considers that this is a fundamental piece of work, demonstrating very clearly the potential impacts of deregulation on a community such as the Bega Valley. 

—I would like to make some general comments that flow from this overview. The first comment I want to make is that I am appalled that we are once again faced with a decision which will further erode rural communities and reduce the profitability of farming businesses. I say I am appalled because it seems that there is little political will to resist the forces that are driving this process. It is a process that has been going on for decades and no political party, including my own, has been able to stop it. We have seen a decline in rural populations for some decades; we have seen, with some outstanding exceptions, the profitability of farms declining.
In the reports and the evidence which we received, these market forces were identified as national competition policy, the global market and commercial realities. I am concerned that we, as politicians, put ourselves forward to represent rural communities, and then we have to say that there are forces which we cannot resist. One has to ask the question: if that is so, if we are unable to resist forces which are driving a process of degradation of rural communities, surely we should question whether we should put ourselves forward. If these forces are irresistible, perhaps we should stop pretending that we have any solutions and allow the processes to simply continue.
However, I believe that there is political will in all of the political parties, particularly those that are most concerned about rural communities. I believe that the recent Victorian election showed that there was political will amongst ordinary country people who are prepared to change their vote if they believe that they are not being represented by those whom they have elected. Country people are understanding that they must take control of their own futures and that politicians must take account of the concerns they express. If politicians do not take account of those concerns, if we cannot resist the forces that are doing this to our country areas, then we should perhaps get out of the road. No wonder people ask, `What is the point of electing people to either the peak farmer organisations 
 or to parliament?', if we cannot do anything for them.
Let me underline, in the time I have left, what the committee report says about those commercial pressures. It is clear from the report that part of the pressure is coming from the big milk manufacturers—the processors. Our report indicates that much of the drive for deregulation comes from Bonlac and Murray Goulburn in Victoria, which have the majority of the market. I find it interesting to read a recent Weekly Times, which indicates that the Chief Executive of Bonlac, Mr Scanlan, is now a million dollar man. In other words, with his base salary and bonuses added to it, he now receives just over $1 million a year in salary. Yet he is asking farmers to live on welfare. I believe that is an obscenity.
There is no doubt that there is commercial pressure coming from the large processors. There is also no doubt that there is a transfer of income out of farmers' pockets into the pockets of the processors and the big supermarkets. I believe that we ought to indicate very clearly to this country where those pressures are coming from and whether or not that is the way Australia wants to go. It is about time we made very clear what is happening.
Another part of the commercial pressure is said to be the pressure from the global market, particularly the pressure for exports. Let me underline the fact that we are talking about exports of a low value product such as skim milk powder which makes up the bulk of the exports and in order to sell skim milk powder into a corrupt world market we are asking farmers to supply the milk for that product at below the cost of production. That makes no sense to me. It makes no sense at all and it certainly does not make any sense to those farmers who in some cases are now receiving below the cost of production for the milk they supply to the manufacturers in order to manufacture a bulk but low value product. A much larger proportion of the milk supply from states such as Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia goes into whole milk. There is no doubt that the premium price they receive is certainly under threat from the milk processors in Victoria, where 
 over 60 per cent of the total milk production in Australia comes from, and that those commercial pressures will continue.
This parliament needs to clearly indicate where that pressure is coming from. We also need to indicate that we believe it is about time the federal government and state agricultural ministers got together and recognised those pressures themselves and, if they cannot be resisted, put together a package which is more adequate than the package being offered. That package does not address the issue of the loss of quotas and their values and it does not address the regional impacts which in some cases will be very severe. In conclusion, I draw attention to the Bega study—which was paid for by people in Bega themselves—which shows that there will be a very significant impact on that community if deregulation does go ahead.
—I understand that there is an agreement to divide the remaining time available in this debate and I ask the Clerk to set the clock accordingly.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-21,"—First, I echo Senator Woodley's comments in relation to the activities of the secretary of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee in the conduct of this inquiry and the preparation of the report, particularly the work of Robina Jaffray, whose work in coordinating the submissions, organising hearings and the compilation of the report has been absolutely essential to the efficient functioning of this committee. Let me pay my compliments. This work is a substantial reflection of the effort and diligence of Robina and other members of the committee secretariat in the performance of their duties.
Let me also say that this committee travels through rural and regional Australia and we are indebted to Hansard for the enormous effort they put in in carrying equipment to hearings, setting up, getting information from witnesses so that the record can properly reflect who is giving evidence, and generally doing the hard slog that is not apparent from the report that the committee lays down. Without the efforts of Hansard, the members 
 of the committee and the secretariat would be extremely hampered in the performance of our work. This report also reflects the diligence, the hard work and the professionalism of Hansard in the performance of its important duty as part of the Australian parliament.
There is always a temptation in areas such as this to tell people what they want to hear. There is also a temptation just to present both sides of the argument but not draw any conclusions. These approaches have not been a feature of this committee in my experience, and this report is no exception. This committee also has a record of bringing down unanimous all-party reports and recommendations, and again this report on the Australian dairy industry is no exception. I must say that we have tested the boundaries of our ability to reach agreement. In some respects there would be passages in this report with which I would agree but others might not and I am sure other senators would say the same thing. That situation has arisen in respect of many reports handed down by this committee. We believe that it is important to have a view that reflects the totality of the views of members of the committee rather than seeking simply to pursue a set of words that a particular senator wants.
We have considered 116 submissions, we have taken evidence from 99 witnesses and there are nearly 700 pages of evidence. The evidence is that the industry has performed exceptionally well over the past two decades. It has made considerable changes over that period and, with the support of government, it has managed the process very effectively. Over the last 20 years we have had the Kerin plan, the DMSS scheme, and the Crean plan, which varied that scheme. So this industry has been the subject of considerable interest from the Australian government.
 There is no doubt that there is a long-term future for the Australian dairy industry and in my view it will be a positive one. There is no doubt as well that the Australian dairy industry will be fully deregulated over time. As this report finds, the real issue is its timing and how that process is managed. It is essential that the process is coordinated and it is clearly the responsibility of the minister, Mr 
 Truss, to manage that process. This is not simply a matter for the industry or individual states. Unfortunately, to date Mr Truss apparently has not accepted that responsibility. I am advised that in relation to the government's approach to the industry package he has now told the industry that they need to go out and sell that package to the states and that it is not a job for the federal government. That certainly is not my view.
It is also the view that, while there may be some benefits from a staged approach to deregulation, the best approach is a one-off, properly designed, adequately resourced and fully coordinated approach. It is clear that in the short term farmers and the regions in which they live will suffer under deregulation and that the position of consumers at best will not improve. In the long term the industry as a whole will benefit if further reforms are achieved in the international marketplace and, I say again, it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth government to deal with these short-term costs and maximise the potential for long-term gains.
In relation to evidence that we have received that there is some support for a proposal that there be a national plebiscite of farmers to determine what course the government and industry should take in managing the dairy industry's future, the committee believes that a simple plebiscite would not be helpful at all. However, perhaps a proper survey covering a wide range of important issues may be helpful. I have to say that this inquiry has been exhaustive—and in some respects, exhausting—and we think that the body of information that has flowed from the inquiry is a sufficient basis for governments to properly develop and implement appropriate measures to manage the process.
It is my view that the Commonwealth government has failed in this regard. It has failed to act in a timely and proper manner and, as a consequence, the industry and state governments are now forced to address these important issues in a very short time frame. That is to be regretted. Unfortunately, I have had a very limited time—which is about to expire—in which to speak on this matter, and I will deal with it again later.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Crane, Sen Winston",LP,1999-10-21,"—I support the opening remarks made by my colleague Senator O'Brien concerning the fantastic effort put in by our committee during this inquiry. I give my thanks in particular to Robina Jaffray. I have been involved in many committees and the work she did on this report was outstanding and of the very highest class. She has done a great deal of work on this report on behalf of the members of the committee and has produced a very comprehensive and fairly large report that really gets to the nitty-gritty of the key issues. I commend the spirit in which my colleagues on this committee have worked through the issues, because they are not simple or easy and go far beyond the dairy industry itself.
Before I walked into the chamber I was talking on the telephone to a friend of mine who is a dairy farmer in Harvey in Western Australia. They are now trying to work out how they will restructure the town because of the impact this will have on them. There is no doubt that over the next two or three years in rural dairy communities—as Senator Woodley said—there will be an enormous restructuring, not only of farms but also of businesses, support industries, service industries and schools. Sometimes people in this place do not have any perception of what happens when three or four children happen to leave an area. That area often loses a teacher or a nurse from the hospital or some other aspect of the service industry in the area is affected. I agree absolutely that the deregulation of the dairy industry is inevitable. In fact, I believe it is already here, even if the states do not deregulate. The DMS scheme is going and we will have across-the-border trading. The impact of that will be quite devastating to dairy farmers in the initial stages.
As a member of the government I will not accept everything that is said in this place, but, while I supported the recommendation in the report, there is some inherent criticism of the fact that the job has not been got on with quickly enough. There has not been enough attention given to it, but the states themselves, particularly New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia—although I do not list 
 them in any particular order; I can start with Western Australia first—have not been helpful. We have a conservative government in Western Australia and when we started this process Victoria had one too. The states have not been as helpful as they could have been.
As a matter of extreme urgency—as we reflect in recommendation 1—the states together with the Commonwealth must now pull their weight and get on with what is required to refine the package put on the table by the Commonwealth government and deal with all the other associated issues. One of the problems you have with a situation like this is when the states have the `head of power' under the constitution to deal with quotas while the Commonwealth has an overall responsibility. Some particular states have been tardy when it comes to dealing with their quotas and what they are going to do. You are then left with a situation which invariably ends up being totally unsatisfactory. I say to all the state ministers and to us in government that we need to put a lot of urgency into the next two, three or four months and come to conclusions that will meet the issues head on.
This has highlighted a chronic problem which we have with the agreement on competition policy. I could criticise the former government for that because they put it together with the state government, but I am not going to do that. I am going to set the challenge to this parliament that we must deal with competition policy or what I see as a gap in it, and that is looking at the national net benefit. When you go around the states individually and you get one report in one state and another report in another state, it confirms the status quo on what is happening, that there is a net public benefit. In one particular state—in this case, it happens to be Victoria by virtue of the fact that a different recommendation came out of that state—and that is not their fault; I think it is a weakness in the system—there is no consideration of the Commonwealth net benefit. That has to be addressed.
There are not many industries like the dairy industry in Australia in the way it is structured, where it has a joint responsibility. 
 Nonetheless I think it needs to be addressed and there needs to be some form of national test as well. Things might get handled a little differently if that were there.
Concerning the package, I want to raise a couple of concerns which I have. It is not the size of the package—I think it is enormous—but I am concerned about the distributional effects that that could well have in terms of what may happen regionally, within a state, and also nationally across the various states. If we analyse some of the figures which we received very recently, I think we will find that, unless there are some disciplines put around that particular package, the states—particularly Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales—are going to find it very hard to accept it because the effect will be that those states will be assisting Victoria to export milk across the border into bigger states and undermine the market milk operations there. That is a real concern which obviously the government and we in this parliament have to deal with so that we get the right result out of the package that has been put up and not one that merely shifts the problem across borders and creates further enormous social problems.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,1999-10-21,"—This report on deregulation of the Australian dairy industry is very significant. It is comprehensive and, as previous speakers have stated—and I endorse their remarks—the comprehensive nature of the report is due very much to the hard work of the secretariat, particularly Robina Jaffray, who worked with the committee throughout its hearings and deliberations. The committee had the opportunity to visit regional areas of Australia, which provided us with first-hand experience of what can be the very serious and in some cases possibly devastating effects of unbridled deregulation and competition policy upon the people working and living in those regions. All colleagues on the committee were very impressed with the evidence that was brought before us, albeit that there were different points of view put from time to time.
Time is short and I am sure there will be much more to say about this report on future 
 occasions. The dairy industry is a significant industry, both domestically and internationally. It has been restructuring since the 1970s, when it suffered a major blow due to the entry at that time of the United Kingdom into the European Community, or Common Market as it was then called. Over those years through the various plans that Senator O'Brien referred to, such as the Kerin plan and the Crean plan, the industry has had to restructure. It has improved its efficiency, and unfortunately that has come at some cost. For instance, today there are some 30 per cent fewer dairy farmers in operation than there were in the 1970s. Still the industry is characterised by some 95 per cent of those farmers being family farmers. When you visit the regions and talk to those farmers, to community leaders and to other people, as we did, you experience first-hand the concerns that they have about future deregulation, particularly the impact that reduced farm gate prices for market milk will have upon them.
While there has been a feeling of inevitability about future deregulation because of the abolition of the domestic market support scheme from July next year, that does not lessen the impact of the problem. For instance, Senator Woodley has referred to the study that was done in the Bega area in my home state of New South Wales. I urge senators and others to look in detail at that study. It demonstrates the problems that can impact upon a regional community with decisions such as this which not only directly affect the industry but have a much greater multiplier effect throughout the community. That experience could quite possibly occur in other areas of New South Wales and in other states. That is why we have recommended that there needs to be a specific focus on regional adjustment assistance within a total package.
The package that has been developed addresses particularly lost income for dairy farmers as a result of deregulation, but there is a range of other issues which also need to be addressed. We have recommended that in particular there has to be consideration given—in fact, there has to be a commitment by state and federal governments—to finding 
 ways to assist those regional communities that will be affected by what happens in this industry. As we have seen, the impact of national competition policy is not confined to just this industry.
I have to say—and I agree with Senator O'Brien—that the federal government could have picked up the ball a lot quicker and run with it a lot harder than it has done to date. I recall, in a debate in this chamber on 29 September, Senator Troeth interjecting at one point in a speech of mine and saying, `This issue is a matter for the states.' It is not a matter just for the states. Whilst regulation of the market milk industry resides with the states, the fact is that this is a national industry and a national issue and it requires national leadership. Unfortunately, I think that has been lacking. You cannot expect to just leave it to the individual states, who have different competing interests, as we have seen, to try and coordinate the final approach. What we are urging as a matter of urgency is for the federal government to coordinate, develop and implement ultimately a nationally agreed package of measures that addresses these issues, not just those that are addressed by this package. In conclusion, I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-21,"—This message relates to the Further 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security) Bill 1999  and specifically the House of Representatives' decision to disagree to an amendment made by the Senate last time around, which was an amendment that I moved on behalf of the Democrats, supported by the Senate, in an attempt to grandfather a group of people. The measure that the amendment related to sought to change the entitlements for CDEP Scheme recipients. Broadly speaking, it was a good measure which increased availability for most scheme recipients to various add-ons that social security recipients normally receive, such as rent assistance, but it also had a flow-on effect of reducing payments for about 4,000 people, mainly women on sole parents pension. That was of concern to the Democrats.
We were willing to accept the intent of the change that the government was putting forward in relation to sole parents, which was to ensure consistency of treatment across all 
 income support recipients, but we did feel that it was inappropriate for the approximately 4,000 people that were already in that circumstance to have their income reduced by a fairly significant amount. Thus, we moved a grandfathering related amendment to protect those people whilst ensuring that any people in the future in receipt of the lone parenting payment would be treated differently under the new regime.
It appears, as the House of Representatives and the government have indicated, that they do not like the concept of a grandfather clause, at least in relation to this particular amendment, and also that the original amendment did not meet the purpose for which it was intended.
Following some communication with the Clerk and also with assistance from the government, I think we have come to an amendment which does have the intent that the Democrats had initially. I suppose this is starting to be an indication of how complex the Social Security Act is becoming and how difficult it is to get amendments that have the intent that one desires reflected in them. But I think we have got it this time. Obviously, as part of that, we would like to indicate that the original intent of the Democrats to have a grandfathering amendment to protect those lone parents currently on the CDEP Scheme to retain their current income treatment is something the Democrats wish to pursue and continue with. Having now, I think, got an amendment which we believe will achieve that, I will move that amendment, which has been circulated, at the appropriate stage in the debate.
I will speak to it briefly without going through all the arguments that we went through last time we discussed the bill. The Democrats believe, as I have just stated, that it is appropriate that those people who are already in the situation do not have a significant reduction in their income. There are two things I would like to emphasise in support of that.
 Firstly, in terms of the concept of grandfathering itself, it was pointed out in this chamber on Tuesday, when the government was putting forward some changes to the 
 Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (1999 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1999, that those changes include a grandfathering clause for some people, so that they would not be negatively impacted by the changes that were proposed to shared caring arrangements. I think that in itself demonstrates that inserting grandfathering arrangements is not calamitous public policy that will cease to enable the effective operation of the entire income support system.
As I stated the first time around, I think it is a legitimate transitional method to try to smooth the effect of change so that any changes that are made do not impact too severely and suddenly on people. The government itself obviously had the same view in relation to another change it was proposing with that other piece of legislation, so I think that in itself shows that there is nothing inherently unacceptable about grandfathering.
I would also like to mention some comments that the Democrats have received from ATSIC. As was stated the first time around, the Democrats quite willingly conceded that ATSIC as a body have expressed their support for the changes the government is proposing to ensure equitable treatment for all CDEP participants. They have stated that and they are keen to get the measure up and running. A letter dated 30 September from Gatjil Djerrkura to the Democrats stated:
I am advised that the Democrats are proposing a grandfathering amendment, which would enable those lone parents currently participating on the CDEP scheme to retain the current income treatment whilst they remain as CDEP participants. ATSIC supports this proposal because it protects the present income of those lone parents currently participating on the CDEP scheme.
I would like to read that into the record as an indication that the government have made some play on the fact that ATSIC supported their amendments, which is quite appropriate for them to highlight. I would also like put on the record that ATSIC has indicated support for the Democrats' proposal to have a grandfathering amendment as part of that changeover.
I think those are sufficient arguments, certainly from the Democrats' point of view, 
 to persevere with our original intent of having a grandfathering component as part of this change and with the hope of an amendment which I believe does meet that purpose. I could ask Senator Campbell, who has an extensive knowledge of the Social Security Act 1991, to outline that in greater detail but I have actually discussed it with his advisers already. I am satisfied that it does meet the aim of the intention that the Democrats had in relation to this. That being the case, I would like to eagerly dispose of the government's motion and then move my amendment.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-10-21,"—On behalf of the Labor opposition, we will be obviously supporting the government motion because it disposes of the Democrats' original amendments, and we will be supporting Senator Bartlett's amendment as circulated in the chamber. It seeks to give legislative effect to the position that they originally proposed. In the original debate in this chamber, Labor had a proposition that the benefit for single parents to access CDEP payments was to be supported. The Democrats did not support that view, and they put up a compromise position, which was that we grandfather the entitlements of those currently in receipt of CDEP.
I said during that debate that I thought that was a second best option, but that, reading the numbers in the chamber, the Labor opposition was prepared to support that. It had the advantage of at least protecting the entitlements of those people currently in receipt of the single parenting payment and CDEP. We would prefer to see the situation that currently exists continue because we do not think there is any good reason for reducing the payments made to some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. We are talking about single parent Aboriginal people supporting children and also working in the CDEP program. We think they are some of the most disadvantaged members of our community.
These are people who are making an effort to contribute to their society. We believe the current arrangements give them the same entitlements as other single parents in terms of earning a tax-free income which allows 
 them to supplement their parenting payment. Sure, this is a supplement that is going from another Commonwealth funded scheme, but we believe, given the isolation of these communities and the absence of any other employment opportunities, that it is not unreasonable to say that they ought to be able to access both payments. This in effect would be their equivalent of obtaining part-time employment in the private sector. There is virtually no part-time or full-time work available in these communities outside the CDEP program. They do not have the opportunities that people living in other communities have. Given that they are single parent Aboriginal people, living in remote communities and trying to bring up children, we think that the current arrangements are not overly generous and that it is a mistake to seek to reduce the entitlements that these people currently enjoy. We think doing so in the name of uniformity is not sufficient justification.
But we have had that argument. We have put that case. The Democrats are putting up a compromise proposition, which is the grandfathering proposition that is before us today. We supported that during the original debate and will support that again as a second-best option. We accept the government's advice that the original amendments did not achieve what we sought to achieve in terms of the legislative outcome. It is obviously important that we get it right. Senator Bartlett has now circulated an amendment which seeks to give effect to that proposition. We will support that again today, and we hope that the government will accept that as a reasonable compromise between what they set out to achieve and the interests of the people affected, which we think ought to be given some priority in this debate. So we will be supporting the motion moved by Senator Ian Campbell to not insist on that original set of amendments, but we will also be supporting Senator Bartlett when he moves the new amendment which establishes the grandfathering provision for single parents who are CDEP participants. We believe that is a much better alternative than the complete removal of those benefits, as proposed by the government.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-10-21,"—I move:
(1)	 Schedule 2, page 40 (after line 6), at the end of the Schedule, add:
55 Benefits of single parents who are CDEP participants not to be reduced
	 (1)	 Section 1188C inserted in the Social Security Act 1991 by item 53 does not apply in respect of a person who, immediately before the day on which this Act receives the Royal Assent:
		 (a)	 was in receipt of parenting payment at the rate applicable for a person who is not a member of a couple: and
		 (b)	 was a CDEP participant.
	 (2)	 However, if such a person ceases on or after that day to be a CDEP participant, subitem (1) ceases to have effect in respect of the person whether or not he or she afterwards again becomes a CDEP participant.
I spoke to this amendment at length before when I thought I was moving it. For the reasons that I outlined before, I think it is a good one to support, and I urge the Senate to do so.
Amendment agreed to.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-21,"—We are not unhappy with the government changing the program. I make the point that it appears that somewhere along the line there has been a problem in communication. We are ready to proceed with the RFA Bill but, if the government wishes not to, perhaps the best thing to do while we sort the matter 
 out is to proceed with another matter. We are not aware of any arrangement to change the program. In terms of being prepared to proceed on another bill, I understand that we are ready to proceed now.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Government Business</title>,Business,17,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-10-21,"—I indicate, as I was the shadow minister on duty in the chamber at the time, that Senator Ian Campbell has suggested to us that there is need for the RFA Bill to be deferred, on advice he has got from Mr Tuckey's office suggesting that he has some agreement with the Labor Party to that effect. The Labor Party senators in the chamber are not aware of that, but in order for us to progress without undue delay we will agree to this motion, on the basis that, if that is not true, the RFA Bill will come straight on after the international tax bill. Obviously there has been some discussion and it is best not to delay the Senate. I understand that Senator Sherry is prepared to go ahead with the international tax bill, but we would obviously want to come back to the RFA Bill if Senator Campbell's information is not correct. It seems sensible that we proceed and vote for this motion at this stage.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-10-21,"—The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1999  proposes to enact double taxation agreements, known as DTAs, with South Africa, the Slovak Republic and Argentina. In addition, it also proposes to enact a protocol—an amendment—to the existing DTA with Malaysia. These are generally consistent but do have some differing provisions because of the specific domestic tax arrangements of some jurisdictions. DTAs exist to clarify taxing rights between jurisdictions for income derived in one jurisdiction by a resident of another jurisdiction. 
 They attempt to ensure an equitable distribution of taxing rights between jurisdictions and to avoid double taxation, so as to encourage trade and investment between entities of the jurisdictions.
Australia has a large network of DTAs mainly because Labor, when in office, significantly expanded the network of DTAs that Australia is a party to. We did this in order to create a better environment for Australian business to operate internationally and to encourage productive investment in Australia. This approach has been built upon by the current government and these latest agreements are the results of the continuation of Labor's successful policies.
I might say in passing, at least in respect of the Slovak Republic, that it is a new nation as a result of the fall of the former Soviet Union and the break-up of the old Czechoslovak communist state. I will make no comment about the break-up of the Czechoslovak state obviously caused by the creation of a new nation in Europe.
I will turn to the specific provisions. Australia's DTAs are all broadly similar in their design. They are based generally on the OECD model convention but they also reflect the particular economic circumstances of Australia, namely Australia being a large capital importer, and the domestic tax rules of the other jurisdiction on some occasions. For example, the taxation of some annuities under the South African DTA differs from the normal agreements Australia is a party to because of the specific treatment of this income under South African law. Similarly, the withholding tax limits for interest, royalties and dividends under the Argentinian DTA vary from the normal practice, as does the inclusion of the specific branch profits tax provision. These variations reflect the reality of negotiations with differing tax jurisdictions and are not opposed by Labor.
However, Labor is concerned at what it sees as the continuing slowness by the government on two fronts concerning our international agreements network: firstly, putting Australian firms on a level playing field where they invest overseas, compared to the generous deal Australia gives foreign investors here; 
 and, secondly, the negligence concerning international tax avoidance through the use of these treaties which the current government has, at least to date, not rectified.
Let me deal firstly with the unfairness of current dividend withholding tax arrangements. The recent Ralph committee's final report covered this issue at pages 677 and 678. The recommendation is:
That in negotiating double taxation arrangements, Australia endeavour to reduce dividend withholding tax rates on non-portfolio investments.
Non-portfolio investments are those where the investment represents 10 per cent or more of a business. So Mr Ralph has recommended to the Liberal government that it undertake specific action concerning DTAs to overcome situations where Australia is more generous to foreign investors than the particular foreign nation is to Australian shareholders. I emphasise that we need to be overcoming the situations where Australia is more generous to foreign investors than the particular foreign nation is to Australian shareholders.
Certainly, in the debate about business tax reforms, it is often emphasised that Australia is less competitive compared with many of our trading partners and international competitors, and at least in some situations Australia is in fact more generous than many of these overseas countries. As Mr Ralph notes at page 678:
Since 1994 Australia has sought lower foreign dividend withholding tax rates on non-portfolio dividends . . .
So Labor started to address this problem. The treaties before us today do deal with this issue because they are following the policy established by Labor. For example, proposed article 10(2)(A) of the South African agreement does obtain fair treatment for Australian shareholders with investments in South Africa. This is because the Liberal government is following Labor's policy lead.
The real issue—the most important aspect of this anomaly—is with the nations with which Australia has the largest investments. The two major nations are, of course, the United Kingdom and the United States. The United Kingdom has fixed the problem through its domestic law but not through the 
 DTA, so at least at the moment the problem does not occur in Britain. But in the United States it is still happening. In the US the current DTA arrangements allow the unfair situation whereby a 15 per cent dividend withholding tax is imposed on Australian businesses remitting dividends from taxed profits from the United States, whereas Australia does not levy such a withholding tax on US investors out of taxed profits from Australia. This is a clear example—despite the often repeated claims, most of which are generalised in the Australian community—that we have less competitive tax arrangements than the United States, for example.
What are the government doing about this anomaly? To date they have been completely silent on this matter. I would just emphasise this again. In respect of the United States, we have the unfair situation where a 15 per cent dividend withholding tax is imposed on Australian businesses remitting dividends from taxed profits from America. Australia does not levy such a withholding tax on US investors out of taxed profits from Australia. This is an example of where Australia's economic interests are being damaged by the poor international relations conducted by the Howard Liberal government. There have been some other examples of this in recent times, but they relate to other matters and I will not go into them here today.
We should have more clout in Washington than we have at the present time. If we did, perhaps we could make some progress in renegotiating this treaty. Unfortunately it seems that the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, does not have a great deal of clout, at least with the current administration in the United States. This is an area to which urgent attention should be given because of the disadvantage to which Australian businesses are being put. Furthermore, the Treasurer's introduction to the United States, which I think most would recall, where he inappropriately and publicly talked about his meeting with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve had the unfortunate side-effect of diminishing our credibility with some of the key economic policy makers in the United States.
Secondly, the Liberal government has not legislated to close the enormous loophole under Australia's DTAs which has arisen because of the decision in the Lamesa Holdings case in 1997. This decision means that foreigners can take free capital gains on holdings of Australian land and mining ventures through utilising a simple chain of companies. Let me emphasise the central concern about this case again. The decision means that foreigners—not Australians—can take tax free capital gains on holdings of Australian land and mining ventures through utilising a simple chain of companies. There has been no legislation, despite the fact that the Treasurer issued a press release promising to do something about this loophole on 27 April 1998—approximately 18 months ago.
Let me deal, in some small detail at least, with the decision in respect of Lamesa Holdings. The Lamesa decision was handed down by the full Federal Court on 20 August 1997. It dismissed an appeal by the tax office concerning a significant loophole in Australia's ability to tax gains arising from Australian real property, including mining rights. The court held that the existing double taxation agreements, DTAs, which give Australia the exclusive right to tax profits arising from the alienation of real property situated in Australia—and this includes shares in companies that hold interests in real property—did not apply in the situation where multiple layers of subsidiaries were interposed between the non-resident holding company and the Australian real property. The disposal of the interest in the Australian asset was accomplished indirectly through selling one of the interposed companies rather than the asset itself.
The effect of this decision, if unaddressed, is to make simple the avoidance of tax on gains made by the non-resident through holding Australian real property. All real property assets held by non-residents can be restructured into a multiple, interposed structure and a significant Australian tax base would then be at risk. It is not just this; there is also the particular problem of the unfairness with respect to Australian resident taxpayers, who do have to pay the appropriate level of 
 capital gains tax. Yet we have the continuing situation where, potentially, the foreign owners—the non-residents—can minimise or even eliminate their capital gains tax on property and some mining interests.
Rather belatedly the Treasurer issued release No. 39 on 27 April 1998 which announced that, from that time, indirect alienations of Australian real property, as occurred in Lamesa, would be subject to Australian tax. This was justified, and quite correctly, as being a move to shore up Australia's existing taxing rights rather than create a new tax base. The result was announced as being achieved by Australia unilaterally amending its international tax legislation in respect of all DTAs rather than individually renegotiating each DTA. I would just remind the Senate that we do not have the legislation yet that deals with the commitment and the announcement made by the Treasurer, by press release, promising to do something about this loophole—and this announcement was made on 27 April, 18 months ago.
—Order! Honourable senators, may I suggest that if you want to hold a meeting, you do it outside the chamber, please.
—I am about to conclude, so hopefully the discussions that are going on will lead to a resolution of the legislation that is outstanding in respect of some other matters. It is considered that this response is the only feasible one to protect the revenue, but this government has not as yet done that. I emphasise the unfairness of Australian resident taxpayers paying appropriate capital gains tax on real property situated in Australia, including shares in companies that hold interests in real property, when foreign residents are not paying the appropriate level of capital gains tax.
I hope that phone call has been answered to try to sort out the particular negotiations that are under way. It should be seen in that context.
Senator McGauran interjecting—
—That was not my mobile phone, by the way.
—The protocol, Julian, is that you people should have your program sorted out.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I have been provoked to rise on a point of order about the matter that just occurred. I attempted to overlook it but I think it is important to make this statement. I ask you to take back to the President the incident that just occurred: a mobile phone went off in the chamber and the offending senator picked it up and started to talk into it. Is there any such protocol with regard to mobile phones inside the chamber?
—There is no point of order, but I will take it back to the President, Senator McGauran.
Senator Murphy interjecting—
—There is no point of order, Senator Murphy.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a further point of order. You indicated to Senator McGauran that you would take it back to the President. I suggest to you that there is a protocol that relates to the use of mobile phones or carrying mobile phones in the chamber. It is clearly spelt out and most senators do know about it, but on some occasions they may forget. I suggest to you that there is nothing to take back to the President on this because what we do with respect to mobile phones is already a common practice.
—There is no point of order, I reiterate that to Senator Murphy.
Senator McGauran interjecting—
—There is no point of order, Senator McGauran. Are you rising on a fresh point of order?
—I can't pretend that I am.
—There is no point of order, Senator McGauran.
Senator McGauran interjecting—
—I understand Senator McGauran has indicated he is going to withdraw his request. It was an unfortunate interlude but, as Senator Murphy highlighted to the chamber, there have been some fairly strenuous negotiations going on about the program. I think that the unfortunate occurrence of the mobile phone ringing should be seen in that context.
—Are you still speaking to the bill?
—Yes, I certainly am. I was speaking in respect of the unfortunate interlude that occurred, which was part of my speech which I maintain is relevant. I am about to conclude my remarks. As I was emphasising before the interruption, it is very unfortunate that we have a situation in Australia where foreign residents who own property in Australia can avoid capital gains tax through interposed entities and restructuring of their various companies. Australians cannot do that. It is a very unfortunate situation, and the opposition makes that point and urges the government to deal with that matter as expeditiously as possible in the legislation coming before this place.
I conclude my remarks by saying that the Labor opposition support this legislation. It enacts double taxation agreements with South Africa, the Slovak Republic and Argentina. We support it because it is appropriate to have fairness and equity—a level playing field—in the international arena to avoid incidences of double taxation. This agreement adds to that and adds to the large network of DTAs that were negotiated when the Labor Party were in government. Albeit with a number of suggestions and criticisms that I have referred to in my speech, we are pleased to see this legislation being extended to these three particular countries. We therefore support the legislation.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL TAX AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,1999-10-21,"—Firstly, in regard to Senator Sherry's comments about the Lamesa legislation, as honourable senators are aware, the Treasurer issued a press release on 27 April 1998 announcing that the government would take 
 action to deal with effective alienation of Australian real property, as in the Lamesa case. The government remains committed to dealing with the issue and asserting Australia's taxing right in such cases. The press release referred to announced the change would apply from 27 April 1998, the date of the press release.
I thank honourable senators who have participated in this debate. The  International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill 1999  will provide legislative authority for three new comprehensive double taxation agreements with South Africa, Slovakia and Argentina and an amending protocol to our existing agreement with Malaysia. The new agreements are consistent with agreements previously concluded by Australia in recent years.
The government believes that conclusion of these new agreements and protocol will go a long way to strengthening the trade investment and wider relationship between Australia and each of these countries. The agreement and protocol will enter into force respectively when diplomatic notes are exchanged advising that all of the necessary domestic processes to give them the force of law in each country have been completed. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-10-21,"—The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1999  relates to two issues. Firstly, it adds members of the Western Australian Anti-Corruption Commission and the Queensland Crime Commission and authorised staff members of those commissions to the list of people who may apply for interception warrants. Secondly, it removes from the 
 Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Act 1997 the sunset clause on the provision that allows members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue interception warrants. The Australian Democrats have no concerns in relation to the granting of the power to apply for warrants to members of the Western Australian Anti-Corruption Commission or the Queensland Crime Commission or to authorised staff.
The reason that I want to speak briefly to this bill today is to recount our views in relation to members of the AAT issuing interception warrants. This issue was debated in September 1997. The view of the Australian Democrats at that time was that, rather than reposing this power in members of the AAT, we would have preferred that it be reposed in state Supreme Court judges. Additionally, we took the view that, before a member of the AAT was nominated to perform this function, the minister should have first made an assessment whether the number of judges performing the function was sufficient or insufficient. The Australian Democrats are still of the view that it is preferable for this function to be performed by judges rather than by members of the AAT who are, with respect, ultimately, administrative officers of the executive government.
The Australian Labor Party did not support either of the amendments I have outlined when my colleague Senator Murray first moved them in 1997. They have again indicated informally that they would not do so on this occasion if they were moved again. I will not be moving those amendments again, but I would like it to be noted for the record that the Australian Democrats very much retain a preference for warrant applications to be dealt with by members of the judiciary rather than officers of the executive. The 1997 amendment act included a requirement that the annual report for 1999-2000 include a review of the amendments by the act. The Telecommunications Interception Policy Review, prepared by Mr Peter Ford of the Attorney-General's Department, makes the comment that, by all accounts, the conferral of the power on nominated members of the AAT 
 had worked well in practice and that the AAT members who have been nominated have a high status and are independent of the executive. He stated that they bring to the task a seriousness of purpose and commitment to principles of accountability which serves the public interest well.
The Australian Democrats are pleased that this is the case, and I am unaware of any specific problems arising out of the decision to allow members of the AAT to issue interception warrants. That report goes on to refer to the proposed new Administrative Review Tribunal, which will replace the AAT, and to suggest that members of that tribunal will continue to perform the function of issuing warrants. I understand that amendments will be required to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 before that can occur, and I would ask the minister or his representative to inform me if my understanding of that is correct.
I submit that the government are being very presumptuous if they think it is a foregone conclusion that members of the new ART will simply pick up where the members of the AAT left off in terms of issuing warrants. I signal to the government that the Australian Democrats would be very careful in assessing the nature of the role of members of the ART and their qualifications before we would even consider allowing those members to perform this extremely important function.
The report also refers to the creation of the federal magistracy and the potential for federal magistrates to be nominated as persons who will be able to issue warrants. Again, I understand that this would require an amendment to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, and I again note that the Democrats would be very careful in ensuring that nomination of federal magistrates in that circumstance would be appropriate. Subject to these comments, the Australian Democrats support this bill.",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-21,"—I rise to very briefly indicate that the opposition support the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1999 . I want to make a couple of comments as to why we are dealing with it now and not at 12.45 p.m., 
 given that it was intended that we deal with a message relating to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . There was an exchange in this chamber because that bill was pulled by the government with, apparently, as I have subsequently ascertained, some consultation with the opposition in the House of Representatives. I will acknowledge that Senator Ian Campbell was correct when he said that there had been consultation, and I wish to put that on the record.
It should be on the record that there was a request from Mr Tuckey's office for the opposition to agree to pull the bill—or the message, I should say—today. The opposition's position is that it is a matter for the government to arrange their business in this chamber, and the government have done so by making a decision to pull the consideration of the message relating to the Regional Forests Agreement Bill. It is a matter for the government as to when that bill proceeds. I indicate that the opposition is ready, willing and able to deal with that bill at any time. As I say, it is a matter for the government to decide when that bill is dealt with and it is a matter that the government will be obliged to clarify should there be any question as to whose decision it was to pull the bill. I say again: the bill was pulled by the government and the opposition has acceded to their request, as it is the government's decision to proceed or not with the message, and the opposition is ready, willing and able to proceed with that matter. In relation to the bill before the chamber, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1999 , my understanding is that the opposition is supporting that bill and obviously, if the Democrats are not proceeding with amendments, we do not need to consider those matters now. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-10-21,"—The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999  makes a number of amendments to the National Health Act 1953 and seeks to address various concerns raised in the Industry Commission's report No. 57 into private health insurance by making changes to the operation and powers of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. The main elements of the bill relate to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. The proposals that are now before us extend the regulatory powers and the independence of PHIAC from the department and the minister in all but matters of policy. Schedule 1 of the bill will transfer further functions and powers from the Department of Health and Aged Care to PHIAC to enhance its role as an industry regulator, and this includes the power to register funds, cancel registrations and approve mergers.
Schedule 1 also has a number of other amendments that give PHIAC further functions, including (1) requiring health funds to be incorporated as companies—this will ensure a professionalism in the health funds and will ensure that funds are subject to the financial rigour that members could legitimately expect in any membership arrangement; (2) amending the act to require health funds to hold health insurance as their primary business so that health fund moneys are spent on health insurance matters; (3) making sure that business decisions must now be made acting in the interests of members, and this also gives the courts powers to set aside transactions which are not in the interests of members of the fund; (4) there will also be a new civil penalty regime for directors where serious contraventions have occurred without them taking reasonable steps to avoid them.
The opposition supports all of these amendments because we believe they will make the industry more accountable and more in line with the expectations of their membership. However, we believe the government should go further, and that PHIAC should be made a stronger and more independent authority. The huge rebate the government is now pouring into private health insurance adds 
 weight to that argument and that there needs to be effective monitoring of the spending of that rebate.
The powers in relation to the prudential regulation of registered funds are dealt with in schedule 2 of the bill. At the moment the minimum reserve requirements do not adequately reflect the reality that a number of funds have operated within these for a number of years. It is proposed to strengthen PHIAC's role by giving it increased power of oversight and the power to order the appointment of an administrator or the wind-up of a fund. It is worth noting that, as at 30 June last year, PHIAC reported that five out of 44 funds were in breach of the solvency standards—down from nine in the previous year. It is unsettling to the opposition that this number of funds are in breach of these requirements. This bill will require PHIAC to set a standard, which may differ between various health benefit organisations, in writing. PHIAC is required to consult with the Australian Government Actuary in that process, and these standards would be a disallowable instrument of this parliament.
The involvement of the Government Actuary is a key to the success of these arrangements in the view of the opposition. We believe it is the appropriate body from which PHIAC can draw advice over capital adequacy and solvency standards, but under the legislation there is no requirement for PHIAC to actually follow the actuary's advice. Again I am drawn to my point relating to the experience and skills base in PHIAC currently. The opposition has put forward an amendment to require the council to publish its reasons if it decides to reject the advice of the Government Actuary, so that the council's decisions will be transparent.
With regard to schedule 3 of the bill, these measures deal with a number of changes that arise out of the defects and unforeseen consequences of the 1998 private health insurance rebate legislation. This bill will remove the requirement for annual registration for receiving the rebate—meaning that, while we may have some incorrect payments, the administration becomes much simpler. In keeping with Senator Harradine's amendments, should 
 a fund not offer no gap or no gap policies by July 2000, the minister will have the power under these amendments to have them wound up. The Health Insurance Commission will be required to pay claims within 14 days. Fund members who have had a claim rejected will be able to seek a review by the Health Insurance Commission before having to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as currently applies.
While we agree with these amendments, this serves to underline for us the rather ham-fisted and excessively hurried approach the government has had to the health rebate legislation. The point that needs to be made is that the government keeps making change after change to private health insurance without ever planning out what it wants to do or how it will get there. I refer the government to the Industry Commission report No. 57 into private health insurance. On page 364 of that report it states:
The overriding purpose of any regulatory regime should be the protection of consumers and not the protection of inefficient funds.
This is one of the key objectives of the opposition in relation to the private health insurance legislation, and I am pleased that the government has accepted the opposition amendments to give a stronger set of consumer rights for those with health insurance. Under the opposition amendments, the council will have a clear set of objectives which require the protection of consumer interests and the minimisation of premium increases.
Other important changes include: public reports will show the price increases for each fund and each state, which will allow consumers to shop around between health funds; rule changes will no longer be allowed to be made in secret; all members will receive an explanation of changes in plain English before they become effective; appeals will be allowed against decisions of the Health Insurance Commission to recover overpayments of the 30 per cent health rebate; and a waiver will be allowed where the overpayment is due to incorrect information or administrative error. These changes will give consumers more power and will force the industry to be more competitive.
We have also proposed amendments to improve the accountability of the industry regulator, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. Council members will no longer be able to be drawn from people managing or working for a fund in order for it to operate at arms length from the industry. These changes will make the bill stronger, and this will be good for the long-term health of the private health insurance funds. I indicate that we will support the bill, and we hope that other senators will support the amendments we move today.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-10-21,"—This piece of legislation, the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 , proposes a significant revamp of the responsibilities of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, also known as PHIAC. The Democrats support this piece of legislation and congratulate the government on the work in it. We will also be supporting the ALP amendments. We believe that the role of PHIAC is particularly important, given the large amount of money that is now finding its way into private health insurance through the rebate—I understand it is around $1.6 billion a year. We certainly support the independence of PHIAC from both the government and the private health insurance industry, to ensure that it can operate in a transparent and accountable manner, free from any political interests and free from any pressure from the health insurance industry. We therefore support the provisions of this bill, which will protect consumers by strengthening the prudential regulation of the private health insurance industry.
We will also be moving some amendments to this bill to further strengthen the accountability and transparency of the regulation of private health insurance. These amendments relate to the appointment of members of PHIAC and the appointment of the Private Health Insurance Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner. The Democrats are concerned to ensure that, wherever appointments are made to public authorities, the process by which these appointments are made is transparent, accountable, open and 
 honest. The practice of `jobs for the boys' should be well and truly behind us as we move towards the year 2000, but unfortunately not much seems to have changed. Certainly in the public perception of how appointments are made, there is still a lot of work to be done. The perception is still very much one that appointments are based on anything but merit. The perception of how appointments to boards such as this are made can damage the bodies, as, in the public eye, they are seen as having in their membership people who lack the appropriate independence and possibly the appropriate skills as well.
It is still the case in Australia that appointments to statutory authorities are left largely to the discretion of the minister who has the relevant portfolio responsibility. In the absence of umbrella legislation to correct this situation in a systematic fashion, the Democrats have moved these amendments time and time again, arguing for them as each piece of legislation that deals with such bodies comes before us. We are attempting to set up an accountable regime concerning appointments made by ministers. I have forgotten how many times my colleague Senator Murray has moved a similar batch of amendments, but he has done so on many occasions.
The Nolan committee, which reviewed the process for making public appointments in the United Kingdom, led to the establishment of an Office of Commissioner for Public Appointments. That allowed for external scrutiny of how these appointments are made in the United Kingdom. The commissioner subsequently developed a code of practice for public appointments, which came into force in the UK over three years ago, on 1 July 1996. The code regulates appointments to non-departmental public bodies and sets out seven principles on which such appointments must be based: ministerial responsibility, merit, independent scrutiny, equal opportunity, probity, openness and transparency and proportionality. The code provides mandatory guidelines for the application of these principles.
A comparison of these reforms with the current practice here in the federal sphere of Australia shows very clearly that we lag well 
 behind the United Kingdom in this respect. Not only do we lack the external scrutiny mechanisms, in the form of the Commissioner for Public Appointments, but, more fundamentally, we do not even have basic procedural safeguards. The Democrats believe that this should be addressed by government as a matter of high priority. The public must have confidence that ministers will not allow improper procedures and will not allow largely irrelevant considerations or, perhaps, personal interest to get in the way of their decisions or to influence public appointments. This relationship is, in some respects, analogous to those of a financial nature, such as the relationship between a trustee and beneficiary, in that it is founded on a high degree of trust and confidence. Where a breach of duty occurs in a fiduciary relationship, the person to whom the duty is owed has access to a range of remedies, but this is not the case where the minister acts in an improper way. There is no avenue for redress. This omission is addressed in the amendments that I will be moving and I look forward to support from other senators for these amendments.
Also in the amendments is a further provision, which requires that, even where the code of practice has been adhered to in determining an appointment, the minister be further obliged to consider the impact of the appointee on the overall complexity of the authority. In the case of PHIAC, this is particularly important. The provision prevents the capturing of a body by a particular sectional interest. Certainly the risk here is that the private health insurance industry—which has a lot to gain or, perhaps, lose—has considerable influence, and there is considerable potential for vested interest to seek to influence this regulatory regime. I say again clearly that our amendments further increase the transparency and accountability of prudential regulation of the private health insurance industry.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-21,"—This is a rather extraordinary occurrence. We have gone through a process where the government sought to reorder the business and proceed with other matters and indicated that there was some agreement that consideration of this message not proceed today. As that information had not been conveyed to the opposition in this chamber, I and Senator Evans indicated that we were proceeding on the basis that we were effectively accepting 
 what Senator Campbell had told us. Subsequently, I advised this chamber that we had been advised there had been a communication from Mr Tuckey's office to the opposition in the House of Representatives with regard to the processing of this message today, that the government was requesting that this matter not proceed today and that the opposition's position was that it was a matter for the government as to whether this message proceeded today or not. The opposition accepted that, as it was a matter for the government, we would not be standing in its way.
We now see that this message has been brought back on for debate today. The opposition is ready, willing and able to deal with the matter today as outlined. But we have lost a considerable period of time to deal with this matter. I do not propose to take a great deal of time at the moment in this debate, other than to point out that any delay in this process is not a delay occasioned by a request of the opposition and if there is any attempt to misrepresent the position then it will be just that—a misrepresentation of the position. Having said that, the opposition is ready to proceed immediately. I have taken the opportunity of advising other parties who I am advised did not know that this matter was coming back on now—and, hopefully, there is no disadvantage. I have taken that step but apparently the government had not.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-10-21,"—I have never heard such extraordinary claims about a piece of legislation and its value. The minister for forests would have us believe this is the be-all and end-all for everything related to forestry; that it will guarantee Tasmania will get a pulp and paper mill; and, indeed, it will guarantee that somehow we will have sustainable forestry as a result. The minister's representative, the parliamentary secretary, Senator Troeth, said a number of things in here yesterday. She said:
. . . the consequence of the opposition's amendments would be the immediate cessation of woodchip processing in all areas except those where RFAs were signed before 1 March 1999, because the exporters would have no guarantee that their product could be shipped. 

Nothing could be further from the truth. If I did not already know that the parliamentary secretary knows very little about this matter, I would accuse her of deliberately misleading the Senate.
The fact is that woodchip exports are dealt with under the Customs Act. There is no way that a delay of this bill, its non-passage or the amendment of it will have any impact on the government at a Commonwealth level or state governments getting approval for woodchip exports. That is simply the fact. Nothing that the parliamentary secretary said yesterday could be further from the truth, but I forgive her because I know she does not really know the processes relating to the granting of export woodchip licences. She went on to say:
The mere fact that Senate approval was required would prevent a woodchip exporter from processing residues.
Again, this is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts; no way is that the case. She further said:
Timber mills would either close or lay off workers, and contractors would be unemployed. These impacts would hit hardest in small mills where sales of residue play a larger part in cash flow.
She got the last part right, because residues do play an important part in the cash flow of small sawmills.
Nothing in this bill, amended or otherwise, will have any impact on that. The biggest impact on small sawmills in this country are the decisions made in the boardrooms of North Forest Products, Boral and others. That is where they stand to lose, because those people take decisions about the amount of money they pay them for residues. Indeed, even under the Customs Act, there is nothing that can prevent the domestic processing of wood in this country. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth has no control over the domestic processing of wood, that is, the processing of timber in this country.
I am sure some senators would recall the debate about the Wesley Vale pulp and paper mill. If they do recall, they will understand what the facts are in respect of this matter. The  minister said that unless we passed this legislation Tasmania would not get a $2 
 billion pulp and paper mill. What a load of rubbish. The parliamentary secretary said:
There would also need to be a freeze on industry development . . . 
Even with RFAs there has been a freeze on industry development. There are a whole range of other reasons, which I will go into further if I get the opportunity. The parliamentary secretary further said:
Therefore, the only thing that these amendments are achieving is delaying the bill until after all the RFAs are signed and preventing the government from getting on with the job of restructuring the industry under secure RFA regimes.
Nothing in the RFAs will allow the Commonwealth to get on with the job of restructuring the industry.
Although this legislation may claim to do a number of things, essentially it is designed to do one thing. It commits the Commonwealth to the payment of compensation should the Commonwealth breach a regional forest agreement. That is essentially all it does—nothing more, nothing less. A regional forest agreement is a signed agreement between the states and the Commonwealth and it is already in place in some states. It is an agreement regarding the conservation and preservation of certain areas, and other areas which are available for commercial forestry.
I say to the parliamentary secretary: read the bill. That is what it does. The parliamentary secretary says that the effect of the amendments proposed by the opposition will bring the forestry world to an end. What a load of nonsense. It has no effect. It is a disapproval process. A constitutional question was raised by the parliamentary secretary. As I understand it, the Constitution indicates that the Commonwealth cannot make a law for part of a state or a law that has different application to other states or parts of other states, but in this case the amendments would not have the effect of making a different law. There is nothing wrong with the parliament reviewing a process. We do it with a number of other acts and processes when we review what is proposed to be put in place. With regard to the constitutional aspects of this matter, at the end of the day a state or a region within a state gets an RFA. It may not 
 be the RFA that was initially proposed for whatever reason, and I have my own personal views about that process. However, the reality is that we ought to deal with the facts in this place.
Finally, I did not think I would ever hear this statement, but somehow the $2 billion trade deficit in the pulp and paper industry has been thrown up at us. If the government is really serious about doing something about that, it would not be worrying about a major debate on this piece of legislation. It would get on with the job and actually give this industry some direction. The government would take the sort of direction that can be taken at a Commonwealth level in conjunction with the states and bring about some real industry development.
This piece of legislation will not guarantee that. We have had a regional forest agreement in my state for 12 months. Despite the grand claim made by the former minister—I think it was Anderson—along with the Prime Minister that a thousand jobs were going to be created, not one has been. In fact, we have probably lost 500 or 600. Let us not try to concoct stories about how important this piece of legislation really is. It is important for one reason; and at the end of the day it is not all that important for that reason, because the opposition in this place, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, cannot stop the government from paying compensation to a state.
Remember, it is the government that has to make the decision to take action against the state if it feels it has not complied with the regional forest agreement. It is the government; not the opposition, not the Senate. If you read the bill, there is a certain process even for the Commonwealth to terminate a regional forest agreement. But at the end of the day it is the government that makes that decision, as it is the government that will make the decision to issue woodchip licences, if it deems fit, for the export of woodchips from areas that are covered by a regional forest agreement, whether or not it is certified by regional forest agreement legislation in any form. 
It is about time that this minister and a few others around this place stopped saying that somehow this legislation is the fundamental underpinning of the future of the forest industry in this country—because it is not. We proposed an amendment other than the one for disapproval, and that was to set up a Wood and Paper Industry Council. To my mind, it was one of the most important aspects of this legislation because it would have put back into regional forest agreements something that would have had some effect, to actually lead this industry to some appropriate development. But, oh no, we could not get that. The Democrats—some of whom indicated to me that they would support that proposal and who I thought were going to support the proposal—did not support it.
Senator Brown did support it. Despite the fact that I have had many disagreements with Senator Brown over time, his environmental credentials are way ahead of those of the Democrats. He at least was able to grasp the nettle in respect of the relevance of having an industry council that actually, from my point of view—and I know he understood this—gave workers the opportunity to have a say, albeit limited, in the future direction of the development of their industry. But that was lost on the Democrats. So we now propose another amendment which goes to the setting up of another form of a council.
I have to say to Senator Greig that he has to understand that despite the fact that he may have a view—and I know Senator Brown has the view—that we should not be harvesting wood from native forests, the reality is something different. If we are going to have harvesting of native forests—and whether you or I like it, at this point that is not going to change—what we ought to do is put in place a mechanism through which there is some say about the utilisation of the wood that we take from those forests. That is what we ought to do. That is why we ought to have a Wood and Paper Industry Council in the legislation—not a stupid advisory council proposed by the government that is not unlike the one they set up before, even though they gave a commitment to the national forest policy process that they would adhere to the council 
 to which we, when last in government, gave a commitment. I say to the Democrats that that is why we want a Wood and Paper Industry Council—because it is the one small aspect of this whole process whereby you might be able to drive some appropriate utilisation of a very valuable resource that in many respects right now is being wasted.
I ask the Democrats to think about that because it is an important aspect. I agree with the Democrats that in looking at the use of commercially available forests, that is, where you harvest forests, be they native or plantation, then environmental issues ought to be taken account of. That is an important aspect of it. That commitment is even in the government's bill in terms of ecologically and sustainably managed forests.
So I have no problem with any suggestion about including environmental representatives on an industry council, but what is important is that we move towards sustainable utilisation of the wood that we take from our forests. We have no guarantee that that will be the case in a regional forest agreement. We have no guarantee in this legislation, without an amendment that goes to the setting up of a forest industry council. That is why, when we proposed our amendment, we wanted it in legislation—not something that the government proposed to set up by regulation, because it will not work. It did not work before; it is just another farce. I say to the Democrats: think very long and hard about that because fortunately we have been given the opportunity to move the amendment again and I would hope that after consideration you will support it.
I say to the parliamentary secretary: you had better understand clearly what this bill is proposing to do because I think at the moment you do not. We will question the government. I will ask you at some point where you think one of the amendments that we propose to move will block export woodchips. I want you to provide some evidence of that.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-10-21,"—We are here today, of course, because the House of Representatives, having returned its message to us, has stated that at this point 
 in time it will not tolerate the amendments which the Senate made not so long ago. Ultimately the question before us is: are we going to persist with those amendments?
I had the opportunity to make what was my first visit to Tasmania last weekend, having been invited there by a range of industry and community groups to discuss issues within my portfolio responsibilities with the Australian Democrats. It took me, in part, to the dockside of Burnie and the breathtaking beauty of the Meander Valley, where some local landcare management people showed me the hillsides and hilltops of such places as Mother Cumming's Peak and Quamby, where for the first time I had the opportunity to view for myself the obscene destruction of the rainforest within that region and, more appallingly, the environmental damage that has resulted.
I was taken, amongst other places, to what was a small creek known as Dunning's Rivulet, which would now be more appropriately named Dunning's Canyon because of the disgraceful environmental damage that has clearly resulted from clear-felling in that region. And while the logging industries continue to deny that they have had any effect or impact on that, it is blindingly obvious to anyone who goes there that there is a direct cause and effect between the destruction of the rainforest in that region and the subsequent destruction of the surrounding lands. The further result of that through environmental degradation is that the run-off from this region is now depositing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of silt into the Tamar River and surrounding regions.
I make this point because it continues on from my personal experiences of the destruction of both the forests and the biodiversity within the south-west region of my home state. Ultimately, the point I am making is that I think we are losing sight of the issue. For we Democrats, the issue before us is not so much jobs, although we accept that that is important, but that the best way to appropriate jobs within what is the logging industry is not through the continued destruction of our native forests.
Senators have said here this afternoon that Democrats must accept the reality that logging of native forests will continue whether we like it or not. I guess in part we accept that. It is clear that both the government and the opposition continue to support the notion that destroying our native forests for logging and/or woodchipping is acceptable to them. It is not to us.
It has been proposed that Labor will again seek to introduce the amendment to establish its Wood and Paper Industry Council. Well, we have had that debate and, at that point in time, we Democrats proposed a raft of amendments in which we agreed to the notion of having such a council to investigate and utilise the best use of natural resources in regard to timber, but we argued then, as I argue again today, that no such council has any mandate from the Australian people unless it is genuinely and sincerely balanced with regard to logging and industry and environment and biodiversity. Labor's proposal does not do that.
It was suggested in the chamber yesterday by Senator Forshaw that we Democrats ought to accept Labor's proposal for their council because, if we did not and if that were to fail, then it would support the government's proposal. Well, then, so be it. If that is the concept to which you want to sign up, it is all yours; we want nothing of it. Having said that, if Labor were to accept the Democrats' amendment to make such a council and a proposal genuinely environmentally responsible and genuinely accessible to the people and their concerns in relation to biodiversity, ecotourism, water catchment and so on, then we would support such a council. So I am indicating that the Democrats have absolutely every intention of reintroducing our amendments to Labor's amendment such that any proposed Wood and Paper Industry Council is genuinely balanced.
In that sense, I guess there are—unless the debate continues further and tangents again—essentially two questions before us. Firstly, what, if anything, will be the nature and structure of the opposition's proposal for an industry council? Secondly, what has the Senate to say on the House of Represen 
 tatives' refusal to accept its amendments? In summary, I state that our argument on the question of an industry council is unchanged. If our original amendments to be resubmitted were accepted by the opposition and such an industry council can become a genuinely balanced and environmentally responsible body, it would have our support.
The bill as a whole regarding the regional forestry agreements is, of course, as I have said before, an obscenity. It is built on a lie. Anybody who has been to either Tasmania or East Gippsland or the south-west of Western Australia can see for themselves that the alleged argument of sustainability within our native forests is utterly ridiculous. Our resolve is unchanged. We Democrats remain utterly committed to the preservation of our ancient and native forests and continue to argue for reasoned debate and reasoned legislation with regard to the logging industry as it relates to alternatives, most particularly regrowth and plantation.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-10-21,"—I appreciate those comments from Senator Greig, but I echo the interjections from the Labor Party that it was the Democrats who, before Senator Greig came, supported the RFA legislation and the majority of the impact of it by giving their numbers to the government to put through, in June, the environment legislation which effectively strips the minister of the power to protect Australia's forests. This legislation is not going to undo that; it is going to compound it.
I will take this opportunity to also put to the parliamentary secretary the question I was going to ask yesterday afternoon about the article in the Australian on Tuesday, 5 October 1999, headlined `An odd choice for sponsor' by Mark Butler. It is a reference to Mission Australia, the latest in the `Australia on CD-ROM' series, which is funded by the federal government to showcase Australia's multimedia talent. It says that, as one of the few surviving legacies of the Keating era, the series aims to provide eight entertaining but thought-provoking pathways into Australia's environmental problems, their causes and possible solutions, with an overwhelming 
 emphasis on the role individuals can play in causing and repairing the damage.
The article goes on to point out that a sponsor of this particular CD-ROM is North. It then says:
Other members of the development team were Landcare Australia, Environment Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, but North's influence is evident throughout. Mr Butler says, `I could find no discussion about the devastating environmental effects of mining in Australia in the past hundred years, for instance. Rather, the emphasis is on the benefits mining brings to all of us. `Mining always has been and continues to be an integral part of Australian life.' End of quote and end of discussion. He says that North's involvement hopelessly compromises the integrity of the disc as a whole. In fact, North scores its own entry in the Mission Australia database, which is a collection of texts, narrated video and stills relating to key environmental topics.
Mr Temporary Chair, if you look at the game options, you see you can choose one of eight zones on a landscape: estuary, farm, coast, city, rivers, wetlands, rangeland, arid and mountain. The related character for the zone gives a brief overview of the situation, which can be replayed. No mention of forests there. But, as we know, North is the biggest woodchipper in the Southern Hemisphere.
I have a question for the parliamentary secretary: why is forest not mentioned in this production? Why is mining given such a particularly favourable run? What amount of funding did North put towards the production of this CD-ROM? What support did the federal government put into it? And what arrangements were made to have this co-host process with the other entities I have mentioned proceed? On the face of it, it is North, which is also a major contributor to the government's electoral funding, having influence on a government production, an influence which is entirely unwarranted and unacceptable. It means having an environmentally based production in the hands of one of the most environmentally damaging corporations in the world, North Ltd—from its mining of uranium at Jabiluka to the destruction of the world's tallest hardwood forests in Tasmania. An explanation is required. I will be pursuing this matter in the parliament until the facts about the production of this CD- 
ROM and the influence of North come to light. I will be pursuing that further in this committee stage, and I hope that, in the meantime, the parliamentary secretary will be able to produce some answers.
I want now to add to the contribution I made yesterday about amendments. I do prefer the council proposal that has been put forward by the opposition. I have one amendment to that, which has not been circulated yet but which would put a member from the Australian Conservation Foundation onto the Council. That was acceptable last time around, as I recollect, so I hope it will be this time. Senator Murphy will know that I am not an avid proponent of this council because I believe we ought to be having the sort of council that the Democrats are putting forward, one that really looks at all the ecological factors, the opportunity lost, the tourism industry's interests and those of local councils. But I can count. We are going to get some sort of council somewhere down the line, and I want to see that there is an environmental voice on that council because of the enormous importance that people right around the country put on the environmental component of forest management in this country.
Finally, I thank the staff for making this quickly available. I make reference to the Saturday Hobart Mercury and the item, `End of a long haul for truckies as mill jobs go.' Twelve Tasmanian log truck owner/drivers are going to the wall after the Prime Minister made a promise, inherent in signing the regional forest agreement, that these true servants of the woodchip corporations would be looked after. They have been dumped. What does Mr Tuckey have to say about his failure to protect these jobs? Has he gone to Tasmania to reason with the logging corporations that have dumped another 12 people who put a great deal of faith and investment into the machinery which saved the log corporations like North Pty Ltd from running the financial risk?
Why is the Hon. Wilson Tuckey, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, silent on this one? Or is it that he is prepared to dump anybody, including the people he says 
 he is going to defend, if it is expeditious to do so in the interests of a few woodchip corporation heavies sitting in their velvet-lined chairs in St Kilda Road? That is how I would put it. It is pretty disgusting. But that is the problem that riddles this whole industry; that is the problem with this legislation. It is not here for the workers. They are not going to be compensated. The compensation clause in this legislation is here for North Broken Hill and the big entities that regularly make big donations to the government as they go down the line. I will be looking forward to seeing the votes that are coming down the line and to following this debate as it unfolds in the next couple of days.

That the committee report progress and seek leave to sit again.
It is appropriate at lunchtime on Thursdays, where people have made plans, that legislation that is controversial not be dealt with during this timeslot. There is an agreement between all honourable senators that no quorums or divisions would be called during this timeslot. Clearly at least one senator has indicated that he is going to call quorums during this time, and it may well be that there would be a division on some of these issues at some stage. So I think it is totally appropriate that the committee report progress and seek leave to sit again.

Isn't it a fact that, under an insurance contract with the GST applied to the premium, this total cost including the GST will be the dutiable base against which stamp duty will then be applied? Was this part of the Howard government's deal with the Australian Democrats: that the states would be able to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in additional stamp duty revenue by allowing the GST to have stamp duty applied to it?

Let me make it absolutely clear there is no budgetary reason why the states should impose their stamp duties on GST inclusive prices—none whatsoever. Let me make it quite clear that this is merely a revenue grab by state governments. I would also point out that the states will be key beneficiaries from the new tax system: the Commonwealth will pass all the revenue from the GST to the states and the Commonwealth in particular has guaranteed that the states will be no worse off under the new arrangements.
If Senator Cook is referring to the Financial Review article this morning, I would draw his attention to a comment by the National Farmers Federation. They put out a press statement today on this particular issue. The National Farmers Federation says the decision by the state governments to apply stamp duty on GST will result in `an unnecessary increase in costs for every household in 
 Australia'. I would have to say that in the end the state governments will have to answer to their own particular constituencies but—from the Commonwealth's point of view in relation to the matter raised this morning—there is no need for that, and of course the states get all the revenue from the GST.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Stamp Duty</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,question

In view of that answer, is the minister also aware that on 23 September the Acting Premier of Western Australia, Mr Hendy Cowan, said in the WA parliament, and I now quote him from Hansard :
As the GST is to replace the current WST regime, it is appropriate that stamp duty be based on the GST inclusive price, value or consideration.

The Commonwealth has guaranteed the states will be no worse off and it seems to me, unless other information can be given—
—On a point of order, Madam President, on a question of relevance. I asked a specific question: did the Acting Premier of Western Australia mislead the parliament in view of the earlier answer by the minister? It seems to me that is a question that has a yes or a no answer. It does not have a maybe answer and it certainly does not have an answer which is an excursion about what the Commonwealth might do. There was a specific question. It was not a question that raised a broad subject for wide canvassing. It requires a yes or no answer. Could you ask the minister to actually answer the question and not dodge it, Madam President?
—I cannot direct him to say yes or no, Senator. There is no point of order. 
—Thank you, Madam President. I think Senator Cook is guilty of overacting again. If Senator Cook had listened to my answer, he would not have asked such a completely irrelevant supplementary question. There is no budgetary reason why the states should impose their stamp duties on GST inclusive prices. Senator Cook, are you listening?

Does the minister recall saying on 31 March this year that the Productivity Commission's report into nursing home funding `raises a number of issues that the government will consult on and make a decision about in coming months'? Is the minister aware of the of concerns of government backbenchers from Queensland over the failure of the Minister for Aged Care to respond to the Productivity Commission report into nursing home funding and, as a Queenslander, does the minister share those concerns? Has he approached the Minister for Aged Care in an effort to get her to do her job and respond to the many issues raised by the Productivity Commission?

"Herron, Sen John",LP,1999-10-21,"—Senator Hogg is obviously referring to a newspaper article that was reporting on a party room meeting. I normally do not comment on party room meetings; in fact, I should not, but in this instance I will make an exception. I can confirm, Senator Hogg, that in the party room we discussed that unemployment was down to seven per cent—the lowest since 1990. We compared that with the Labor Party's unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent. We talked about the inflation rate being 1.6 per cent; it has now been less than two per cent for over two years—in fact it has been the best in 30 years. We discussed the lowest home mort 
 gage rates in the last 30 years. We discussed the growing economy.
—On a point of order, Madam President: no doubt those matters were discussed, and also Dr Wooldridge's problems with the MRI scam and all sorts of other issues, but this question is about Senator Herron's responsibilities representing the Minister for Aged Care. Consistent with rulings you have made, which are that answers must be relevant at least in the area in which they have been asked, I would ask you on this occasion to direct Senator Herron either to answer the question or, if he has got nothing to say, to sit down and take it on notice.
—I draw Senator Herron's attention to the question.
—I have a lot to say and it is good news. It is bad news for the opposition; I appreciate that they do not like hearing that. Specifically in relation to Senator Hogg's question, yes, I am concerned and have expressed that concern but, on the other hand, I respect what the minister is doing. Since the Productivity Commission report was handed down, the minister has consulted with all sides in relation to this issue. She is particularly mindful of the impact on the industry and on those older Australians who live in nursing homes.
Another part of the good news that I can report is that this government has increased the funding for nursing homes by 42 per cent since we were elected in 1996. The Labor government spent $2.5 billion on residential aged care across Australia; our outlay in the 1999-2000 budget is to be $3.5 billion—a 42 per cent increase. The reality is, and Senator Hogg may not be aware of this, that the amount of funding that has gone to Queensland has increased. I was delighted when the minister told me that. It has actually increased as part of that funding and increased disproportionately.
The minister will respond to the coalescence part of the Productivity Commission's report when she has finished consultation. She had consultation with two industry groups this week, for example. The minister will give a considered response to that report, taking into 
 account all factors. She will do it in her time and at her pace, because it is important that the correct decision is made.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-10-21,"—On 18 October, Senator Allison asked me a number of questions with respect to the education of children of East Timorese asylum seekers. I can say that a distinction needs to be drawn between two categories of East Timorese in Australia. There are those that arrived in Australia as a result of the post-referendum difficulties and those that have been temporarily resident in Australia for some years and who are seeking recognition as refugees and resultant permanent residence in Australia.
The East Timorese that arrived in Australia following the recent referendum in East Timor hold temporary humanitarian stay visas—visa category 449. This is a similar visa type to that provided to the Kosovars and brings with it a recognition—
—On a point of order, Madam President: it is competent for the minister obviously to read this into the Hans 
 ard  record. I did make a point earlier that it is much more appropriate that they either be incorporated or read into the Hansard  record as opposed to tabled, and I appreciate that. In this case, Senator Allison, who I understand asked the question, is not here. This is another example where I think—unless other agreements have been reached that I am not aware of—an incorporation would be more appropriate than what the minister is doing, in the absence of Senator Allison's, who asked the original question.
—Are you speaking to the point of order, Senator?
—Madam President, I did give notice to Senator Allison that I would be answering this at the conclusion of question time. This is an important answer which I think needs to be heard.
—It is for the minister to determine. He may seek to have it incorporated or he may read it.
—As I mentioned, this is a similar visa type to that provided to the Kosovars and brings with it a recognition of the special needs facing these people. School age children covered by this visa are educated within the safe havens in which they live. There has been no waiting period for access to these education services. Since 1992, however, a number of East Timorese have entered Australia on short-term visitor visas and subsequently applied for protection visas and permanent residency. These people accepted the conditions that applied to the other holders of such visitor visas, including a condition that holders of visitor visas will not undertake more than three months study while on that visa. This is a normal condition for visitors and is noted on the visa.
With over 3.5 million visitors to Australia each year, it clearly would not be in Australia's interest to offer unrestricted study opportunities to visitors. To do so would have enormous implications for Australia's full fee paying overseas student program. It is also consistent with the government's approach to entry to Australia that the primary purpose for being in Australia should be reflected by the visa issue. Where a person applies for a protection visa, the Department of Immigra 
 tion and Multicultural Affairs issues a bridging visa which provides the applicant with the capacity to remain in Australia lawfully while their application for protection is considered. It is important to note that about 80 per cent of applications for protection visas are rejected on the grounds that applicants do not meet the criteria to be considered as refugees. It would therefore not be sensible policy to offer free access to the full range of government services to visitors who may apply for this form of permanent residency while onshore.
There is a body of litigation before the courts affecting the East Timorese asylum seekers holding temporary visas. The majority of East Timorese on bridging visas are currently residing in Victoria. The Catholic Education Office in Victoria has indicated that schools do accept enrolments on compassionate and humanitarian grounds in individual cases which may from time to time include school age children from East Timor. The decision to charge fees or not depends on individual circumstances and can involve community or church sponsorship of children or families.
The Department of Education in Victoria has indicated that government schools are able to accept the enrolment of school age children on bridging visas provided supporting documentation from DIMA is provided to verify that the student is part of an application for a protection visa. Australia is providing educational opportunities for school age East Timorese children in Australia, whether through education programs for those students brought to Australia temporarily or through the offer of public education for those seeking permanent residency in Australia.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Education: East Timorese Asylum Seekers</title>,Questions Without Notice,26,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Newman), to questions without notice asked by Senators West and O'Brien today, relating to the participation of women on advisory committees and to child care funding.
I was really interested to observe the minister's response to questions asked today. 
 Some might have called it a lecture that the minister sought to give to the opposition—to Senator Chris Evans and to anyone who dared to ask the minister a question about the financial situation in her portfolio. Frankly, the figures from her own department indicate that what the minister has been telling the Australian people about expenditure on child care and on the availability and utilisation of child-care places is absolutely wrong.
It was not so long ago, in fact it was 10 August, that the minister released a glossy publication regarding child care in Australia which extolled the alleged virtues of this government in relation to their administration of child care in this country. One can say that the publication released by the minister, Child care in Australia, was totally self-serving and, when compared with her own department's publication, the 1998-99 annual report of the Department of Family and Community Services, it is an absolute misrepresentation of what has been occurring in child care. It is quite clear from her own department that the estimated expenditure, on an accrual basis, from appropriations was $868,831,000 and the estimated full year effect was $818,619,000—in other words, a difference of over $50 million.
The minister sought to explain that away and said we would have to go to some other portfolio—I think it was the Department of Health and Aged Care—statements and annual report and that might give us the total picture. Isn't it incredible that her own department would publish statements on expenditure relating to child-care support without an annotation for the department of health. I see here that some of the amounts do refer to the department of health but they say they cannot get the figures at this time. The minister is prepared to go public and claim, in her own publication, Child care in Australia, that marvellous things were being done. But in terms of her own department's document, they show a reduction of $50 million and the figures from the department of health are not available.
 When I asked the minister a supplementary question, I think all was revealed. One could see it in the face of the minister when I asked 
 the supplementary question, which was to answer the second part of my question which related to the utilisation of child care in long day care places in this country. The minister had no idea. Her own department's publication, on page 187, in table 2, entitled `Number of operational places by service type in Australia', shows absolutely clearly, without one question of a doubt, that the number of those operational places between June 1998 and June 1999 fell from 194,600 to 190,300.
Let me break it up for you, just so there is absolutely no question about it: community long day care, 51,700 to 50,600; private—and this is the area the government claims is doing so well—129,700 to 127,100; and employer and non-profit, 13,200 to 12,600. She is damned by the figures of her own department, because the glowing picture that the minister has sought to portray is shown to be clearly false. It is shown to be untrue. If her own department says that the number of places has fallen by 4,300, then the minister is effectively playing a confidence trick on Australia in her publication Child care in Australia. Frankly, the minister ought to be censured by this Senate for misrepresenting the case so blatantly. I was not surprised by the minister's reaction to my supplementary question.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-10-21,"—There is probably no need to respond to what we just heard from Senator O'Brien across the chamber because there seems to have been a lot of enthusiasm taken out of this take note of answers. It is now a quarter to four and we have only one Labor Party opposition member left in the chamber to take up enthusiastically—
—Hey!
—Senator Carr, are you going to tell us that you would dare get up on this subject?
—This has been your problem—you've never been able to count.
—Order, Senator Carr.
—I thought you were going home to Victoria, Senator Carr, to join— 
Senator Carr interjecting—
—Senator Carr, I will have some order. Senator McGauran, you will address the chair and roughly some of the questions and answers that were given.
—Madam Deputy President, I do not want to descend into the unsavoury moments we had between 3 and 3.30 p.m. led by Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.
—Do not reflect on another senator, either.
—I would have to say it was one of the worst scatter gun question times I have ever seen—and that is really saying something. There seemed to be no point to their question time. Perhaps it was an open question time.
—Bring back Senator Ray to organise them.
—In a sense, Senator Patterson is right. The lid is really being lifted now on Senator Faulkner's leadership. It was an absolutely hopeless question time where people like Senator O'Brien would ask questions over the top of and through the responsibility of Senator Chris Evans, who should be asking those questions. What is more, your question was so estimates based. Just to finish on Senator Patterson's interjection, Senator Ray is needed to bring back a bit of discipline, because the lid is now really being lifted off Senator Faulkner's leadership. It is rowdy and it is undisciplined. You should have seen the faces of the people in the gallery. For the first time, I actually cringed.
—Madam Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I think that even Senator Ray would object to being linked with taking note of the answers to questions on child care. I know he has an interest in the matter, but I think Senator McGauran is drawing a long bow to link my motion with Senator Ray and what he might think whilst he is out of this chamber. I fail to see the relevance. I think the senator should be drawn back to the motion.
—This is usually allowed to be a fairly wide-ranging debate.
Senator Lightfoot interjecting—
—Order! Senator Lightfoot, you might like to withdraw that reflection.
—Madam Deputy President, I personally do not think that that was within such an area that it ought be withdrawn.
—Senator Lightfoot, given the mirth that your colleagues expressed, you were obviously casting an aspersion, or it was interpreted that way. If they have interpreted it that way, you had best withdraw, please.
—I will withdraw, Madam Deputy President.
—Senator McGauran might like to tailor his answer somewhat to the answers given by the minister.
—The point I was trying to make was about question time, and it related to the child-care question. Senator O'Brien is noted for his questions on minutiae in any committee he is on, let alone in this chamber, but his question was on such minutiae it should be saved for the estimates committees. Senator Newman hit it out of the ballpark, as she did with her answers to other utterly frivolous questions.
Senator Lundy is going to get to speak on child care, I believe, but she should put a minute aside to discuss the very point that Senator Newman made about Mr Costa's discriminatory and sexist point. Mr Costa—who is 43 years of age, I note—believes that a woman of 45 years of age is far too old to take over the reins of the ACTU. Senator Lundy, I know the punch has been taken out of this taking note of answers to questions, but you would do well to put a minute aside—
—Senator McGauran, the answers that we are taking note of are the answers given by the minister to opposition questions.
—I quickly make the point: could you put a minute aside to answer that? You cannot let Mr Costa's comments go unchallenged.
—That of course was an answer to a dorothy dixer; it was not an answer to an opposition question.
—Quite right. Senator Lundy, don't do yourself a great injustice. My knowledge of child care is in relation to the government's tax reform package and the simplification of the whole child-care assistance program which will be introduced on 1 July 2000. The tax reform proposals include a single child-care benefit to replace the child-care rebate and child-care assistance. You are quoting old statistics. We are talking about the future in child care, which will begin on 1 July 2000 in party with this government's tax reform package. It is anticipated that families with one child in full-time care who are eligible for the maximum rate of the CCB will receive $120 per week—that is, $2.40 per hour—in government subsidy.
Senator Lundy and Senator O'Brien, what about a bit of credit for the government's plans for child care and for our tax reform package? What about a bit of balance in this argument in regard to the $3 billion that this government spends per year on child care? This is 20 per cent more than you put in in your dying days—in your last three years—in government. A bit of balance in this argument would go a long way.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-10-21,"—I would certainly like to participate in this debate on taking note of Senator Newman's answers, and I do so on the basis that Senator Newman has been loose with the truth. Today we heard again from the minister that there has been no reduction in child-care funding by this government, but we know from facts released in the annual report from the Department of Family and Community Services that child-care funding has fallen from $999.438 million to $935.692 million over the last two financial years. That is a fall, which is in direct contradiction to what Senator Newman said today in this place. 
There are a couple of other pertinent facts I would like to draw to Senator McGauran's attention—given his comments in this debate—including the number of long day care places, which has fallen. In offering this information, again taken directly from the annual report, it is worth noting that previous information provided in this place by Senator Newman is completely exposed as a doctoring of statistics.
Let me explain to the Senate exactly what I am talking about. The number of places for community long day care fell in the last year by 1,100. In private long day care the number of places fell by 2,600. That is a total of 3,700 places. Explanations previously afforded by Senator Newman used a rounded figure which incorporated the number of out of school hours care places to boost that figure. You cannot deny the fact that the number of long day care places in this country has fallen, and you cannot deny the fact that funding has fallen.
These two issues, I think, do make Senator Newman look as though she has continued to persist with her efforts to be misleading with respect to the government's position on child care. Her determined efforts today and the massive confidence booster, the artificial mirth, that emanated from behind her every time she responded to a question—which was then completely exposed and I think reiterated by Senator McGauran's acknowledgment that maybe we should turn our attention in this motion to take note to that confidence boosting afforded Senator Newman today—show one thing and one thing only: that Senator Newman is weak not only on child care but also on all issues of policy that affect women in this country. For the last two weeks we have seen Senator Newman stumble and fall over very simple, basic questions relating to women in this parliament, the role of women in Australian society and the capacity of the government to deliver what they need within the community.
Let us reflect on a couple of these issues. First of all, there is the reduction of support by the government, through the Office of the Status of Women, for grants to incredibly important community organisations that are 
 run by women for women. The government have shown an appalling persistence to defund and disarm groups in our community that stand up for women and that oppose their policies. We saw the most blatant example of that most recently with the defunding of a number of women's organisations. Today, I heard those organisations excluded from the women's roundtable, including the National Women's Justice Coalition and the National Network of Women's Legal Services, tell their stories about how they have been defunded and about how they have been excluded from consultations. And the minister comes in here and pretends that the government have done something worthy for women and worthy for child care. Come on! What we saw today was a pathetic effort by the minister to try to throw back something at this side of the chamber. In fact, she has been so completely undermined through questioning in this place and by her appalling performance in representing women in the federal parliament that she is obviously taking the coalition government to a place of complete and utter disrepute on their record of representing women.
I would like to finish on a positive note, and it relates directly to child care. I had the great privilege of attending a wonderful event just recently here in Canberra, when the inaugural ACT child care awards were presented and brought much needed recognition to workers in the child-care sector. I would like to acknowledge the work of Judy Small and her committee, who took the initiative to stand up and be proud for the services that these women, these people, provide to Australia—to children, to women and to their families.

"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-10-21,"—I think it is rather a pity that someone like Senator Lundy should deliver such unmitigated rubbish at the same time as denigrating one of the best ministers that this parliament has ever seen with respect to child care. And I want to take this opportunity to rebut Senator O'Brien's needlessly negative contribution this afternoon, too. He said that we, as a government, were `playing a confidence trick on Australia with respect to child 
 care', and that Senator Jocelyn Newman should be censured. Let me read something on which Senator O'Brien and Senator Lundy based their most appalling statements here this afternoon with respect to the government and our child care policy. It provides some background to that and it reads:
It is anticipated that families with one child in full-time care who are eligible for the maximum rate of CCB—
that is, child-care benefit—
will receive $120 per week ($2.40 per hour) in Government subsidy.
That is a heck of a long way ahead of what Labor's policy was for 13 years. At the same time as delivering benefits to families and the children of families, more importantly, Australia's greatest asset, incidentally, we have fixed up the big black hole that you people left. You simply could not deliver because you could not handle the economy. That is why you could not deliver on child care. That is why you could not deliver in other areas of social services, because you could not handle the economy.
Let me read on:
Maximum assistance will be available for families with incomes under $28,200 per annum, tapering down to a minimum rate of $20.10 per week for 50 hours of care when family income reaches $81,000 per annum. The payment will be proportional to the number of hours of care paid for a family each week.
The CCB will continue to provide loaded rates of subsidy for families with more than one child in care.
Labor did not have that system in place. You lived off plastic credit. You put it on the tick. You left a $10 billion debt for us to fix up. We not only fixed that up but also delivered—we deliver in all areas and we deliver in all areas of child care.
It goes on:
For a family receiving maximum CCB, this loading will provide an additional $11 per week where there are two children in full-time care and an additional $32 per week where there are more than three or more children in full-time care.
And you say that we are going backwards. It continues: 
The CCB will further assist families by providing a 10 per cent loaded rate of assistance to families using part-time centre-based care, in recognition of the higher fee charged to families using this type of care.
We have tried to encompass everyone, even those people who may slip through the social service cracks. Let me go on again:
.	 extend qualification for Family Tax Benefit Part A . . . to families with children up to age 21 who fail to qualify for Youth Allowance (YA) due to the parental means test or who receive low levels of YA;
.	 abolish the assets test for family tax benefits;
We had to abolish one of your particular implementations, which worked against families. It continues further:
.	 provide about $13 billion per year of personal income tax cuts and about $2½ billion per year of additional family payments.
The Labor opposition are talking about censuring Minister Jocelyn Newman. You are talking about the government playing a confidence trick on the Australian people. We know who is playing the confidence trick. We know that you spent too long in power. We know that you mishandled the economy and, when you mishandle the economy, you cannot deliver the goods. I believe it will be a long time before the Australian people trust those inept people on the other side—those people who depended on propaganda to get where they were during those 13 appalling years of hard Labor. I believe the Australian people will think long and hard before they ever put those sorts of people back into federal power again.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-10-21,"—We are debating a motion to take note of the answers from Senator Newman today, who once again was unable to address the issues that were before this chamber, other than to provide us with the normal, supercilious, condescending and patronising—
—Please do not reflect upon another member in this place, Senator Carr.
—I am not; I am just indicating the method by which these questions have been attempted to be addressed by a minister who clearly finds it important for 
 us to get a clear sense of her views of correct behaviour in such a way that allows her not to have to actually address the questions that are before the chamber at the time. She was asked whether or not her own department's report had in fact now identified that actual Commonwealth expenditure on child care had fallen again this year. She was also asked whether or not the number of long day care child-care places in both the private and the community sector had fallen again as well. She could not address those issues, other than to try to criticise members of the opposition in, as I say, a very condescending manner.
The truth of the matter is that the reports of her own department reveal the facts on these questions. This is a government that is into its second term. Quite clearly, it has had a policy over the life of both those terms of government of reducing support for child care, of reducing the opportunities for working Australians to enjoy the benefits of child care and of reducing the benefits to children. Of course, the whole point about child care is that it provides benefits for the entire family and especially for children. The fact that the quality of provision is falling as a result of the budget cuts that this government has imposed is all too clear for anybody who has any experience of this industry—and many of us do, not just as legislators but as parents.
We all understand what is occurring within the child-care industry in this country. We all understand what is happening in child-care centres across the country. The opportunities for children are declining, as parents are obliged to pick up more and more of the costs that were once borne by the taxpayer on the basis that this government believes in the user pay principle. That is fine if you have plenty of money, but the whole issue here is whether or not the government has an obligation to ensure that these services are provided on an equitable basis in such a way as to make sure that the community benefit is exercised, because this goes to more than just individual benefit.
This government has confirmed in its own reports that the funding for child care has fallen and that the number of child-care places available to Australian families has also 
 fallen—the number of long day care places has fallen from 194,600 in June 1998 to 190,300 in June 1999. My recollection is that in the first term of this government there were spending cuts of about $800 million in the child-care area. There were cuts of about $600 million with the withdrawal of the operational subsidies for child-care centres. That, of course, had a direct bearing on the quality of service that was provided. We now have before us the evidence, the official confirmation, that the government is withdrawing not only money but also places—and of course one follows the other. Federal government budget cuts to child care have been forcing the child-care industry into decline. The impact of the withdrawal of support for and investment in child care is now showing up in the official figures.
When Senator Newman goes on TV and says, `We now have to sort out the differences of interpretation of figures,' she patronisingly claims, `Trust me, I'm from the government.' What the government is now saying is that she cannot be trusted. Her own department is saying that her views cannot be relied upon. Her department's annual report demonstrates that the minister cannot be relied upon to provide the public with a proper reflection of what is occurring. And what would one expect? If you cut the budget and the services, of course the opportunities are going to decline. If the government cuts child-care assistance, it will hurt Australian families and they will increasingly be forced into the informal, casual forms of child care. They will be forced into the unregulated, unaccredited and the lower levels—the bottom end of the market—where the qualifications are not available to be seen to demonstrate that the quality of care can be maintained. As a consequence, the children of this country are going to miss out. I think the minister ought to be condemned for that.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-10-21,"—I want to participate in the debate this afternoon because so many misleading statements have been made that the record should not be allowed to remain uncorrected. There is no doubt that the oppo 
 sition does have a duty to test the policy of the government and to criticise where criticism is due, but it does have an obligation not to be misleading. What we have seen this afternoon is a disgraceful attempt to mislead the Australian public.
Page 187 of the annual report that was quoted during question time and referred to during debate on the motion to take note of answers tells only half of the story. What in fact has been omitted from the information that has been given to the Senate is that, whilst there is a very different mix of the way in which child care is now put together, the overall numbers have increased from 399,400 to 422,100. We have not heard one single word about the fact that the overall numbers have increased; we have only heard that some of the categories have been adjusted yet other have been increased. The total number of child-care places available to Australian families has in fact gone up every year since the coalition came to office. That is a point that really needs to be emphasised. It is a point that the government is not given credit for when the opposition picks out some isolated figure and seeks to mislead the Senate on what the true position is.
The opposition is doing a very little other than cooking the books in choosing to add up only those figures in the table which might suit their claims and completely overlooking and ignoring those sectors which have increased: family day care and out of school hours. You might wonder why family day care and out of school hours numbers have increased. It is because that is where the need is. That is where the research showed the need was and where the need was not being met. These are the services that families both need and use, and that is the reason why the overall numbers have gone up and why there has been an adjustment in some of the categories of child care. It is simply more flexible and suits more children to have a different mix.
—Into the backyard!
—Senator Carr, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would not 
 be interjecting in circumstances where you have been so misleading.
If we look at the coalition's achievements and initiatives—I know that the opposition does not like this because it does not suit their argument one bit—you will find that the coalition has allocated more funding to child care than Labor ever did: $5.3 billion over four years to the years 2002-03 to fund 70,000 additional places in each of the coalition's first three budgets. That is a pretty impressive figure, no matter how you look at it. From July 1996 to March 1999, there was an increase of 272 child-care centres across Australia: 491 private child-care centres opened, while 204 closed in areas where there was either no need or where the resources could be otherwise better deployed.
Labor simply failed the child-care sector while in government and is now playing politics. This is not a very sensible thing to do. Growth in child care under Labor was simply unchecked and unsustainable, and those on the other side know it. There was no formal planning system for child-care centres, resulting in some areas having an oversupply of child-care places and others having none. The operational subsidy was focused on community-based centres instead of where there was need. Babies were barely catered for; children with disabilities were not properly catered for; children in remote areas were not properly catered for. So do not come in here and read out misleading statements about this report without—
—We are just reading the report.

The document read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE ON JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT REPORT 366 REVIEW OF AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORTS 1997-98 SECOND QUARTER
Recommendation 3  Paragraph 3.33
The Minister for Finance and Administration should address the issue of incentives and penalties related to agency expenditure of Budget appropriations to ensure that agencies' concerns to achieve their expenditure bids do not overshadow the Commonwealth's interest.
Recommendation: Supported /Not Supported
Under the Commonwealth's previous cash appropriation framework, the bring forward of expenditures by agencies to avoid the lapsing of annual appropriations at year end often led to wasteful application of public monies. However, the Commonwealth's accrual budgeting framework from 1999-00 is a key reform in providing greater flexibilities to agencies and requiring more business like and results orientated performance, and will prevent many such dysfunctional resource management practices from continuing.
`Departmental' appropriations to agencies for their outputs will in future be paid as those outputs are delivered. Providing budgeted outputs are delivered, agencies will be able to receive their full appropriation in the financial year and retain cash balances in their own bank account. Interest will also be paid on agency cash balances to encourage optimal cash management practices.
Annual `Administered' appropriations, typically for subsidies and grants administered by agencies on the Government's behalf, will be for full accrual expenses and will be appropriated by `outcomes' sought by the Government. Where expenses have accrued against these appropriations but payments not yet made, the unspent amount will not lapse and remains available for payments in future financial years.
To the extent relevant expenses did not accrue, these appropriations will lapse. Consequently, agencies will generally no longer be able to make payments under these appropriations where the relevant goods and services weren't received, and 
 hence expenses weren't incurred, in that same financial year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title>,Committees,29,1,speech

However, the Commonwealth's accrual budgeting framework from 1999-00 is a key reform in providing greater flexibilities to agencies and requiring more business like and results orientated performance, and will prevent many such dysfunctional resource management practices from continuing.
`Departmental' appropriations to agencies for their outputs will in future be paid as those outputs are delivered. Providing budgeted outputs are delivered, agencies will be able to receive their full appropriation in the financial year and retain cash balances in their own bank account. Interest will also be paid on agency cash balances to encourage optimal cash management practices.
Annual `Administered' appropriations, typically for subsidies and grants administered by agencies on the Government's behalf, will be for full accrual expenses and will be appropriated by `outcomes' sought by the Government. Where expenses have accrued against these appropriations but payments not yet made, the unspent amount will not lapse and remains available for payments in future financial years.
To the extent relevant expenses did not accrue, these appropriations will lapse. Consequently, agencies will generally no longer be able to make payments under these appropriations where the relevant goods and services weren't received, and 
 hence expenses weren't incurred, in that same financial year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report: Government Response</title>,Committees,29,2,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-10-21,"—On behalf of Senator Knowles, I present the 80th report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Persons Referred to in the Senate (Board members and staff of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc.) .
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion in respect of the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the report be adopted.
This report is the 28th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the Senate.
On 13 October 1999, the President received a letter from Mr Kimberley Heitman, Chairman of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc., relating to remarks made by Senator the Hon. Richard Alston during debate in the Senate on 30 September 1999. The President referred the letter to the committee as a submission under privilege resolution 5. The committee considered the submission on 14 and 21 October 1999 and recommends that it be incorporated in Hansard.
The committee reminds the Senate that, in matters of this nature, it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons. Rather, it ensures that these persons' submissions, and 
 ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. I commend the report to the Senate.
The submission read as follows—
RESPONSE BY MR KIMBERLEY HEITMAN CHAIR, ELECTRONIC FRONTIERS AUSTRALIA INC. (ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD MEMBERS AND STAFF OF ELECTRONIC FRONTIERS AUSTRALIA INC.)
We, the individuals listed below, wish to seek redress under the resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 relating to the protection of persons referred to in the Senate (Privilege Resolution 5). We are readily identifiable as the persons referred to by Senator Alston, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in the Senate debate on the topic ""Internet Censorship"" on 30 September 1999 (Hansard pages 8953—8955 inclusive), that is, the Board members and staff of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. (EFA):

Senator Alston stated that we are ""maniacs"", ""low grade, undergraduate political activists"", ""have no interest at all in sensible and responsible regulation of the Internet"" and are ""not in the slightest bit interested in the welfare of the community, whether parents have concerns or anything else"". Senator Alston also stated that we approve of offensive material being forced on children and adults and that we are the cause of a problem the Internet Industry Association and the Government have in negotiating a code of practice.
All these allegations are unsubstantiated and false. The Senator's remarks impugn our individual good characters, reputations and credentials, and those of the thousands of members and supporters of the organisation we represent. In addition, the Senator's remarks are factually incorrect, and we seek this opportunity to set the record straight.
The following facts are pertinent: 

1.	 Senator Alston's description of EFA as ""low grade, undergraduate political activists"" is factually incorrect, and falsely deprecates the breadth of academic and professional expertise of the EFA Board. The majority of EFA Board members completed degrees in fields including law, education, science, engineering and economics more than ten years ago. None are undergraduates. Three-quarters are over the age of forty. All have been active users of the Internet for at least the last five years, and several are professionally involved in managing Internet services.
2.	 Senator Alston's statement that we are ""not in the slightest bit interested in the welfare of the community, whether parents have concerns or anything else"" is incorrect. Members of the Board and staff of EFA include responsible parents with a total of 10 children between them ranging in age from 1 year to 27 years. EFA's website has a section entitled ""Advice for Parents—Information to guide and inform parents on ways to protect their children in using the Internet"". This includes the ""Australian Internet Parental Control Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)—A guide to assist concerned parents, legislators, educators, and the public in learning what is available today to protect children"". This was compiled by EFA in 1996, long before any government agencies developed an interest in assisting parents. This document was drawn to the attention of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards in our submission of March 1997 and an earlier version was included in our response to the Department of Communications' ""Consultation Paper on the Regulation of on-line Information Services"" in August 1995. Our concern is for the future of Australia's children and grandchildren—that we as a society not bequeath them with a censorship system that would be a totalitarian regime's dream, enabling the suppression of any dissenting voices on the Internet. The planned regime enables the suppression of voices following one complaint and empowers a statutory authority to suppress voices without a complaint being lodged. EFA has consistently argued that a Government serious about protecting children from online dangers must commit funds to parental education and police resources.
3.	 Senator Alston's statement that ""there are these maniacs—these electronic frontiers outfits—running around stirring up trouble, using quaint expressions"" is incorrect.
The Oxford Dictionary defines ""maniac"" as ""person affected with mania"" and ""mania"" as ""mental derangement marked by excitement and 
 violence"". Senator Alston's allegation as to our mental stability has no basis in fact. Moreover, we have not advocated or engaged in violence. Last year Senator Alston's office invited EFA's current and then Chairperson to participate in the E-Commerce Enabling Australia Summit in Canberra. Senator Alston's office was aware of EFA's position on Internet regulation having received our detailed written response to the framework issued for public comment in August 1997. EFA's position on the matter has remained stable. The Government's has not.
Senator Alston's disparaging reference to EFA as an ""outfit"" is misleading. EFA is a non-profit national organisation formed in January 1994 and incorporated under South Australian law in May 1994 to protect and promote the civil liberties of users and operators of computer based communications systems. EFA members come from all parts of Australia and from diverse backgrounds.
Senator Alston opines that our expressions are ""quaint"". These are no more quaint than those contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The ICCPR was signed by the Australian Government in 1972, came into force in 1980 and reservations to Article 19, and to other articles, were retracted  in 1984. The ICCPR forms Schedule 2 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. Article 19 of the ICCPR ""quaintly"" states: 
	 ""2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.""
Our comments on this matter are contained in our submission to the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies' inquiry of April/May 1999.
4.	 Senator Alston's statement that ""they got themselves over to the recent Berterlsmann Conference and made a big noise there along the same lines"" implies that there is something untoward about EFA's attendance at the Conference. This is not so.
Mr Jens Waltermann, Deputy Head, Policy, Media Division of the Bertelsmann Foundation invited EFA's Chairperson to attend. In his letter he said, inter alia: ""It is with great pleasure that we invite you to be our guest in Munich, Germany. Your participation would be an honour for the Bertelsmann Foundation.""
Furthermore, EFA Board members have previously been invited speakers and/or panel participants at national and international conferences such as: 

.	 OECD Seminar: International Co-operation Concerning Content and Conduct on the Internet, March 1998, Paris
.	 INET 98 Conference: The Role of Non-Governmental Organizations in Developing Internet Policy, July 1998, Geneva
.	 E-Commerce Enabling Australia Summit, April 1998, Canberra, on invitation from Senator Alston's office
.	 Seventh International World Wide Web Conference, April 1998, Brisbane
.	 IT&T Security Forum Seminar, October 1998, Canberra
.	 EDUCAUSE in Australasia, 1998, Sydney
.	 CFP 99 Conference, April 1999, Washington D.C.
.	 IIR IT Security Conference, April 1999, Canberra
.	 Internet World Australia `99 Conference, August 1999, Sydney
.	 IIR Data Protection and Privacy Conference, August 1999, Sydney
.	 AUUG Conference, September 1999, Melbourne
	 iSEC Australia 99 Conference, September 1999, Sydney
Furthermore, if ""made a big noise"" refers to speaking out on issues of concern, we prefer to call that civic duty. It is the purpose of our organisation, and the expectation of our members, that we do so.
5.	 We reject Senator Alston's allegation that we have no interest in sensible and responsible regulation of the Internet. We believe the Government's approach to content regulation has neither of those qualities. Over the past six years EFA Board members have freely contributed a considerable amount of personal time and expert advice to inquiries concerning Internet regulation conducted by Senate Committees, the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Department of Communications and the Attorney-General's Department. Current Board members were invited to give testimony to Senate Committees at public hearings concerning regulation of the Internet in 1997, 1998 and 1999. EFA has consistently warned that Australian Internet censorship legislation will not protect children but will unfortunately give parents unfamiliar with the Internet a false sense of security as to their children's safety. We note that Senator Harradine acknowledges this is a matter of concern, although Senator Alston will not.
6.	 Senator Alston's allegations as to our views on ""mousetrapping"" are based on either incorrect 
 information given to him by his staff, or a misinformed guess, not on our statements. Senator Alston stated: "". . . mousetrapping is an issue. . . it is entirely appropriate to put pressure on host countries to clean up their own backyards. That is precisely what we are doing. We are not just saying that we hope that end users, parents, will block these sites. We think it is offensive, the community thinks it is offensive and the industry thinks it is offensive. Electronic frontiers do not"".
We have never condoned, nor would we condone, pagejacking or mousetrapping or any other means of forcing content on persons who do not wish to view it. Senator Alston's allegation that we do not object to such practices is utterly without foundation. Furthermore, the Senator's implication that the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Act is necessary to deal with such problems is demonstrably incorrect. It will not have the slightest effect in protecting children or adults from being caught in such traps. The USA FTC and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have dealt with the recent instance using existing laws. Evidently, no new laws are necessary to deal with such problems.
7.	 Senator Alston's allegation that we were or are ""feeding lines to that woman from the Civil Liberties Union"" has no basis in fact. Presumably Professor Strossen reads Australian news reports and media releases, probably both Senator Alston's and EFA's, which are equally accessible around the world on the Internet.
8.	 Senator Alston states that he does ""not find industry opposing [the government's] approach"" and that ""[t]he industry itself accepts that there should be these codes of practice and this form of regulation. We have been trying to negotiate it for the last three years with the Internet Industry Association. Their problem is that there are these maniacs—these electronic frontiers outfits—running around stirring up trouble"".
We reject the allegation that we are the cause of any problem the Internet Industry Association (IIA) may have. If IIA has a problem, it apparently arises from IIA's attempts to develop a ""self-regulatory"" code that ""the industry"" supports as well as meets with the approval of the Government. Only 60 of Australia's 700 Internet Service Providers are currently members of the IIA according to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman as reported by Fairfax I.T. News on 5 October 1999.
We also reject Senator Alston's allegation that we are not ""responsible players"". The persons Senator Alston quotes as not opposing the government's approach are generally persons 
 outside Australia who will not be affected by the legislation. Silicon Valley stands to gain as Australians and their businesses move offshore. In addition, persons such as the USA CEO of Lotus are computer software developers, not obvious members of the ""Internet industry"". Moreover, APC Newswire reported on 7 October 1999 that Bryan Simmons, Lotus vice-president of worldwide corporate communications, said that comments by the CEO of Lotus ""were meant only to communicate deference to the government's sphere of sovereignty, not support of any government's particular policies"". Yahoo have previously denied supporting the legislation. With regard to Senator Alston's reference to a second press release by The National Australia Bank, Arnold Bloch Leibler and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu indicating that they are ""happy with the current legislative framework"", APC Newswire also reported that ""A spokesperson for the group said the second press release had not expressed support for the legislation, but for the Internet Industry Association's (IIA) latest draft code of the Internet Industry Code of Practice"". In fact no industry group supports the legislation except the IIA, and its endorsement is conditional upon its Code being accepted.
9.	 Senator Alston states that  ""[s]eventy-four per cent of Australian respondents [to the Bertelsmann survey] said that the courts and legal authorities, politicians and other agencies all have a part to play in the appropriate supervision and selection of Internet content"" and ""That is why I find it fascinating that somehow there is this notion that the community is opposed to what we are doing. They certainly are not.""
Senator Alston's reference to seventy-four percent of Australian respondents is incorrect. As multiple responses were allowed to the question, the only accurate figures that can be taken  from Table 13 of the report are each of the individual percentages. Nevertheless, Senator Alston or his staff have added some individual figures: 9 per cent believe that politicians have a role to play, 26 per cent—courts and legal authorities, 39 per cent—other agencies, to find a total of 74 per cent. However, 52 percent believe Internet users themselves are best able to control unwanted content. Adding the figures from different responses makes them meaningless; it wrongly implies that 220% per cent of Australian respondents have an opinion.
10.	 Senator Alston goes on to say ""where is this concern, apart from those maniacs I mentioned earlier?""
As stated above, the Senator's allegations as to our mental stability are groundless. Senator Alston does not appear willing to listen to the 
 widely expressed concerns. It is a well-known fact that the Senator's advertised email address has returned messages unopened to citizens attempting to make their concerns known. Senators and/or their staff from various political parties have advised constituents that they received an inordinate amount of email expressing concern, a considerable majority of the 100 submissions to the Senate Select Committee inquiry opposed the government's approach, a petition signed by 12,140 persons was tabled in the Senate on 30 June 1999, some 50 pages of comments expressing concern were received in response to a survey conducted by The Age, the list could go on. It is not that Senator Alston is unaware of the wide concern expressed. It is that Senator Alston chooses to disregard such concerns and exercise his Parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech in an irresponsible manner to mislabel persons expressing concern as ""maniacs"".
In summary, Senator Alston's allegations as to our characters, views and intent are incorrect, unjustified and utterly without foundation. Despite his attempts to malign us, we intend to continue to make the ""big noise"" that Senator Alston obviously finds discomforting until such time as the government's approach becomes, in our opinion, reasonably and appropriately adapted to serve a legitimate end.
We tender the above in good faith and request that our response be incorporated in the parliamentary record.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-10-21,"—I would also like to speak to this motion. In doing so, I remind senators of the context in which this privileges report was provoked. Senator Alston, whose comments were the subject of this report, took great liberties with his facts and his use of other parties in the context of the debate as he presented the issues in this chamber. This report contains a comprehensive response from Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. provided by Mr Kimberley Heitman, the chair of that organisation.
As those in this place can see, it is a lengthy response, because Senator Alston continually cast appalling aspersions on this organisation in his rather flimsy defence of the issue at hand. I would like to read the summary of 
 the words in the response from Mr Kimberley Heitman of EFA. It reads:
In summary, Senator Alston's allegations as to our characters, views and intent are incorrect, unjustified and utterly without foundation. Despite his attempts to malign us, we intend to continue to make the ""big noise"" that Senator Alston obviously finds discomforting until such time as the government's approach becomes, in our opinion, reasonably and appropriately adapted to serve a legitimate end.
This report traverses a range of clauses which go to every allegation and aspersion that Senator Alston has cast on this organisation, which diligently sought to express a view of a large number of members of the Australian community in response to the government's Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999.
As a honourable senators would know, this is an issue of ongoing public debate and the Electronic Frontiers Australia organisation will no doubt continue their diligent work in bringing the facts to the forefront of that public debate. They will do what is within their capability to defend themselves in the face of continual abuse by a minister who is obviously far more concerned with trying to drag people's names into this debate and diminishing the debate by personal attacks rather than sticking to the fundamental issues that are so worthy of a public airing and a comprehensive discussion, both in this arena and in the public area generally.
I commend this report from the Senate Committee of Privileges. I ask that all senators take the time to read it so that the Electronic Frontiers Australia organisation are fairly represented in their response to Senator Alston's appalling treatment of them.

In fact no industry group supports the legislation except the IIA, and its endorsement is conditional upon its Code being accepted.
9.	 Senator Alston states that  ""[s]eventy-four per cent of Australian respondents [to the Bertelsmann survey] said that the courts and legal authorities, politicians and other agencies all have a part to play in the appropriate supervision and selection of Internet content"" and ""That is why I find it fascinating that somehow there is this notion that the community is opposed to what we are doing. They certainly are not.""
Senator Alston's reference to seventy-four percent of Australian respondents is incorrect. As multiple responses were allowed to the question, the only accurate figures that can be taken  from Table 13 of the report are each of the individual percentages. Nevertheless, Senator Alston or his staff have added some individual figures: 9 per cent believe that politicians have a role to play, 26 per cent—courts and legal authorities, 39 per cent—other agencies, to find a total of 74 per cent. However, 52 percent believe Internet users themselves are best able to control unwanted content. Adding the figures from different responses makes them meaningless; it wrongly implies that 220% per cent of Australian respondents have an opinion.
10.	 Senator Alston goes on to say ""where is this concern, apart from those maniacs I mentioned earlier?""
As stated above, the Senator's allegations as to our mental stability are groundless. Senator Alston does not appear willing to listen to the 
 widely expressed concerns. It is a well-known fact that the Senator's advertised email address has returned messages unopened to citizens attempting to make their concerns known. Senators and/or their staff from various political parties have advised constituents that they received an inordinate amount of email expressing concern, a considerable majority of the 100 submissions to the Senate Select Committee inquiry opposed the government's approach, a petition signed by 12,140 persons was tabled in the Senate on 30 June 1999, some 50 pages of comments expressing concern were received in response to a survey conducted by The Age, the list could go on. It is not that Senator Alston is unaware of the wide concern expressed. It is that Senator Alston chooses to disregard such concerns and exercise his Parliamentary privilege of freedom of speech in an irresponsible manner to mislabel persons expressing concern as ""maniacs"".
In summary, Senator Alston's allegations as to our characters, views and intent are incorrect, unjustified and utterly without foundation. Despite his attempts to malign us, we intend to continue to make the ""big noise"" that Senator Alston obviously finds discomforting until such time as the government's approach becomes, in our opinion, reasonably and appropriately adapted to serve a legitimate end.
We tender the above in good faith and request that our response be incorporated in the parliamentary record.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-10-21,"—I would also like to speak to this motion. In doing so, I remind senators of the context in which this privileges report was provoked. Senator Alston, whose comments were the subject of this report, took great liberties with his facts and his use of other parties in the context of the debate as he presented the issues in this chamber. This report contains a comprehensive response from Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. provided by Mr Kimberley Heitman, the chair of that organisation.
As those in this place can see, it is a lengthy response, because Senator Alston continually cast appalling aspersions on this organisation in his rather flimsy defence of the issue at hand. I would like to read the summary of 
 the words in the response from Mr Kimberley Heitman of EFA. It reads:
In summary, Senator Alston's allegations as to our characters, views and intent are incorrect, unjustified and utterly without foundation. Despite his attempts to malign us, we intend to continue to make the ""big noise"" that Senator Alston obviously finds discomforting until such time as the government's approach becomes, in our opinion, reasonably and appropriately adapted to serve a legitimate end.
This report traverses a range of clauses which go to every allegation and aspersion that Senator Alston has cast on this organisation, which diligently sought to express a view of a large number of members of the Australian community in response to the government's Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999.
As a honourable senators would know, this is an issue of ongoing public debate and the Electronic Frontiers Australia organisation will no doubt continue their diligent work in bringing the facts to the forefront of that public debate. They will do what is within their capability to defend themselves in the face of continual abuse by a minister who is obviously far more concerned with trying to drag people's names into this debate and diminishing the debate by personal attacks rather than sticking to the fundamental issues that are so worthy of a public airing and a comprehensive discussion, both in this arena and in the public area generally.
I commend this report from the Senate Committee of Privileges. I ask that all senators take the time to read it so that the Electronic Frontiers Australia organisation are fairly represented in their response to Senator Alston's appalling treatment of them.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,1999-10-21,"—On behalf of the government, I resume this debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 (No. 2)  presented by Senator Jacinta Collins. The government rejects this bill. It relates to the some 30,000 reservists we have in this country. When this matter was being debated last Thursday, Senator Mason, from the govern 
 ment side, said there has been a long link between the reservists and the regular forces going back to 1901—right back to Federation—when Australia had a military force comprised of militia and volunteers of some 27,000, which is not much different to the figures we have today.
We had a permanent force then of only 1,500, so you can see the weights were very much on this particular type of training and force and that the reserves were critical to this country's defence way back in those times. The reserve forces comprised about 96 per cent of Australia's total force. Today they represent far less—about 30 per cent.
I should note when taking figures and statistics from Senator Mason's speech that indeed his brother, David, was in the Army Reserve. Senator Mason also said that Senator Ludwig on the other side of the parliament also belonged to the reserves. This honourable profession takes in all sorts of people from all walks of life wishing to do their patriotic duty in our armed forces.
Members of the Army Reserve generally spend between 20 and 40 days a year training with their units. However, there is a minimum obligation of 14 days per year for most of the reservists. These reservists need to be on individual alert and readiness at all times. The members must maintain a very high standard of individual readiness. They must demonstrate continued competency in their basic military skills. They must demonstrate continued competency in their trade, maintain high levels of physical fitness and maintain their medical and dental fitness with limited support from the Army health services. In a sense, while they are away from training they must maintain a readiness and alertness. They may be part-time soldiers, but they have full-time skills nevertheless.
In her second reading speech, Senator Collins said that this bill aims to amend the legislation so as to give back to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the power to include leave for reservists to participate in the activities necessary to be a member of the Australian Defence Force. In essence that is what the debate is about today. I have outlined the utter professionalism of our reserve 
 forces and the close historical links we have always had with them. Senator Jacinta Collins is pushing—on behalf of the opposition, no doubt, because this was tabled in the other House by Mr Beazley—something different again. This matter is clouded in patriotism and heartfelt emotion for the reserves, but if you strip it all away, they are just pushing an ideological industrial relations line. Regrettably, the opposition is cloaking this in patriotism. It is the same old political and ideological push to increase the numbers of allowable matters above 20 in the awards. It is an attempt to undermine the government's industrial relations reforms which have been an unmitigated success in modernising the workplace and breaking down the grip the unions have over their own members.
Mr Beazley in the other place linked this issue to the situation in East Timor when he said:
Now it is critical. It is not going to be possible to sustain this deployment for any length of time without recourse to reserves. Reserves must now be recruited and given certainty in terms of their employment and their capacity whilst in their employment to be trained properly for circumstances of danger in which they may find themselves.
To the extent that this statement is true, it in no way relates to the necessity as outlined by Senator Collins' bill to amend the industrial relations laws. The government is blatantly aware the importance the reserves play in the East Timor situation. We do not need the opposition to use it in regard to industrial relations laws. I would have thought it was a little more serious and important than that.
In fact, we already have reservists serving in East Timor. Some 38 officers and 49 other ranks are in the Army alone. They are medical specialists, logistics personnel and they hold staff positions. In regard to Mr Beazley's comments that our reserves need to be properly trained for circumstances of danger—and you cannot disagree with that on the face of it—I do not think that the professionalism of our trained armed forces, either reserves or full-time, needs to be questioned in this way. Their performance in securing Dili and subsequently other parts of East Timor has been highly successful, professional and admired 
 by all the contributing nations under Australian authority.
Although there are unknown dangers ahead, we are secure in the thought that our Army—that is, the reserves and the full-time personnel—is prepared. Given that Australia's  deployment in East Timor will continue for some time—and we  truly do not know how long—there is no doubt that the armed forces will rely on our reservists in one capacity or another, as they are now. They will either support in East Timor or support at home. We are reacting accordingly to meet these new and unexpected demands which will inevitably lead to increases in the defence budget. The government's seriousness in regard to our future commitments to East Timor should not be doubted or used as a pawn in an industrial relations game.
We will use the reservists who volunteer for full-time service where we need their skills to supplement regular personnel, or where they complement regulars. Reservists who volunteer to serve are paid a full-time military salary and, should they be deployed as part of the peace enforcement mission, they should receive the same tax-free salary and allowances as their regular counterparts. Where the government does not need to call out the Army Reserve to defend Australia, current laws allow reservists to be used on deployment overseas only if they volunteer for full-time service. Should they volunteer, then our preference is to negotiate with their civil employer to allow the reservist to serve. If in a given high priority case this fails, and an employer refuses to release an individual reservist who has volunteered to serve and whom Defence requires, then we would be able to invoke sections 8 and 9 of the Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965 to prevent the employer from penalising or prejudicing their employee because of their service.
—It is inconsistent with earlier advice.
—Whose advice?
—That is; earlier government advice that that wasn't available.
—Senator Collins, I can assure you that it is the backstop that we 
 have. What is more, I would doubt that there would be any employer in this country who would prevent a reservist from volunteering or being called up to go to East Timor.
—They are already doing it.
—They are already doing it?
—Yes.
—When you make your contribution to this debate—
—Order! There is too much discussion across the chamber. Senator Collins, Senator McGauran is entitled to be heard in silence.
—In a sense, I know that it is against standing orders—
—It is not a sense; it is against standing orders.
—It is against standing orders. Nevertheless, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I point out that I have heard Senator Collins's interjections. When Senator Collins winds up the debate, she will be able to counter these arguments. She cannot say that something in the Defence Act is not in the Defence Act and it does not work.
—No, I'm asking you for the advice.
—I say to you that this is the government's method. You may not like it, you may not accept it, but it has been proven to work.
—Where?
—Since, as Senator Mason quoted so well, 1901 when the reserves were in full force. It has not been written into the awards per se or into the industry relations aspects of every single award.
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—No, it has not, Senator Collins. Rather, the government would prefer the cooperation of the employer, which they have received to date. If necessary, we can invoke the Defence Act.
—Give us the legal advice that it works.
—The legal advice would show that that clause stands. These sections of the bill which re-establish the act have not yet had to be relied on.
—Precisely.
—They hang there like a sword. You have to admit, Senator Collins—
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—Senator Collins laughs because it has not yet been enacted. The fact is that the law is there that it can been enacted.
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—I invite Senator Collins in her address to answer how many situations we have had of the East Timor nature where reserves have had to be called up to defend their country and supplement the regular force and where we would need to have to enforce this anyway. Firstly, there have been very few situations like this. Secondly, we have never had a situation where the reservists have been blocked from going because of their employment. Unless you can lay on the table hard evidence, no-one is going to accept your method other than to strip it away and reveal what it really is—an industrial relations pitch under the cloak of patriotism.
You do not get much worse than that—using the East Timor situation and our well-trained reservists as a political football because you want to get at our Industrial Relations Act. Senator Collins, how did you get dragged into this? I would have thought that you would not have associated yourself with this. I know that industrial relations is indeed one of your specialities. You came in with a record from the trade union—one of the conservative trade unions; an old DLP union, I believe. She has managed to get preselection for the Labor Party with those poor credentials. You come in with a bit more balance than Senator Carr.
—Is she a grouper?
—She is an old grouper.
—Order! There is too much discussion and interjection across the chamber. A certain level is tolerable, but it is getting out of hand. Can I ask senators to observe the standing orders and give Senator McGauran a fair go.
—I was trying to make the point that I would have thought that at least Senator Collins would have come in with a balanced view in regard to industrial relations matters, but it seems not.
The act has not been relied on, as I have said. In most cases, if not all, employers have come to an amicable arrangement. It should not be too hard to imagine that an employer would support and encourage such an honourable pursuit. I cannot imagine an employer not doing so. We have evidence of that. There are prominent examples to show that the existing workplace relations regime that we have in place is working: Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank—
—They are discriminating against their employees. Telstra is discriminating.
—I can see your look, Mr Acting Deputy President, so I will not pick up that interjection. Telstra has a flexible reserve leave agreement with its employees.
—Telstra is discriminating.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I need to pick up that interjection. Senator Collins says that Telstra are discriminating. They have a flexible reserve leave agreement with their employees.
—Only to contract employees.
—With regard to enterprise agreements.
—It is outrageous.
—Exactly, in regard to enterprise agreements, which you cannot stand. You want to change the whole Industrial Relations Act. That is the point of your motion to introduce this bill.
—You are wrong again.
—If I am wrong again, I will listen with great interest to your summing up. It is not just Telstra but the Commonwealth Bank, the Northern Territory government and Wesfarmers Dalgety that have a flexible reserve leave agreement with their employees. There are several merchant banks that have agreements. So it goes on. The biggest companies in Australia have agreements with their employees with regard to reserve leave. There is no hindrance, and nor should there be.
I have not seen any evidence from the other side on this. I read Mr Beazley's contribution in the second reading debate on this matter. He spent half of it complimenting our troops in East Timor, which is worthy but hardly pertinent to this issue. He never mentioned that employers are discriminating against our reservists. Look at Labor's record in this regard in its 13 years in government. You had the chance to implement what you are saying we should implement now. When you were in government 152 out of 3,000 federal awards had written into them a reference to reservists. Of those awards, about 50 per cent were in the public sector. Under Labor, there was no comprehensive coverage of reservists and their leave entitlements.
I would venture to say that of all the agreements—enterprise agreements or award agreements—there is greater reference now to reservists' leave than there was when Labor was in government. It is also a matter of consciousness too. Let's face it: we have the issue before us now. Employers are going to be far more conscious than they were. Foreign affairs and defence were off the political agenda up until recently. They were not the centre point of politics or even of employers' thinking—industrial relations was, tax reform was. Now it has come to centre stage, I think you will find that this issue will be taken up by employers. They will see the sense in writing reservists' leave into enterprise agreements.
I think you are being unfair to the employers. Not only can you not show that they may be discriminating against reservists but, what 
 is more, it is an issue that has just come to the fore and it does not need this sort of bill to push cooperation. We have evidence that the Queensland government and the New South Wales government—Labor governments—support this government's approach in regard to reservists' leave. They have sent messages to this government that they cooperate in regard to our approach, that there should be a cooperation between the reservists and the employers, that there should be encouragement, but not written into awards.
—They have not said that.
—They have said that.
—Prove it. Rubbish!
—You are very isolated on this issue, Senator. I have read your second reading speech. I had to refer to Senator Beazley's speech to try to understand what you are actually trying to push here, whether you are serious at all about the matter. It keeps coming back to the same thing: it is just an ideological push to undermine the industrial relations laws. It has nothing to do with concern for the reservists and the raising of the East Timor issue is really cheapjack.
As I said at the beginning of my speech, we on this side of the chamber respect the reservists and know we will be relying on them in the East Timor issue. We know that we have the backstop in relation to the Defence Act if we have to force employers to give the reservists leave, but we know we will not have to. There is a greater spirit in the community than Senator Collins would allow us to believe. Employers are not two-headed monsters. In fact, I think they would see it as an advantage to their employment. I have already listed the number of big companies that see it as an advantage and would encourage people to join the reservists. It adds to their workplace and to the nation as a whole. So we reject this bill before the Senate.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-10-21,"—Not surprisingly, I too reject the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian 
 Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999  completely. I think the speech that my colleague Senator McGauran gave was excellent. He highlighted many points that expose the bill as totally superfluous not just to the reservists but to Australians in general and to employers in particular. That is not to say that I do not believe that reservists should have some protection, but it does not do that as a prime objective.
The bill tries to weaken the Workplace Relations Act that the other side detests so much. Speaking as a former national serviceman, someone who was conscripted between the Korean War and the Vietnam War, I must say on reflection—and on reflection soon after I was discharged—that I enjoyed very much indeed the camaraderie, the discipline and the feeling that I was making a contribution to my country. I stayed on the reserve list for some 25 years. I met many lifelong friends there, one of whom was the Hon. Ian McLachlan, former Minister for Defence. We are friends to this day, all these years on.
There was no union interference. I do not remember ever getting a letter from the ACTU saying, `You should really join us for protection. We will protect you.' We were not there to be protected in any case; we were the protectors. We were going to protect the people of Australia. We did not need the interference of the ACTU. This is about trying to weaken the Workplace Relations Act to the detriment of Australia. I recall reading in history where unions went on strike and interfered during the Second World War in Darwin and other places and forced officers of the very highest rank to unload cargo so that those fighting ships could defend Australia. This is about the old numbers game—number crunching.
When I was in national service in the 1950s, 60 per cent of the Australian work force was unionised. Today it is less than half. That speaks volumes for the failure of the union system. There are adequate laws in place to protect everyone in Australia. The trade union movement is a luxury that Australia cannot and does not need today. Above all it does not need the—
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—Senator Collins needs it because she is here by dint of the trade union movement, as is everyone on that side. Everyone on that side becomes a satrap of the ACTU. That is what this is about.
I know what the union movement is. I have been in a few unions over the years. I have never derived much out of it at all. In fact, it cost me. I do not know what I got out of it, on reflection. I could not even resign at one stage. It was like Alcoholics Anonymous—you can join, but you never know where to resign. As a consequence, my fees went on for years. At one stage I got a bill from the union movement that I could have built a large double story house for. I had to pay this bill because I did not know where to resign. I was, not surprisingly, in Actors Equity. I was in the Australian Workers Union. I was in the Plasterers Society, as was one of the esteemed members of the Whitlam cabinet who served here, Jim Cavanagh. So I have that background. But as to an ulterior motive of trying to cause problems with our union, I wrote back to the ACTU when I received a letter last week and said that I wanted nothing to do with, and I certainly was not going to cooperate in, bringing about changes. Our fighting boys and women are adequately protected.
When Mr Beazley introduced this bill into the other place, he did so based on false premises. They were echoed in this place when Senator Jacinta Collins read in those same amendments to the Workplace Relations Act. She said, inter alia:
Senators may recall that in the same fell swoop the government took away the commission's power to make awards on such extreme things—
these were her words—
as occupational health and safety matters, meal break facilities, amenities for people in lunch rooms and the fact that there should be first-aid kits provided in workplaces, or sexual harassment matters.
This sounds like she is talking about some deal in the iron ore fields of Western Australia, some sort of ambit claim. But she is talking about our armed services, about our reservists. I do not suppose Senator Jacinta 
 Collins has spent all that long in the armed services.
—I grew up in them.
—You might have grown up in them, but growing up in the armed services and growing up in an armed services establishment is a different thing altogether.
—In the services.
—She should know, even if she grew up in them, that the armed services today and our men and women in those services are amongst the finest equipped people in the world. They do not need the ACTU to protect them or to supply decent meal breaks. They get decent meal breaks, for God's sake. They get decent first aid facilities in all areas. They are second to none in the world. It is no good trying to subvert our armed services with statements like that. It is no good trying to weaken them in the eyes of the public and causing their parents and others concern by saying they need first-aid kits in workplaces. What a stupid thing to say.
—What about sexual harassment?
—The armed services lead the world in anti-sexual harassment practices.
—Nobody believes you on that one.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I take a point of order. I thought Senator Lightfoot had the floor.
—Senator Collins, you have been persistently interjecting. You were not interjected on when you spoke.
—Since the Workplace Relations Act has been implemented there is markedly less disputation. Also—and this gives the lie to these amendments—there have been real wage increases under that act. There are more people in employment. There is a record number of people in employment in Australia. Never before has Australia employed so many people. There is corres 
 pondingly less unemployment, down considerably from the peak of the appalling Hawke and Keating years. Senator Collins talks about the government's obsession with industrial relations. She may only be reading the same speech the Hon. Kim Beazley read in the other place; I do not know. But let me give some facts about reservists and the government's approach to reserve leave and workplace relations. The document I have says:
We are working with employers to ensure reservists' availability for training and service, and employers are willing to cooperate.
Senator McGauran mentioned those major companies that are cooperating. Why would we need superfluous amendments like this when we have that level of cooperation from our major employers? To go on:
They appreciate the government's constructive approach to let them manage their businesses while contributing to the defence effort.
When I was in National Service, my job was guaranteed when I got out. My job was guaranteed when I had to go away on bivouacs or camps. These were compulsory, you must remember. These were not volunteers. Senator McGauran mentioned those volunteers who are in the danger zone, an active service zone, a volatile zone in any part of the world—East Timor.
He mentioned Telstra. They have instituted flexible reserve leave arrangements and, following recent discussions, the Victoria Police are considering leave applications on a case by case basis, remembering the important role that they undertake in protecting the people of Victoria. It is not as if they could afford to lose something like 100 or 200 people, so it has to be on a case by case basis. Working with employers and reservists, we are making an effective reserve regime. I was in a reserve regime for 25 years and took it very seriously.
In contrast, we have seen the Leader of the Opposition in the other place propose award based, compulsory paid reserve leave, along with other ill-considered amendments. Why would you want to be in a unionised regime if the system is working so well? You on the 
 other side obviously have ulterior motives for doing it. Mr Beazley was asked:
Can you understand why employers even more so then would be upset because they say, `Well, all right, I'm losing employee X for two weeks and I've got to replace that person and pay someone accordingly?'
The Leader of the Opposition then said:
Oh, yes. And that's why it's important that it be incorporated in an award.
There seems to be some kind of madness about everyone having to be tied to an award. We are protected by minimum wage regimes. They are protected by the armed services itself with respect to awards.
—But not their jobs.
—Their jobs are protected. As I just explained, many of our major employers do cooperate with the armed services. In other words, Mr Beazley—and I suppose Senator Jacinta Collins is the same—is quite open about the fact that his model of reserve service relies on simply forcing employers to comply with his rules. That is diametrically opposed to the highly successful reservist scheme that we have now.
I do not understand the logic behind it. There must be something ulterior. There is something hidden here, and what is hidden is obviously not for the benefit of the people of Australia in defence terms. It is obviously not to the benefit of those young men and women who are serving and protecting us, fighting for us and helping us maintain our standard of living, which is envied throughout the world. It is not helping them. This is an attempt to get the numbers in the ACTU up. That is what it is about. It is number crunching in the armed services.
I think you should leave them alone. I do not think that Senator Collins, Mr Beazley or anyone else in the union movement should tamper with our armed services. They are running very well. They are a well-greased machine. They do not need the likes of Senator Collins interfering with them and causing them concern, concerning the officers who run that marvellous organisation concern and causing the parents of those men and 
 women who are serving in East Timor concern. Leave them alone.

—Mr Acting Deputy President, on a point of order: you have already called Senator Collins to order. She has interjected consistently. I know it is her bill. She is going to have a chance to speak on it or she has spoken on it; I do not care what she has done.
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—Order, Senator Collins! There is a point of order being taken. Please, order!
—She has interjected continually throughout Senator Lightfoot's speech. I ask you to call her to order.
—Thank you. I uphold the point of order. I warn Senator Collins: there has been too much in the way of interjections. Please will you wait your turn to speak at the conclusion of the debate.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. With the award system under Labor, only 152 out of 3,000 federal awards referred to leave for reservists. Of those awards, about 50 per cent were in the public sector, with the rest being principally single industry awards. Once again, I am at a loss to explain why, after 13 years in power, it was not rectified then. Why do you want to do it now? Because you want the numbers now. That is all it is about. I think that is a pretty low way to go about treating our armed services people.
In contrast, our workplace relations regime is working. This is voluntary cooperation. Some examples of the major companies that it is working with are: Telstra, which I think my colleague Senator McGauran mentioned; the Commonwealth Bank, the bank that lives here, the icon that you were never going to privatise but you did—you could not wait to get your hands on the money and your sticky fingers in the Commonwealth Bank till; the Northern Territory government; Wesfarmers Dalgety, a great institution in the great state of Western Australia, which has also agreed 
 to voluntarily reimburse and re-employ without loss of seniority those people who choose to take the voluntary reserve path; and Serco Gardner Merchant.
There seems to be confusion about whether or not you people want employers to pay their reservist employees while on defence training leave. Perhaps when Senator Collins answers, she could take that on board, because Mr Beazley confirmed he did not really understand the amendments that he was proposing. They cannot be very important or high up in the pecking order if Mr Beazley admitted he did not know what the amending bill was all about.
I do not think those opposite have any interest in having an effective reserve for our defence force. I think the opposition's argument is outdated, ideologically driven, about numbers and about embellishing the failing ACTU. You failed your people in the trade union movement. The union movement lost people like me because the union became superfluous. You failed your people. If you proceed with this bill and if you, God forbid, augmented by others in this place, do get it passed, I tell you this: you will also fail those young men and women in our armed services. You will fail those reservists. This is not a bill that assists them; this is a bill that assists the trade union movement and has little or nothing to do with enhancing the employment prospects of those young men and women who so gallantly choose to serve us in the reserve system. They should be applauded and not tampered with, as you people in the trade union movement are attempting to do by amending the Workplace Relations Act.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,1999-10-21,"—Viewed in isolation, I think that the matter introduced today by Senator Collins in her private member's bill, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 , seeks to address a discrete issue. I think that has to be said.
—Thank you, Senator. Some facts at last.
—It is whether leave for participation in service and training as a member of the Australian Defence Force 
 reserves is an allowable matter which may be taken to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for conciliation or arbitration. As Senator Collins has been so gracious to me, I will return the compliment by saying that it actually appears after subsection 89A(2) of the draft, which reads:
Insert additional allowable award matter: service and training in Australian Defence Force Reserves.
Subsection (2A) then says:
Leave for service and training as a member of the Australian Defence Force Reserves is an allowable matter for the purposes of subsection (1).
That relates to it being able to be brought to the commission for conciliation and arbitration. But one would have to say that it has much wider ramifications, and the debate that has ranged widely over the last couple of weeks is worthy of wider discussion in this place.
Not the least of those points is the timing for the introduction of the bill, which I think deserves attention. Without wishing to sound too cynical, it does seem that the Labor Party is at its opportunistic best in seeking to elevate this matter into one of high principle at this precise time, especially when our troops are on an overseas engagement and when sensibilities are aroused. The reason why I think we in the government, and indeed the Australian people, are entitled to draw an adverse inference against the Labor Party for raising this issue at this very sensitive time is that, during 13 years of Labor government, only some 152 out of 3,000 federal awards referred to leave for reservists and actually dealt with the topic. Of those 152 awards, 50 per cent were in the Public Service in any event. I do not think Labor could claim that it has comprehensively addressed this issue when it had the opportunity to do so and was in a position to be able to review the matter. If I get time later on, I will return to the fact that it actually received a report from the unions recommending that there should be a comprehensive review and did nothing about it.
So it hardly behoves the Labor Party to now bring to this place a bill which seeks to address issues which they could have addressed had they chosen to do so. Had the 
 Labor Party really wished to champion this cause because of a principled belief in its place in the award system, they could have done so, rather than to use it as a one-off, politically motivated effort. Surely in those circumstances they would have turned their minds to the issue when they could actually have constructively addressed it.
The issue at the heart of the matter is the fundamental question whether Defence Force leave is already an allowable matter under section 89A(2)(g) of the Workplace Relations Act. I think we have to say that there might be some doubt about it. But, in the absence of a definitive ruling by the commission, the second question is whether there ought to be an amendment to the Workplace Relations Act to make Defence Force leave an allowable matter. The third question is whether the subject is already adequately dealt with in any event by a provision in the Defence Act and the Defence Re-establishment Act 1965 prohibiting employers from acting to the detriment of, and prejudicing reservists because of, their need for military service and need for leave.
I will take these questions in reverse order. It is clear that legally enforceable protection does exist in the legislation to ensure that the employment of those undertaking military training leave is in fact protected—that is, in the Defence Re-establishment Act 1965. I note that there has been some unwarranted criticism of the fact that there have been no prosecutions under the legislation. That is supposed to indicate some weakness. I would have thought that, on the contrary, it points to the opposite conclusion—namely, that it is an effective legal sanction and that people in fact abide by it. I believe that most Australians, and that includes by definition Australian employers, recognise the invaluable contribution that reservists do make to our national defence effort and respect the arrangements that are necessary for related leave. It is a matter of pride, I think, that we can contribute to the national interest by encouraging the support of our reservists and allowing them to be properly trained.
As speakers did last week, I wish to take the opportunity to restate, on behalf of all 
 Australians, our support for our troops who continue Australia's proud and distinguished tradition of service overseas. I think it is indeed a shame that we are having anything like a political argument about some of the conditions of reservists. The next question is whether there is any need to have any different approach towards reservists and employees from that of the government's cooperative approach, and I have to say that Labor's attempt to turn back the clock to make defence leave an allowable matter is simply redundant. Not only is it redundant; it also fails to acknowledge the fundamental shift in the way that industrial relations operates now in this country and the way that employers and employees relate to each other.
I am the first to acknowledge that it must indeed be very irksome for Labor to have to recognise, even if they do not acknowledge, that the new workplace relations regime—with a streamlined, pared down awards system and the emphasis on voluntary workplace agreements—is actually working, and working very well. Quite simply, the balance in the system has been restored to better reflect the incontrovertible fact that unions now represent only about a fifth of the work force in the private sector. It was a major initiative to pare back dozens of conditions to 20 allowable matters, and this government is not about to agree to additional allowable matters being snuck back in under whatever guise.
By now it must be obvious, even to the opposition, that flexibility in negotiation actually allows employees and employers to come to arrangements that suit their particular circumstances, rather than to shoehorn them into a prescriptive straitjacket that suits no-one other than the unions. I know that might not be a fact that the opposition likes to hear, but the figures bear it out.
The fact that the government's approach to reserve leave and awards is working can be seen in a number of factors and a number of actual positive outcomes. Telstra has instituted flexible reserve leave arrangements and, following recent discussions, the Victorian police have in fact agreed to look at a case-by-case basis for considering leave applica 
 tions, taking account of Defence's need for particular reservists.
Working with employers and reservists is in fact building an effective reserve regime. This is something that the government has done deliberately and constructively, and it is a record that the government is proud of. In contrast, the Leader of the Opposition's proposals for award based, compulsory, paid reserve leave—along with other ad hoc amendments to the act—seek to just turn back the clock. The Leader of the Opposition was asked in a recent radio interview this question:
Can you understand why employers, even more so then, would be upset because they say, `Well, all right, I'm losing employee X for two weeks and I have got to replace that person and pay someone accordingly?
The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, said:
Oh, yes, and that's why it is important that it be incorporated in an award. You take a thing like that out of awards and it is very unlikely that people are actually going to be supportive of it.
In other words, Mr Beazley is quite open about the fact that his and Labor's preferred model of reserve service relies on simply forcing employers to comply with his rules.
We know that, if you have to force people to comply, often that does not work at all. In fact, the cooperative and flexible approach that has been taken is working very well. Under a more cooperative approach, we have seen some very major organisations actually address this issue constructively. Organisations such as Telstra, the Commonwealth Bank, the Northern Territory government, Wesfarmers Dalgety and Serco-Gardner Merchant are just some examples of employers with flexible reserve leave. Admittedly, some of these have negotiated arrangements on different conditions—they are not all identical—but each of these organisations has sought to comprehensively address the need to be able to allow reservists to have the training they need.
In Mr Beazley's confused remarks about whether or not he wanted employers to pay their reservist employees while on defence training leave—in the self-same interview— 
Mr Beazley confirmed he did not really understand the amendments he was proposing: he did not know whether it was going to be paid leave or unpaid leave. He is not interested in an effective reserve as part of our Defence Force, which is extraordinary for a member of parliament who has professed for some years a great passion about the Defence Force. Not to have actually addressed this issue and had it clear in his own mind is quite extraordinary.
—He was the Minister for Defence.
—How it fades from memory, Senator Patterson. He is interested, of course, in bringing back nothing other than an outdated ideologically driven award system that certainly did not work then and it will not work now.
As I said a little earlier, I have a note here that the ACTU wrote to the government in mid-October this year with a suggestion on reserve matters. It said that reservists called out for the defence of Australia should be allowed to have an allowable award to cover that issue. But, of course, the document was dated May 1995, so certainly the ACTU has not addressed the huge shift—the fundamental shift—in the way industrial relations actually now operate in this country, nor does this document even attempt to address the fact that the successes under the streamlined government system have to be taken into account in looking at any adjustment to the Workplace Relations Act.
For the last year of the Labor government this policy suggestion that had come from the ACTU was in their possession, yet no action was taken. I think that really speaks volumes about the bona fides of this particular bill and it speaks volumes about the former Labor government given the fact that this was obviously brought to their attention and yet no action was taken. It simply confirms the suspicion that this current profession of concern for reservists is really nothing much more than crocodile tears.
The fact that the government's approach is preferable and that it is working can also be seen in recent messages of support that have been received by none other than each of the 
 premiers of Queensland and New South Wales regarding the reservists. We know that the current deployment to East Timor has seen many reservists volunteer for full-time service in the ADF, and that is the only way, if they did volunteer, that they would be sent. In many cases they have negotiated leave arrangements with their employer and that has been an arrangement that has been allowed. It illustrates the point very well. The messages from the Labor premiers reflect this government's cooperative approach towards reservists and employers, using encouragement and negotiation rather than the opposition's confrontational approach. As I said, a number of organisations are responding positively to requests for leave from their reserve employees to allow them to contribute a period of full-time service.
An example is that reservists in the Department of Defence who wish to transfer to full-time services in connection with INTERFET may apply for leave under their industrial agreement. In some circumstances, leave granted for this purpose will be with pay for the first 14 calendar days of service and without pay for the remainder of the posting period. In other circumstances, leave will be granted without pay for the entire period of service. The leave without pay component will count as service for all purposes except annual leave. That is a pretty comprehensive arrangement that does address the need.
Reservists on full-time service with the Defence Force will receive a military salary. Interestingly enough, in Queensland and New South Wales the governments have recently outlined leave provisions for reservists wishing to volunteer for full-time service in the Australian Defence Force. That does not sound to me as if Labor governments in Queensland and New South Wales are very supportive of the bill and the initiative that is presently before this house.
A number of national and government departments at both state and federal level have expressed their support of employees wishing to join the Australian Defence Force, and around 90 reservists are already serving as part of INTERFET. It illustrates the point pretty clearly when state Labor governments 
 encourage employees to come to these arrangements with their employers. They recognise that cooperative arrangements work, they send messages of support to the federal government for the approach that they are taking and they believe that it will build a competent, trained and cooperative reserve regime.
Yet another reason to suspect that the need for this bill is absolutely otiose is the fact that military training can already be reinserted into public sector awards through arbitration, at least for the most part for payment at award rates. So we have to ask ourselves, and indeed speakers from the government are asking: what is the real agenda here? Why is the Labor Party seeking to do this now when they could have taken this initiative years ago to make it comprehensive throughout awards if it really occupied such a prominent place on their agenda? They simply did not. There was no comprehensive coverage. Today in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald entitled `Undermining the unions' the author, Brad Norington, makes a very interesting point. He says:
Unions, not surprisingly, have resisted the mandatory stripping back of awards amassed over many years and are still mounting legal challenges—
and in the next paragraph—
Begrudgingly, however, most admit that their members have not been hurt much by the award-stripping process because the central provisions on minimum pay, annual leave, sick leave, overtime and penalty rates remain untouched.
This is a try-on; it is not necessary. I commend to the Senate the approach that the government has taken in a flexible arrangement that is actually meeting the need for our young men and women to get the leave they need to undertake their military training.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-10-21,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 (No. 2)  which the opposition, through Senator Jacinta Collins, is seeking to put through the chamber. I am disappointed that this is the way in which the ALP is going about their first 
 attempt at policy making. It is a patch of policy. We have not seen anything from the policy free zone opposite. I heard them say recently, `Oh, well, you didn't have your policies out.' I remember a number of times when I was in opposition that we had policies out and on the board for debate. But we do not see any from the other side except this little policy patch.
I am disappointed also because, once again, we are seeing Labor's attempts at policy making founder. As Senator Coonan said, they are attempting to politicise an issue which is untimely and inappropriate in the current situation. I think it is also very cynical. Rather than trying to constructively fill the policy vacuum in their party platform, Senator Jacinta Collins's bill is an attempt to attack the reform of workplace relations via the backdoor of politicising Australia's peacekeeping commitment to East Timor.
One can see how ridiculous this is. It is just plain crazy. Despite the apparent intention behind Senator Collins's bill, it is a plain old-fashioned attack on the initiatives undertaken by this government in promoting flexible workplace agreements. It is clear that the Labor Party—the dinosaurs on the other side—want to step back in time and go back to the Dark Ages of mass legislation and the coercion of employers rather than allowing employees and employers to come to flexible agreements on things like Defence Force service.
Senator Coonan and a number of my colleagues have pointed out that in the bad old days of the Accord, the then industrial relations system—152 federal awards out of a total of 3,000, of which 50 per cent were in the Public Service—had some reference to reserve leave entitlements. That is approximately five per cent of all awards. The Labor Party come in here now and indicate what they want to do, when they had 13 years in government. If they were so concerned about the rights of reservists, especially with regard to pay, they would have done something about it in 13 years in government. Senator Coonan went over this in detail, but I think it is worth reiterating that five per cent of 
 awards made reference to leave entitlements for reservists.
—How many employees?
—Senator Jacinta Collins has interjected on every speaker on this side. She asks: how many employees? It does not matter. It matters that one person on one of those awards wanted to engage in reservist activities and did not have it in their award. Don't care about the numbers; care about the individuals. That is what we care about on this side of the chamber. The opposition talk about numbers; we talk about individuals on awards who had no rights—the rights the opposition say they want to put in place now with regard to their activities as reservists.
—Five per cent is not relevant unless you know how many employees.
—Senator Jacinta Collins keeps interjecting because that is all she can do. You shout louder in interjections if you do not like what is being said. We are telling it like it is—like their policy was. Only 152 federal awards out of 3,000 had some reference to reserve-leave entitlements. There were individuals on awards, maybe only a small number, who did not have leave entitlements. It is crocodile tears on the other side. It is all false: let's have a go at this now; let's make a political issue while our troops are overseas.
I know what the two reservists on my staff think about this legislation. I know what they think about what Senator Collins is trying to do. I have two young men on my staff, both of whom are reservists, both of whom have a great commitment to Australia and both of whom think this is absolutely ridiculous. Those are the views of two young reservists on my staff. I do not know how many there are on the Labor side but I have at least two on my staff.
Under Labor's compulsory complex system, there was no comprehensive coverage across the award system of young people—men and women—who wanted to participate in the reserve forces, so why should we go back to 
 that system now? Labor want us to go back to a period of complex industrial relations which failed to promote job growth and which saw record levels of unemployment at 11 per cent. Small business after small business came to us saying, `We can only employ our families because, under the current industrial relations system, we cannot afford to employ other people. It is too costly, it is too difficult and we are not prepared to do it.' So they held back from creating jobs, except for family members basically, and they ran their small businesses on the smell of an oily rag because the industrial relations system under Labor was so unworkable for small business. Labor would have us go back to record business collapses, high inflation, low productivity and record high levels of industrial disputes.
People on this side of the chamber, and those who have supported us, do not want to see those dark days again. This bill put forward by the Labor Party will put us back to those dark days. It is about introducing more allowable award matters and thereby reducing the flexibility and simplicity of the new system introduced by this government, which has seen unemployment fall to seven per cent.
—You should read the bill. It's just one!
—I do not think I have ever heard a senator interject so long and so often against so many senators in such a short time.
—Except you!
—I interject from time to time. Senator Quirke was totally out of order because he was interjecting when he was not in his own seat.
—Senator Quirke is not in his seat, but I understand he is leaving the chamber.
—That's disgusting.
—It is appalling behaviour; he ought to leave the chamber. Off he goes. He's gone! The other side is so interested in this they do not even have two members on their side. We ought to call a 
 division now, and they would not have two people to call it. We could move that the bill not be supported and then we could move on, because Senator Collins would not have anybody to support the bill. They are so interested on the other side, so vitally interested in Senator Collins's bill, that she does not even have one other member to support her.
Senator Quirke has just come back in to support her. He went out to get a newspaper. He heard what I said and has wandered back into the chamber. Senator Collins is so lucky to have Senator Quirke here to support her. That will make her feel so much better. Two members of the opposition care about this bill.
—None of them want to speak on it.
—None of them want to speak on it. We have not had a speaker from the other side. There is nobody over there to defend this bill and to speak on it. As I said earlier, this bill is really about is politicising Australia's commitment to the peacekeeping operations in East Timor.
—It's your filibuster!
—Senator Collins, you have been constantly interrupting speakers on this side.
—She begged for that one!
—Senator Collins, I ask you, please. You will have your opportunity to speak later in the debate.
—No, I won't. That's the point.
—It may be some time later, but I ask you now to cease interjecting while Senator Patterson makes her contribution.
—And a marvellous contribution at that, Mr Acting Deputy President, despite the constant interjections from the other side.
—Sustained interjections.
—Sustained interjections from the other side. This bill politicises 
 Australia's commitment to the peacekeeping operations in East Timor, where some reservists have volunteered to serve. The ALP is seeking to get some mileage for its flip-flop policy on supporting Australia's efforts overseas, a policy which seeks to undermine this government's commitment to the peacekeeping operation there.
Let us make it clear: those reservists who are serving in East Timor are protected by sections 8 and 9 of the (Defence Re-establishment) Act 1965, which protects any employer from prejudice against an employee who undertakes Defence Force service.
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I do not think Senator Collins should be giving a running commentary on everything that speakers on this side say. I ask you to call her to order. I find it very distracting. I am trying to listen to what the speaker is saying on this side.
—I have asked Senator Collins if she could maintain some decorum. Senator Collins, I would ask you to be mindful that you will get the opportunity to contribute to this debate at some later stage.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I was saying, this act, along with the Defence Act 1903, ensures the protection of Australia's workers by imposing fines under the criminal law against employers who seek to take action against them because of military service. This, coupled with a workplace relations system that allows employers and employees to negotiate flexible working arrangements, ensures that workplace agreements continue to meet the need for reservists to have Defence Force leave with the full support of their employers. I want to refer to a comment made by Minister Bruce Scott in the other place. He said:
The Labor Party are saying that we should have made reserve leave part of the Australian workplace agreements. The fact of the matter is that there are now more reserve leave provisions in those agreements than there were in the awards. When I talk to the people out there in business, many of whom 
 employ reservists, they say, `We would rather cooperate with the government and cooperate with the Defence Force than be coerced into employing someone and give them that leave through the award system. We would rather work cooperatively with the reservists rather than be coerced.' That system is working.
We know that the Commonwealth Bank have it in their Australian workplace agreements. Telstra have it in their agreements. The Northern Territory administration have it in their agreements. Our system is working. I wish the opposition would get into the real world and see how it is working and get behind good public policy that not only supports small business but also supports the reservists who want to have leave as part of an agreement under the Australian workplace agreements.
We in the coalition are about encouraging Australian businesses and organisations to support their employees' community service. We are about allowing businesses and employees the opportunity to create more productive, better paying and higher employment environments in which Australians can get jobs, keep their jobs and be better rewarded for their efforts. But what about the ALP? What are they doing to provide policies which will provide similar outcomes? Absolutely nothing. As I said, they are still in a policy vacuum. If this bill represents any idea of what their policies are going to be like, then I can only pity the `true believers', because their beliefs are absolutely misplaced.
I know a number of my colleagues have referred to this interview with Mr Beazley on 6PR, but it has only recently been drawn to my attention. I could not believe it. Had this been a Leader of the Opposition when we were in opposition, that leader would have been vilified. It would have been repeated on every news broadcast and the leader would have been mocked. In an interview on 6PR on Monday, 11 October the interviewer was asking Mr Beazley about this bill, part of the Labor Party's policy. The interview went as follows:
Interviewer—Would it work like this, that if you need, say, two weeks off, you get paid leave from your employer? Is that how it works?
Mr Beazley—You'd get leave from your employer.
Interviewer—You don't get paid leave? 

Mr Beazley—That would be paid by—the Army would give you pay while you're in there and so you've just got the right to leave there.
Interviewer—OK. So it's unpaid leave, in other words?
Mr Beazley—Yes.
Interviewer—It's paid because the Army pays you.
Mr Beazley—Yes, that's right.
Interviewer—But from the employer's point of view you're saying to your employer, ""I need two weeks' unpaid leave because I'm going on exercises""?
Mr Beazley—Yes, that's right.
Interviewer—Nonetheless, I suppose you'll have those in industry saying, well, it's all very well and good but I've got to get somebody else to replace that person while they're away and that's going to cost be dough.
Mr Beazley—Yes, well, that's right. Sorry. Look, mate, I might have misled you there. It would be paid leave, in a sense, like your annual leave, that sort of thing.
Interviewer—So it's paid leave?
Mr Beazley—Paid leave, yes.
Interviewer—But that's double-dipping, isn't it?
Mr Beazley—Not particularly. They don't get paid huge amounts by the Defence Department.
Interviewer—But they're still being paid by their employer, plus they're going to get money from the Defence Department.
Mr Beazley—That is correct but that's what the case has always been.
Interviewer—Well, I get back to the question then: Can you understand why employers even more so then would be upset because they say, ""Well, all right, I'm losing employee X for two weeks and I've got to replace that person and pay someone accordingly""?
Mr Beazley—Oh yes. And that's why it's important that it be incorporated in an award. You take a thing like that out of awards and it's very unlikely that people are actually going to be supportive of it.
Interviewer—All right. Well, what chances do you—
Mr Beazley—Oh sorry, mate, I've misinformed you again. It is unpaid.
Interviewer—Oh, OK.
Mr Beazley—I've got a bloke in here who's sort of waved his hands all over the place and said that that was paid, so in fact as I originally thought, it is unpaid. 

Interviewer—Right, OK. I think it would have been—
Mr Beazley—I thought I must have made a mistake when I initially mentioned it to you—the arm waving—but I hadn't made a mistake, it was unpaid.
Interviewer—Well, that's not so bad, because it would have been a case of double-dipping, but that's not the case so that's fine.
If anybody knows whether Mr Beazley knew whether the leave was paid or unpaid after that, I will give them a prize.
Senator Coonan interjecting—
—As Senator Coonan said, `He wasn't waving.' The adviser was waving, but Mr Beazley was drowning. What a performance from the Leader of the Opposition. He has been a Minister for Defence and he does not have a clue. He had a debate in his party room about a bill they are going to put through and he does not have a clue whether reservists are paid or unpaid by their employers. He does not know. He has to second-guess because someone is waving at him outside the interview room. I can remember when opposition leaders on our side of politics made a mistake and they were vilified. Here we have the Leader of the Opposition, who has been a Minister for Defence. That is the bit I cannot believe. No wonder the country went to the dogs when they were in power.
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. This matter is tedious repetition. It has been raised by every speaker from the government so far. It is tedious repetition of the press release from the minister for misrepresentations.
—Order! Senator Collins, refer to people by their proper title.
—I will withdraw that. Just to clarify the point, I should say Minister Reith.
—There is no point of order, because I do not believe that Senator Patterson is repeating any statements that she has made earlier in her speech. It is her responsibility to make any speech she chooses to make.
—I can understand why Senator Collins is sensitive. I would be sensitive too. If my leader had done an interview like this, I would be so embarrassed.
—Hugely embarrassed.
—I would be hugely embarrassed. She has to try to explain what her leader was saying—when he had been a Minister for Defence. There might have been an excuse if he were a new shadow minister having just taken on the portfolio, but that performance was something like that of the muddle-headed wombat. That would have been okay on the ABC show that we all used to listen to when we were kids: you know—row, row, row; the Argonauts.
—A wave.
—A wave from the Argonauts—and the muddle-headed wombat has to get the story right. It deserves reiterating by every speaker on this side to just demonstrate how lacking in detail, how lacking in policy and how uncoordinated and undisciplined the other side is. If the Leader of the Opposition—a former defence minister—cannot get the policy story right for his own party's bill—
—He was right.
—Order! Senator Collins, you will have a chance to debate the issue later.
—As I said before, Mr Acting Deputy President, when you start to put the pressure on, when you start to put the heat on, when you start to show that they do not know what they are talking about, all they can do is shout louder and interject more because they do not like what they hear. As I said, if the Leader of the Opposition cannot get the policy story right, how can we expect the ALP ever to get the whole policy story right? In returning to the bill before the chamber, let me look at its practical effect.
—Good idea.
—I wanted to talk about the Leader of the Opposition's absolutely appalling performance on 6PR. This bill will not result in any concrete gains for 
 Australian workers. All it does is enable awards to provide for such matters. It will mean no material benefit for Australian workers. In no way will it dramatically increase the number of reservists available to the defence forces. In no way will it provide any further support to Australia's ability to maintain its commitment to the INTERFET forces and the people of East Timor.
The reality is that employers have been supporting the defence reserves under the current workplace agreement arrangements, which provide flexible, workable and mutually agreeable arrangements for Australian business and employers. The simple fact is—
—Recruitment has dropped significantly.
—The simple fact is that Labor, the unions and the ACTU have consistently opposed award simplification and the empowerment of workers to negotiate their own rewards. This was clearly shown by their own shadow minister for defence science and personnel, Mr Laurie Ferguson, on 11 May 1999 in the other place when he said:
But far from protecting reservists, the government has abandoned them to the marketplace. The coalition's Workplace Relations Act—driven as it is by an antiworker ideology—
these people must have come out of the ark—
prevents reservists from obtaining defence leave as an award condition.
Mind you, he does not actually say that only 152 awards out of 3,000 refer to reservists leave. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,1999-10-21,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999  proposes to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996. Its purpose is, purportedly, to ensure that leave for participation in service and training as a member of the Australian Defence Force reserves is one of the matters which may be taken to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for conciliation and arbitration. I said `purportedly' because the real purpose of this bill is of course quite different from what its subtitle describes. Let me say at the beginning that the Liberal Party has always acknowledged and cherished the contributions and 
 sacrifices ordinary Australians have made and are continuing to make for the welfare of our nation by service in defence of it. Defence of the realm is a fundamental issue to this party and this government.
It is a historic fact that when the Howard government came to office in 1996 it was presented with a gift of a $10 billion black hole in the budget, courtesy of the Labor government and its last Minister for Finance—none other than Mr Beazley, now the Leader of the Opposition and the proud sponsor of this bill. I draw the Senate's attention to this coincidence of Mr Beazley's participation. It is actually not a coincidence at all, because there is even more to it than that. Mr Beazley was in fact the Minister for Defence in a previous Labor government, when he presided over the decimation of Australia's defence capability on the basis that Australia was not under any foreseeable military threat. I understand `foreseeable' is a term referring to 50 years.
The situation has changed. We can understand that Mr Beazley would now be desperate to be on record as a person who cares about the members of our defence forces. What better way to do it—a totally costless and totally irresponsible way—than to put forward a legislative proposal like this bill. He does not have to pay for anything. He does not even have to make sure it goes through. What we have here is a caring, want-to-be national leader. All he wants for the nation is to make sure that the jobs of reservists are protected. Who would not be moved by his concern? However, the right of a reservist is already protected by legislation—by sections 8 and 9 of the Defence (Re-establishment) Act of 1965. Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to the fact that it is an act of 1965. Under this act, employers are prevented from penalising their employees because of their service in the armed forces reserves. Under this act, employers would be charged with a criminal offence if they attempted to do so.
It is important to note that not only is this legal protection provided but also it is an historic fact that these sections of the act have never needed to be relied on before. In other 
 words, Australian employers are much more compassionate about our nation's defence than the Labor Party is prepared to credit them with. Charity has never been a strong suit with the Labor Party, has it? It is more a case of `If you see a head, kick it as hard as you can.' But let us be charitable about it. Is the Labor Party merely being misguided in their enthusiasm to provide additional legislative protection? Not at all. This bill actually proposes to add an allowable matter to the awards. This is the real purpose of the bill: not concern over the welfare of the reservists but the addition of another matter to be considered in the awards.
The real purpose of this bill is to perform another last-ditch act of sabotage against the government's workplace reform program—reform that is urgently needed to bring Australia into a position where it can face global competition in the 21st century. I might add that the need for this reform was recognised by the Labor Party, even though they will be hard pressed to admit it, because this reform process was commenced—albeit in a half-hearted and half-cocked manner—back in 1991 by the Labor government. What this government proposed in the 1996 Act, unlike the current bill before the parliament, takes that reform process to its logical conclusion.
This reality is highlighted by Mr Beazley's obvious confusion about the actual status of a reservist's job. For Senator Collins's peace of mind, I will not repeat Mr Beazley's performance on Radio 6PR, in case she is moved to complain again. But the reality is that the issue brought up by this bill is not at all that of the welfare of the reservists.
—I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would like Senator Tchen to read it again because I did not hear it the other 10 times. I would honestly like him to do it again, and I think he should feel free to do it.
—Senator Quirke, there is no point of order.
—With your permission, Mr Acting Deputy President, I think I do not need to indulge Senator Quirke. I suggest that Senator Quirke read today's Hansard  in 
 detail. At no stage has Senator Quirke asked about the description of Mr Beazley's going back and forth, saying, `I'm sorry. It will be paid. It won't be paid' and the people waving at him from outside the broadcasting booth.
I would like to talk about something that is a little more serious. I do not want to take the Labor Party to task about how inadequately they are trying to represent the people of Australia, because I understand that the function of an opposition party is to make noise rather than to actually propose policy which the nation can follow. I want to come back to this question of workplace reform. It seems to me that the fundamental issue of the Workplace Relations Act 1996—I know Senator Collins is an expert in this area so I will not try to match her on the intricate details of it—is quite simple. Australia has an almost unique system of workplace relations. It is something that has been built up over the years and it has a history of which we can be proud—regardless of which party we come from.
It has given workers good protection during periods of difficulties. However, employers and employees have relied for too long on a centralised system where third parties rather than workers themselves take the initiatives and make decisions about wages and working conditions. If you put into the formula that the employees and employers themselves do not form the first and second parties but each of them is actually represented by other parties, you have a system in which there are not just two players who work in partnership to carry out economic activities to their mutual benefit; you have three, four or five parties all working in their own private interest.
As we go into the new century, this system is putting a burden on Australia's ability to compete in the world. One of the elements of the reforms put in place by the Workplace Relations Act 1996 is to define different levels of agreements which would guarantee workers' welfare and also productivity for employers in the workplace. The award system, which has formed the bedrock of guarantees for workers' conditions, has been redefined to its proper purpose as a safety net. 
 The nature of a safety net is that it covers the basic requirements that guarantee workers' conditions.
When the 1996 act was passed we had more than 3,200 federal awards in the Australian workplaces. Each of these awards applied to different conditions, different industries and had different complexities. The 1996 act provides for the award system to be simplified. According to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, under the act these 3,200 awards were reduced to about 2,000 awards by July 1999. Also, about 1,200 awards have been identified by the Industrial Relations Commission as being in the process of being simplified. So the process is well in hand. Within the next few years we should have a very good safety net in place which will enable employers and employees to embark on proper enterprise bargaining which will guarantee workers good conditions and employers good productivity.
Although this process is developing natural momentum, we find the Labor Party trying to add items to the award process. As I pointed out earlier, this is quite unnecessary because protection for Defence Force reservists is already in place. There is no need to add to it. I would suggest that this is only a mischievous attempt by the Labor Party to, on the one hand, redirect attention from their inadequacy in the past and their inability to make proper provision for Australia's defence and, on the other hand, without drawing attention to it, slow down the process of reform to help their mates in the union movement who see all this reform process as something to be feared because it will either do them out of a job or require them to acquire new skills in representing workers and fighting for workers' needs. As I said at the beginning, what better way to achieve your end than by introducing some elements which have nothing to do with what the nation actually needs? In looking at this bill, let us look at the real purpose behind the proposal. I urge the Senate to reject it.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AUSTRALIAN DEFENCE FORCE SERVICE AND TRAINING) BILL 1999 (No. 2)</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,36,1,speech
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1999-10-21,"—In the couple of minutes available to me before the time for this debate 
 expires, I want to say something about the private member's bill introduced by Senator Collins on behalf of the Labor opposition, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Australian Defence Force Service and Training) Bill 1999 (No. 2) . I really could not put it any better than the erudite way in which Senator Tchen has just said it—that this legislation is really a subterfuge. It is a disgraceful subterfuge to reinstall an industrial relations system that might have been all right in the 19th century but certainly had no place as the 20th century progressed and most definitely has no place in Australia as we enter the 21st century. The Labor Party through this legislation is making a disgraceful—Senator Tchen said mischievous; it is certainly mischievous but it is more than that—attempt to misuse Australia's support for East Timor to reestablish this outdated, passe awards system of wage regulation in Australia. And it will fail. (Time expired)

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-10-21,"—I wish to speak to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission annual report. It is interesting to look at note 
 16 on page 187 of that report which sets out executive remuneration. I note that because the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has a great deal of responsibility in looking at the probity of the actions of Australian companies.
I noticed that a report of the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities was tabled by Senator Chapman this morning. His media release on that report says:
The Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities has recommended that company annual reports must disclose directors' and executives' remunerations in all its forms, including the value of options granted, exercised and lapsed during the year and their aggregation in the total remuneration package.
The table at note 16 of the ACCC report does not attend to their executive remuneration in the same way. Having said that, I am reminded of a contribution I made on 22 September with regard to Airservices Australia—an authority of this government—in which I asked questions of Minister Anderson in relation to a document that had been published which purported to set out the salaries of managers and other staff. I asked Mr Anderson for a copy of a report on the salaries and increments of those staff and that was refused.
In the context of the statement by the committee and the media statement by its chair, Senator Chapman, today, it is hard to understand how Minister Anderson can refuse to reveal to the public details of the salaries of the executives of Airservices Australia. It is the case, as with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, that this statutory authority has as its effective shareholders the people of Australia. Senator Chapman said in this regard today:
The committee has recommended that new disclosure requirements should apply to listed managed schemes to ensure that the same levels of accountability and transparency apply to these entities.
He pointed out that many directors and executives were seeking to use the law as they did not feel compelled to comply with it and felt that the law could be contested. In the case that I mentioned, it is not a question of the law; it is a question of the discretion of 
 the minister. The minister is using that discretion to decline to reveal to the Australian people the very information that the parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities has recommended be required of directors and executives of companies in the private sector.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission should follow the same standards. Much more detail on remuneration should be supplied than is set out in this table, which is merely a list of bands of salaries and the number of officers who lie within them. We were told in the Airservices case that the salaries ranged up to $329,000 for the Chief Executive. Parliamentary salaries have been in the news recently, but they do not go anywhere near the salary that Mr Pollard receives. The General Manager, Corporate and Employee Relations for Airservices is paid $256,214. I see in the ACCC document that no officer receives a salary of that level. I do think that whilst the ACCC document is, in my view, deficient in what it presents—and I am heartened by the statement of Senator Chapman—it is hard to understand why the minister cannot see that the Australian public have a direct interest in knowing what a statutory authority such as Airservices pays to individuals. If newspaper reports are correct, the salaries for those officers are greater than for those in the ACCC. (Time expired)

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-10-21,"—by leave—During the debate on the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 , the Minister for Family and Community Services said that she would provide at a later hour a statement of reasons setting out the government's concerns concerning amendment No. 6 moved by the opposition. I therefore table the statement on behalf of Senator Newman and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard .
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Statement of Reasons
Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1999
While the Government supports amendment 6 moved by the Opposition, I table the following statement of reason to express a concern with this amendment.
The amendment allows the Managing Director of the Health Insurance Commission to waive a debt owed to the Commonwealth where the Managing Director is of the opinion that incorrect or misleading information was given to a person by, or on behalf of, the Commonwealth or a health fund.
The Government emphasises that the decision of the Managing Director to waive such a debt is entirely discretionary.
The Government notes that it is unusual that the Managing Director of the Commission should consider the waiver of a debt owed to the Commonwealth where incorrect or misleading information was given to a person by a health fund.
In such situations the Commonwealth will have the ability to waive a debt owed to it by a person because of the apparent wrongdoing of a completely different party, namely a health fund.
Ordinarily, if a person has been given incorrect or misleading information by a health fund, the appropriate course of action is for the person to take legal action against the fund.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-10-21,"—On Tuesday, Northern Territorians celebrated a most important and auspicious occasion in the Northern Territory's history. Tuesday, 19 October, marked the 25th anniversary of the election of the first fully elected parliament of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory of 25 years ago was still pictured by the vast majority of Australians as the frontier of our great country, a vast region with extremes of climate that was populated by wild and dangerous animals and by even wilder characters.
It was viewed as pioneer country, and people who made this their home worked hard, gave a lot to the community and had a lifestyle that many in southern states could only dream of, or in some cases imagine in their worst nightmares. The Northern Territory is still a place for pioneers, but they are pioneers of a different ilk to those of 25 years ago, who were building a modern community and its necessary infrastructure in the face of much adversity.
Over the past 25 years we have seen enormous and unparalleled growth in the Northern Territory. Let me outline some of the major achievements and issues as I have seen them over the course of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I was very privileged to have been an initial member of that assembly in 1974, so the 25th anniversary has a very personal and parochial significance for me.
There has been an incredible growth in the tourist industry, from a somewhat unsophisticated beginning into something that now caters for all types of visitors in the most professional and friendly manner. The Northern Territory had 1.28 million visitors in 1998-99, with 434,000 of them being from overseas. This compares to only 113,000 for 1971-72, with 12,000 of them being from overseas. The Northern Territory government has facilitated this growth by expanding the number of Territory parks to over 90 and putting in place the infrastructure that is so necessary—such as the Yulara resort—to service the national parks in the Territory. The gas pipeline from the Mareenie field to Darwin is another major achievement that should be noted. This opens up many possibilities. It is pleasing to see the current plans for a major LNG plant in Darwin and the benefits this project will bring.
In 25 years we have seen the mining industry expand from one worth just over $100 million a year to one worth $933 million in 1997-98. There have been several new major projects come on line and the expansion over the years of others such as the Nabalco operation at Nhulunbuy. Gold has proven over the years to be a major commodity in the Territory, with various mines expanding or operating. I think of places like Jabiru and the Macarthur River and recent developments relating to diamond mining.
Closely related to the issue of mining is the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1996 which was introduced by the Fraser government. It is my belief that this federal act has been both a boon and a curse to the Northern Territory. It has certainly focused attention on the plight and needs of Aboriginal people, but at the same time, due 
 to the fact that it traverses traditional land administration, it has created an impediment to mining and land development. Complex land council administration has acted as a hindrance to the social development of many Aboriginal people, and the concentration on acquiring land at any cost has perversely left the vast majority of Aboriginal people living in remote communities still dependent on welfare support income mechanisms.
It is interesting to note the parallel between the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act of 1978 and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act of 1976. Both of them over this period that I am talking about have had an important impact on the Northern Territory. It is very significant to note the positive and the negative on both of those issues.
Another issue which is of particular recent importance is defence. Over the years we have seen a substantial build-up of defence forces in the Territory. The RAAF base Tindal and the defence personnel and infrastructure located in the Darwin region are proving their worth to Australians and the greater international region. The federal government has continued the build-up of defence forces in the Territory and earlier this year upgraded the readiness of the 1st Brigade in Darwin. This foresight has showed its dividends in the response to the recent East Timor crisis.
The Northern Territory government and the community have done much to welcome the defence personnel to the Territory. They have worked hard in conjunction with the forces to make any impact of defence personnel's presence a minimal and positive one for all involved. The Territory's response to the East Timor crisis, both at a government and business level, has shown the sophistication, planning and readiness of the Territory for tasks of this magnitude and the potential of the region as a service centre.
In the south of the Territory a major defence installation that is often not talked about is the Pine Gap joint defence facility. This facility has seen a large expansion recently and is vital to our national defence interests and the economy of Alice Springs. The staff 
 numbers in 1974 were 432: US, 226 and Australian, 206. In 1999 there are now 850 staff there, and half are Australians.
The creation of a Northern Territory Public Service that escaped the paternalistic management style previously seen from Canberra is another important step in the Territory's development. The Northern Territory Public Service was consolidated by Chief Minister Marshall Perron, who was also instrumental in ensuring that Territory businesses received appropriate government assistance to develop, to expand and to seek new opportunities. Marshall Perron was also instrumental in an important aspect of the Territory's social development prior to his retirement, the Northern Territory's progressive euthanasia legislation. This Northern Territory legislation, unfortunately, was thwarted in this parliament in a manner that constitutionally could not have applied to any state. This issue will be seen as a watershed in the Territory's history and an important factor in the social development of the community.
Since 1974 we have seen substantial change in the Northern Territory community. The population is ageing, with more people choosing to stay in the Territory to enjoy the lifestyle opportunities it offers in their retirement. We are seeing increasing numbers of second, third and even fourth generation families in the Territory, adding stability and character and giving much back to the community.
On a personal note, it has been a privilege and an  honour serving Territorians almost continuously in various political capacities since that fateful day in 1974 when I was first elected to public life. I have many fond memories of the time and some memories that, whilst they cannot be called fond, will always remain with me, in particular memories of Cyclone Tracy, which followed only a couple of months after the election of that first parliament. My first speech to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was made a week after Cyclone Tracy, and it is not hard to guess the topic of that speech—planning and relooking at the lives of many people.
A fledgling parliament faced an enormous task in the reconstruction of the social and 
 physical environment of Darwin. I am proud to have been a member of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission from 1975 to 1978 as a nominee of the Territory parliament and can only marvel at the Darwin I see now compared to then. The Territory is an exciting and vibrant place with many projects and developments coming on line or expanding. The people of the Territory have an air of optimism and expectation that is refreshing. This attitude is certainly a factor in the success of business and government in the Northern Territory, along with a willingness to have the foresight to recognise the potential in the region in so many diverse areas. This foresight has seen Territorians pioneering Australia's engagement with Asia, and Darwin becoming a highly sophisticated service centre that is pivotal in the area of regional focus.
The Territory pioneers of today are those pioneering our engagement with the Asian region and those who are looking to expand their opportunities nationally and internationally. In the next 25 years, the Legislative Assembly will have much to look forward to. In the near future we will have further infrastructure to facilitate our engagement with the region such as the railway and the continued development of the port and, of course, an advancement into statehood. I predict that the Darwin of the future will be cosmopolitan—a new Singapore—and the social reform of the next 25 years will impact on the lives of all Territorians, particularly with a major health, educational and social improvement for Aboriginal Territorians.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Northern Territory Parliament: 25th Anniversary </title>,Adjournment,40,1,speech
