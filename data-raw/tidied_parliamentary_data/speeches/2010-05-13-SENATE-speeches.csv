"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-05-13,"—The reason for not not granting leave in relation to this matter—clearly it is a matter we would not agree with—is that we would not have the numbers in the chamber.
—I hope you’re not opposing.
—There was a double negative.
—A double negative, Senator Parry.
—Yes, there was a double negative in that.
—Are you speaking to a motion?
—I am speaking to a motion. In doing so I recognise that the three signatures on the motion mean that we would not have a majority in the chamber. We would then waste time by going through a procedural motion which the government would lose. The government does not support the reference of these matters to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of the reference appear to be a direct investigation into a state election, without any reference to the Commonwealth Electoral Act or the Australian Electoral Commission. As such, this inquiry should be undertaken by the South Australian parliament. If not rejected, this would indicate to all state and territory parliaments that they have the right to investigate Commonwealth elections for partisan political purposes. This matter is a reference to a Commonwealth body and it should relate to Commonwealth matters.
Shortly after the first four paragraphs of the reference were reported to the media I asked the AEC for a briefing on these allegations and whether similar alleged conduct would be in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The AEC advised that these alleged activities would more likely than not be in breach of the act. However, in order to remove all doubt and to ensure that electors are made aware of on whose behalf how-to-vote cards are distributed, I requested the AEC to prepare possible amendments to the act. These amendments, which I table now, improve the authorisation requirements under the act so that it is made clear at the top of how-to-vote cards whether or not the card is being distributed on behalf of a political party or candidate. I will be seeking support for the amendments when further electoral legislation is debated in June and, of course, I look forward to the support of the movers of this reference for those amendments which make this inquiry unnecessary.
Unfortunately, I had very little time to be able to address the reference or hold consultations on it. Had I been afforded that opportunity I would have advised those supporting the motion that paragraphs (e) and (f) seem to be matters that should be dealt with by the relevant state authority and not matters that the Commonwealth should inquire into. Paragraphs (a) to (d) are clearly matters that raise concern. I expect Senator Fielding, having looked at that issue in detail, would acknowledge that the government has looked at acting to ensure that how-to-vote cards are dealt with in an appropriate manner and that the matter will be dealt with during the June sitting. If those amendments were to be a standalone bill, I would ask the opposition to indicate that they would not oppose any cut-off motion so that we can also deal with them.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Electoral Matters Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-05-13,"—We will look at any amendments that the Special Minister of State wants to bring forward to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. From what he has said to me, I do not think this addresses in any way the matter that was the concern of Senator Xenophon, Senator Fielding and me and which led to this reference. Unless my colleagues tell me otherwise in light of these amendments, in my view we should continue to pursue this matter through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It was disgraceful, inexcusable behaviour in the South Australian election. We think it is intolerable and we think the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is the body that should fully investigate the matter in the terms of the motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Electoral Matters Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-05-13,"—This is a very serious issue, and we hear the Labor Party trying to weasel out of it. They ran around impersonating Family First in South Australia, and the Prime Minister has not got the guts to rule it out at the federal election. He should have come out the same day and ruled out doing these dirty tricks at this upcoming federal election. It was wrong. I am not just upset with the fact that they looked better than our people did! That was crazy. Maybe they got a discount on the shirts. I would like to know where they got the shirts from, because they were good shirts.
—We’ll give them to you!
—Great! Maybe you will get a bulk discount and give them to us. But it was totally wrong. It was misleading and deceptive, and here you are trying to stall on this issue. It is blatantly wrong and you should not be doing it. This motion has to go through today.
—You’re stalling. You’re sending it to a committee.
—This is a serious issue and you are treating it as if it is not. What happened in South Australia is misleading and deceptive and should be ruled out.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-05-13,"—As a co-sponsor of this motion, I think what occurred in the South Australian election is something that needs to be looked at at a federal level. These terms of reference will deal with that. I note that the South Australian premier has indicated concerns and that there may well be changes to the South Australian Electoral Act so that this sort of thing does not occur again. Obviously Senator Brown is in a much better position to discuss this, but in previous years there was misleading conduct in relation to people saying they were Greens or associated with the Greens. I have heard stories about that occurring in years gone by. One of the problems that we have in relation to section 329 of the Electoral Act at the moment is that it deals with the issue of printed material. T-shirts are not included as printed material. I have drafted an amendment to the Electoral Act to include the issue of conduct and have forwarded copies of that to my colleagues. I would like to think it is something that will have bipartisan support, because clearly what occurred in South Australia indicates a problem: the possibility of abuse. I do not think anyone in this chamber would want to go down that path. For the next federal election I think it is important. We have been alerted to it; now we need to deal with it.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-05-13,"—The Greens likewise will support any motion to clean up the rampant misrepresentation which goes on in the run to both state and federal elections and which is engaged in by the major political parties on both sides. We have seen from the Liberal Party in the past the electoral how-to-vote cards handed out that can confuse the voters into thinking they are coming from the Greens. But what is not covered in this motion is the deception of people in the run to elections through specifically targeted negative advertising. The Labor Party has become the doyenne of this deceptive activity. We saw it in the Tasmanian elections. We saw it in the South Australian elections. We saw it in the seat of Mitchell in South Australia, where arguably it changed the outcome of that election. On all occasions the Labor Party labelled its opponents—Liberal, Green or Independent—as wanting to promote illegal drugs and/or relationships with prisoners who had committed heinous crimes and who were in jail. We can expect more of it because it seems that it works, and it is not until we get truth in advertising and an end to the deliberate setting up of opponents, which seems to be coordinated and rampant in the Labor Party nationally, that we will get some protection for voters from this highly planned, misleading advertising.
Senator Fielding himself came in in an election in which his party is alleged to have spent a million dollars repeatedly advertising in my home state that I wanted to give drugs to children. So Family First is not clean from this tendency to want to besmirch untruthfully opponents in the run to elections. We should stop it. There is not in this proposal a motion for truth in advertising in the run to elections. There should be, and it is something the Greens—apparently alone, though perhaps with Senator Xenophon—will be campaigning for in the run to this election and consequently.

That—
To ensure appropriate consideration of time-critical bills by Senate committees, the provisions of all bills introduced into the House of Representatives after 13 May 2010 and before 3 June 2010 that contain provisions commencing on or before 1 July 2010 (together with the provisions of any related bill) are referred to committees for inquiry and report by 15 June 2010.
The committee to which each bill is referred shall be determined in accordance with the order of 13 February 2008 allocating departments and agencies to standing committees.
A committee to which a bill has been referred may determine, by unanimous decision, that there are no substantive matters that require examination and report that fact to the Senate.

The key outcomes agreed by the Commonwealth Government and five states and two territories at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting on 19 April and 20 April 2010 and the process of consultation between the states and Commonwealth prior to these agreements and related matters, including but not limited to:
the new financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and states and territories over the forward estimates and the conditional requirements upon the states for receipt of additional Commonwealth funding;
what amounts of the $5.4 billion Commonwealth funding is new spending, what is re-directed from existing programs/areas, the impact on these existing programs and what savings are projected in existing health programs across the forward estimates from these new financial arrangements, including the inputs, assumptions and modelling underpinning these funding amounts;
the projected number of additional/new services this additional funding will provide in elective surgery treatments, in emergency department treatments, in expected numbers of patients to sign up to the diabetes spending measure, in additional general practitioner (GP) treatments in aged care facilities, including the inputs, assumptions and modelling underpinning these projections;
the $15.6 billion top-up payments guaranteed to the states by the Commonwealth in the period 2014-15 to 2019-20, including exploring the breakdown of expenditure relating to hospitals, outpatient services, capital expenditure, GP and primary healthcare, aged care and other areas of health expenditure;
the names, roles, structures, operations, resourcing, funding and staffing of any new statutory bodies, organisations or other entities needed to establish, oversee, monitor, report upon or administer the National Health and Hospital Networks, Primary Care Organisations and the funding channels to be established under the COAG agreements;
what arrangements are in place, or are being negotiated for states that have not signed up, nor fully signed up to the COAG agreements, including what contingencies have been put in place for states that may want to alter agreements in future;
the intent of the state and territory governments and their preferred number and size of Local Hospital Networks in each state and territory;
the number of hospitals which will receive: activity‑based funding, block grant funding, or a mix of both;
aged care:
the 2 500 new aged care beds to be generated by zero interest loans,
the 2 000 beds for long stay older patients to be established,

"Ludwig, Sen Joe (Manager of Government Business in the Senate)",ALP,2010-05-13,"—I seek leave to make a short statement.
—Leave is granted for two minutes.
—The Commonwealth government has reached an agreement on health reform with all states and territories, except Western Australia, which represents the biggest change to our health system since the introduction of Medicare. These changes are the end result of a comprehensive structural review of Australia’s health and hospital system by the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, an extensive consultation process to test the report’s recommendation and consultation and intense negotiations with states and territories culminating in the COAG agreement of 20 April. Just two days ago we released a budget that fully funds the health reform investments.
This referral to committee around the detail of the agreement is a duplication of the significant effort that has already taken place. In fact, we believe that the detail sought by Senator Fierravanti-Wells could be found within the publicly released documents which are in existence. These include the intergovernmental agreement on 20 April 2010; the document, A national health and hospitals network for Australia’s future—delivering better health and better hospitals, released on 11 May 2010, which I table, and the 2010-2011 budget papers. Within that documentation are key milestones for implementing the various elements of the agreement. These clearly outline those areas where further consultation and negotiation will take place with states and territories and with key stakeholders prior to details being finalised. For these reasons the government opposes the motion.

—The government believes the motion is not appropriate. Key documents relating to Australia’s future tax system are already public. The government released the final report of the panel on 2 May 2010. On 2 May it also released its long-term tax plan entitled Stronger, Fairer, Simpler: Tax Plan for our Future. This is the first instalment of the government’s response. The package includes numerous informative fact sheets that may be of assistance to Senator Abetz. The second instalment was delivered in the 2010-11 budget, when we announced further substantial tax reforms, standard deductions, a reduction in interest withholding tax and new incentives to encourage personal saving. It is important to note that Treasury then released relevant policy parameters provided to KPMG Econtech, which then independently modelled their economic effects.
A summary modelling report and the full report is available on the KPMG website. I know that websites are not particularly popular with Senator Abetz, but I suggest he go to the KPMG website. He does not need to go via any other pathway to Treasury officials—it is there on the KPMG website. The development of the recommendations of the independent review panel was undertaken against a background of massive community engagement. On 6 August 2008 the panel released its architecture of Australia’s tax and transfer system. On 10 December three more papers were released and public meetings were held. The panel also conducted focus groups in April 2009 to further explore some of the issues raised in the public arena. Senator Abetz can freely access all these documents at www.futuretax.gov.au and, should he need the government to supply hard copies, that can also be arranged. The government opposes the motion.
—Mr President, can I recommend that Senator Abetz be sent a copy of the Hansard with respect to that statement so that he does receive the information.
—Senator Brown, that is not necessary.

—Since this government has been in office, Dr Henry has appeared before every Senate estimates and before Senate committees generally on many occasions. I have to say that that was not the case under the former government. There were occasions when I asked for Dr Henry to appear and he did not, but I never brought it into the chamber to insist—in the way that Senator Bushby is doing—that he must appear. I think that, in these circumstances that I will outline, it is unreasonable for such a motion to be presented to the chamber. Dr Henry has explained to the Senate estimates committee that he has an immovable family matter. He is taking leave. He must attend that family matter, and it will take him outside the country. It is a private family matter.
I am sure it would not be a surprise to anyone in this chamber that Dr Henry has a very, very heavy workload; he always has done. Particularly under this government he has had a heavy workload. In all the circumstances, it is and was appropriate for Dr Henry to receive leave because of his family circumstances. I would argue to any impartial observer that Dr Henry fairly deserves an opportunity to take the leave to be with his family. We oppose the motion and the amendment, if it should be carried. There are any number of Treasury officials who will be appearing before the Senate estimates committee who are very capable of responding to the range of questions that will be put by the opposition and the crossbench team.
—You want us to buy that?
—Are you questioning, Senator McGauran, by way of interjection the circumstances of Dr Henry? Are you seriously questioning that?
—I am questioning you.

—The opposition does not begrudge Dr Henry the opportunity to have an overseas holiday at this time. We are sure he has earned a holiday given the ad hoc way the government approaches economic issues and places demands on Dr Henry. But of course we have been reasonable in this. We have actually sought private clarification through the minister as to the nature and the timing of the trip to ensure that the circumstances leading to this are truly immovable and truly relate to circumstances that cannot be avoided. Despite making that effort, we have received no assurance that that is the case. All we have been told is what is contained in a letter from the Assistant Treasurer which we received last night—that he has unavoidable personal commitments and no further advice has been provided as to what that relates to. Given that he is not due to appear for three weeks, one can only presume that those relate to commitments that he has chosen to accept rather than those that might have been imposed on him through a sudden death or similar tragic circumstances.
The question is: why has this holiday been chosen to be taken during estimates? It has long been the case that the budget is held in the second week of May and that, after a week’s break, budget estimates occur in the two weeks following. It is not like the Secretary of the Treasury has not known when this will occur. The sittings for this year came out in November last year. He has had almost eight months to lock this into his diary and to make sure that he was available to turn up on these dates.
We are looking at a point in time that will be the first opportunity for the estimates committee to examine Dr Henry on the Henry review. For the last two years, he has been turning up to estimates committees and refusing to answer questions about the review because ‘it is not yet delivered’. It is now delivered; it is released. The government has responded. But it has responded dismally to the Henry review, and the people of Australia deserve the opportunity for parliament to examine Dr Henry on his review and his thoughts about the government’s approach to it.",SENATE,<title>ECONOMICS LEGISLATION COMMITTEE</title>,<title>Attendance of Witness</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1

—There is always a means of coming to a reasonable agreement on the basis of the information available. I do not mind what the argument is in either direction, but the amendment put forward is to enable a mutually agreeable time to be found for Dr Henry to appear before the committee, and I am sure that can be arranged. I would point out that not only did Dr Henry not always appear before the committee during the period of the coalition government but quite recently I asked for the Governor of the Reserve Bank to appear before a committee to look into the matter of the scandal surrounding Securency, which has half its board appointed by the Reserve Bank, and, if I remember correctly, the opposition voted to prevent that happening. So there is a double standard here.

I think it is important that we hear from the Secretary to the Treasury. He has recently completed the most comprehensive review of our tax system in many years, and I commend the government for commissioning Dr Henry to do that. I think it is important we hear from Dr Henry in relation to that. I think it would have been unreasonable to insist that he attend during estimates if he had genuine prior family commitments and I think it is important that this motion is passed and that we hear from Dr Henry before the end of the financial year.",SENATE,<title>ECONOMICS LEGISLATION COMMITTEE</title>,<title>Attendance of Witness</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1

—I think it is important to note that Dr Henry has probably had better attendance at estimates under the Labor government than under the coalition government. I could be wrong, but that is my belief. And I think that is a good move. I am sure that the circumstances through which Dr Henry will not be available would be serious enough for him not to appear but I think this motion does make sense. To have Dr Henry available to the Economics Legislation Committee at a mutually agreeable time on or before 30 June 2010 does make a lot of sense, and we will be supporting the motion for that. What we have to realise is that Dr Henry was tasked to take a root and branch approach. The budget is just out and this is a very important period coming up to the election. I think this is a more than reasonable motion to support.

That the Senate take note of the report.
In relation to this particular Senate inquiry I congratulate Senator Scullion, all of the members of the committee and the secretariat staff for the very significant work they have done on this report. I know Senator Scullion is very keen to speak to the report and its recommendations and will certainly take the opportunity to do so later on. There are a number of very significant recommendations, all of which seek to improve the situation of Australia’s Indigenous people.
I had the privilege of being able to attend some of the committee’s hearings—in particular, the hearing held at Weipa in the Cape York Peninsula area of Queensland. The evidence given made it quite clear that, in spite of motions to say sorry to Indigenous people by Mr Rudd earlier in the term of this parliament, as with most things with Mr Rudd, they were just words. It is again a hallmark of this government that there is plenty of talk but very little action. Indigenous people who gave evidence to this inquiry clearly made that point.
Another case in point is the wild rivers legislation in Queensland which imposes a huge impost on the ability of Indigenous people to usefully use their lands. It is legislation that has been widely condemned by Indigenous people in North Queensland. Mr Abbott has moved a quite significant private members bill to overturn Queensland legislation to avoid the provisions of the Queensland wild rivers legislation and to make sure that any decisions made by the Queensland government in relation to this matter are only taken with the full consultation and consent of Indigenous people.
Mr Rudd had an opportunity to indicate to Australia and to Indigenous people that his words of saying sorry meant more than just words. This was an instance where Mr Rudd could have turned those words into action. Regrettably, so far he and his colleagues in the Labor Party have opposed this private members bill, and I think that is indicative of the approach that the Rudd government has taken towards Indigenous people generally.
As I indicated, there are a number of significant recommendations made by the committee. I commend those to the parliament. Senator Scullion as chair will be addressing this report at a later period. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-05-13,"—I too would like to comment on this report. I am a member of this committee and I think committee members get a very good insight into some of the issues that Aboriginal communities need to deal with. We travel around each of the states and territories as much as we can. We visited a number of communities, as Senator Macdonald has indicated. Unfortunately, I was not able to make it to Weipa—which I was most distressed about—due to other committee commitments. However, I did join the committee for the rest of the hearings in Queensland and I learnt some very valuable information.
Several of the recommendations you will see in this committee report address the issues of the Cape York Family Responsibility Commission. There is a review of that process and an ongoing evaluation, which I think is very important. You will see that several of the recommendations relate to ensuring that results from that evaluation of the Cape York trial are very seriously reviewed. I think that is particularly important. We heard from the Cape York Family Responsibility Commission, who gave us some very valuable information. I was also in the position of having heard representatives of the commission talk at an ACOSS conference the week before in Canberra, so I have had the opportunity to hear about this trial on several occasions.
A very important point to make here is that this trial is significantly different from many of the other trials that are going on around Australia about income management. A lot of people hold up the Cape York income management trial as an indication of the success of income management. The point that is very clear from the inquiry and from talking to representatives of the family commission is that they take a very holistic approach to the way they deal with the issues of disadvantage in Cape York—the issue of not attending school and the other issues that affect family dysfunction. That is, they put a lot of effort into case management. This trial has cost around $40 million. There are many people pointing to the success of the trial. About 450 people have been through the process. Only 98 of those have been income managed and towards the end of the process. What happens is that you get case managers and case workers working with the families to look at what is going on in those families—how they can help, whether it is the kids’ nonattendance at school, how you encourage attendance at school, whether there is domestic violence and the other causes of disadvantage—and start to address those and walk people through the process.
The point is that, of those 400, only 98 at the time we heard the evidence had been income managed. That was a much more consultative process. As you can see, $40 million into a trial of that size is a substantial amount of money. I am not for one minute criticising that. The point is that there is a lot of effort going into case management to help people to genuinely change. I very strongly support the recommendation the committee has made about looking at the results. The key is that we need to look at the success factors, if overall it is judged to be successful.
We raised a number of issues in the report about housing. There was a lot of ongoing criticism about the SIHIP process and a motion was passed in this place this morning dealing with that. We raised a lot of questions about that program. You can be sure that there will be a lot more focus on that issue, I would suggest in this place anyway, in estimates and in the committee’s ongoing work. That is an absolute key, as we all know, to addressing disadvantage in Aboriginal communities.
The other issue that we covered, particularly in Queensland—we had a particular focus on Queensland this time; senators may remember that we had a focus on Western Australia and the Northern Territory last time—was criminal justice issues. We had a very useful discussion on that issue with correctional services and the Attorney-General’s Department in Queensland. Aboriginal incarceration is a very significant issue that certainly I and the committee have been looking at very carefully. I believe there will be further work done by the committee on the issues surrounding incarceration. A discussion paper has been produced by the committee on that very clear issue, which we need to focus on very strongly. I am very hopeful that the committee can continue to look at that, in the same way that I am hopeful that other agencies will start to look at the very high number of Aboriginal people who are incarcerated in the criminal justice system and its causes.
One of the issues that came up in this inquiry—and the matter is dealt with in the report that I am going to table next in this place—is that of Aboriginal people in the criminal justice system who have poor hearing. In Queensland, it was acknowledged that Aboriginal people are not screened for hearing problems as they go into the criminal justice system. One of the recommendations in the report is for the Queensland government to have a look at that issue and consider screening Aboriginal people for hearing impairment as they go into the criminal justice system. I very strongly commend to the chamber that recommendation as well because I think it will start to address some very important hearing and health issues for Aboriginal Australians.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-05-13,"—While all sides of politics can agree that the people-smuggling trade appallingly exploits innocent individuals who are desperate for freedom and desperately fleeing persecution, the Greens do not believe that the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010 deals with those issues, as I said in my earlier remarks in this debate. Rather, we have a situation where providing humanitarian assistance to asylum seekers could be criminalised under this bill, particularly as it fails to reflect our obligations under the current international anti-people-smuggling protocol. We are a signatory to that protocol yet its definition is not used in this legislation. The protocol that we are a signatory to specifically states that it does not aim to punish individuals who assist smuggled persons purely for humanitarian reasons. That is the difference between it and this bill.
The fact that the government has failed to commit to a charter of rights, which would enshrine our commitments under international law and provide an avenue for human rights challenges in Australian courts, gives cause for concern with this legislation, particularly when it unintentionally captures innocent individuals simply because it is so poorly drafted and broad, does not include the correct definitions and, therefore, does not fulfil its aim to criminalise genuine people smuggling. The bill does not reflect the issues in relation to people that are helped on humanitarian grounds.
Given the lack of consultation with the legal profession about the impact that this legislation will have on civil liberties, as well as the failure of these proposed new measures to adhere to our commitments under international law, I move a second reading amendment on behalf of the Greens:
At the end of the motion, add: “and further consideration of the bill be an order of the day for the first sitting day after:
      (a)     the bill has been subjected to inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, proposed by the Government as part of its new Human Rights Framework; and
      (b)     a statement of the bill’s compatibility with Australia’s international obligations has been produced and tabled in the Senate”.
The government say that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Human Rights Subcommittee is their new measure for moving forward with any legislation that has questions around its compatibility with human rights and international law. Why not let this bill be the first one to go through this committee? If the government are honestly committed to ensuring that individuals’ human rights are not violated and that legislation is not flawed in relation to human rights and civil liberties, then they should let this legislation go through that process. The Greens will not be supporting this legislation going to the next stage until it has moved through that committee and a statement of its compatibility with our international obligations is tabled in the parliament. Why would the government, after announcing that this is their new process and that this is what they are committed to, not take the opportunity to test it out with such an important piece of legislation?
It is clear from various submissions provided to the Senate committee which looked into this legislation—the committee inquiry which was rushed and whose report is one of the poorest I have seen in my short time here in the Senate—that the new offence in the amendments to the Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Migration Act 1958 is too broad and ineffective, particularly in the ambiguous reference to material support, which I spoke about earlier. Not only is this term vague and indeterminate, with concerns about fairness and due process, but it also presents problems with our obligations under international law, including the refugee convention.
Australia is a signatory to the anti-people-smuggling protocol, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, yet all the legal evidence given to the Senate committee inquiry into this legislation raised concerns that it breaches our commitments to them. In particular, article 6 of the protocol against the smuggling of migrants requires states to criminalise specified conduct:
… when committed … in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit …
Yet that has been left out of this piece of legislation. This requirement already exists in the people-smuggling offences under the Criminal Code. Why do we need this definition of material support, which does not offer any more clarity about the types of issues and individuals which this legislation will deal with? Under this bill, the requirement for a profit motive to exist is omitted. So, if a person helped somebody to escape an awful situation where they were fleeing for their life or from persecution, this bill would say that the person helping that individual is a criminal, without even a transfer of money. It simply does not make sense in relation to what the government suggests is the intent of this legislation.
It is obvious that there is strong concern that, if this legislation is passed in its current form, it would criminalise activities of aid organisations, humanitarian workers, charity and church workers and other individuals who assist people across borders for humanitarian reasons. Why is it that the government has not included the international definition of people smuggling? If the government intends to tackle genuine people smugglers, then why is that not clearly defined in this legislation? There is really no argument for not doing so. Of course, that is why this piece of legislation should not proceed until it is further looked at. It is such a poorly drafted, poorly targeted piece of legislation. One of the witnesses, indeed, during the inquiry said that it was the worst piece of legislation she had ever seen, and this was from a quite significant person in the legal profession in Australia. Despite having previously appeared in front of the committee long before the Rudd government were running the country—that is, during the Howard years—she still made the point that this was the worst piece of legislation she had ever seen.
It is clear from the government’s own submissions that there has not been adequate time to consider this bill. The failure of the government to articulate why it is necessary to introduce the new measures proposed in this bill highlights why public consultation and debate are necessary. I strongly urge the Senate to support the second reading amendment put forward by the Greens that suggests that this bill should not proceed until it is further scrutinised and checked off by the new Human Rights Subcommittee so that we can really have an understanding of the impact it will have.

",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2010-05-13,"—In speaking on the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010, I want to start by acknowledging that on budget day the 123rd arrival of a suspected illegal entry vessel occurred—that is, 123 vessels since 2008. Here we are in May and there have been 55 vessels this year. They are arriving at a rate of three per week. Anybody experienced in this area—and I was the minister in charge of border protection in 2007—knows the season has only just begun. We have had 55 boats this year and the season has only just begun. These boats are arriving at such a rate that I checked various websites to make sure one had not arrived this morning. At any given moment, I suspect Northern Command is aware of several boats on their way, spotted by Coastwatch, showing up on radar or according to advice we receive from passing merchant and commercial vessels.
This bill is one of the most shameful answers to a collapse of public policy that this parliament, in its long history, has ever seen. The mismanagement not just by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship but also by the border protection minister and by the Prime Minister is absolutely unsurpassed in Australian parliamentary history. Having deployed troops in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Middle East generally and in the full knowledge of what has gone on in Sri Lanka, to now say that we will delay the processing of refugees from those places because they are now more stable is an insult not just to senators’ intelligence but also to the intelligence of every right-thinking Australian.
It was five minutes ago, metaphorically, that the government was saying this was all about push factors. This piece of legislation is the most crass political stunt that this parliament has seen in its long history. We are now saying it is not due to push factors, as those push factors have abated such that there can be a delay and treatment of these people in a different way. So the defence of this guilty party in power at the moment has changed mid-trial. That is how strong the defence was when it started out—it was weak, it was a house of cards and it has begun to collapse. The confusion, indecision and misunderstanding in responding to this problem—this public policy issue that is at the forefront of many minds in Australia, particularly in my home state of Western Australia—and the public policy catastrophe that these ministers, including the Prime Minister, have presided over are simply outrageous.
The people smugglers are now so brazen that when suspected illegal entrants arrive in our waters they have the telephone numbers of defence personnel in their mobile phones. David Cody on the ABC highlighted the fact that one of the witnesses to the SIEV 36 coronial inquest told the coroner that mobile phones are taken because some asylum seekers have found the phone numbers of ADF personnel. How does this happen? The government is utterly asleep at the wheel on these matters if suspected illegal entrants have the personal mobile phone numbers of Australian Defence Force personnel before they get here. We know they will pull up next to Christmas Island, ring 000 and say: ‘Come and get us.’ This is an organised, corrupt trade that this government has inaugurated. When we were in power, they never had the mobile phone numbers of our personnel and they never knew about ringing 000. This is an organised, planned operation from within Australia that this government has presided over and, two years down the track, it is now belatedly taking some action. What an absolute scandal!
I now go to the SIEV 36 coronial inquest. On 16 April, an explosion occurred on board the SIEV 36 in which five men perished. The coronial inquest was conducted by Mr Greg Cavanagh, a jurist in the Northern Territory—a stipendiary magistrate. I pause to give him great credit for the work that he has done on this difficult subject matter. Pursuant to the legislation, he was to make recommendations and to proceed to find out what happened. He found out that there was an organised, planned modus operandi to ignite the boat. Of course, the government refused to disclose any of this information to the public, but there was an organised conspiracy by these people on board this boat to blow it up. At the time of the detonation, there were nine Australian Defence Force personnel on board the boat. This is what the government has led us to—our own soldiers, sailors and airmen who were on board that boat were exposed to the risk of being blown up by this government’s total failure in public policy.
The coroner found that all the adult passengers on this boat had conspired to tell other than the truth to the coroner. I want to take the Senate to those matters. At paragraph 12, he said:
... a group of passengers ... believed they were to be returned to Indonesia ... Notwithstanding that all passengers now deny knowledge of most of what occurred, I conclude that at least passengers Brahimi, Ghulam Mohammadi and Salman were involved in a plan to set fire to the vessel.
Further, he said:
As to whether lives could have been saved—
and five people died in that explosion—
I have concluded that action taken by navy personnel was appropriate and more passengers might have died but for the action they took. Indeed, later in these findings, I refer specifically to the bravery of three members of the ADF.
He went on to say that many of the ADF members who were blown into the water by this explosion, and were injured, recovered and then assisted in the timely rescue and treatment of passengers, and probably went on to save many lives. This is a very fine day in the history of the Australian Defence Force. This group of people were intercepting a suspected illegal entry vessel and were exposed, as we now know with the benefit of hindsight, to enormous risk, and they responded magnificently. I want to commend them and I want to commend the Chief of the Australian Defence Force for what has been a remarkable response in very, very difficult circumstances.
In paragraph 18, the coroner said:
At the time of their deaths, the deceased were passengers on SIEV 36. A group of 47 asylum seekers and two Indonesian crew departed Indonesia in the middle of the night on either 10th or 11th of April 2009. Their destination was Australia. On the morning of 15th of April 2009, SIEV 36 arrived in the vicinity of Ashmore Island. At that time, the passengers were somewhat dehydrated, exhausted and seasick but none were suffering from any serious illnesses. One of the crew, Beny, had an infected tooth. A passenger, Talash, had previously had an appendectomy.
And there were a number of children on board this vessel. This is what we have: 47 desperate people on the high seas, some in various states of ill health. What happens? After being intercepted and after the Navy had gone on board and cleaned up the vessel, we then had a whole host of issues involved in towing them for the next 12 to 13 hours. As a result of some of them mistakenly believing they were to be towed back to Indonesia, a deliberate act was carried out—as the coroner has set out. That act was recorded on a video from the vessel HMAS Childers. The coroner stated:
The camera was on HMAS Childers and had been activated within minutes of—
the naval officer on the spot—
calling high threat. That video shows that about 12 minutes before the explosion, namely about 7:33am, the passenger Brahimi was squatting at the bow of the boat immediately in front of the hatch where the unleaded petrol was stored. There was still one container of petrol in that hatch. The other had been taken by one of the crew members to the cabin and it remained somewhere in the cabin or in the engine compartment thereafter. That container was recovered and Beny said a photo of it attached to his statutory declaration was the container, when he gave his oral evidence.
Naval officer Faunt saw Brahimi at the bow and two naval personnel moved to the front. A person called Salman was standing in front of the cabin and had a cigarette lighter. It was Brahimi with the lighter and it was sought to be taken from him. A very short time after that the vessel detonated. We are so lucky that no Australian personnel died in this incident. Five people who were near the explosion perished. Nine Australian Defence Force personnel suffered ear damage, extensive burns and many of them were thrown into the water.
In dealing with some of the evidence, at paragraph 68 the coroner said that one of the naval seamen on board said:
Salman was gesturing towards him and he denied that the other passenger spoke to him. He denied seeing the activities of G. Mohammadi. He denies any knowledge of how the fire started.
69. Having regard to the video evidence, and what he had said previously in his written statements, I must conclude that his denials are not to be believed. He has lied.
This is about one of the asylum seekers. The coroner goes on to say:
When asked if Brahimi was resisting—
one of the naval officers—
told me ‘Absolutely’. Bendeich who took the lighter from Brahimi said he had to prise the lighter from his hand. Brahimi not only resisted but can be seen—
on the video—
trying to throw the lighter to other passengers.
71. Brahimi also denied that the floorboards over the hatch where the petrol was stored were open at that time—
the naval officer concerned—
however said they were open. He replaced them after he had taken the lighter. The video shows them to be open. Again Brahimi has not told me the truth.
The coroner goes on to set out all of the events and at paragraph 72, he said:
I cannot be certain as to what Brahimi was attempting to do with the lighter. He did not smoke. The question is why did he have the lighter in his hand? Why was he flicking the lighter? It might have been a threat or it may have been that he intended to light a fire at the forward hatch area. He was in a very good position to gain access to the unleaded petrol, spill the petrol and then start a fire. In all events if he had intended to do so, he was stopped by the intervention of Dawe and Bendeich—
both naval personnel—
73. Other passengers were asked about this ‘lighter’ incident. Most if not all of those who were a on the front deck would have been in a position to see this incident. However, all the witnesses called denied knowledge of it. In so far as those depicted on the video were in a position to see and were in fact looking in the direction of the incident, I do not accept their denials of knowledge. They are lying.
He goes on to find many of the witnesses lied in their evidence. At paragraph 75, he said:
I can only conclude that they have not told the truth.
And so it goes on. The coroner sets out that there has been a conspiracy to deny an intent to destroy this vessel, which contained 47 personnel plus two crew and nine Australian Defence Force personnel.
What do you think the government’s response to these people has been—these people who have lied at a coronial inquest and who apparently in the full knowledge that something terrible would happen, according to the coroner, deliberately blew up this vessel? What do you think happened to them, Madam Acting Deputy President? This government granted them visas. This government has granted these people, who were prepared to conduct the most violent act of criminality not just to themselves but to our personnel who were rescuing them, visas. It is an absolute disgrace.
We then come to this legislation, which seeks to toughen up the whole scenario. The event on SIEV 36 was caused by this government mismanaging—bungling—the whole policy of border protection. The government stands to be condemned. Five people died that day, we were very lucky that other sailors and Australian Defence Force personnel were not killed, and the government has given these people visas in the face of this damning report by the coroner.
Of course, we have had other boats—quite apart from the fact that these people have mobile phones. We know that just the other day we had to send out a P3 Orion to a boat. People were put in the water to assist a boat of some 59 Sri Lankans. Five asylum seekers perished just prior to 11 May because the boat they were in had been at sea for some 20 days and had no food, water or fuel on it. That is what this government, in its stupidity, has delivered to this public policy issue: people in leaky boats coming across a treacherous piece of water and perishing. Five people from that boat perished. Goodness only knows how many boats have set off from Sri Lanka to make the trip and have never been heard of again. This is the scandal of these people with their crazy compassion and their ‘we won’t have children behind razor wire’. There are probably dozens and dozens of men, women and children who have perished in those waters because of the stupidity of the minister for immigration and a bungling, hopeless Prime Minister who does not understand the parameters of this matter, particularly in Sri Lanka.
The government’s real attitude was on display in an article by Andrew Bolt in the Herald Sun of 13 May in which he talks about former MP Peter Katsambanis, who was a member of the Refugee Review Tribunal. Mr Katsambanis told Andrew Bolt that his former colleagues on the tribunal are under pressure to accept dodgy refugee claims. The article said:
The management of the Refugee Review Tribunal has hinted very strongly that members should start approving more refugee claims … after the change of government in 2007.
There is the cat out of the bag.
It was made very clear by management that long term career prospects would not be enhanced by continuing to make decisions that were lawful and correct (ie rejections or affirmed cases where that was the correct decision to make)—
that is, to refuse entry.
One of the people deciding the next round of appointments on the RRT is John Gibson, a Melbourne lawyer who heads up the Refugee Council of Australia. He also appears in many … cases in the Federal Court appealing against decisions made by RRT members. The fact that this man is on a panel selecting or recommending RRT members offends every principle of independence of administrative decision making …
So here we have the system rigged, and it demonstrates the government’s quite misguided and stupid policy. What has the government delivered to this nation on this policy? Men, women and children travelling across a perilous piece of water, many of whom perish; Australian Defence Force personnel thrust into ever-greater risk in managing their arrivals; and a huge budget black hole of expense on Christmas Island and in motels in Queensland. Those things are what the stupid, misguided, so-called compassionate policy of these people has delivered. And we have to deal with this. We have to pick up the pieces. We have to fly the aircraft, sail the boats, man the surface assets and go out and rescue people at a massive rate.
People are losing their lives because of this crazy, crazy policy. When will this government wake up and stop playing politics like this crazy piece of legislation and delaying processing? What on earth does that say? It says, ‘We’ve lost the plot, we don’t know what we’re doing, but we’re going to look politically tough.’ I think Australians are waking up at last.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-05-13,"—I rise to speak on the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. In following Senator Johnston’s comments, can I say that as I move around the country I find people are waking up. In this country where one out of three people has been born overseas, people support, and this country has always subscribed to, an Australian immigration policy that is built and depends on order and process. That has been the success of our immigration policy. It depends very much on our sovereign right to determine who comes into this country, and we decide in an orderly manner and according to a process that follows rules and regulations.
Millions of people have come to this country and made an absolutely fantastic contribution. They do not remember the queue that they stood in. They perhaps do not remember the time they waited, but they do know that they came in through the front door. That is the message out there to the millions of Australians. That is why millions of Australians are very concerned about the breakdown of our border protection and, more broadly, the breakdown of process and order in our immigration policy. They came here, they respected order and process, they integrated into Australian society and they expect that their government respects those same principles that they were asked to abide by in coming to this country.
My colleagues have talked about the processes and humanitarian programs. Australia has been a very generous subscriber to humanitarian programs and accepting refugees—indeed, we take about 13,500 per annum. In my time, I have had the benefit of speaking to a number of people who have come to Australia after waiting overseas. They came to Australia and they have benefited from that humanitarian program. Many of them waited for years and years in camps overseas. They went through the proper processes, through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many women—including mothers and their children—who have been abused as a consequence of war and other circumstances overseas waited in camps. As far as I am concerned—and this is the expectation in our country—they are the ones who should be given first preference. We do not know the security status of people who want to jump the queue. We do not know where they come from. We do not know who they are.
As a consequence of this government’s changes, it is not just the person who comes in—either offshore or onshore—through the back door; it is also a multiplier effect that their families also come out to this country. It is very clear that the government’s changes in July 2008 started the process. The process started when Minister Evans announced the changes. You cannot change aspects of our immigration system—and, indeed, as a consequence of answers given at estimates by Minister Evans, there have been changes to about 26 programs in the department. Some have been small. Some have been major, like abolishing temporary protection visas. But the reality is that the compound effect of these changes has said something to people overseas. These people watch what happens in Australia. This is an industry; this is not just somebody who decides they are going to dodge the system.
Before I became a senator, I worked at the office of the Australian Government Solicitor for 20 years, where I saw this industry in operation firsthand at the grassroots. Senator Johnston talked about dodgy claims. I have seen my fair share of dodgy claims through the courts. That is the reality. That is the end effect of dismantling of a proper and orderly immigration process. So it is little wonder that we are seeing a budget blow-out. It is an extra $1 billion over four years, according to figures released in this budget.
This does not only affect the offshore arrivals; it also affects onshore arrivals. Yes, this debate has been primarily about boat arrivals; but this is also about people who claim asylum onshore. What sort of message has this sent to people who arrive here with a valid visa who then suddenly decide that they are going to claim asylum status? Every one of those people who is successful in claiming asylum takes another place from those 13,500 places that have been set aside for people who have been assessed by UNHCR to be genuine refugees. This is what this debate is about. It is about order and process.
In the end, I look at what this government has done and I look at its history. Yes, under the Howard government we did have a tough but successful policy, but this has a long history. The Howard policies had their antecedents in Labor’s policies. Let us not forget that it was Labor that introduced mandatory detention in this country. Let us not forget that it was Gerry Hand who introduced temporary protection permits. And they worked. They worked in that era, they worked under the Howard era and they will continue to work in the future.
So, when I look at the practical angles and effects of this, it is critical to the sovereignty and security of this country that we know who comes in, that security is not compromised at the expense of proper processes and that the necessary checks and balances are undertaken. I conclude by saying that this whole sad and sorry episode of the dismantling of proper order and process has, regrettably, had consequences and will continue to do so unless this government changes its tack.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-05-13,"—Over the past few years there has been a lot of discussion about illegal arrivals in Australia—indeed, in recent months the debate has been hotting up. Almost everyone has an opinion—about what their motives are, about whether Australia should accept them, about how we process them, about how we treat them once they are here and about whether there should be offshore processing on Christmas Island. These are important discussions that we need to have, and I do not think many people would disagree with that. At the outset I want to acknowledge that this a complex and divisive issue. There are more than two sides to this argument and more options than the all-or-nothing choices that we are often presented with.
I also want to acknowledge that this Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010 refers to people smugglers—those who make money off the desperation of others—rather than the arrivals themselves. I agree that as a country we should be taking steps to try to deter smugglers who charge exorbitant fees and offer pie-in-the-sky promises only to put their charges lives at risk in rickety boats and rough seas. We have seen in recent days this very example: the five Sri Lankan Tamils who went missing after their boat ran out of fuel somewhere to the west of the Cocos Islands. Those five are now presumed dead and the remaining 59 people on the stricken boat had to be rescued by the crew of a Slovenian freighter. If media reports are to be believed, this happened just five days after Australian authorities first learned that the boat was out of fuel. Apparently, the missing men had left the boat to try to find help for others on board, which included women and children.
Even worse was the SIEV X disaster in 2001. I note that Senator Faulkner when in opposition was outspoken and courageous in pursuing that particular incident. I think it was referred to as a Certain Maritime Incident in the reports. In that horrific incident, 65 men, 142 women and 146 children died off the coast of Java on their way to Australia. We need to make it clear that this should not happen at all. We need to show that Australia values human life and that we condemn the treatment of people as ‘just another commodity’.
However, I have concerns about the possible unintended consequences of this bill. My colleague Senator Hanson-Young, on behalf of the Australian Greens, has raised valid concerns that the bill could breach Australia’s international human rights obligations and I share some of these concerns. I am concerned that this bill is simply too heavy-handed. It does have good elements in terms of an expanded role for ASIO. That is a good thing. It is important that intelligence services and exchanging of information can nip the problem in the bud and prevent the people smugglers doing their business in the first place. Whilst I have always had the view that our intelligence agencies should be subject to robust scrutiny by this parliament, it is important that we have that exchange of information.
These concerns, and Senator Hanson-Young has articulated them very well, include the broadness of the definitions included in the bill. Under this bill people acting on humanitarian grounds, or offering financial support to refugees overseas, can be charged with people-smuggling offences. This bill treats good Samaritans the same as ‘for profit’ people smugglers, which means that under this bill the nuns from The Sound of Music could be thrown into jail. That is one of the unintended consequences of this bill. That is plainly ridiculous.
—A highly suspect lot anyway.
—I think Senator Scullion said that the nuns were a highly suspect lot anyway. I am sure he said that tongue firmly in cheek.
A few years ago when the Prime Minister was an opposition frontbencher, he wrote an article for The Monthly about Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the role Christianity should take in society. There was a fair amount of criticism aimed at that article and some derision of the Prime Minister when he was then in opposition, but basically I think that the Prime Minister was right, although the arguments he made could apply to anyone, not just Christians. His piece on Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a powerful piece. It was well written, well researched, and it made a point about the issue of moral imperatives in public life. Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a German Lutheran pastor and was one of the first and most outspoken opponents of Hitler and Nazism. He is famous for his writings on theology advocating moral imperatives and he assisted people out of Nazi Germany. He assisted Jews to escape Nazi Germany so that they could avoid the fate that befell six million people of the Jewish faith.
Reverend Tim Costello of World Vision—my good friend—has said that, today, Bonhoeffer would be considered a people smuggler. Interestingly, around the same time Bonhoeffer was travelling secretly around East Germany to encourage a Christian movement against Nazism, delegates from countries around the world were gathering for the Evian Conference. The conference held in July of 1938 at Evian-les-Bains in France was called to discuss the issue of growing numbers of Jewish refugees fleeing from Germany. While most of the delegates expressed their sympathy for the refugees, none of the countries, except the Dominican Republic, were too keen on taking more immigrants than their ‘quota’.
One of the Australian delegates was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas W. White, at the time Minister for Trade and Customs. His attitude on behalf of Australia was:
It will no doubt be appreciated also that as we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration.
He went on to add:
I hope that the conference will find a solution to this tragic world problem.
So, in other words, Australia’s position in 1938 was ‘We are very sorry, but it is not our problem.’ We all know what happened in the events following 1938.
Last week, I received a copy of Australia’s Human Rights Framework which, according to the accompanying letter from the Attorney-General, ‘outlines action the government will take to promote and protect human rights’. Two of the measures outlined in the framework were the establishment of a parliamentary joint committee on human rights and the introduction of statements of compatibility with UN human rights treaties to accompany all new legislation. I believe the government when they say they are committed to human rights and to protecting Australia’s international reputation.
So my preference would be for the government to postpone debate on this bill until these two framework measures are established and introduced. This way, the joint parliamentary committee on human rights can then review this legislation in terms of our human rights obligations. It does not have to be a lengthy process. It is important that we deal with this, but let us put the safeguards in place. Let us not have unintended consequences.
The government can then issue a statement of compatibility on this legislation so that we can be confident in Australia’s dedication to human rights. This is an issue where there are literally lives at stake. Without the government taking these measures to ensure that we have the best possible legislation in place, the most effective legislation in place and one that is fair and without unintended consequences, I cannot support this bill in its current form.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-05-13,"—This is Australia and we will decide who comes into this country—not the people smugglers, as the Rudd government has been allowing and encouraging. Border protection is a fundamental concern to all Australians. Australians expect their government to keep their borders safe and stop illegal people or goods from coming into the country—and rightfully so. It is a basic requirement of any government to take care of our national security. There can be no compromise when it comes to our national security.
When it comes to border protection and stopping illegal immigrants from flooding our borders, this government is nothing short of a failure. Every day we read in the papers of another boatload of people caught trying to sneak into the country by jumping the queue, while people in refugee camps, who are waiting patiently, are forced to wait even longer because they have had their places taken by those who are coming by boat.
It is a huge issue for all Australians and something which is costing us hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayers’ money. Facilities on Christmas Island are at breaking point, with too many people flooding our shores for us to be able to detain everyone there. Now we are being forced to bring these people to the mainland, where they are practically processed in our living room. This is concerning many, many people. It is proof that the government has lost control of its handling of this issue and does not have an idea of what to do with the mess that it has created.
So what is the Rudd government doing? The Rudd government is just throwing more money at the problem, in the hope that it will fix the flood of boats coming our way. The Rudd government is spending $202 million in this budget on accommodation for asylum seekers. First we had Hotel Christmas Island and now it is Hotel Queensland. What is next—the Hyatt or Club Med? The Rudd government does not have a clue on how to handle the wave of asylum seekers flooding onto our shores—and giving them luxury accommodation is clearly not the answer. There is no way we should be detaining asylum seekers in hotels, because it just gives the people smugglers an extra selling point for their marketing.
Clearly the Rudd government is all at sea with its asylum seeker policy. The Rudd government is encouraging people to put their lives at risk by jumping onto leaky boats and taking the dangerous voyage to Australia—all because we are seen as a soft touch. We need to send a clear message to the people smugglers that Australia will no longer allow them to profit by preying on desperate and vulnerable people. The Rudd government needs to stop throwing money at the problem and start implementing a policy that will fix the problem.
I have been to Christmas Island and have spoken firsthand to people who arrived illegally by boat. The belief out there is that, as long as you pay enough money, you can simply jump on a boat and come to Australia, where you only have to wait three months and then you are given a gold pass into Australia. Why would you bother to wait five to 10 years in a refugee camp, when you can simply pay to jump the queue? That is the kind of message this government has sent to people smugglers—and it is just wrong. We have seen boat after boat stream into our waters, and you would have to have your head in a bucket of sand to say we do not have a serious people-smuggling problem.
I voted for the Rudd government’s changes to the immigration laws back in 2008 because I was against the barbaric laws which were put in place by the Howard government. But I accept that these changes have led to unintended consequences. The Rudd government need to wake up and realise that people smuggling is a real problem that is only going to get worse, and they need to be prepared to take more serious action. That is why I have put forward the idea of sending boat people to the back of the queue in overseas refugee camps—to stop people smugglers from selling Australia as an attractive destination.
Under Family First’s proposal, queuejumpers would be sent to the back of the queue at various overseas refugee camps and not given a gold pass to come into Australia. We need to send a clear message that queue jumping will not be tolerated by Australia. Every time we accept into our country a refugee who has come by boat, another refugee waiting patiently in an overseas camp somewhere is forced to wait even longer. That is not fair. For every person who comes by boat as a refugee, we take one person from the front of the queue in an overseas refugee camp. Clearly, they are jumping the queue. There are thousands of refugees patiently waiting in line in camps across the world trying to gain asylum, but boat people just push their way further and push those who have been waiting in the queue further down the queue. There is no way I think we should be rewarding people for jumping the queue and penalising those who are waiting in line.
Under this idea, Australia would take in people who have waited patiently in line in overseas refugee camps instead of rewarding queuejumpers. As I said, we need to send a clear message that queue jumping will not be tolerated by Australia. Australia is a fair and compassionate country and we should do our fair share to help refugees, but we should not encourage queuejumpers under any circumstances. As I said, every time we accept a refugee into our country by boat, a refugee waiting patiently in a camp somewhere overseas is forced to wait even longer. How is this fair on these people? There are hundreds of thousands of refugees patiently waiting in line in camps across the world trying to gain asylum, but boat people just push them further down the queue. There is no way we should be rewarding people for jumping the queue and penalising those who are waiting in line.
Of course, the real villains here are not the asylum seekers but the notorious network of people smugglers who prey on the vulnerabilities of desperate people and put the lives of these desperate and vulnerable people at risk all for the sake of making money for themselves. People smuggling is a despicable crime, and we cannot afford to go soft on these people. We need strong laws in this country to deter people smugglers and send a message that this kind of illegal activity will not be tolerated. I have always maintained that we should throw the book at people who engage in people smuggling, because that is the only way we are going to get through to them that Australia will not put up with their criminal activities.
Family First support the measures contained in the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010—because, when it comes to people smugglers. there can be no compromise and no leniency. This bill will expand the crime of people smuggling to include those people who provide material support or resources towards a people smuggling venture. It also contains provisions which harmonise the people-smuggling offences contained in the Criminal Code and the Migration Act, making it easier for us to prosecute people smugglers when they break our laws. People smugglers have no respect for our laws. They endanger the lives of vulnerable people and they threaten the border integrity of this country.
Family First welcomes these changes, but they are still not enough. They are simply scratching at the surface. Until the Rudd government gets serious, this problem is not going to go away. Until the Rudd government looks at Family First’s plan and takes action to discourage people from getting on the boat in the first place, this is going to remain a problem for our country and remain a concern for many, many Australians. Even the UN has revealed that people smuggling into Australia is out of control. Now it is time for the Rudd government to listen, so that we do not all end up paying for this later down the track.",SENATE,<title>ANTI-PEOPLE SMUGGLING AND OTHER MEASURES BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2010-05-13,"—I rise to end the second reading debate on the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2010. I first thank all senators for their contributions to the debate and I note the support of the opposition for this legislation. This debate has been wide ranging and a great many things have been asserted—some of which has had something to do with the legislation that is before the chamber and some of which has not. I shall try to confine myself to those matters which are relevant to the bill before the chamber.
This is legislation which seeks to deal with people smuggling. Obviously there is broad agreement that people smuggling jeopardises the safety, wellbeing and security of those being smuggled. The government takes a hardline approach to dealing with people smugglers and the supporters and financiers of those engaged in this trade. We are determined to maintain a strong message to people smugglers that their activities will not be tolerated in Australia.
Domestic efforts to combat people smuggling have yielded strong results and since September 2008 there have been 138 arrests and 36 convictions of people smugglers in Australia. There are currently 101 people being prosecuted in Australian courts for people smuggling. The government has also implemented a strengthened offshore approach. In the same period, the Australian government cooperation with regional countries has resulted in more than 180 disruptions involving more than 4,900 people bound for Australia. Our regional partnerships have resulted in the arrest of more than 150 people smugglers overseas and this bill before the chamber complements the government’s plan to combat people smuggling by strengthening Australia’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework.
The measures in the bill will address the often serious consequences of people-smuggling activities, including the potential for injury and loss of life on maritime ventures to Australia and the targeting of enablers and financiers of people-smuggling activities. The bill will act as a greater deterrent for people smugglers and it will enable law enforcement and national security agencies to play a greater support role in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat people smuggling.
The ability for law enforcement agencies to obtain evidence through telecommunications interception and surveillance devices is vital to combating people smuggling and the bill will make telecommunications interception available for the investigation of offences relating to people smuggling. It will ensure that law enforcement agencies can make emergency authorisation for the use of surveillance devices for the new aggravated people-smuggling offence and will ensure that law enforcement agencies are equipped with the necessary tools to effectively combat people smuggling.
The government maintains its humanitarian approach to those persons who are genuine refugees but fall prey to people smugglers while it works to improve the situation of displaced populations in the region. The bill is consistent with the approach the government is taking. For example, whilst imposing new offences and strict penalties for people smugglers, the new offence of supporting people smuggling will not target persons who pay for their own passage or the passage of family members on the same venture.
This bill has been considered by both the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. I thank both committees for their work on the bill and on the matters raised. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended the bill be passed, subject to further amendment to the definition of foreign intelligence contained in the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979. The government has considered this recommendation and is confident that the proposed amendments provide the appropriate powers to achieve the intended outcome and will not be seeking further amendments to the bill.
The bill is a measured response to a growing problem and demonstrates the government’s commitment to addressing the serious nature of people-smuggling activities and to targeting criminal groups who are involved in organising and benefiting from people smuggling activities. I commend the bill to the chamber.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-05-13,"—I rise to speak on the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. This bill is the final stage of what has been a long and much debated process, particularly for the professionals covered by the legislation. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act to streamline the recognition of health professions under the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions. The national registration and accreditation scheme is a significant reform commenced by the coalition government. There has been strong in-principle support for a nationally consistent registration and accreditation scheme for health professions. Jurisdictional differences for registration and accreditation requirements have hampered workforce mobility and made it difficult to monitor the small number of practitioners who have been under scrutiny or facing disciplinary action in a given jurisdiction.
The guiding principles of the scheme are stated as:
To provide for the protection of the public by ensuring that only practitioners who are suitably trained and qualified to practise in a competent and ethical manner are registered;
To facilitate workforce mobility across Australia and reduce red tape for practitioners;
To facilitate the provision of high quality education and training and rigorous and responsive assessment of overseas-trained practitioners;
To have regard to the public interest in promoting access to health services; and
To have regard to the need to enable the continuous development of a flexible, responsive and sustainable Australian health workforce and enable innovation in education and service delivery.
The process commenced with the Productivity Commission recommendations in January 2006 for a single national registration board and a single national accreditation scheme. The coalition government acted on the recommendations by reaching a COAG agreement in 2006 to establish a national registration scheme. In April 2007, COAG agreed on a single national registration and accreditation scheme to start in July 2008.
The health workforce underpins our health and hospital system. Health workforce issues are prominent in political debate and in the media. The coalition has a strong record and commitment to improving the quality of Australia’s health workforce, despite this government’s best efforts to rewrite history. The coalition government delivered nine new medical schools, including in regional areas such as at the University of Wollongong, which I was very pleased to support. There was a 50 per cent increase in medical school places between 2003 and 2007. Additional funding was provided in 2006 for some 605 additional medical school places being phased in from 2007 to 2011. The coalition government also provided 3,700 additional nursing places between 2005 and 2007. It was the coalition government that introduced funding for practice nurses through the Nursing in General Practice Initiative and later with additional MBS rebates.
Following the election of the Rudd government, the national registration and accreditation scheme stalled. The implementation has been delayed by two years and the start date is now July 2010. A key motivation for a single national scheme for registration and accreditation was to reduce bureaucratic red tape across the jurisdictions. Regretfully, it seems there has been bureaucratic influence and interference with the establishment and proposed functions of the boards.
It was only after the first Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry that a requirement was included for the ministerial council to give consideration to the potential impact of the council’s direction on the quality and safety of health care. A provision has been included for the council to first give consideration to the potential impact of its direction on the quality and safety of health care. A number of professions, including physiotherapy and psychology, have experienced delays with or expressed frustration at the process for specialisation recognition under the registration scheme. Clearly, the process has not been without difficulty and there remain some issues to be resolved before implementation in July.
The bill also provides consequential amendments to section 19 of the Health Insurance Act relating to Medicare benefit ineligibility for medical practitioners that are not authorised to render certain services under the practitioner’s registration. The coalition will not oppose the bill.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH PRACTITIONER REGULATION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-05-13,"—I rise to speak on the Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. The Australian Greens understand that reaching this agreement on a national system for the registration and accreditation of the 10 health professions that are currently included has been a long and complicated process. We believe that reducing bureaucracy and making cost savings are very good for our health system where that is practical and where it produces good outcomes. We also support the concept of national registration. However, we do have some concerns that, in some instances, there seems to have been a lowering of the standards of accreditation in order to generate this one-size-fits-all solution.
I will talk about a specific example from my home state of Western Australia. The standards of the Australian Psychological Society for their colleges and entrance into their colleges are quite different from those in Western Australia, where we have a much more focused approach on specialist registration standards. We believe that we have higher standards than those of the Australian Psychological Society. In the last few years since we have fortunately been able to access some of these services under Medicare, the society has allowed more people with no postgraduate training into their specialist colleges, something which the WA board has not allowed. This is why WA has the lowest level of membership of the Australian Psychological Society. WA’s psychologists have not needed membership of their specialist colleges to be identified as specialists. We have that already in WA. The WA registration board has performed this function—we believe a lot better.
The most important issue for WA is that the new system will have only the undergraduate level of training—four years of university training and supervision—registered to practise in all areas of psychology. They believe—and the Greens are concerned about this—that this level of training is significantly below international training standards. International training standards require, at the very least, masters-level training—two years full-time intensive postgraduate training and two years supervision. All up, that is at least eight years. WA has been the only state, and still is, which has registered this postgraduate training and two years on-the-job supervision, and hence has been the only state to meet international training standards. This level of registration in WA will be lost under this new scheme. It has caused a significant amount of concern in Western Australia, and I am sure that my fellow Western Australian senators have received emails and letters about this as well—not to mention meetings around this issue.
The endorsement process, which on the surface looks like the postgraduate registration, is highly inadequate—especially for WA. Firstly, although people with these postgraduate qualifications can be endorsed to practise in a specialist area under the national scheme, the specialist areas of practice are not protected at all. This is because a registered generalist with only undergraduate training—no clinical, diagnostic or ethics training—can go out and practise in all specialist areas. They just need to refrain from indicating that they are endorsed.
Secondly, the endorsement procedure is very flexible. This means that if the Psychology Board of Australia, for example, under pressure from government or others felt they needed to change the level of training for endorsement definition—for example, reduce it—then this could be readily done. It makes it much more difficult to ensure that we are maintaining standards. Endorsement is also confusing to the public, who look for specialists, not for ‘endorsed’ psychologists. This is of concern to the psychologists and their level of training, which ensures that the public know what they are getting and that it is the best. It is also actually confusing for the public, particularly in Western Australia, where they are very used to the specialist title approach that we take there.
We are concerned about the potential deskilling of the workforce over time. If an undergraduate can practise in all speciality areas but just not say that they are endorsed, why would they spend the extra time and significant cost to do postgraduate training if this is not going to be accredited and registered properly? We believe that the way forward is for WA to retain specialist title registration and the recognition that affords, which gives much better protection to the public and the community. I understand that this issue has been raised on a number of occasions and that it has not been properly dealt with through the whole accreditation process. There continues to be a great deal of anxiety in Western Australia around this particular issue.
The other issue about the national registration scheme that continues to concern me is around midwives and the linking of midwives with the requirement for indemnity insurance. I do appreciate that there has been legislation passed through this chamber which provides indemnity insurance for midwives. Of course, at the moment we have got that intermediate situation where we all know that indemnity insurance does not extend to midwives providing homebirths but all registered midwives have to have indemnity insurance. At the moment we have a two-year exemption where midwives do not have to have the indemnity insurance for providing homebirths. That situation is ongoing, yet needs to be resolved. The Greens will be watching this very carefully.
As I have said, the Greens have supported this process. We do have some ongoing and specific concerns, particularly around the issue of specialist psychologists and their titles in Western Australia. We believe that needs to be resolved in such a manner that Western Australia can retain its specialist titles. We encourage the government to engage with the Western Australian government and the Australian Psychological Society process in Western Australia to ensure that these psychologists and their specialist titles and training are preserved. This is not just about psychologists wanting to have specialist titles for the prestige. This is an important issue for the community. It is an important issue about standards and maintaining those standards in Western Australia. Western Australians feel really strongly that we should not have to lower our standards, which are good standards, to the eastern states’ standards. In fact, we believe that the eastern states’ standards should be raised to those of Western Australia because they are a much better approach and they meet international standards.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH PRACTITIONER REGULATION (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2010-05-13,"—I rise to indicate coalition support for the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2010, following a practice that has occurred since 2001. The Australian Research Council Act 2001 stipulates that the act should be amended each year to incorporate the amount appropriated for the Australian Research Council and to bring up to date the details of the funds administered. This measure provides for an increase in spending of approximately $889.6 million over four financial years, applies indexation against the existing schemes and creates an additional out year.
The funding supports three initiatives in particular: the Research in Bionic Vision Science and Technology Initiative, the Super Science Fellowships scheme and continued funding for National ICT Australia. The Super Science Fellowships scheme consists of 100 three-year early-career fellowships which will be awarded to some of Australia’s most promising young researchers. They will focus on the areas of space and astronomy, marine and climate, and future industries, all of which are very important to our economy. The Research in Bionic Vision Science and Technology Initiative is looking at things like the bionic eye, which we have heard something of recently. As I understand, it is one of the few initiatives to come out of the 2020 conference that was conducted here in Canberra with some of Australia’s best and brightest, allegedly. National ICT Australia has an important role in maintaining Australia’s research and skills base in the social and economic benefits that ICT capacity can bring. The opposition is more than happy to support these initiatives that are very important to the development of industry in the country and looks forward to seeing results.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-05-13,"—I rise today to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009 and the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 2009. The purpose of the first bill is to introduce a framework for the regulation of biologicals by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Biologicals are human cellular and tissue based therapy products that contain or are derived from human cells or tissues—for example, skin grafts used to treat severe burns. This legislation will have implications for the 20 licensed tissue banks nationally, including bone banks, eye banks, heart valve banks and skin banks, and also organisations which are working in the area of cellular and tissue therapies. The regulatory impact statement outlined a number of approaches to regulation: option 1 was to retain the status quo; option 2 was to regulate all human cellular and tissue therapies as medicines or therapeutic devices and remove the exemptions for transplant, assisted reproduction tissues, and human cellular and tissue therapies which had been prepared for a particular person; and option 3, which is the option that is being taken, is to regulate human cellular and tissue therapies as a discrete class of therapeutic goods, namely, biologicals.
In the legislation there are four classes of human cellular and tissue therapies, each with a different level of regulation based on the level of risk. From the consultation it is apparent that stakeholders prefer option 3, which is reflected in this bill. Option 3 has regulation based on risk and clarity, has compliance costs lower than option 2, has improved consumer safety over option 1, which is the status quo, and is consistent with experience in the United States, Europe and Canada. Organs will continue to be regulated by the Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority and assisted reproduction tissues will continue to be regulated in the current way.
This bill is part of the overall ongoing regulatory reform being undertaken by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. This is the fourth in a series of bills implementing that reform. It seeks to build on other reforms agreed to by the parliament over the last year. The coalition has been broadly supportive of these measures. Human cellular and tissue therapies have been primarily manufactured by not-for-profit tissue banks and major hospitals. However, with rapid advances in cellular and tissue technology there is an increasing involvement by private sector companies and clinics in the manufacture of human cellular and tissue products, while medical device manufacturers may in future incorporate human cells and tissues into medical devices. Clearly, therefore, we do not need an update of the Therapeutic Goods Act to reflect that these emerging technologies and human cellular and tissue products can be regulated as a specific group.
The government assures that under this legislation all biologicals used within Australia will be properly assessed and regulated providing confidence for patients who hope to benefit from the outcome of these technologies. Biologicals will be included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and only those that are so registered or otherwise exempted will be able to be supplied and used in Australia. Biologicals can be exempted from the Therapeutic Goods Administration regulatory framework by regulation to deal with emergency situations, to allow for special experimental users or where substitutes are not available.
Criminal and civil penalty provisions are provided for in the bill to ensure compliance by those bodies and individuals involved in the making, supply and use of biologicals. These penalties are consistent with other provisions of the Therapeutic Goods Act and can apply in the same way as penalties for the misuse of other therapeutic goods. The second bill complements the amendments proposed in the first bill and will ensure consistency with the approach on annual charges for biologicals taken towards all therapeutic goods. The coalition does not oppose these bills.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2010-05-13,"—I know that the Higher Education Support Amendment (University College London) Bill 2010 is listed as non-controversial, but that does not mean that it is without significance. It is a highly significant bill. As Senator Stephens would know, while some people—indeed, some of my own colleagues—do not appreciate the full significance of the higher education sector to our economy, it is our third-largest export, so anything to do with higher education is critical to this country’s future. This bill foreshadows and flags the increasing internationalisation of the Australian tertiary sector, allowing further universities to enter into the sector and compete with Australian universities. Specifically, this bill seeks to enable the listing of University College London as a table C provider, which will allow it to offer FEE-HELP assistance to eligible domestic students.
Honourable senators will be aware that University College London, known as UCL, is one of the world’s leading research institutions. It is one of the great universities of the English-speaking world, and it is a great thing that this bill will enable them to compete in Australia. Enabling students to attend UCL and qualify for FEE-HELP signals the continued internationalisation of higher education in Australia. This is a good thing. It is a great thing for our nation. It also signals that with competition our nation cannot in any sense afford to rest on its laurels. I know the government is seeking not to do that, and the opposition will encourage them in that endeavour.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-05-13,"—The Foreign Evidence Act 1994 provides a means of adducing foreign material obtained through mutual assistance as evidence in Australian criminal and related proceedings. The Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 would streamline the process for adducing foreign evidence, particularly where that evidence is a business record. The bill as proposed to be amended by the government amendments would displace the operation of the rule against hearsay with respect to foreign business records—that is, foreign business records could be adduced even when the record contains hearsay evidence provided that the other evidentiary requirements in the particular jurisdiction are satisfied.
The amendments would also enable the court to examine foreign material and draw inferences from the material in order to establish the material as a business record that may be adduced and would remove a provision of the bill which would have given the court the discretion to limit the use to be made of foreign material. It will remove a provision of the bill which would have created a presumption that foreign material complied with the testimony requirements in the Foreign Evidence Act and will make minor consequential amendments to the application provision. This would assist in relation to complex prosecutions involving the use of evidence obtained overseas, including investigations into people smuggling and associated conduct such as the provision of material support and laundering the proceeds of criminal activity. With those short words, I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FOREIGN EVIDENCE AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-05-13,"—by leave—The Foreign Evidence Amendment Bill 2008 has quite a history. As originally drafted, the amendments proposed by the bill provide that business records obtained through mutual assistance will be presumed to be admissible unless the court is satisfied that the records are not reliable or probative, or are privileged. In addition, there are measures to provide for testimony to be admitted in Australian courts although the law in the country where the evidence was taken does not require such evidence to be given on oath or affirmation, or under caution, provided that there is an obligation to tell the truth.
The opposition’s consultations revealed some significant concerns about the practical effect of the bill. The following shortcomings were identified. Firstly, subclause 24(4) of the bill provides for material obtained as a result of a mutual assistance request to be adduced as evidence if it ‘appears to consist of a business record’. This is a departure from established principles of evidence, which require the party seeking to rely upon the material to establish that it is in fact a business record. In effect, this reverses the onus of proof and requires the accused to establish that the material is not a business record.
Secondly, the regime introduces a broad judicial discretion as to admissibility of foreign material, at the expense of the ordinary rules governing the admissibility of evidence. Thirdly, subclauses 24(5) and (6) provide that, once foreign material has been adduced, the material will be admissible despite any other rule of evidence. Exclusionary rules of evidence—for example, the rules as to opinion, tendency or hearsay evidence—will not be available as a safeguard. Fourthly, foreign testimony is presumed to comply with local rules as to an obligation to tell the truth unless evidence sufficient to raise a doubt to the contrary is adduced. This reverses the usual onus of proof on that issue as well. Fifthly, the bill has a retrospective operation—that is, it would, if enacted, apply to proceedings currently on foot. Rules of evidence are considered procedural rather than substantive and therefore the presumption against retrospectivity does not apply.
The effect of the bill, therefore, could be to expose Australian litigants to liabilities on the footing of evidence of a standard inferior to that which would be required by an Australian court. Accordingly, the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. At those hearings, both the Law Council of Australia, represented by some very senior practitioners including Mr David Russell QC, and civil liberties groups raised similar concerns. The committee reported on 10 March. The opposition members of the committee recommended that the bill not be passed in its existing form. The government’s response has been amendments which were circulated in the Senate in August last year, although it has taken until today for the Senate to consider them.
The amendments significantly truncate the bill. They provide that, once the court has determined that foreign material consists of a business record, it will be admissible despite the hearsay rule. Business records are an exception to the hearsay rule under the Commonwealth Evidence Act and, as far I can determine, in most other Australian jurisdictions. It therefore would not seem to make any substantive change to the law, other than to make specific provision for evidence that has been obtained from a foreign source under a mutual cooperation agreement. In those circumstances, in its amended form, the coalition is now in a position to support the bill.
In closing, I would like to record my thanks to those whom I have consulted in relation to this dense though, to us lawyers, intensely fascinating subject—in particular, Mr Russell QC and Robin Speed and Daniel Appleby of Speed and Stracey Lawyers, who were instrumental in identifying the practical shortcomings of the bill in its original form, as well as Mr Odgers SC and Ms Sarah Moulds of the Law Council of Australia, who provided such valuable evidence to the committee.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-05-13,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that, with the amendments that have been foreshadowed to us by the Special Minister of State and Cabinet Secretary—and in particular foreshadowed in the minister’s letter to me of the week before last—the opposition is in a position to and does support the Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010 and the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010. The story of how we came to this position is a long and in many ways sorry one. What in its original form was represented as a considerable enhancement to the freedom of information laws of Australia—laws which I might say were introduced originally by a Liberal Attorney-General, the late Senator Peter Durack, during the Fraser government—in fact, under close scrutiny, appeared to be a very severe curtailment of freedom of information in this country. When these bills were referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee, that committee discovered in particular a proposal to remove the reversal of the onus of proof provided for in section 61 of the Freedom of Information Act so as to cast the onus of proof upon an applicant rather than upon a minister or the minister’s delegate seeking to defend a decision to refuse to disclose information.
To understand why this is such an important issue, it is important to appreciate this. Freedom of information laws operate on the assumption that, unless cause is shown by government why information ought to be withheld from a citizen, the information should be available to the citizen. There are perfectly appropriate exceptions made to that principle, the most obvious of which of course is in relation to national security. There are others as well, including protection of other people’s privacy, protection of commercial-in-confidence information and so on. If a refusal of an application under the Freedom of Information Act occurs then the applicant—that is, the citizen seeking the availability of the information—has a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It has always been the case that a party seeking to overturn an adverse decision or a refusal by the minister has had the benefit of a reverse onus. That is what section 61 of the act provided. That has always been uncontroversial.
I have taken the trouble of going as far back as to look at the original report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs of November 1979, which reported on the first iteration of the Freedom of Information Act—that is, the Freedom of Information Bill 1978. I discovered that, from the very first occasion that freedom of information legislation was introduced into this chamber, it has been uncontroversial that a citizen who is faced with the refusal of an access request and wishes to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to overturn that refusal enjoys a reverse onus—that is, before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal it remains for the government, for the minister or his delegate, to justify the refusal to grant access to the citizen.
There is a very important reason why that should be so. Once an application for access to a document is refused, the applicant has no way of testing whether or not the appropriate criteria and statutory tests have been observed by the decision maker who was responsible for the refusal. How on earth is an applicant appealing to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to be in a position even so much as to mount an argument as to why the decision about refusal of access to a document was wrong when ex hypothesi they cannot have the document themselves? They would not be able in any conceivable set of circumstances to discharge an onus of proof that lay upon them to show why the decision was wrong. In the words used by coalition senators in their dissenting report following the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee’s hearing:
The government, the decision maker, the minister or his delegate have a monopoly of information, so the practical effect of removing the reverse onus in section 61 of the act would be to make any decision to refuse access for all intents and purposes unchallengeable on appeal.
Yet in their original form that is what these bills sought to do. Under cover of a lot of rhetoric about reforming and expanding freedom of information laws, what the Rudd government was originally planning to do in these bills was to remove the reverse onus in section 61 so as to make any refusal of access to a document practically unchallengeable. It would have been the greatest reversal of freedom of information practice in the history of the Freedom of Information Act. Astonishingly and to the very great discredit of those responsible for the preparation of the bills and their presentation to the Senate committee, this fundamental change—this extremely significant and deleterious change to section 61 of the act—was in fact included in a schedule presented to the Senate committee as a miscellaneous technical amendment.
Just think about that. Dwell and reflect for a moment on the supreme irony that, in a bill which falsely claimed to be expanding and reforming the freedom of information regime, an amendment which would have set back the regime to make it practically unworkable was itself concealed from the Senate committee by being treated as a technical minor amendment. That is hardly freedom of information; a conspiracy to conceal highly material information from the Senate committee would be a better description. Nevertheless, due to the industry of coalition senators and, in particular, Senator Scott Ryan, this anomaly was discovered and highlighted.
A number of witnesses before the Senate committee who were deeply experienced in freedom of information practice dwelt upon the effects of the removal of the reverse onus in section 61. One of those witnesses was Mr Mark Robinson, who appeared on behalf of the Law Council of Australia. Mr Robinson is one of Australia’s most experienced freedom of information practitioners, having appeared in hundreds of applications both for and against governments and, in the course of 17 years, having sat as a judicial officer hearing applications under the New South Wales Freedom of Information Act and, in fact, having been the draftsman of the New South Wales Freedom of Information Act.
In response to an assertion on behalf of the government that the removal of the reverse onus of proof in section 61 would have no practical effect on the operation of the act, this is what Mr Robinson had to tell the committee:
It is an irrelevant assertion. I say this because the applicant does not normally know what document it is that he or she is seeking, and he or she does not normally know what it contains. They may think they do but they may be wrong. And how can an applicant meaningfully assist the tribunal by presenting his or her case first and by bearing the onus of proving something? You only have to think about it logically, I submit. As an applicant I can stand up and say: ‘I put an FOI application in. I don’t have to tell you why I did it, because that’s irrelevant. I don’t have to tell you who I am, because that’s irrelevant. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with the document when I get it, because that’s often irrelevant—and I want the document.’ And I sit down. Now, how is that possibly going to discharge the onus of proof? It puts an applicant in an impossible position, both practically and as a matter of fairness, and as a matter of law. On one view of it, that onus could never be discharged, ever.
I put to Mr Robinson the proposition that:
… it is almost impossible to imagine how an applicant could succeed if he bears the onus of proof since he has no means of knowing what is in the document.
When I asked him whether he agreed with that proposition, Mr Robinson said:
Absolutely …
He went on to say that the impact of the government’s proposal to withdraw the reverse onus of proof in section 61 would be to undermine the Freedom of Information Act. He went on to say:
The most stark way to appreciate this is to accept that, in most FOI cases since the beginning of the FOI Act, in the AAT the Commonwealth goes first. The Commonwealth agency has presented its case first in every case I have been involved in and in almost every case that I am aware of … third parties who want to preserve their trade secrets may sometimes come in. They are called reverse FOI applications by other people. The situation is different there, but in the ordinary FOI case of an FOI applicant wanting a document from the Commonwealth the Commonwealth goes first. This will change that.
I asked Mr Robinson whether he agreed that the effect of section 61 was at variance with the declaration of intent in the objects clause of the bill that it would expand access to information. Mr Robinson said that, yes, he did. In response to questions from Senator Scott Ryan, Professor Spencer Zifcak, the Vice-President of Liberty Victoria, also expressed concern that the removal of the onus of proof would, for all practical purposes, undermine the operation of the FOI Act.
Government senators in their majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs thought that they had reached a halfway point by suggesting that perhaps there could be no onus of proof provision in the amended act. But, of course, that does not meet the objection. An applicant for information under the FOI Act, faced with a situation in which a monopoly of knowledge is possessed by those who have refused an access application, is in no better position if there is no onus of proof than if the onus of proof lies upon them. The only way that FOI practice can be observed is if the onus of proof—the onus of upholding the refusal to provide information, in other words—lies on the decision maker—that is, the minister or their delegate because only they, as I have said in my remarks, are in a position to know what is in the document whose disclosure they are resisting.
I am pleased to say that at long last the minister, Senator Ludwig, saw the sense in what the opposition was saying and saw the sense in what was contained in the coalition senators’ minority report. In a letter which he directed to me the week before last Senator Ludwig capitulated on the issue of onus of proof just as the government capitulated on a number of other issues which will form the government amendments which are about to be moved by the minister. It is for that reason that the opposition now find ourselves in a position in which we are able to support this legislation. We support its intent; we support the other aspects of the legislation which I have not dwelt upon in these remarks. The only reason this legislation has now become uncontroversial is that the government capitulated to the opposition. The government was found out in trying to slip past the Senate and a Senate committee, under the ruse that it was a technical amendment only, a proposal which would have rendered unworkable the entire scheme of Australia’s freedom of information legislation.
There is so much heroic rhetoric from the Rudd government. This is yet another example of the total disconnect between the heroic rhetoric of the Rudd government and the reality of its very nasty and deceptive political practice. On this occasion, as on so many other occasions, the Rudd government has been found out. It has backed down from its attempt to distort and set back Australia’s freedom of information laws. I particularly want to thank Senator Scott Ryan for his efforts in revealing this attempt to get what would have been a very, very deleterious amendment past the scrutiny of the Senate. In the form in which it will now be amended, the opposition is in a position to support the legislation.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN INFORMATION COMMISSIONER BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-05-13,"—The Australian Greens welcome the Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010 and the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010 and congratulate the government on having taken these important steps towards greater openness in government. I would like to add my remarks to those of Senator Brandis on the issue of onus of proof. He put it probably more eloquently and at greater length than I was going to, but those concerns were certainly shared by the Australian Greens. I suppose in this instance the government is to be commended for at least acknowledging, under the weight of overwhelming evidence, that it was wrong rather than, as we see so many times in this place, simply just pushing ahead. As a result this legislation, while very significant, is now being debated as noncontroversial.
Information is central to knowing how our elected representatives are exercising their power and to hold our representatives to account. The Greens believe that open and transparent government is a prerequisite to an effective democracy. We welcome the government’s commitment to a pro-disclosure culture and a restoration of open and transparent government. We also look forward to the review of the fees and charges because very significant concerns were raised in the committee process about the interaction between processing charges and application fees. We urge the government to bear in mind that the costs of fees and charges should not be prohibitive for the kind of freedom of information requests that agencies normally deal with. Access to information for an individual or an organisation should not be determined by their ability to pay, as such fees and charges need to be set at a reasonable level. We also look forward to developments in the application of freedom of information to parliamentary departments and would appreciate being kept informed of any progress in this area—it was set aside from consideration in these bills.
Senators will probably already be aware that we have a number of amendments that we will seek to move when we shift into the committee stage. I will briefly foreshadow them now. I do not propose to tie up the chamber for too long when we get to discussion of those amendments. I would firstly say, as is so often the case with this government and, I suppose, with the previous government, that this is a package of generally good legislation that the Australian Greens support. We concur that it will improve transparency and accountability of government departments and of course for that reason we are supporting it. But there is always a catch. There is always a poison pill, and in the case of this particular legislation it is quite a serious one—that the government has proposed to shroud intelligence and security agencies entirely from the reach of the Freedom of Information Act. The minister will be aware that I raised these issues when we debated a less comprehensive FOI bill earlier. Those issues remain. They have not changed, and the government is persisting with this idea that existing public interest immunity grounds are not sufficient for some reason—and we have never heard a justification for why not—and that in fact the administrative decisions of agencies, or the amount of paper clips that they are ordering, should be permanently beyond the reach of freedom of information legislation.
So the amendments that we will move seek to remove the current exemption from the FOI Act granted to intelligence agencies. We believe that the scope of exemptions from the act are central to the act’s effectiveness and we do not believe that simply because a document originated in a security agency it automatically has implications for national security and should therefore receive automatic and whole exemption from the Freedom of Information Act. If the Greens amendments succeed, security and intelligence agencies will still have the entirely legitimate right to prevent material from being released through FOI application processes under the normal grounds that they use today, including issues of national security, issues of operational secrecy and the kinds of legitimate public interest exemptions that, throughout a long history of convention in the Australian Senate, have been allowed as legitimate reasons for these agencies to withhold information. We are not proposing that those exemptions lapse or that they should no longer apply, simply that it is at best lazy drafting to simply exempt these agencies from freedom of information entirely. So our amendments go to that effect.
The second part of our amendments provides guidance for a review of this situation which is profoundly unsatisfactory to the Australian Greens. We propose that this review should take place after the act has been in operation for two years to ensure that it properly addresses the Greens concerns about wholesale exemptions from the act, particularly in respect to intelligence agencies. I will be interested to hear the minister’s remarks before we close the second reading debate on that issue specifically, in expectation that the minister may give us some commitments in this regard. In fact a two-year review is a pretty poor substitute for good public policy which would surely have allowed that security and intelligence agencies should not be beyond the reach of an instrument as important as freedom of information. In fact, these are precisely the kinds of agencies for which oversight by the public and by the parliament is more important than ever.  I will make a couple of other concluding remarks when we move to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN INFORMATION COMMISSIONER BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second reading</title>,Bills,31,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2010-05-13,"—I thank the opposition, the Greens and Senators Xenophon and Fielding for their support for early passage of this legislation through the Senate, and I also thank those senators who participated in the inquiry by the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee.
The Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2010, together with the Australian Information Commissioner Bill 2010 is, after all, concerned with significantly enhancing openness in government. The Rudd government has undertaken the first overhaul of the FOI Act since it was enacted in 1982, nearly 30 years ago. The passage of the FOI Act was a milestone for Australia. The Rudd government continues to recognise that we are responsible and accountable to the people we serve. For this reason, when we were in opposition we committed to overhauling the FOI Act and we have delivered on this promise. This legislation expressly recognises that giving the Australian community access to government-held information strengthens Australia’s representative democracy, recognises the role that this object serves to increase public participation in government processes and increases accountability in the government’s activities.
The Australian Information Commissioner Bill will also establish the first independent model to oversight FOI administration. Many of the reforms within that model, which provide for a framework for agency driven proactive publication of government information together with the single public interest test, are contained within these two bills, but this does not mark the end of the government’s commitment to ensuring an effective FOI regime and that the amended FOI Act meets the government’s object of enhancing openness provisions made in the Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Bill 2009 and in the Australian Information Commissioner Bill. A full review will be undertaken of the operation of the legislation two years from the commencement of the reform measures. These bills comprise the strongest package of measures to enhance public access to government-held information that this chamber has seen in nearly 30 years.
In foreshadowing an issue that the Greens have raised in relation to the review which I just mentioned, I have included a statement in the second reading speech in order to address the concerns raised by the Australian Greens. The review will also need to include a consideration of whether the exclusion of agencies, including intelligence agencies, from the application of the act is still appropriate and necessary. Naturally such a consideration would require reference to international practice and consideration of what is in Australia’s public interest. The government would be opposed to the first foreshadowed amendment. We think that second part, both in the second reading statement and with my statement on Hansard, goes some way to addressing the Greens issue. I know it does not go all the way, but I accept that this is a matter that the Greens take very seriously. In this instance, the government’s position is quite clear. We have articulated that we have got to what we consider to be an appropriate balance in this legislation.
Finally, the establishment of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner underpins the government’s objective to revitalise the FOI Act and also lays a stronger foundation for privacy protection and improvements in the broader management of government information.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2010-05-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research (Senator Carr) to questions without notice asked by Senators Colbeck and Williams today relating to the proposed tax on the mining industry.
There is really only one constant in the debate surrounding this great big new super resource tax by the Rudd government, and that one constant is that the Prime Minister, in promulgating and advancing this tax, has not been honest with the Australian people. Further to that, he has absolutely no understanding of the mining industry.
This government, right around Australia, are on the nose with the electorate. After 2½ years, they find themselves in a most perilous position. Everybody on this side of the chamber senses it. There are baseball bats waiting for these Labor candidates in the next federal election, particularly in my home state of Western Australia. The workers, the shareholders, the fund managers, the airlines and the indirect industries maintaining equipment, supplying equipment and providing transport—all those support industries—are all waiting with baseball bats for these Labor candidates.
This Prime Minister has not been honest. These ministers have not been honest. They are advancing that this tax is like the petroleum resource rent tax. What an absolute disgrace! It is a misrepresentation—and, quite frankly, it is unworthy of them holding a position in this chamber. The petroleum resource rent tax is six per cent plus five per cent plus depreciation and there is a delayed timeline before it kicks in. This Rudd government’s crazy super tax on the mining industry of this country starts straightaway—it is almost retrospective. The Prime Minister knows that. Minister Carr knows that. Minister Sherry knows that. Why would they seek to mislead people? Why would they seek to try to fudge it?
This tax is a thought bubble from this Prime Minister when he could not get his emissions trading scheme through. He has had to fill a deep hole in his budget forward estimates and he has thought, ‘Where can I go that has some revenue, some cash? I will go to the miners.’ This tax is on top of state royalties—unlike the petroleum resource rent tax. Why would you misrepresent that? Why would you be dishonest about that? This tax is for existing mines, as has been established. Why would you misrepresent that it is like the petroleum resource rent tax? It is totally different.
Mum and dad shareholders who have invested good money through their own super funds or through their own cash in mining companies onshore—as we would want them to do to support our own people—have had the goalposts moved. Our sovereign risk is now looking absolutely trashed on world markets. The dishonesty has been exampled by Senator Conroy and finance minister Tanner, when talking about the National Broadband Network, in saying that the whole scheme would return a modest six or seven per cent—yet for miners, six per cent is a super profit! Coalmining in Queensland and in New South Wales is clearly for the chop. Electricity prices in Victoria are going to go through the roof when the value of coal put into the boilers is actually deemed a super profit. The mining companies of this country commit company tax, state royalties, native title payments, payroll tax and superannuation to the national good. This tax is going to take them up to about 60 per cent.
I say again: there are baseball bats waiting for these Labor ministers. State member McTiernan—running against our candidate Randall in the seat of Canning—has been begging Joe Bullock to go to Hasluck. She has seen the polling and said, ‘Get me out of this; I do not want not to go down the gurgler.’ We have heard nothing in Western Australia about health, given the Prime Minister’s grandiose spendathon on health. But I would also say that none of the other states have heard anything about health. There is no detail. There is nothing. There is just a doorstop and no delivery. There is a doorstop from this Prime Minister and no delivery. You have heard this from me first: it is bye-bye Gary Gray; it is bye-bye Stephen Smith; and it is bye-bye Glenn Sterle.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,35,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-05-13,"—I appreciate the forward warning that seems to be coming from the other side. I think it is much more tainted with optimism and hope about what will occur rather than any general advantage. Nonetheless, this tax is about having a fair taxation system in our country. This is an area which is looking at a fair contribution. That is all that is being asked. We are looking at profits that are super profits and we are looking at getting a fair return on the resources of our country.
What is not surprising—and we are absolutely prepared for it because we have seen it over generations—is that whenever there is the introduction of a new tax there are the grim forebodings of the future and the outrageous statements about what will happen. We will hear that the sky will come tumbling down and the quarries will be filled in. What we are talking about is ensuring that in this country there should be a fair return to this country and the people living in the community for the resources with which we know we are deeply blessed with. We are not asking anything more than that. What we are talking about is that people are part of it.
We hear about the fact that there is no knowledge of the industry but the industry is involved in the process. We have a situation where now, after due process, the government makes a budget decision and decides that this is one way of taxation for our community. It is not an unusual process. It is one that has been used by many governments over many years. The Treasurer and the industry are going to set up a process where the detail will be worked out and where people can be engaged in the area so that it will not be imposed on them arbitrarily.
Companies that are making profits out of the mining industry in this country will have clarity about the tax they will pay and they will have clarity about what constitutes royalties and what does not. We consistently hear about this confusion. The process will be that the new tax will be introduced; no one has hidden from that. There is almost a proposal that this is a hidden tax—it is not. It has been clearly put forward. There is one industry that will be affected and the process will be there to work out and clarify these details.
I certainly heard the minister say on a number of occasions in answers to questions today that the KPMG modelling was looking at what this would bring into the country in the future: it would help the mining industry; it would help our community. Some of the profits that will be coming out of this taxation will be reinvested into important things in the community, such as the infrastructure processes. It is very important to the regions about which we are speaking, and to the regions I look after in Queensland, that they have absolute assurance about the road process and the improvement in rail. I know that my comrade Senator Hutchins will be concentrating on this area.
—Yeah, ‘comrade’ is right.
—He is absolutely always a comrade. We have never been afraid of that term. We do not see it as a difficulty. We see it as something that we use quite openly. We are following through on the ongoing aspects. The people on the other side will continue to cry gloom and doom as they always do—it does not matter what initiative comes up or what proposal comes up in the budget—and they will be beating their hearts while saying that this is something that will destroy the economy.
We are hoping that we will be able to move forward through this quite fair process and have an actual engagement with the community when looking at how profits can be effectively reinvested into our community. It is a fair aspect of taxation and a fair understanding of responsibility. The actual income that comes from this reinvestment will benefit the whole community. It will not be just sent overseas or taken into some other area but it will be reinvested into the areas which share in the profits of our community. It is a fair process. It is not dishonest. It is not hidden. It is something that will take us from 2012 onwards.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,35,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-05-13,"—It is very interesting today—I have been trying to work out where Mr Rudd got this idea from. It has fascinated me to find out where Mr Rudd got this idea from. Now I have found it. I looked up ‘Hugo Chavez’ and I found that in Caracas in Venezuela on 27 February 2007 it was reported that Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez signed a decree to nationalise the oil industry—the sixth-largest in the world. The decree allowed Venezuela’s state oil company to take a 60 per cent stake in the oil industry at the time. It seems surprising that the tax that will now be on Australian miners is 58 per cent. He is out by two per cent but he has arrived there. The article goes on to quote Chavez:
The privatization of the oil sector to overseas companies in the 1990s was ‘disgraceful,’ said left-wing populist Chavez at the signing ceremony in Caracas… ‘The privatization of oil is over,’ Chavez said. ‘This is the last space that was left for us to recuperate’…
So well might you call your friends ‘comrade’, Senator Moore, because comrades they obviously are. This is the most bizarre piece of politics that has happened to Australia for so long—the nationalisation of the mining industry. That is exactly what you have done. You are taking 40 per cent of the profits, putting the corporate rate of tax on the remainder and you are absorbing 40 per cent of the losses. You have nationalised them to exactly the same extent—bar two per cent—that Hugo Chavez did in South America. Is that where our nation has now been delivered? It is not Henry’s view. This is something that comes from the peculiarity of the Labor Party.
So well may they call themselves ‘comrades’, because comrades they certainly are and that is exactly what we have here. Australia went down this path briefly—a bit of insanity back in 1949—when Labor decided to nationalise the banking industry, but we thought we had moved on from that. But the man who dwells at the philosophical brothel of ideas, our dear Prime Minister, had to try to endear himself back to the left wing after he completely deserted them over the ETS—after he left them behind. He tried to recant from it on The 7.30 Report last night but, because he had to try to endear himself back to the left wing, he came up with one of the nuttiest policies that this nation has ever seen. It is startling that I can read something about Hugo Chavez and see awful similarities to exactly where our nation has gone now.
They say that nothing is going to change. We have already heard Tom Albanese saying they are shutting down projects. In my state of Queensland, as we speak, they are reassessing projects. They are shutting down projects; people’s jobs are threatened. You have given up on the people of Dawson and you will lose the seat of Dawson. You have given up on the people of Flynn and you will lose the seat of Flynn. The fly-in, fly-out workers in Leichhardt are not going to vote for you. This is something that is absolutely peculiar.
Then we had one of the most pathetic performances I have ever seen by a minister in this chamber when Minister Kim Carr had to turn around on a question and on microphone say, ‘Has anybody got anything on that?’ For one of his answers, he had to turn around and ask, ‘Has anybody got anything on this?’ Why? It is because this policy has risen up from hell and it has arrived on their desks and there it is. They do not care. They are quite happy with this ad hoc approach.
They completely and utterly burn Minister Wong and they have treated her like an oily rag. Why? It was because it was convenient. At the philosophical brothel, the dispensation of virtues comes at random. As long as the price of popularity is right, you can do what you like. Now will come the reshuffle. Now we have the nationalisation of the mining industry—our major exporter. That you would take our nation to this position is perverse. If that is what we have to come in this nation under the guidance of the Labor Party, it is perverse. It will put up the price of bricks, it will put up the price of quarrying, it will put up the price of cement and it will be part and parcel of you driving our nation into the dirt.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,35,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2010-05-13,"—And the sky will fall in. Maybe I should just remind the opposition that in this tax we are referring to the resources of this country. They do not belong to BHP; they do not belong to your paymaster Clive what’s-his-name Palmer. They do not belong to Tom Albanese; they belong to the Australian people. This tax has been discussed by a number of people over some time. I might run a guess who. First of all, just guess who—

Senator Abetz interjecting—

—That is right, Senator Abetz: guess who. We are talking about increasing the taxation on resources that are owned by this country. On 25 February this year in a parliament on the other side of the country—in fact Senator Johnston’s parliament—there was a question asked in relation to what discussions had been underway in relation to royalties. In relation to the royalties increase, guess who said this:
The mining companies are aware of it, and some of them have expressed their views. I have to say that a few people who work around the mining industry came to me over summer and said,—
and I am going to have to give it away now—
‘By the way, Colin, the mining companies are getting away with murder, they’re not paying enough.’ A number of people working in the mining industry have said that to me.
As I said I did give it away—it was the Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Mr Colin Barnett. That was what Mr Barnett said. Let me just tell you what the independent assessment of the government’s resource rent tax by KPMG said. This is what they have published and you can see it if you wish to, Senator Abetz. They said:
Introducing the new tax modelled as a resource rent tax has zero economic costs. Further, effectively abolishing the crude oil excise and state royalties leads to an economic gain because it encourages activity in the mining sector. Further, the cut in the company tax rate stimulates investment across the whole economy also relating to economic gain.
They further went on:
It will increase GDP by 0.7 per cent and increase employment in those industries.
You have the courage, Senator Abetz, when the budget comes in to the Senate, to vote against it, because we have made it very clear that three things are going to be attached to that resource rent tax. The first is infrastructure, the second is relief to small companies and the third is in relation to increasing the superannuation contributions. Do you have the courage to vote against that?
As my comrade Senator Moore said, you have been very optimistic about these things. You go and tell people in the budget that there was $4.2 billion put forward for road projects over 2010-11. Let me just go through a few of them. There is the Hunter Expressway, New South Wales; the Kempsey bypass, New South Wales; and the Sapphire to Woolgoolga project, New South Wales. In Queensland there is the Cardwell Range realignment. In Victoria there is the Kings Road interchange and the duplication from Waurn Ponds to Winchelsea. In Western Australia there are four projects and there is one in South Australia. Of that money, the government is going to put forward $59.5 million to eliminate 320 road black spots over the next year.
Then we can go on to a number of other things, particularly the magnificent investment that is going to occur in rail over the next few years to fix up 10,000 kilometres of track and to make sure that there are a further 235 kilometres constructed and that 3,771 kilometres will be upgraded. That is what you have to risk when you vote against it. (Time expired)

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2010-05-13,"—What Comrade Hutchins and Comrade Moore, the self-declared comrades over there, are suggesting is that they realise Tuesday night’s budget was built on a house of cards and that this resource mining tax is the only way in which they are going to bankroll what they need to undertake in the next 12 months.
—Our resources!
—They are not your resources; they are the resources of all Australians, who have been and who are the recipients of the benefit of the mining boom over the last few years.
Senator Fielding has already indicated that he is not likely to support such an irresponsible and knee-jerk measure, and neither will this coalition be as irresponsible as you are. The Rudd government resource mining tax is nothing more than the Labor government’s desperate search to feed its spending addiction. That is all we have seen for the last two years. The amount of waste is criminal. In case those senators opposite are wondering why my colleagues and I get so upset about their needless spending, it is because it is because it is hard-earned taxpayers’ money that they are spending in such a fraudulent and outrageous way. It is money provided by hardworking mums and dads who are under increasing pressure to make ends meet. Labor has wasted billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money over the last two years and we know they cannot be trusted with the public purse.
For the benefit of the chamber, let me remind you of the litany of this waste. Labor promised computers in schools for every year 9 to 12 student. So far, only 220,000 of the one million computers promised have actually been delivered, and I might add that the budget blew out by $1 billion. They promised to cut spending on consultancies, but what did they do? They broke their promise and instead have awarded another $1.1 billion in consultancy contracts since coming to office. They promised broadband for a mere $4.7 billion, but broke that promise and replaced it with a $43 billion plan. In the process they wasted $20 million on a cancelled tender process and spent $25 million on another report by consultants.
They claimed to have all the answers on climate change and the environment. We know that in the Prime Minister’s own words he described it as ‘the moral challenge of our times’. But they have squibbed on the ETS, wasting hundreds of millions of dollars in the process to date. We have seen $50 million spent on climate change advertising and paid 150 public servants to administer the ETS. We saw 68 delegates sent to Copenhagen at $1.5 million, the solar panel blow-out of $850 million and the Green Loans Program cancelled after $175 million was spent. The list just goes on and on. They promised to cut the cost of living but we have seen that prices have continued to rise. And we have seen the millions wasted on the abandoned GROCERYchoice and Fuelwatch programs. Labor continues to struggle on basic sums, but one equation is very simple: that is that waste increases debt and puts upward pressure on interest rates. When Kevin Rudd makes promises at this year’s election, we know that his track record says he will fail to deliver and will waste significant amounts of taxpayer money in the process. Australia cannot afford three more years of Labor’s waste and mismanagement.
In conclusion, it is clear that this government is desperate to find money to pad its spending splurge. It has turned its sights on the tobacco industry and turned its sights on the mining sector, and, in the shadow Treasurer’s words, ‘This is a tax on hope,’ and on the future of all Australians.

Government Response


Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission Report


Review of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002


Recommendation 1:  The Committee recommends that the Attorney General’s Department and the Australian Crime Commission develop legislation as a matter of urgency to ensure that a person summonsed by the ACC, at a time when they are the subject of criminal or confiscation proceedings, may only be examined in relation to matters quarantined from those material to the pending proceedings.

Accepted

The Government agrees that it is appropriate to develop legislation to ensure a person subject to criminal proceedings is not able to be examined in relation to matters material to the pending proceedings.  The Government notes that this issue is the subject of a current appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia following the Federal Court’s decision in OK v Australian Crime Commission. 

Recommendation 2:  The Committee recommends that both the summons and the memorandum be revised to ensure that as far as possible, recipients understand what is required of them, and that procedures allowing adjournments for the purpose of seeking legal advice be included in the ACC’s examination practice.

Accepted and completed


Recommendation 3:  The Committee recommends that the ACC develop without delay, a practice and procedure manual for the benefit of practitioners and those summoned for examination or to produce documents.

Accepted and completed


Recommendation 4:  The Committee recommends that the ACC in consultation with the Attorney General’s Department identify barriers to information sharing, and where regulatory or legislative remedies are necessary these be developed and implemented.

Accepted

Continued information sharing is vital to the effectiveness of the intelligence function and the success of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC).  Steps have been taken to ensure the ACC can share information with appropriate government agencies by prescribing a list of agencies and amending the Australian Crime Commission Regulations 2002.  Further consideration may be given to information sharing with the private sector.
The Government notes that this recommendation was made in the context of information sharing between the ACC and non-police government agencies.  At the time of the Committee’s review, a Federal Court decision prevented the ACC from disseminating information to Commonwealth agencies that were not a police force unless they were prescribed by regulation under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (ACC Act).  In response to this decision, which has since been overturned by the Full Federal Court, regulations have been made facilitating information sharing between the ACC and other relevant government agencies. 

Recommendation 5:  The Committee recommends that the ACC consider statutory proposals to amend the ACC Act to provide categories of ACC officers with the necessary identified powers, including such matters as the powers to apply for or execute a warrant, and the right to carry a firearm.  These should replace the current system of the use of Australian Federal Police special constable provisions.

Not Accepted

The secondment of State and Territory police and access to Australian Federal Police (AFP) special member status for some ACC staff enables the ACC to carry out its functions. The Government recognises that further consideration of providing the ACC with enforcement powers may be necessary in the future.

Recommendation 6:  The Committee recommends that the ACC Act be amended to provide for the appointment of the Commissioner of Taxation to the ACC Board.

Accepted

The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act No. 2 2010 amended the ACC Act to include the Commissioner of Taxation as a member of the ACC Board.

Recommendation 7:  The Committee recommends that formal arrangements be instituted to confirm the current practice of reporting allegations of misconduct to relevant accountability organisations, including the PJC, the IGC, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and the proposed Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.

Accepted

The ACC has well established processes for communicating with the Commonwealth Ombudsman on complaints against the ACC or members of its staff relating to serious matters of alleged misconduct or corruption.  Processes for reporting of matters to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) are contained in the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 (the LEIC Act).  The Government does not consider it appropriate for formal mechanisms to be put in place for allegations of misconduct to be reported to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission (PJC-ACC) or Inter-Governmental Committee of the Australian Crime Commission.

Recommendation 8:  The Committee recommends that formal arrangements be put in place to require the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to notify the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and the proposed Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity of any allegations of misconduct by officers of the ACC.

Accepted

The ACC has well established processes for communicating with the Commonwealth Ombudsman on complaints against the ACC or members of its staff relating to serious matters of alleged misconduct or corruption.  Processes for reporting of matters to ACLEI are contained in the LEIC Act.  The Government does not consider that separate formal arrangements are required in relation to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.

Recommendation 9:  The Committee recommends that the CEO of the ACC direct, in the ACC Policy and Procedures, that in any case where the ACC procedurally has a choice of regulatory regime for the use of investigatory powers, it adopts as a matter of practice, the Commonwealth protocols.

Not Accepted

The ACC works in close collaboration with States and Territories on various investigations and it may be more appropriate for the ACC to pursue other regimes and protocols than those of the Commonwealth to meet operational requirements.

Recommendation 10:  The Committee recommends that section 55AA of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended to broaden the scope of the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s briefing to the PJC to include any matter relating to the operations of the ACC.

Noted

The Government will give further consideration to the issues raised in this recommendation as part of a proposal to improve the operation and accountability of the ACC’s powers.

Recommendation 11:  The Committee recommends that the ACC Act 2002 be amended to provide explicit requirements to Board agencies to provide enumerated classes of information to the PJC on the ACC.

Not Accepted

The Government considers that it would be inappropriate to legislate to require State and Territory government agencies to provide information to a Commonwealth Parliamentary Committee.  Such a requirement may conflict with legislation that those agencies currently operate under.  In addition, the Committee noted that in most cases agencies cooperate with the PJC-ACC to provide the required information.

Recommendation 12:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity Bill, when introduced, include provisions that provide for scrutiny of the agency’s operations by this Committee.

Not Accepted

The effective oversight of the ACC would be compromised if the Committee charged with scrutinising its activities also had responsibility for scrutinising the activities of ACLEI, a body charged itself with scrutinising specific aspects of the ACC.
The LEIC Act commenced operation on 30 December 2006.  ACLEI is responsible for investigating allegations of corruption in the ACC and the AFP.  As such, the LEIC Act provides that a separate Parliamentary Joint Committee oversee its operations. 

Recommendation 13:  The Committee recommends that the Parliament create a new Parliamentary Joint Committee on Commonwealth Law Enforcement, with jurisdiction to supervise the operations of the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police and other Commonwealth law enforcement agencies.

Accepted

The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement Bill 2010 (the Bill) was introduced into Parliament on 18 March 2010, and is currently being considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.  An exposure draft of the Bill was circulated with the Discussion Paper on proposed legislative reforms to Australia’s counter-terrorism and national security legislation which was released on 12 August 2009.

Recommendation 14:  The Committee recommends that the legislation for the creation of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity includes provision for the Committee to refer matters to the Commission for investigation, with a requirement to report to the Committee on the results of such investigations. This ensures the completeness and effectiveness of arrangements for scrutinising the operations of agencies, and - were its jurisdiction expanded as recommended above - prevents the Committee’s workload from becoming too great for effective Parliamentary supervision of the relevant agencies.

Accepted-In-Principle

Under section 23 of the LEIC Act, a member of the PJC-ACC can refer
allegations of corruption in the ACC and AFP to the Integrity Commissioner for investigation either personally or on behalf of the PJC-ACC.  However, it should be noted that ACLEI’s role is not to undertake investigations on behalf of the PJC‑ACC. 
Under section 25 of the LEIC Act, a person making a referral may elect to be kept informed of the action taken by ACLEI in response to the referral.  For example, where the Integrity Commissioner decides to investigate a matter referred under section 23 and the person has elected to be kept informed in accordance with section 25, the Integrity Commissioner must take steps as the Integrity Commissioner considers reasonable to keep the person informed of the progress of the investigation of that corruption issue.  Further, in accordance with subsection 58(1), the Integrity Commissioner must also advise the person of the outcome of the investigation of the corruption issue.
It would not be appropriate for the PJC-ACC, charged with oversight of the ACC, to also scrutinise ACLEI’s activities.

Recommendation 15:  The Committee recommends that where priority issues involving the ACC arise, the Commonwealth continue to grant funds on a ‘once-off basis’ when this occurs between budgetary cycles.

Noted

The Government will provide the ACC with tied funding for specific purposes subject to normal budgetary processes.

Recommendation 16:  The Committee recommends that the issue surrounding the employment of secondees be addressed as a priority.  Any review should address the standardisation of salary and working conditions through the development of a common secondment arrangement, as well as the implications of this system on the integrity and disciplinary framework.

Accepted

There have been attempts to introduce a common employment framework which have proven challenging due to the wide disparity in conditions in different jurisdictions.  Secondee arrangements were reviewed in August 2009 and the ACC intends to amend the arrangements so that secondees retain the salary and conditions of service applicable to their home jurisdiction.  This will provide the following benefits:
certainty on the use of relevant police powers when seconded
more flexibility in the timing of secondments and capacity to extend where required for operational purposes 
greater capacity to attract secondees to the ACC as they will not need to alter employment arrangements 
some state police officer conditions, particularly in relation to superannuation, are affected by the movement to leave without pay, and 
reduced administration the ACC due to the requirements around recruitment under the Public Service Act 1999 leading to more efficient recruitment and management.
Ongoing efforts will be made towards standardisation of salary and working conditions.  However, this is a complex matter that requires detailed consideration and consultation at Commonwealth, State and Territory government level.

Recommendation 17:  The Committee recommends that section 46B of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended to provide that the maximum number of examiners allowed to work with the Commission at any one time be limited to three.  The Committee also recommends that a further provision be inserted allowing the regulations to review and prescribe a higher number of examiners if and when the need arises.

Not Accepted

There are currently four examiners appointed under the ACC Act.  The Government is open to considering provision for part-time or short duration appointments to meet the operational cycles. While examiners may be appointed for a maximum of ten years, the Government considers that the ACC requires a degree of flexibility to stagger and overlap appointments to enable examination programs to continue effectively and efficiently and to maintain a high degree of examiner expertise.

Recommendation 18:  The Committee recommends that regulatory, or if necessary legislative changes be introduced to allow persons summonsed for an Examination to be eligible for legal aid from the legal aid commissions, subject to the usual means tests.

Not Accepted

The Attorney-General’s Department already provides assistance in ACC proceedings under section 27 of the ACC Act.  The Department also provides assistance to witnesses before other Australian Government bodies, royal commissions and other major inquiries under a range of other schemes.
It is not accepted that allowing legal aid commissions to provide assistance directly would be a ‘far more efficient procedure for representation than having to provide an application to a government department before even approaching a lawyer’ as stated in the report.  There would be little difference if the statutory scheme arrangements were administered by legal aid commissions rather than the Department.  Grants of aid from legal aid commissions are made for specific purposes and a lawyer would still need to make a separate application for a grant of aid for an appearance before the ACC, even if a grant of aid had previously been made for a related criminal matter.
The Attorney-General’s Department administers 26 statutory and non-statutory schemes of legal assistance and has demonstrated its capability of efficiently assessing applications for grants of assistance.  It is also noted that the ACC Act scheme gives rise to a relatively small number of applications (six applications were received in 2008–2009 and ten in 2007–2008), all of which are dealt with promptly. 
It is not correct to say that applicants must contact the Department before approaching a lawyer.  In the Department’s experience, most, if not all, applicants for assistance under the scheme have contacted a lawyer before applying for assistance.  In most cases this is a lawyer who has been assisting the applicant with matters related to the examination before the ACC.

Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission Report


Examination of the Annual Report for 2004-2005 of the Australian Crime Commission


Recommendation 1:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended to provide for the appointment of the Commissioner of Taxation to the ACC Board.

Accepted

The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act No. 2 2010 amended the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (the ACC Act) to include the Commissioner of Taxation as a member of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) Board.

Recommendation 2:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission consider the release of the public versions of key research, including a declassified version of the Picture of Criminality.

Accepted

The public version of the Picture of Criminality in Australia, Organised Crime in Australia was released on 16 January 2008.  An updated report was released on 25 February 2009.  It will be updated periodically to ensure its continued relevance to increasing the public’s awareness of the impacts of serious and organised crime on the community.

Recommendation 3:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended to prescribe the maximum number of examiners to be appointed.

Not Accepted

There are currently four examiners appointed under the ACC Act.  The Government is open to considering provision for part-time or short duration appointments to meet the operational cycles.  While examiners may be appointed for a maximum of ten years, the Government considers that the ACC requires a degree of flexibility to stagger and overlap appointments to enable examination programs to continue effectively and efficiently and to maintain a high degree of examiner expertise.

Recommendation 4:  The Committee recommends that the document ‘Public Information Statement: Examinations conducted under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002’ be provided to all witnesses and their legal representatives along with the summons to appear at an examination.

Accepted

Those who are served with a summons to appear and give evidence at an ACC examination are provided with an explanatory note which is annexed to each summons.  The explanatory memorandum provides specific information about the rights and obligations of examinees. The explanatory memorandum also refers to the Public Information Statement: Examinations Conducted under the ACC Act, which is available on the ACC website.  The Public Information Statement contains general and procedural information on the ACC examination process to assist witnesses, practitioners and examiners.

Recommendation 5:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission investigate the establishment of a common employment framework for secondees as a matter of priority.

Accepted

There have been attempts to introduce a common employment framework which have proven challenging due to the wide disparity in conditions in different jurisdictions.  Secondee arrangements were reviewed in August 2009 and the ACC intends to amend the arrangements so that secondees retain the salary and conditions of service applicable to their home jurisdiction.  This will provide the following benefits:

Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission Report


Inquiry into the manufacture, importation and use of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD) in Australia


Recommendation 1:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Government and the States, the Territories and their agencies standardise the terms being used to describe amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD), particularly for research and statistical purposes.

Accepted

The Government recognises the importance of standardising drug terminology, particularly for research and statistical purposes.
Efforts have already been made to standardise drug terminology in Australia.  For example, the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) are represented in the Police Statisticians’ Group, which deals with the collection and analysis of regional crime statistics and works closely with the Australian Bureau of Statistic (ABS) National Crime Statistics Unit (NCSU).  The Police Statisticians’ Group considers and adopts standard definitions and terminology for its purpose on an ongoing basis, including illicit drugs terminology.  This group is currently developing a standardised data dictionary together with the NCSU.  Once this data dictionary is completed, it will be provided to the Ministerial Council of Police and Emergency Management – Police (MCPEMP) and the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy (MCDS).
Further attempts to refine these terms will require the support of the health and law enforcement agencies on MCDS.

Recommendation 2:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission develop a nationally coordinated response to new and emerging communications technologies used by organised criminal networks to undertake serious criminal activities.

Accepted-In-Principle

The Government agrees that law enforcement and the intelligence community would benefit from a nationally coordinated response to new and emerging communications technologies used by organised criminal networks.  However, it would not be appropriate for the ACC to assume the coordination role outlined in the recommendation as the ACC primarily has an investigative and intelligence focus. 
On 16–17 April 2009, the Standing Committee of Attorneys‑General (SCAG) agreed to a set of resolutions for a national response to combat organised crime.  Attorneys‑General also agreed to establish a Senior Officers’ Group to undertake work on the legislative, interoperability and information sharing measures that were agreed to.  Attorneys‑General agreed to a range of further measures to support the national response to combat organised crime agreed to in April 2009.
The Attorney-General’s Department has led the development of an Organised Crime Strategic Framework (the Framework) that clearly articulates the roles and responsibilities of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies in combating organised crime.  The Framework was released on 25 November 2009 and proposes a stronger collaborative approach and a significant focus which on enhanced intelligence and information sharing capabilities, attacking the criminal economy and building community and business resilience.
It is understood that other jurisdictions are also developing high-level strategic frameworks to address organised crime at the State and Territory level.  It will be important to coordinate Commonwealth, State and Territory strategic frameworks in order to achieve a coherent national response to organised crime

Recommendation 3:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission work with Federal, State and Territory law enforcement agencies to achieve consistency in the collection and analysis and reporting of data on the chemical composition of seized illicit tablets, as well as drug identification and coding.

Accepted-In-Principle

The Government considers that consistency in data collection, analysis and reporting is an important objective.  The Commonwealth’s law enforcement agencies currently apply the ABS Standard Classification of Drugs of Concern to their data collection and analysis activities and request input from their partners in line with this standard.
The AFP has developed the Australian Illicit Drug Intelligence Program which aims to establish a series of Amphetamine Type Stimulants (ATS) fingerprints or ‘signatures’.  This will allow chemists to conduct comparisons between batches of drugs.  This information is important in identifying the source of finished ATS, precursors used in ATS manufacture and production methods.
In response to an Attorney-General’s Department funded report – Building Illicit Drugs Forensic Capacity across Australia – which was endorsed by MCDS in May 2008, the AFP, in partnership with the Department, has developed a business case for the implementation of a national illicit drug forensic system.  This business case involved significant consultation with State and Territory law enforcement agencies and would assist in achieving greater consistency in the collection and analysis and reporting of data on the chemical composition of seized illicit tablets, as well as drug identification and coding.  Importantly it would also expand the drug seizures subjected to profiling to include samples from State and Territory seizures.
Although the ACC will continue to work with other Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies in developing a consistent process for the collection of seized drug data, the AFP and the Attorney-General’s Department are better positioned to take the lead on this issue.

Recommendation 4:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission continue to be funded commensurate with the anticipated increase in organised criminal activity in relation to amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD).

Noted

The ACC has received increased funding to address AOSD issues.  The ACC continues to maintain a focus on drug-related intelligence and investigative issues.  In 2008–09, for instance, the ACC received an additional $5 million to address issues associated with the proliferation of synthetic drugs in Australia.
Any proposals for increased funding for the ACC’s AOSD work will be developed and considered as part of the Government’s annual budget process, including within the context of cross government and portfolio funding proposals.

Recommendation 5:  The Committee recommends that public education and demand reduction campaigns for illicit drugs be factual, informative and appropriately targeted. The Committee also recommends that such campaigns seek input from young people, and take account of user experiences of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD).

Accepted

This recommendation reflects the current approach to social marketing campaigns developed by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing in relation to both licit and illicit drugs.  Public education and demand reduction campaigns are strongly underpinned by advice from drug and alcohol experts and comprehensive market research amongst young people to ensure the education and campaign resources are appropriately targeted and effective with the intended audience.
This approach will be maintained in the development and delivery of the Government’s Illicit Drug Use – targeting young people who use methamphetamines, announced in the 2008 Budget.

Recommendation 6:  The Committee recommends that, in the execution of the National Drug Strategy, harm-reduction strategies and programs receive more attention and resources.

Accepted

The Commonwealth is committed to the aims contained in the National Drug Strategy 2004–2009 – improving health, social and economic outcomes by preventing the uptake of harmful drug use and reducing the harmful effects of licit and illicit drugs in Australian society.  As part of a comprehensive approach, the Commonwealth, along with its State and Territory partners, will continue to pursue the eight priority areas identified in the Strategy:
prevention
reduction of supply
reduction of drug related harms
improved access to quality treatment
development of workforce, organisations and systems
strengthening partnerships
implementation of the National Drug Strategy Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Complementary Action Plan 2003–2009, and
responding to emerging trends.
The Government is of the view that effective interventions to prevent drug use, treat those with drug problems and stop drug trafficking and manufacture all contribute to a reduced level of harm to individuals and the community. 
The National Drug Strategy 2004–2009 is currently being evaluated.  The results of the evaluation will inform the development of the next phase of Australia’s National Drug Strategy, including the role of harm reduction strategies.

Recommendation 7:  The Committee recommends that the Victorian feasibility study for an illicit tablet monitoring and information service be monitored and, as appropriate, the outcomes independently evaluated by the appropriate Commonwealth Government agency.

Not Accepted

While the Government is supportive of measures aimed at reducing the harm caused by illicit drug use, it has concerns about the use of pill testing at dance venues and similar locations that are similar to those raised in the report.  In particular, the Government is concerned that:
there are problems with the accuracy of current pill testing procedures, in that they do not provide information about:
the size of the dose
the purity level
what other harmful additives are present
how the drug will react with other substances taken, or
individual responses to the drug
any official conduct and sanction of pill testing might be interpreted as condoning illicit drug-taking
pill testing programs could expose those conducting the tests to liability for any harm resulting from the use of pills that have been tested, and
the pill-testing process could provide users with a false sense of security.  There is no guarantee that a particular pill, brand or logo is safe just because it has been through a testing process, and
the current testing procedures do not have adequate quality assurance or controls.
However, the Government is prepared to consider the results of any research aimed at providing new or more objective information about the impacts of pill testing. 

Recommendation 8:  The Committee recommends that a review of the provisions of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug and Other Offences) Act 2005 be undertaken and that it be amended to provide for regular reviews of the effectiveness of the provisions at two-year intervals after the initial review.

Accepted-In-Principle

The Government agrees that the provisions of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug and Other Offences) Act 2005 should be reviewed. 
The Government considers that the initial review should consider whether and when any subsequent reviews should be undertaken and whether there is a need to amend the Act to make provision for regular reviews.

Recommendation 9:  The Committee recommends that the States and Territories consider adopting drug offence regimes based on the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug and Other Offences) Act 2005 with the aim, as far as is practically possible, of establishing greater national consistency in the offences and penalties that apply to crimes related to amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD).

Accepted

The Commonwealth will continue to work with State and Territory Governments through MCDS and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General to encourage national consistency of drug offences and precursor offences.  In particular, it will do so by supporting the implementation of model serious drug offences as agreed by all jurisdictions through Model Criminal Code Officers Committee in 2002, and the implementation of the model schedules of drugs, plants, precursors and threshold quantities developed by the MCDS–Scheduling Working Party in 2007.

Recommendation 10:  The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth government undertake regular reviews of the effectiveness and interaction of Commonwealth and State drug legislation.

Accepted

The AFP and State and Territory police services monitor the ongoing effectiveness of serious drugs legislation.  The Commonwealth supports the principle that regular reviews should occur to ensure streamlining of the different jurisdictions’ drug and precursor legislation.  The Commoweanlth considers that the review of the provisions of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug and Other Offences) Act 2005 (see response to Recommendation 8), should also cover the interaction of Commonwealth, State and Territory drug legislation.  That review should consider whether, when and by whom any subsequent reviews should be undertaken.  The Government believes that as the key ministerial forum on illicit drug issues MCDS is best placed to progress any regular reviews.

Recommendation 11:  The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government continue to work with the State and Territory Governments to encourage national consistency of offences relating to amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD) and precursor chemicals.

Accepted

The Government accepts this recommendation and, as outlined in response to Recommendation 9, will continue to work with State and Territory Governments through MCDS and SCAG to encourage national consistency of drug offences and precursor offences.
In February 2005, the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs (IGCD) formed the Scheduling Working Party on Controlled Substance, which consisted of relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies and industry representatives, to recommend model schedules of controlled drugs, plants and precursors and relevant quantities to the IGCD and MCDS.  Model schedules and quantities for drugs, plants and precursors were completed in May 2007 and subsequently noted by MCDS at its May 2007 meeting. 
In 2002, the Commonwealth established a National Precursor Working Group to facilitate the implementation of the National Precursor Strategy.  Under this Strategy the Precursor Working Group has promoted the implementation of a range of nationally consistent policies, including, where appropriate, uniform criminal provisions and regulation (for example, the rescheduling of pseudoephedrine).  A National Precursor Control Framework was developed under the National Precursor Strategy and was presented to MCDS in 2009.  The Framework is designed to encourage greater national consistency for the regulation of precursor chemicals.  The Precursor Working Group brings together 45 members from Commonwealth, State and Territory law enforcement agencies, forensic and health services, and non‑government members including the pharmaceutical and chemicals industries. 

Recommendation 12:  The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in collaboration with State and Territory Governments and pharmacists, continue to implement Project STOP nationally.

Accepted

The national rollout of Project STOP in pharmacies took place in August 2007 as part of the National Strategy to Prevent the Diversion of Precursor Chemicals into Illicit Drug Manufacture.  As of 18 August 2009, approximately 75% of pharmacies nationally (3,856 pharmacies nation‑wide) had registered with Project STOP and over 3.3 million transactions had been processed.
The Commonwealth has committed $463,782 in funding to the Pharmacy Guild of Australia for the national rollout of Project STOP as part of the National Precursor Strategy.  The Department of Health and Ageing has also committed a further $156,242 towards awareness raising on Project STOP as part of the Pharmacy Development Program for the Pseudoephedrine Awareness Campaign.

Recommendation 13:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission collaborate with the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service and the relevant State and Territory law enforcement agencies to improve performance measurements for drug law enforcement under the National Drug Strategy.

Accepted

The Commonwealth has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve performance measures for drug law enforcement. 
The ACC has concluded a research project in collaboration with Victoria Police and Macquarie University which looked at the effectiveness and efficiency of strategic and operational activities including models for calculating return on investment of ACC investigations. Further analysis is occurring on measurable performance indicators and flexible forms of structure and management.
The AFP has acknowledged the need to balance supply and demand side indicators with performance measurements of drug law enforcement by developing the AFP Drug Harm Index (DHI) in 2001.  The DHI, which is updated regularly (latest update was published in 2006), combines supply and demand side indicators into a single measure that encapsulates the potential value to the Australian community of AFP drug seizures.  The benefits of the DHI approach have recently been recognised by overseas and international agencies, which are independently developing their own drug harm indices.
The National Drug Law Enforcement Research Fund previously commissioned a project by the Australian Institute of Criminology to develop a performance measurement framework for drug law enforcement in Australia.  The project, completed in December 2006, developed a model performance measurement framework for Commonwealth, State and Territory law enforcement agencies to better assess the effectiveness of law enforcement strategies in tackling the supply and distribution of illicit drugs in Australia.  Stage 2 of the project, which focussed on refining the framework’s performance measures and exploring options for implementation within individual law enforcement agencies, was completed in November 2009.  The report made a number of recommendations for progressing the implementation of the framework nationally.  This work is being continued in 2010.

Recommendation 14:  The Committee recommends that the reporting of Australian Federal Police statistics show separately the drug law enforcement policing outcomes for the ACT and federal jurisdictions.

Accepted

The usual practice of the AFP and ACT Policing is to report drug law enforcement policing outcomes separately and distinctly from each other.  This is critical as the outcomes for the AFP are reported to the Australian Government, whereas the outcomes of ACT Policing are set in consultation with the ACT Government. 
For example:
the AFP and ACT Policing publish separate Annual Reports each year
the AFP and ACT Policing have separate statistical listings in the Australian Crime Commission’s annual Illicit Drug Data Report, and
the AFP and ACT Policing made separate submissions to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission–AOSD Inquiry.
Circumstances where the AFP may report all drug seizure statistics (AFP National and ACT Policing) together are generally limited to United Nations questionnaires seeking whole‑of‑country or whole‑of‑agency data.

Recommendation 15:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission and other Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, in conjunction with the relevant State and Territory agencies, develop a standard data dictionary to ensure that information shared is as accurate as possible.

Accepted

As noted in the response to Recommendation 3, the Commonwealth’s law enforcement agencies currently apply the existing ABS Standard Classification of Drugs of Concern to their data collection and analysis activities and requests input from their partners in line with this standard.
As highlighted in the response to Recommendation 1 the Police Statisticians’ Group is currently in the process of developing a standardised data dictionary together with the NCSU and this will be presented to MCPEMP and MCDS for endorsement once it is completed.

Recommendation 16:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission review its current sources of information so that the potential for double counting between State, Territory and Commonwealth agencies is minimised. Such a review should be published so stakeholders have a clear understanding of the basis and accuracy of supply data.

Accepted

The ACC engages in a continual dialogue with contributors to the Illicit Drug Data Report (IDDR) in its effort to produce a robust statistical report.  However, there are limitations in its ability to confirm the accuracy of each data entry that exists, and these are stated in each edition of the IDDR, allowing users to assess the suitability of the data for their purpose.
Currently, the ACC imposes standard data requirements on contributors and sources IDDR data from the most relevant agencies in each jurisdiction to minimise the incidences of double counting.  The ACC uses the National Illicit Drug Reporting Format system to process data for the IDDR. This system has enabled the ACC to improve the statistical accuracy and reliability of data.  However, ultimately the ACC must rely on the data controls established by the jurisdictions for the accuracy of the data it receives.  The ACC does not consider that alternative sources of data exist given that it is collected directly from police forces and contracted forensic laboratories.
The ACC is confident that it currently accesses the most authoritative available data.  However, it will continue to work with contributors to identify data improvements to enhance the data provided to it as part of the ongoing process of compiling and annually reviewing the IDDR.

Recommendation 17:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission work with the State and Territory law enforcement agencies to increase their participation in data provision to the Australian Crime Commission’s databases.

Accepted

The ACC has been actively working with the States and Territories to increase data flow into the Australian Criminal Intelligence Database (ACID). 
To enable jurisdictions to more effectively share criminal information and intelligence, the ACC implemented the Standard Information Exchange Format (SIEF) enhancement to ACID.  SIEF facilitates information exchange among law enforcement agencies by allowing disparate systems to share, exchange, accept and translate information.  By supporting SIEF, criminal information and intelligence can be more efficiently and effectively uploaded to ACID by agencies, providing users with wider access to law enforcement intelligence and the ability to undertake more effective searching.
The ACC provides regular training to State and Territory law enforcement agencies on the use of ACID and the analytical tools available to ACID users.  The ACC presented to the ACC Board in December 2009 on the current ACID/Australian Law Enforcement Intelligence Network (ALEIN) functionality and options for further investment in ACID/ALEIN.
The National Clandestine Laboratory Database (NCLD) was rolled out nationally in August 2008.  The NCLD helps law enforcement agencies better target their drug investigations by integrating information on seized clandestine laboratories from all police and forensic agencies around Australia.  The ACC has completed NCLD training programs for all jurisdictions.

Recommendation 18:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission work to include the data provided by the State and Territory law enforcement agencies to further develop the Illicit Drug Data Report.

Accepted

The ACC remains committed to producing a quality statistical report in the form of the IDDR and, where possible, to enhancing its value.  The IDDR is the only report of its type in that it combines law enforcement data on a national basis with standardised counting rules.  While there was some criticism aimed at the report in submissions to the committee, generally the IDDR receives widespread acknowledgement as the most authoritative description of the drug situation in Australia for the reporting period.
The ACC will continue to work with jurisdictions to identify data improvements to enhance data collection and reporting methods as part of the ongoing process of compiling the IDDR.

Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission Report


Inquiry into the Future Impact of Serious and Organised Crime on Australian Society


Recommendation 1:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government examine the cost of provision of telecommunications data by telecommunications companies, with particular reference to methods by which that cost can be met or controlled.

Accepted

The Government, in association with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), will continue to facilitate discussions between agencies and industry that will review the costs associated with access to telecommunications data.  Ongoing discussions will explore options for greater standardisation of costs and investigate technical or procedural efficiencies that may reduce those costs. While ACMA has an arbitrator role, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (the TI Act) also deals with the division of costs between carriers and agencies as it applies to the interception of communications.

Recommendation 2:  The committee recommends that the issue of failure to cooperate with the Australian Crime Commission examination process be resolved immediately; and that the Commonwealth Government release the Trowell Report as a matter of priority.

Accepted

The Independent Review of the Provisions of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 by Mr Mark Trowell QC was tabled in the House of Representatives on 21 February 2008 and the Senate on 11 March 2008.
The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act No. 2 2010 (the SOC No. 2 Act) amended the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 to include a mechanism for examiners to refer uncooperative witnesses to a superior court to be dealt with as if in contempt of that court.

Recommendation 3:  The committee recommends that the Australian Customs Service continue to have access to telecommunications interception through law enforcement agencies, and that those agencies liaise to enhance the provision of telecommunications interception information to the Australian Customs Service.

Accepted-In-Principle

The Government proposes that current arrangements continue and that within the framework of the TI Act, the Government will consider ways to enhance the provision of telecommunications interception information to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.

Recommendation 4:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth and Queensland governments collaborate to expedite the granting of telecommunications interception powers to the Queensland Police Service and the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission.

Accepted

On 8 July 2009, the Attorney‑General declared the Queensland Police and the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission to be agencies for the purposes of the TI Act.  The declarations mean that these agencies are able to apply for warrants to intercept communications to assist in the investigation of serious offences.
Telecommunications interception powers are an essential investigative tool for modern law enforcement agencies and will assist Queensland to better combat serious criminal activity.  The Commonwealth will work with Queensland to help establish its technical capability to use these powers.
This brings Queensland into line with every other police force in Australia.

Recommendation 5:  The committee recommends that recommendations of the Sherman report into the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, where appropriate, be implemented without delay.

Accepted

The Government is committed to ensuring effective proceeds of crime legislation at the Commonwealth level.  The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act 2010 (the SOC Act) and the SOC Act No. 2 implemented recommendations from the Sherman Report.

Recommendation 6:  The committee suggests that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission in the next term of the Federal Parliament conduct an inquiry into all aspects of international legislative and administrative strategies to disrupt and dismantle serious and organised crime.

Accepted

The Government supports the conduct of an inquiry into all aspects of international legislative and administrative strategies to disrupt and dismantle serious and organised crime. 
The Government welcomes the 17 August 2009 report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission (PJC-ACC) inquiry into the effectiveness of legislative efforts to disrupt and dismantle serious and organised crime groups and associations with these groups. 

Recommendation 7:  The committee recommends that any future review of the Corporations Act 2001 identify provisions which could be amended to inhibit the activities of organised crime, including, but not limited to, those provisions dealing with directors.

Accepted

The Government will continue to monitor corporations law to identify opportunities for reform to inhibit the activities of organised crime groups, in line with the national response to combating organised crime agreed by Commonwealth, State and Territory Attorneys‑General in April 2009.
At its 17 April 2009 meeting, the Ministerial Council for Corporations (MINCO) considered the issue of director disqualification under the corporations legislation, in response to concerns about the use and management of companies by organised criminal groups.  The States and Territories were asked to outline their position in relation to five options for reform, put forward by the Commonwealth, that range from extending automatic disqualifications to establishing a national register of prohibited persons.  At its 6 August 2009 meeting, MINCO resolved that officers would undertake further work on the potential to expand the categories of offences that result in automatic disqualification from managing companies under the Corporations Act 2001.

Recommendation 8:  The committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments enact complementary and harmonised legislation for dealing with the activities of organised crime.

Accepted

The Government recognises that serious and organised crime is a national issue which would benefit from a complementary and harmonised legislative approach. In April 2009, the Standing Committee of Attorneys‑General (SCAG) agreed to a set of resolutions for a national response to organised crime.  Those resolutions dealt with both legislative and operational measures to combat organised crime activity.  In August 2009, SCAG agreed to further measures to support the national response to organised crime.  Through the April and August 2009 SCAG resolutions, all jurisdictions have agreed to consider introducing laws to enhance criminal asset confiscation and offences organised criminal activity.  Jurisdictions also agreed to implement the model laws for cross‑border investigative powers, developed in 2003 by the SCAG and then Australasian Police Ministers Council Joint Working Group. 
The SOC Act and the SOC Act No. 2 implemented measures aimed at organised crime agreed to by State and Territory Attorneys-General and strengthened existing laws by:
introducing new criminal offences targeting those involved in organised crime
strengthening criminal asset confiscation and anti-money laundering regimes
requiring individuals suspected of possessing unexplained wealth to demonstrate it was legally acquired
broadening access to telecommunications interception for the investigation of organised crime offences
enhancing police powers to investigate organised crime by implementing model laws for controlled operations, assumed identities and witness identity protection
enhancing money laundering, bribery and drug importation offences
enhancing search and seizure powers
extending criminal liability to individuals who jointly commit a Commonwealth offence
improving the operation and accountability of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC), and
improving the operation of the National Witness Protection Program by increasing protection for current and former participants and officers.
The Commonwealth has also endorsed an Organised Crime Strategic Framework which will provide a unified strategic direction for all Commonwealth agencies with responsibility for combating organised crime. It will also enhance collaboration and coordination across government and provide a greater understanding of criminal networks and threats from organised crime.

Recommendation 9:  The committee recommends that the government seeks to expedite the telecommunications industry’s adoption of option B of the Telecommunications (Service Provider—Identity Checks for Pre-Paid Mobile Telecommunications Services) Determination 2000, so as to require 100 points of identity documentation upon activation of prepaid mobile phone services.

Not Accepted

At their inaugural meeting on 16 June 2009, the Commonwealth and Telecommunications Industry Experts Group examined the current identity checking requirements for the purchase of prepaid mobile phone services. The Group identified significant deficiencies and difficulties with the operation of the identity checking regime.
As a result, the Group agreed that a review of the arrangements was required to ensure the policy objectives were being met and the arrangements are effective and efficient. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy established a working group, comprising industry representatives, ACMA, the Attorney-Generals Department and law enforcement and national security agencies to guide the review and explore options for improved arrangements. 
The working group is currently considering a proposal for an improved identity checking regime based on the collection of information at the point of activation. The proposal aims to better meet the requirements and objectives of law enforcement and national security agencies by collecting a richer set of information about the purchasers of pre-paid SIMs at the point of activation and improved access to collected information.  The proposal also aims to provide industry with opportunities to better streamline the process while ensuring that consumers can reasonably access these services. The working group is progressing development of the proposal as a priority.

Recommendation 10:  The committee recommends that the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management—Police consider a more strategic and national approach to recruitment and retention of sworn police officers across all jurisdictions; and that consideration be given to enhancing cross-jurisdictional mobility, including secondments, of sworn police officers and other police service personnel.

Accepted

The March 2008 Police Commissioners Conference endorsed a resolution to refer the issue of ‘recruitment and retention’ to the Australian and New Zealand Policing Advisory Agency (ANZPAA) Board for examination.  While the nature and scope of ANZPAA’s Work Program is subject to its Board’s endorsement, it is expected that this and a broad range of related issues will be addressed as part of that program.  ANZPAA reports routinely to MCPEMP on its activities and its work could inform any consideration of more strategic and national approaches in due course.
The Commonwealth commissioned a federal audit of police capabilities in 2009 conducted by Mr Roger Beale AO.  The findings of the Audit were presented to Government through the Minister for Home Affairs on 30 June 2009.  Relevant stakeholders within the Commonwealth, States and Territories and the non‑government sector were consulted in its development.  The 2008 Budget provided the Australian Federal Police (AFP) with $191.9 million dollars over five years commencing 2008–09 to recruit 500 police officers.  The Government also provided $20 million over four years for a recruitment and retention program, which will include strategies to recruit more women and Indigenous officers.

Recommendation 11:  The committee recommends that the Productivity Commission inquire into the cost effectiveness and benchmarking of law enforcement bodies and current national arrangements to address serious and organised crime.

Noted

The Government agrees that the cost effectiveness of law enforcement responses should be examined.
An inquiry of national arrangements to address serious and organised crime does not fall within the mandate of the Productivity Commission.  The Productivity Commission is not the appropriate organisation to undertake such an inquiry.  The Commission is the Australian Government’s principal advisory body on microeconomic policy and regulation.  It undertakes inquiries and provides advice on matters relating to industry, industry development and productivity.
The outcomes from the Federal Audit of Police Capabilities deal with the issue of national arrangements to address serious and organised crime.

Recommendation 12:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government increase funding to the Australian Institute of Criminology.

Noted

The Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) is funded by direct budget allocations and revenue from project based work for clients.  Any proposals for increased funding for the AIC will be developed and considered as part of the Government’s annual budget process including within the context of cross government and portfolio funding proposals.

Recommendation 13:  The committee recommends that a formal relationship be established between law enforcement agencies, government departments and the Australian Institute of Criminology to enhance the provision of data, information and research; and that particular emphasis be placed on the removal of any legislative impediments to the provision of data to the Australian Institute of Criminology by Commonwealth, State and Territory departments and agencies.

Accepted

The Government recognises the value of information and data to the quality research of the AIC and agrees that the AIC should identify the precise requirements to access that data.  The AIC will provide any issues for consideration of possible improvements in AIC access to data to the Heads of Commonwealth Operational Law Enforcement Agencies and MCPEMP.
AIC access to State and Territory data and information is a matter for consideration by State and Territory governments as well as other appropriate forums. 

Recommendation 14:  The committee recommends that public education programs about emerging criminal activities, such as credit card fraud, banking fraud, identity theft and internet-based criminal activity, be given a higher priority and increased resources.

Noted

The Government will continue to assess the resources and needs for further public awareness campaigns targeting emerging crimes.  Previous initiatives have targeted identity crime, e-security and online protection.  The Government is also working closely with the private sector to raise awareness of particular crime types, for instance through the Australian Consumer Fraud Taskforce which is focused on consumer protection in relation to frauds and scams.
Public education campaigns on specific new and emerging crime types and risks will continue to be developed and funded on a case by case basis in conjunction with industry, non‑government organisations and the community.  The ThinkUKnow campaign, a joint initiative of the AFP, Mircosoft and ACMA has already been successful in raising public awareness of the need for child safety on the internet.  In July 2009, the Government launched the CyberSmart website which sets the benchmark for cyber-safety advice and targeted information for Australian children, parents and teachers.

Recommendation 15:  The committee notes that the Australian Crime Commission has prepared a public version of the Picture of Criminality in Australia and recommends that the ACC Board make this report available at the earliest possible date.

Accepted

The public version of the Picture of Criminality in Australia, Organised Crime in Australia was released on 16 January 2008. An updated report was released on 25 February 2009.  It will be updated periodically to ensure its continued relevance to increasing the public’s awareness of the impacts of serious and organised crime on the community.

Recommendation 16:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government seek to ensure the comprehensive and public reporting of online fraud, particularly within the banking and finance industry.

Accepted-In-Principle

The Government supports the fullest possible reporting of all crimes including online fraud in order to better inform banking consumers of the potential and associated online fraud risks.  The Government is also working closely with the private sector to raise awareness of particular crime types, for instance through the Australian Consumer Fraud Taskforce which is focused on consumer protection in relation to frauds and scams.

Recommendation 17:  The committee recommends that CrimTrac be funded to examine the legislative, administrative and technical aspects to allow the inclusion of additional datasets to the Minimum Nation Wide Person Profile; particular consideration should be given to Aviation Security Identification Cards, Maritime Security Identification Cards, explosives licences and ammonium nitrate licences.

Accepted-In-Principle

The National Police Reference System, hosted by CrimTrac, has the technical capacity to include additional information sets such as Aviation Security Identification Cards, Maritime Security Identification Cards, explosives licences and ammonium nitrate licences.  The legislative and administrative aspects of providing additional datasets would need to be considered in consultation with States and Territories and Commonwealth agencies.
The Government is seeking the support of the CrimTrac Board of Management to have CrimTrac and the Attorney-General’s Department consider the technical, legislative and administrative aspects of including additional datasets on the Minimum Nationwide Person Profile (MNPP).  The Government has asked CrimTrac, the Attorney-General’s Department and the ACC to review any impediments to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Database accessing MNPP data.
These reviews will also need to consider the privacy implications of providing access to this information through the MNPP.  Any Commonwealth funding required to support enhancements to MNPP would need to be considered in the annual Commonwealth Budget process.

Recommendation 18:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government review CrimTrac’s current funding model in order to provide it with a greater level of funding certainty.

Accepted

The Attorney-General’s Department is currently working with CrimTrac to review both their funding model and their governance structure.  Any future funding model will need to be considered by the CrimTrac Board.  The Commonwealth is a member of the CrimTrac Board.

Recommendation 19:
  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments implement a national number plate recognition system.

Noted

The Commonwealth has provided $2.23 million of funding from the confiscated assets account under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to carry out the Scoping Study. 

Recommendation 20:  The committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission give consideration to the extent to which its information handling protocols incorporate, and could be enhanced by, the principles of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

Accepted

It is acceptable that the ACC’s criminal intelligence holdings remain exempt from the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988.  However, the ACC’s current policy is to comply with the Information Privacy Principles to the greatest extent possible.  This policy position is supported by compliance with a range of specific provisions in the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 and other statutes that require the ACC to maintain the confidentiality of information it holds.  The dissemination of ACC information in accordance with such legislation carries specific conditions, typically including the requirement that no further dissemination shall occur without prior ACC approval.  The ACC will continue to give consideration to the extent to which its information handling protocols incorporate, and can be enhanced by, privacy principles in the context of this recommendation and other relevant considerations.
The Government notes that recommendation 37‑1 of the Australian Law Reform Commission’s (ALRC) Report 108 – For Your Information: Australian Privacy Law and Practice (2008) proposes that:
the ACC, in consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, should develop and publish information‑handling guidelines for the ACC and the Board of the ACC.  The information-handling guidelines should address the conditions to be imposed on the recipients of personal information disclosed by the ACC in relation to further handling of that information.
the PJC-ACC should monitor compliance by the ACC and the Board of the ACC with the information‑handling guidelines.
The Government has announced that it will be responding to the ALRC’s recommendations in two stages, with recommendations relating to exemptions (including recommendation 37‑1) to be considered in the Government’s second stage response.

Recommendation 21:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government provide funding for a feasibility study into the development of a single national case management system.

Recommendation 22:  The committee recommends that the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management—Police give consideration and support to the development of a single national case management system.

Accepted-In-Principle

The issue of a national case management solution has arisen in a number of forums, including in the Clarke Inquiry recommendations.  In March 2009, the CrimTrac Board approved the proposal for CrimTrac to conduct a feasibility study into a national case management capability.

Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission Report


Examination of the Australian Crime Commission Annual Report 2006–07


Recommendation 1:  The Committee urges the government, without further delay, to amend Part II Division 1 Subdivision B Sub-section 7B(2) of the Act to include the Commissioner of Taxation on the ACC Board.

Accepted

The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act No. 2 2010 (the SOC No. 2 Act) amended the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (the ACC Act) to include the Commissioner of Taxation as a member of the Australian Crime Commission Board.

Recommendation 2:  The Committee recommends that the government expedite its response to the Trowell Report and in particular, address the emerging problem that refusal to co-operate with the ACC examiners and examination process is being employed as a delaying tactic to thwart or frustrate ACC operations.

Accepted

The Independent Review of the Provisions of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 by Mr Mark Trowell QC was tabled in the House of Representatives on 21 February 2008 and the Senate on 11 March 2008.
The SOC No. 2 Act amended the ACC Act to include a mechanism for examiners to refer uncooperative witnesses to a superior court to be dealt with as if in contempt of that court.

Government Response


Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission Report


Inquiry into Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act 2007


Recommendation 1:  The committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission be required to, without delay, develop and implement a consistent and reliable method for its examiners to promptly and securely record their reasons for decision as required by Part II Division 2 Subsections 28(1A) and 29(1A) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002.

Accepted

It is now the established practice of Australian Crime Commission (ACC) examiners to prepare and record their reasons prior to the issue of every summons and notice pursuant to subsections 28(1A) and 29(1A) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (the ACC Act).  The forms used for summonses and notices now include the time and date of issue.  The time and date of settlement is also included in the record of reasons, ensuring that compliance is apparent on the face of the documentation.
Measures are in place to provide assurance as to the accuracy of the documents at the relevant time including restricted electronic access and audit measures that disclose any subsequent amendments to the documentation.

Recommendation 2:  The committee recommends that the amendment made to Part II Division 2 Subsections 28(1A) and 29(1A) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 by the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act 2007 be repealed but that those subsections be amended to ensure that the reasons for the decision must be recorded in writing before the issuing of a summons or notice.

Accepted

The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act (No. 2) 2010 (the SOC No. 2 Act) amended the ACC Act to ensure that ACC examiners record their reasons for issuing a summons or notice to produce before, or at the same time as, the summons or notice is issued.  A failure to do this invalidates the summons or notice.  ACC examiners are no longer able to record reasons after the summons or notice has been issued.

Recommendation 3:  The committee recommends that Part II Division 2 Subsections 28(8) and 29(5) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be repealed.

Accepted

The SOC No. 2 Act repealed subsection 28(8) of the ACC Act and replaced it with a new subsection stating that a failure to comply with requirements set out in section 29A will not invalidate the summons. As such, a failure to comply with the requirement to record reasons and attach the relevant Board determination (subsections 28(1A) and 28(2)) will invalidate the summons.
The SOC No. 2 Act also repealed subsection 29(5) and replaced it with a new subsection stating that a failure to comply with requirements set out in section 29A will not invalidate the notice.  The effect of this amendment is that a failure to comply with the requirement to record reasons in subsection 29(1A) will invalidate the summons.
This recommendation suggests that subsections 28(8) and 29(5) be repealed in their entirety.  However, the new subsections 28(8) and 29(5) state that a failure to issue a non‑disclosure notation under section 29A will not invalidate the summons.  The Committee’s report focused on ensuring that an examiner be properly satisfied prior to issuing a summons or notice, and that the reasons for issuing the summons or notice are recorded.  The requirement to include a non‑disclosure notation under section 29A is not related to the decision of whether or not to issue a summons or notice.

Recommendation 4:  The committee recommends that Part II Division 2 Subsection 29B(4) of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended to include the Commonwealth Ombudsman.

Accepted

The SOC No. 2 Act expands the circumstances in which a disclosure may be made under subsection 28B(4) to include making disclosures to the Commonwealth Ombudsman (the Ombudsman) for the purpose of making a complaint under the Ombudsman Act 1976.   The SOC No. 2 Act also allows disclosure under subsection 28(4) to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI) for the purpose of referring to the Integrity Commissioner an allegation or information that raises a corruption issue.  ACLEI is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious and systemic corruption issues in the Australian Federal Police and the ACC.  As such, it is appropriate that a person is able to disclose a summons or notice to ACLEI for the purpose of referring to the Integrity Commissioner an allegation, or information that raises a corruption allegation.
The SOC No. 2 Act also expands the circumstances in which a disclosure may be made under subsection 29B(2) to include making disclosures to the Ombudsman for the purpose of making a complaint under the Ombudsman Act, or to the ACLEI for the purpose of referring to the Integrity Commissioner an allegation or information that raises a corruption issue.   
Recommendation 4 of the PJC‑ACC Report was limited to amending subsection 29B(4).  However, it is appropriate that all people who are aware of a summons or notice (either under subsection 29B(2) or 29B(4)) be able to disclose matters connected to the summons or notice to the Ombudsman or ACLEI where appropriate.

Recommendation 5:  The committee notes that Sections 10 and 12 of the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act 2007 deems certain summonses and notices valid thereby protecting any prosecution based on those summonses and notices. The committee recommends that:
the same practice be adopted in relation to summonses and notices issued subsequent to the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act 2007 until now;
but that henceforth, in line with Recommendation 2, the practice of retrospectively recording reasons for the issue of summonses and notices be immediately discontinued and that Sections 10 and 12 of the Australian Crime Commission Amendment Act 2007 be repealed.

Accepted

The amendments in the SOC No. 2 Act only operate prospectively.  Therefore the requirements to records reasons before or at the time a summons or notice is issued only applies to summons or notices issued after the commencement of Schedule 7 of the SOC No. 2 Act.  Accordingly, a failure to comply with such requirements will only invalidate summons or notices issued after commencement. 

Recommendation 6:  The committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended to include the statutory definition of contempt and the statutory power of referral, plus ancillary provisions, proposed as clauses 34A and 34B in the National Crime Authority Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 (except that the referral be to the Federal Magistrates Court) for matters arising under Section 30 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002.

Accepted

The SOC No. 2 Act enables the ACC to apply to a Court to have an uncooperative witness dealt with for contempt.  This provides the ACC with a more immediate means of encouraging witnesses to cooperate with ACC Examiners, as the ACC can issue the threat of immediate detention.  A contempt power was also recommended by the independent review of the ACC Act conducted by Mr Mark Trowell QC.

Recommendation 7:  As a corollary of Recommendation 6, or as an alternative thereto, the committee urges the Commonwealth Attorney-General to negotiate with the judiciary an expedited judicial process for matters referred by the Australian Crime Commission under Part II Division 2 Section 30 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002.

Noted

As the SOC No. 2 Act provides the ACC with a contempt power, the Government will not be responding to this recommendation.  The Commonwealth consulted with States and Territories on the contempt regime.

Recommendation 8:  The committee recommends that Part IV Section 61A of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended to require the Minister to cause an independent review of the operation of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 every five years with the first review to be undertaken no later than 1 January 2011.

Accepted

The SOC No. 2 Act requires that the provisions and operation of the ACC Act be reviewed once every five years.

Recommendation 9:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Ombudsman be required to inspect records made by the Australian Crime Commission examiners to ensure full compliance with Part II Division 2 Sections 28 and 29 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 and that the Ombudsman report annually to the Parliament on this matter.
Recommendation 10:  The committee recommends that at least once in each year the Commonwealth Ombudsman be required to provide a briefing to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission about the Australian Crime Commission's exercise of the coercive powers under Part II Division 2 Sections 28 and 29 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 and that Part III Section 55AA of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 be amended accordingly.

Not accepted

The Government does not accept that the additional statutory oversight recommended by the Committee is necessary given the extent of statutory and judicial oversight already in place.  The ACC is subject to regular review by the Courts and through the existing capacity of the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman’s own motion investigation powers can be used for any part of the ACC’s operations, including examination processes and other matters related to the use of coercive powers.  For example, in August 2008, the Ombudsman released a report into the ACC’s use of powers under Division 2, Part II of the ACC Act, which provides the framework for examinations. 
Administrative measures have been implemented in relation to the Committee’s recommendation that reasons be recorded prior to the issue of a summons or notice to produce.  Reasons are now recorded prior to issue in all cases.  These administrative measures were reinforced by amendments to the ACC Act included in Schedule 7 to the SOC No. 2 Act.  These changes to administrative practices, along with a clear legal obligation to record reasons no later than the time of issue of a summons or notice, will ensure appropriate scrutiny and oversight of the ACC’s legal obligations through the existing legal processes available in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and Courts.

Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission Report


Inquiry into the legislative arrangements to outlaw serious and organised crime groups


Recommendation 1:  The committee recommends that the ACC work with its law enforcement partners to enhance data collection on criminal groups and criminal group membership, in order to quantify and develop an accurate national picture of organised crime groups within Australia. 

Accepted

On 25 November 2009, the Government released the Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework (the Framework), which includes measures to improve intelligence, information sharing and interoperability among agencies to best identify and combat organised crime networks and their activities. 
A key element of the Framework is the biennial development, by the Australian Crime Commission (ACC), of an Organised Crime Threat Assessment to provide a shared picture among relevant stakeholders of the most significant threats and harms arising from organised criminal activity.
Under the Framework, the ACC will continue to play a key role in collecting and disseminating intelligence on criminal organisations.  The continuation of current arrangements, including the ACC Board and existing task forces are supported under the Framework.

Recommendation 2:  The committee recommends that the ACC monitor the Serious Crime Prevention Orders, of the United Kingdom’s Serious and Organised Crime Agency, and report to both the Minister for Home Affairs and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission on the operation of the orders and on any benefits to Australian law enforcement agencies.

Recommendation 5:  The committee recommends that the ACC continue to monitor the effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s Financial Reporting Orders, and report to both the Minister for Home Affairs and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission whether similar reporting orders may be of benefit in the Australian law enforcement context.

Accepted

The Government agrees that the ACC continue to monitor the effectiveness of Serious Crime Prevention Orders and Financial Reporting Orders in the context of other investigative and offender management options, and report back as appropriate.
Recommendation 3:  The committee recommends that the unexplained wealth provisions of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Bill 2009 be passed.

Noted

The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act 2010 was passed by Parliament on 4 February 2010 and received Royal Assent on 19 February 2010.

Recommendation 4:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government give urgent consideration to strengthening the enforcement of registration obligations under the Anti‑Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006.

Accepted

Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter‑Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act), providers of remittance services are required to register with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC).  On 23 April 2010, the Government released a discussion paper detailing proposals to enhance regulation of Australia’s remittance sector in order to combat serious crimes.  The paper includes proposals to tighten the registration obligations of the sector, and to empower the AUSTRAC CEO to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of remitters in appropriate circumstances, including if the person poses a significant money laundering, terrorism financing or people smuggling risk or has a history of non-compliance with their regulatory obligations.   Subject to the outcome of consultations, the Government proposes to introduce legislation amending the AML/CTF Act as soon as possible.
The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Serious and Organised Crime) Act No. 2 2010 strengthened AUSTRAC’s ability to take enforcement action against reporting entities that do not comply with their obligations under the AML/CTF Act.  Specifically, it removed the requirement that AUSTRAC prove that an entity located in a foreign country is not an authorised deposit-taking institution when taking action against providers of remittance services under the AML/CTF Act.
The Government is currently considering options for improving the operation of the AML/CTF Act more broadly.  The Government is committed to developing a workable legislative framework that strikes a balance between efficient conduct of business and effective regulation to combat money laundering and terrorism financing.

Recommendation 6:  The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government examine a more integrated model of asset recovery in which investigation and prosecution are undertaken within one agency, such as the ACC.

Accepted

The Government will examine possible options for a more integrated model of criminal asset confiscation.
An important factor for consideration will be the desirability of closely coordinating action to confiscate criminal assets with any related investigation or prosecution of criminal offences.  Consideration would also need to be given to the resources and expertise required to integrate in a single agency the functions of investigating criminal assets and applying for court orders to restrain and confiscate those assets.
Integrating asset recovery into the ACC may not be an appropriate option as it may detract from the agency’s key functions of information and intelligence gathering and dissemination. 

Recommendation 7:  The committee recommends that the Australian Government, in consultation with regional partners, give consideration to establishing an intelligence fusion centre in the Oceania region.

Accepted in principle

The Framework clearly articulates the benefit of a fusion capability such as the successful concept of the ACC’s Financial Intelligence Assessment Team, which pools analytical skills and provides shared access to multiple Commonwealth data and intelligence holdings located within the ACC.  The Government has committed to the development of a domestic criminal intelligence fusion capability linking a range of agencies and is currently focused on establishing that capability.  Any consideration of a fusion centre in the Oceania region should occur once the Commonwealth fusion capability has been established and fully evaluated.

Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam, AAA, IAA, IMU, JeM and LeJ as terrorist organisations


Tabled 15 June 2009


Government’s Response to Committee’s Recommendations


Recommendation 1:

The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulation, made under the Criminal Code section 102.1, to list Ansar al-Islam as a terrorist organisation.

Response:

The Government agrees with the recommendation.

Recommendation 2:

The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulation, made under the Criminal Code section 102.1, to list Asbat al-Ansar (AAA) as a terrorist organisation.

Response:

The Government agrees with the recommendation.

Recommendation 3:

The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulation, made under the Criminal Code section 102.1, to list Islamic Army of Aden (IAA) as a terrorist organisation.

Response:

The Government agrees with the recommendation.

Recommendation 4:

The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulation, made under the Criminal Code section 102.1, to list Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) as a terrorist organisation.

Response:

The Government agrees with the recommendation.

Recommendation 5:

The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulation, made under the Criminal Code section 102.1, to list Lashkar-e Jhangvi (LeJ) as a terrorist organisation.

Response:

The Government agrees with the recommendation.

Recommendation 6:

The Committee does not recommend the disallowance of the regulation, made under the Criminal Code section 102.1, to list Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) as a terrorist organisation.

Response:

The Government agrees with the recommendation.

Recommendation 7:

The Committee recommends that where a decision to de-list an organisation is made, that the Attorney-General provide a statement of reasons to the Committee and a public statement of reasons.

Response:

The Government agrees in principle with the recommendation.
Before an organisation can be listed as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not a terrorist act has occurred or will occur) or advocates the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not a terrorist act has occurred or will occur). The statement of reasons, which is made available to the public, contains information which forms the basis for the Attorney-General’s decision to list or re-list an organisation.
Regulations listing an organisation as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code expire after two years. The organisation then ceases to be listed, unless new regulations are made to re-list the organisation. To date, two organisations – the Armed Islamic Group and the Egyptian Islamic Jihad – have not been re-listed following the expiry of regulations listing these organisation as terrorist organisations. In both cases, the Government informed the public by media releases that the organisations would not be re-listed. The media releases explained why the organisations no longer met the statutory test for listing as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code. The Government considers that this is an appropriate way of informing the public that an organisation will not be re-listed, and considers that this performs the function of a ‘public statement of reasons’.
The Government recognises that the Committee has a particular interest in these matters. Where the Committee requests more information on an organisation that is not being re-listed, the Government will ensure that the Committee receives a further briefing by ASIO to explain in more detail why the organisation no longer meets the statutory test for listing.

Improving the statement of reasons

The Government also notes the discussion in the Committee’s report on improving the statement of reasons. In particular, the Government notes the Committee’s request that future statements of reasons be drafted, at least in part, in such a way that the information is directly referrable to the statutory criteria for listing contained within the Criminal Code.
In response to the Committee’s request, the structure of the statement of reasons has been improved. The statement of reasons now states the statutory criteria for listing under the Criminal Code, and clearly sets out how the organisation to be listed or re-listed satisfies the statutory criteria.

Government Response to Recommendations from the Parliamentary Inquiry into RAAF F-111 Deseal/Reseal Workers and their Families


Foreword

The Australian community quite rightly expects the Commonwealth Government to care for our servicemen and women who suffer ill-health because of their military service.  This Government takes that responsibility very seriously.  In 2007 we announced an election commitment, set out in Labor’s Plan for Veterans’ Affairs, to convene a Parliamentary Inquiry to examine the health and compensation issues surrounding the Royal Australian Air Force’s (RAAF) F-111 deseal/reseal workers and their families.
In addition to examining the health effects of F-111 fuel tank maintenance, with particular reference to the unique fuselage repair work undertaken and the health risks involved, the Parliamentary Inquiry was also tasked with considering the adequacy of the Government’s response to date.  The aim was to investigate whether the Government’s response was adequate and consistent with the findings of the Study of Health Outcomes in Aircraft Maintenance Personnel, 2004 (SHOAMP); and, whether the overall handling and administration of health and compensation schemes was sufficient.
The previous Government provided access to benefits for some 700 RAAF personnel and civilians who were identified as having been involved, to some degree, in the RAAF’s formal deseal/reseal fuel tank maintenance programs.  Health care and compensation benefits were available to workers experiencing any of the SHOAMP-specified illnesses; with the Health Care Scheme available while a claim was being determined, and continuing indefinitely even if a claim was rejected.  The previous Government also paid one-off ex-gratia lump sums to eligible participants who had been in formal deseal/reseal programs, where they satisfied Tier 1 or Tier 2 criteria - definitions based on length of participation in the formal programs. Such ex-gratia payments were available regardless of a claimant’s health status, and were based only on a participant’s working environment.
The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade commenced the F-111 Parliamentary Inquiry in June 2008 and took evidence and histories from the fuel tank maintenance workers themselves.  It also reviewed relevant scientific and health studies, and considered the services and support provided to affected workers by the Departments of Defence and Veterans’ Affairs.
The Inquiry report, Sealing a just outcome: Report from the Inquiry into RAAF F-111 Deseal/Reseal Workers and their Families, was tabled on 25 June 2009. A copy of the report is available online at:
http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/jfadt/deseal_reseal/report.htm
The report makes 18 recommendations, broadly relating to:
health care and support for RAAF deseal-reseal workers and their families;
access to compensation using the provisions of subsection 7(2) Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (SRCA) - for conditions resulting from exposure to the chemicals used in deseal-reseal processes, as identified following the SHOAMP;
access to ex-gratia payments;
occupational health and safety issues specific to Defence and the Australian Defence Forces;
continuing statistical analysis and review of health issues affecting personnel, and medical research to help understand the underlying factors for these medical conditions.
The Government has accepted 14 of the Inquiry’s recommendations, some in modified form, one partially accepted, and some accepted with enhancements. The tables at pages 6 and 10 detail the Inquiry’s recommendations and the Government Response.
The Government Response provides some $55 million over four years, expanding the definition of eligible personnel and the benefits and services available to them - to provide better access to care and compensation under the SRCA. 
The Response significantly expands eligibility for compensation and health care under ss7(2) of the SRCA, by recognising thousands more F-111 maintenance personnel who may be affected because their work required fuel tank entry.  An estimated 2,400 additional workers, (along with those associated with the formal deseal/reseal work programs) may now be considered for access to health care and compensation through inclusion in the definition of Tier 3 exposure classification, should they become affected by the health conditions linked to F-111 deseal/reseal work. While they were not subject to the same working conditions (with respect to the time spent in fuel tank entry and levels of chemical exposure) as those in the formal deseal/reseal programs, the Government acknowledges that other personnel, such as those undertaking ‘pick and patch’ work, may have also been adversely affected by their working conditions.
Health care treatment and counselling, provided by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs under the SHOAMP Health Care Scheme, and health screening and testing under the Better Health Program, is now available for many more workers.  The Government Response also caters to the needs of family members of fuel tank maintenance workers, by extending counselling services available to workers and their families.  Both group and individual counselling sessions will be available - designed to meet the specific clinical needs of participants.  There will also be an increased number of sessions in the counselling program.
To enable easier access to health care and compensation, the requirements for evidence to support claims have been broadened - through the development of guidelines enabling statutory declarations to be considered as part of formal evidence. This will facilitate the claims process for those whose official work-related records may be unavailable.
The Department of Veterans’ Affairs will task a senior officer, with a health background, and a background knowledge of the F-111 worker claims, to oversee the implementation of this Response.  This officer’s role will also include monitoring and analysing the nature of health issues arising for current and future claims, so that trends in any late-emerging illnesses are identified. 
The Department of Defence is continuing to research the underlying cause of health conditions associated with F-111 fuel tank maintenance, through its study of mitochondria in personnel exposed to fuel and solvents.  A pilot study has now been completed and the next stage of the research is being scoped under the management of Defence Centre for Occupational Health. 
The ex-gratia payment scheme continues unchanged, with the exception that the Estates of deceased personnel who died prior to 8 September 2001 are now eligible to apply for ex-gratia payments.  The Government has elected not to extend eligibility for the ex-gratia payment scheme. 
In the interests of fairness, the scheme (although a flawed approach to a complex health and compensation issue) remains open to workers involved in the formal deseal/reseal work programs under the existing eligibility criteria.  The new guidelines for use of statutory declarations should assist more of the personnel involved in the formal deseal/reseal work programs to access the ex-gratia payments, where official records of their involvement are not available.
As part of the Government Response, there is now a dedicated F-111 Government website, jointly hosted by the Departments of Defence and Veterans Affairs. The site provides information and assistance to F-111 fuel tank maintenance workers and their families, detailing the range of health services and compensation entitlements for affected workers, and the new eligibility requirements. The website is available at:
http://f111.dva.gov.au
The Government thanks the Committee responsible for conducting the Parliamentary Inquiry - for the breadth and scope of their work. We have considered the report in detail and are pleased to present this Government Response, outlining our approach and actions regarding the important matters raised on behalf of F-111 fuel tank maintenance workers and their families.

Recommendations from the Parliamentary Inquiry

Government Response


1


That the definition of eligible personnel for the purposes of Tier 3 of the ex-gratia scheme be extended to include personnel posted to one or more of the F-111 maintenance squadrons 1, 6 and 482 who carried out Sealant Rework work during the period 1973 to 2000 and personnel who served in 3AD or 501 WG and who undertook fuel tank entry and Sealant Rework work outside of the formal DSRS program.


Accept - with modification and enhancement (DVA)


The Government accepts the recommendation to expand the definition for eligibility for Tier 3 status, with access to compensation and health care under ss7(2) of the 
Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988
 (SRCA), to now include all personnel undertaking F-111 fuel tank maintenance involving fuel-tank entry prior to January 2000, including personnel who worked in F-111 fuel tanks at locations other than RAAF Base Amberley, in addition to those personnel who are already eligible through their work in, or linked to, F-111 deseal/reseal.
 


This definition is more generous than that recommended by the Inquiry.


The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) will utilise the services of a senior officer to monitor and analyse the nature of conditions appearing in incoming compensation claims so that any emerging trends indicative of late onset conditions associated with deseal/reseal work can be identified.
 


2


In absence of evidence to the contrary and where usual documentary evidence is not available or is inconclusive, a statutory declaration by the applicant confirming:


- they were posted to 1, 6 or 482 Squadron between 1973 and 2000, or 3AD or 501 WG;


- that they were required to undertake Sealant Rework (‘pick and patch’) or fuel tank entries; and


- accompanied by a second corroborating statutory declaration from a commanding officer or superior officer or person who has already had a claim under the scheme approved
 


be accepted as evidence of qualifying service.


Accept – with modifications (DVA)



The Government accepts recommendation 2 with modifications to make it consistent with the expanded definition in its response to recommendation 1.
 


This response addresses the particular issues faced by RAAF maintenance personnel undertaking F-111 fuel tank repairs, with the absence of official records.


Accordingly, in the absence of evidence to the contrary and where usual documentary evidence is not available or is inconclusive, a statutory declaration by the applicant confirming that they carried out eligible deseal/reseal work or other F-111 fuel tank maintenance involving fuel tank entry prior to January 2000, accompanied by a second corroborating statutory declaration from a commanding officer or superior officer or person who has already had a claim under the scheme approved, will be accepted as evidence that will be considered in deciding if the person is eligible for Tier 3 status.


DVA will issue guidelines in relation to the use and acceptance of statutory declarations.
 
 The mere presence of two statutory declarations will not guarantee the success of an application: every case will be judged on its merits.


7


That a review be undertaken of those cases in which a statutory declaration has been rejected by DVA in determining an F-111 ex-gratia application. That the committee be provided with a copy of that review.


Accept (DVA)



The Government accepts the recommendation and will undertake a review of cases in which a statutory declaration has been rejected by DVA in determining an F-111 ex-gratia application.
 
 This may result in additional payments under the ex-gratia scheme and additional statutory compensation under the SRCA.


8


That the healthcare and compensation provisions made available under the F-111 ex-gratia scheme be in accordance with ss7(2) of the SRCA or the 
Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986
 (VEA) and this apply to the widened group in accordance with the recommendations in this report.


Accept – with modification (DVA)


The recommendation is accepted to the extent that eligible personnel defined in recommendation 1 will have enhanced access to health care and compensation pursuant to ss.7(2) of the SRCA for the 31 conditions identified by the SHOAMP and access to the SHOAMP Health Care Scheme (SHCS).


9


That the cut off date requiring applicants for the SHCS to submit claims prior to 20th September 2005 be removed. That all claims for SHCS received by DVA and rejected because of the September 2005 date be reviewed.


Accept (DVA)



The Government accepts the recommendation.


The removal of the closing date of 20 September 2005 from the SHCS will enable new personnel to apply for access to the SHCS, after submitting a claim for compensation and makes allowance for those health conditions that have a latency period before onset.
 
 This will enable a person to receive treatment through the SHCS at the time that the condition becomes evident and provide access to the Better Health Program.


Applications rejected because of the closure date will be reviewed and new applications will be accepted.


10


That the requirement excluding estates of those who died prior to 8th September 2001 from accessing the ex-gratia scheme be removed. Those estates of former personnel with qualifying service in accordance with the scheme and these recommendations be eligible for support under the ex-gratia scheme.


Accept (DVA)



The Government accepts the recommendation.


Estates of eligible former personnel who died before 8 September 2001 will be able to apply under the ex-gratia scheme.
 
 It needs to be established that the former RAAF worker had eligibility as Tier 1 or Tier 2 in accordance with the scheme and the new accepted recommendations.
 



11


That the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs appoint a person with suitable qualifications and background knowledge of the F-111 workers claims to oversee the implementation of these recommendations and to provide expert assistance to DVA in processing claims. The person should be appointed for a minimum of two years and also provide periodic advice to the Minister on progress in handling claims.


Accept – partially (DVA)



The Government partially accepts this recommendation.


The Government will ask DVA to task a senior person, with suitable qualifications, including appropriate health background, and background knowledge of the F-111 worker claims to oversee the implementation of all the recommendations and to provide expert assistance to DVA in processing claims.
 
 This person will provide reports to the Government and will be responsible for the monitoring described in the response to recommendation 1.


The Government does not consider it necessary to appoint an independent person to oversee implementation of these recommendations as this would take away from the responsibilities and powers vested in the Repatriation Commission, the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, the relevant Departmental Secretaries and the Chief of Defence Force.


12


That group counselling be made available to F-111 fuel tank repair workers and their families. That initially, participation in up to five group counselling sessions be made available to all who have access to funded individual counselling. That the Minister review whether further group counselling sessions should be made available, based on outcomes from these group counselling services.


Accept – with modification and enhancement (DVA)



The Government accepts the recommendation by providing enhanced access to counselling services, in excess of that recommended by the Inquiry.


The Government proposes that VVCS - Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service (VVCS) develops and delivers a flexible program of groups and individual counselling to meet the clinical needs of individuals including partners.
 


13


That the Government give consideration to expanding respite care for partners of seriously ill former F-111 workers who are principal care providers.


Accept (DVA)


The Government accepts the recommendation.


DVA will consider options for additional respite services for deseal/reseal partners.


14


That Defence provide a briefing on the progress of litigation to the Committee in March and September of each year.


Accept (Defence)


The Government accepts the recommendation.


Defence can provide a briefing on the progress of common law litigation of personal injury claims to the Committee in March, September and as otherwise required by the Committee.


15


The Committee recommends that Defence and DVA establish a dedicated website in relation to F-111 aircraft maintenance issues. Such a website should be comprehensive and include:


- the Board of Inquiry (BOI) Report and recommendations;


- the complete SHOAMP study reports;


- complete information on the ex-gratia payment including application forms;


- a link to this report and recommendations; and


- contact details and role descriptions of all relevant personnel including the Defence Force Advocate, ex-gratia processing team, DVA compensation processing team and other support mechanisms such as the F-111 DSRS Support Group, counselling support and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.


Accept (DVA and Defence)



The Government accepts the recommendation.


Defence and DVA will establish a dedicated website in relation to F-111 aircraft maintenance issues and include the information detailed in the recommendation.


16


That a review of DVA staff training be undertaken to ensure a regular high standard of client focused delivery of services occurs. That policies for handling cases of seriously ill patients, especially those in vulnerable circumstances, be reviewed.


Accept (DVA)


The Government accepts the recommendation.


DVA has already taken a range of actions to improve its service delivery and has future plans for further action to ensure a regular high standard of client focused service delivery.
 
 Policies for handling cases of seriously ill patients, especially those in vulnerable circumstances, will be reviewed.
 


17


That the ADF expand its internal capability in occupational medicine as a matter of some urgency. That a review of current practices in handling OH&S matters within the ADF be conducted to amongst other things, respond to the structural and cultural issues identified in the BOI and by Professor Hopkins.


Accept (Defence)


The Government accepts the recommendation.


Defence has appointed a Senior Physician in Occupational Health and Safety Medicine.
 
 Defence is expanding its occupational health and safety capability and has already put in place a program delivering on this requirement with an estimated cost of $9.96m, funded from within budget allocation. The Defence OHS Strategy 2007-2012 has taken into account lessons learned from previous occupational health and safety issues including the F-111 deseal/reseal Board of Inquiry.


18


That the ADF fund further research into the mitochondrial changes identified in Professor Bowling’s research. That as part of that research, further wider study be undertaken into the health implications of working with aviation turbine fuels and the results of these studies be reported back to the Committee at least annually.


Accept (Defence)


The Government accepts the recommendation.


Defence continues to support further research into mitochondrial changes in fuel and solvent exposed personnel, and Defence is also undertaking work to assess the health implications of working with aviation turbine fuels.


 


 


Table of Recommendations—Rejected


At recommendations 3 – 6, the Inquiry Committee recommended the continuation and extension of an ex-gratia payment scheme instituted by the previous Government. This scheme attempted a simplistic lump sum payment solution to a complex health and compensation issue. The scheme did not make payments based upon need but based upon working conditions. As a consequence the majority of ex-gratia payments were made to personnel who were not suffering adverse health conditions. At the same time, other personnel suffering from similar health conditions were not able to access appropriate health care and compensation.


The intention of the Inquiry Committee in extending ex-gratia payments to a broader work group was aimed at achieving equity. However, the Inquiry Committee was clearly faced with great difficulty in framing parameters for the broader work group. Unfortunately, the parameters selected by the Inquiry Committee suffer from many of the same difficulties as the original scheme. The majority of ex-gratia payments would be made to personnel not suffering from adverse health conditions. The Government recognises the challenge faced by the Inquiry Committee in seeking to achieve equity with ex-gratia payments made by the previous Government. However, the recommendation by the Inquiry Committee to continue and expand the scheme would continue an approach that is not based upon sound principles.
 
 In the interests of fairness, the ex-gratia payment scheme will remain open to the original workgroup of workers associated with the deseal/reseal formal programs.
 
 The approach to statutory declarations at recommendation two will also apply to Tiers 1 and 2 of the scheme and this may assist some workers associated with the deseal/reseal formal programs who were not successful in their previous ex-gratia payment applications due to the lack of official records.
 
 However, the scheme will not be expanded to a wider work group.


The Government approach is based upon providing health care and compensation through the existing statutory mechanisms to those in need. Accordingly, the Government has taken an inclusive approach to recommendation 1 and 2 that exceeds the recommendations of the Inquiry Committee. This is a principled approach aimed at supporting those whose health has been affected through their service in the unique working environment of F-111 fuel tank maintenance.

Accordingly, the Government does not accept recommendations 3 – 6.

No

Government Response

3

That the definition of eligible personnel for the purposes of Tier 2 of the ex-gratia scheme be extended to include personnel posted to one or more of the F-111 maintenance squadrons 1, 6 and 482 who spent between 20 and 59 cumulative working days carrying out Sealant Rework (‘pick and patch’) during the period 1973 to 2000 and personnel who served in 3AD or 501 WG and who undertook fuel tank entry and Sealant Rework (‘pick and patch’) work outside of the formal DSRS program.

Reject
The Government rejected this recommendation.
The Government has preferred a response that applies a principled approach to providing health care and compensation to those workers suffering adverse health effects as a result of performing work associated with the deseal/reseal formal programs and other F-111 fuel tank maintenance involving fuel tank entry.
The Government does not propose to expand the ex-gratia scheme because it believes that it did not address the adverse health effects caused by fuel tank maintenance work.
In the interests of fairness, the ex-gratia payment scheme will remain open to the original work group and the approach to statutory declarations at recommendation two will apply to assessments under Tier 2 of the scheme.
4

In absence of evidence to the contrary and where usual documentary evidence is not available or is inconclusive, a statutory declaration by the applicant confirming:


- they were posted to the squadron between 1973 and 2000; and


- that they undertook Sealant Rework (‘pick and patch’) work for between 20 and 59 cumulative working days during the period 1973 to 2000 outside of the formal DSRS program, or 3AD or 501 WG; and


- accompanied by a second corroborating statutory declaration from a commanding officer or superior officer or person who has already had a claim under the scheme approved;

be accepted as evidence of qualifying service.
Reject
The Government rejected this recommendation as it was directly related to recommendation 3 that has been rejected.
5
That the definition of eligible personnel for the purposes of Tier 1 of the ex-gratia scheme be extended to include personnel posted to one or more of the F-111 maintenance squadrons 1, 6 and 482 who spent 60 or more cumulative working days carrying out Sealant Rework (‘pick and patch’) work during the period 1973 to 2000 and personnel who served in 3AD or 501 WG and who undertook fuel tank entry and Sealant Rework (‘pick and patch’) work outside of the formal DSRS program.
Reject
The Government rejected this recommendation.
The Government does not propose to expand the ex-gratia scheme because it believes that it did not address the adverse health effects caused by fuel tank maintenance work.
In the interests of fairness, the ex-gratia payment scheme will remain open to the original work group and the approach to statutory declarations at recommendation two will apply to assessments under Tier 1 of the scheme.
6

That where usual documentary evidence is not available or is inconclusive, a statutory declaration by the applicant confirming:


- they were posted to the squadron between 1973 and 2000; and


- that they undertook Sealant Rework ‘pick and patch’ work for 60 or more cumulative working days during the period 1973 to 2000 outside of the formal DSRS program, or 3AD or 501 WG and;

accompanied by a second corroborating statutory declaration from a commanding officer or superior officer or person who has already had a claim under the scheme approved.
Reject
The Government rejected this recommendation because it was directly related to recommendation 5 that has been rejected.
 

 


GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES REPORT NO 103 ON THE CONVENTION ON CLUSTER MUNITIONS


Recommendation 2


The Committee recommends that the Australian Government and the Australian Defence Force (ADF) have regard to the following issues when drafting the legislation required to implement the 
Convention on Cluster Munitions
, and when developing policies under which the personnel of the ADF operate:

the definition of the terms ‘use’, ‘retain’, ‘assist’, ‘encourage’ and ‘induce’ as they apply in Articles 1, 2 and 21 of the Convention on Cluster Munitions
;

preventing inadvertent participation in the use, or assistance in the use, of cluster munitions by Australia; and
preventing investment by Australian entities in the development or production of cluster munitions, either directly, or through the provision of funds to companies that may develop or produce cluster munitions.

Government response


Dot point 1

Noted.
In developing the legislation required to implement the Convention, the Government will have regard to the meaning of the terms ‘use’, ‘retain’, ‘assist’, ‘encourage’ and ‘induce’ as they apply in the Convention.  The Department of Defence will also have regard to the meaning of these terms in developing policies under which ADF personnel will operate. 

Dot point 2

Noted.
Article 1 of the Convention prohibits States Parties from using cluster munitions and also prohibits assistance in the use of cluster munitions.  However, this prohibition is subject to the exception contained in Article 21 that allows States Parties, their military personnel and nationals to engage in military cooperation and operations with States not party to the Convention that may use cluster munitions.  This provision allows States Parties to continue to conduct operations with allies not party to the Convention who may be using prohibited cluster munitions, such as the United States.  The Convention does not prohibit inadvertent participation in the use, or assistance in the use, of cluster munitions.  During military cooperation and operations with States not party to the Convention, Australian personnel will nonetheless be prohibited from themselves using cluster munitions or expressly requesting the use of cluster munitions in cases where the choice of munitions used is within their exclusive control.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-05-13,"—Everyone hates getting annoying phone calls during dinnertime from telemarketing companies trying to sell them something. It is the last thing that anyone wants after a hard day’s work. Family First supported the creation of the Do Not Call Register back in 2006 to stop these kinds of calls and we support the changes in the current bill, which will extend people’s registration from three to five years. For many people, telemarketing calls are unwanted—they are a nuisance and an invasion of family time at home. For almost three years now, four million Australians—that is a lot of Australians—have exercised their right to get rid of these unwanted calls by registering themselves on the Do Not Call Register.
—Not just four million Australians; it is four million Australian families
—That is four million Australian families who do not want to get unwanted marketing calls—four million Australian families who do not want their time wasted by these annoying calls. But guess what? Up until just a week or so ago, many of these people faced the prospect of dropping off the Do Not Call Register and once again becoming fair game for those nuisance calls. Why? Because their registration on the Do Not Call Register was going to expire. That would have meant many people would drop off the Do Not Call Register leaving them exposed when they thought they were protected by the register. It would also have meant no more quiet dinner times sitting down with the family and catching up on the day’s events; no more undisturbed TV—perhaps watching the Senate—when you get to plonk yourself on the couch after a long day at work; no more quality time with the kids or helping them out with their homework without annoying phone calls. Instead, the government finally got the message that people on the Do Not Call Register really do not want to have to keep on registering over and over again. So what did they do? They drafted an amendment. Did they draft an amendment to ensure that people would be permanently registered on the Do Not Call Register unless they asked otherwise? No, of course not. That would be doing what most people would probably want them to do. Instead, they have extended the length of registration from three years to five years. What that means is that the problem of people dropping off the Do Not Call Register unwittingly has not been fixed; it has been simply delayed. Because in two years from now the people who rushed to put themselves on the register back in May 2007 will be in the same position they are now. Sure, people can re-register themselves on the Do Not Call Register but let us face it, how many people do you think are really going to do this? How many people do you really think actually know that they are going to drop off the list and will need to re-register themselves? The government will probably say they will have some sort of campaign but we all know that that is not as effective as allowing people to register permanently.
I spoke to a number of people and asked them about the Do Not Call Register. None of them had the foggiest idea that you need to re-register. Maybe up in government circles—maybe in 7.30 Report land, I do not know—this is the topic of conversation at dinner parties, but I can tell you that out on the street most ordinary Australians would not have a clue. And now, because of shonky public policy, all these people will again be fair game for telemarketers, not now but in two years time. The government is delaying the problem, not fixing it. And what about those vulnerable Australians who most need this protection from those nuisance calls? Those Australians, many of them elderly, who unfortunately are more susceptible to high-pressure tactics and need the protection that the Do Not Call Register provides. There are many vulnerable Australians who really hold on to the fact that their number is not on telemarketers’ lists and I think the government has totally underestimated how much people rely on this register. Does the government really think that these people know that they have to re-register? I cannot believe it.
The worst part about all of this is that it would be so easy to fix this problem but the government refuses to act. In the United States and the United Kingdom registration periods have been removed, so registrations remain permanent. Maybe this is a tactic of the Rudd government to make another election promise and say they will fix it next time around and do it permanently. But in the US and the UK registration periods have been removed so that registrations remain permanent. Claims that permanent registration present a problem are just rubbish. In the US and the UK when a number is deactivated, such as when a person moves house, the register is notified and updated, meaning that even an owner’s new number will not be registered without their knowledge. This shows that permanent registration is possible and can work. There is no evidence of any problems with this system in other jurisdictions. It staggers me that the government will not go the full mile and let people register themselves permanently on the Do Not Call Register. It also staggers me that the government is still giving an exemption to—guess who?—politicians. That is right! Politicians are exempted from the Do Not Call Register. Even if you are registered on the Do Not Call Register, guess what? Politicians are exempted and, yes, they can make those calls. That is a cop-out. It is a disgrace that we ban all other companies but politicians are exempt.
—You should be able to talk to your constituents.
—The issue here is why. Why would they do that? Think about all those pre-recorded messages from the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition going through to the phone. Pollies are exempt. We cannot wait for those phone calls again—maybe from this Prime Minister. I do not know. Maybe those in 7.30 Report-land will be exempt! But this is a very serious issue. There are many vulnerable Australians, and to think that politicians are exempted! In my home state of Victoria there are two elections this year, and you can bet your bottom dollar that families across the state are going to be called up and hassled. It is a double standard and I think it is pathetic. It is not just the Labor Party that is guilty of this double standard; the coalition under the Howard government also supported this decision. I have been firm in my position from all the way back in 2006: politicians should be treated just like every other telemarketer or company and made to follow the Do Not Call Register.
Both of these issues—the issue of letting people permanently put themselves on the list and the issue of getting rid of the special exemption for politicians—are matters which need to be dealt with, not put off again for a couple of years. I have circulated amendments which address both of these issues and will continue to hold the government of the day to account on these two matters. The Do Not Call Register was put in place for a very good reason. We need to make sure that we continue to protect those Australians who want to be on the Do Not Call Register, not make it more difficult for them to avoid these annoying nuisance phone calls.",SENATE,<title>DO NOT CALL REGISTER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2010-05-13,"—It is good that we have got to this amended Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 now before the chamber, but it is bad that it has taken so much to get to this. What a waste in getting to this. What a waste of time. What a waste of money. What a waste of work. The government announced its Do Not Call Register proposition at budget time last year. It took them another six months to release discussion papers to start to get legislation drafted. What a waste of time, particularly when it is now incumbent upon this place to pass the bill with amendments to keep existing homeowners’ do-not-call registrations alive. What a waste.
What a waste that it took stakeholders; business, which was supposedly going to benefit from this bill; and the parliament, in particular the opposition and Senate committee processes, to do the homework that the government should have done but, as usual, failed to do in preparing the Do Not Call Register proposal without any sort of evidence based policy. Why all that waste when all this bill was ever based upon was a ministerial whim? That is what it was. In evidence given to Senate inquiries into the bill, Senator Conroy said:
It has been a particular concern of mine that unwanted and unsolicited calls and faxes are wasting valuable business resources …
He said that in an attempt to justify the proposition that businesses should be able to register themselves on the Do Not Call Register—a proposition which is now no longer part of the bill. I then asked:
Do you have evidence from business?
Senator Conroy said:
Businesses that choose to register their number clearly want protection against telemarketing calls. If they do not, then they do not have to.
That is code from Minister Conroy for ‘We will build it and they will come’—the same sort of code that he is using for the National Broadband Network. His faith was ‘Build the Do Not Call Register and they will come.’ Through the Senate committee process he finally learnt that business would not come. The Senate committee heard, ‘What conscientious CEO would care to register his or her business on the Do Not Call Register, effectively saying, “My business is closed for business”?’ Minister Conroy would have realised, had he done his homework, that the very businesses that were supposedly going to benefit from the Do Not Call Register would not have put themselves on the register in the first place.
He also would have realised that his proposition would not work, because the bill failed to distinguish between so-called telemarketing calls to business and normal business-to-business calls—so much so that pretty much every business making everyday commercial phone calls would have been forced to call a Do Not Call Register authority to check that the very business they wanted to call was not registered on the Do Not Call Register. This presented the absolutely absurd proposition that almost every business would have to call a register to see if a recipient of their call was on it when, in fact, the register would likely be empty. That was proven through the Senate committee process by the relevant department confessing, firstly, that they had no proof of how many businesses would register for the Do Not Call Register if the bill were to proceed in its original form. Secondly, they had no idea, no mapping and no cost-benefit analysis of the number of occasions on which a business wanting to make outgoing phone calls to another business would have to check with the Do Not Call Register, what it would cost them to do so, for what period of time a so-called washed list of numbers you could call would last and what the consequences of that would be. The government had not done its policy homework.
So we have wasted all this time and all this industry resource and effort essentially on a minister’s whim: ‘Let me build it and they will come.’ The Australian people are entitled to ask whether it will be exactly the same with the same minister and his ‘Let me build the National Broadband Network and they will come’.",SENATE,<title>DO NOT CALL REGISTER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-05-13,"—I thank senators for their contributions on the Do Not Call Register Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This is, of course, noncontroversial legislation. This bill expands the class of numbers that can be listed on the Do Not Call Register and allows for a change to the registration period which initially will be set at five years for both existing registrations and future registrations. I commend the bill.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-05-13,"—I seek leave to incorporate for the information of honourable senators the Leader of the Opposition’s response to the budget speech, delivered by Mr Abbott in the House of Representatives earlier this evening.
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Of the three budgets delivered by the Rudd Government, this is the most political, the least believable, and the most damaging to Australia’s long term future. It’s a typical, old-fashioned, tax-and-spend Labor Budget that also features all the debt and deficit that can be expected from Labor, only covered up by clever accounting and a great big new tax on mining.
If the government’s revenues really had exceeded expenditure, it would be entitled to claim prudent economic management. What the government has actually delivered, though, as opposed to talk about, is a $57 billion deficit this year – the biggest ever. What the government is actually doing now, as opposed to promising in three years time, is borrowing $700 million every week till then.
Brazenly, the government wants credit for a surplus that doesn’t yet exist and that it’s unlikely ever to achieve. The surplus that it says will happen in three years time is based on increased taxes and on the growth that those increased taxes will almost certainly strangle.
That $1 billion surplus is roughly the amount required to fix the pink batts program that’s been linked to four deaths; the amount required to pay for the extra detention measures needed because the government has lost control of our borders; or the blow out in the computers in schools programme. It’s roughly half the blow-out in the school hall programme.
Does anybody seriously believe, based on this record, that a re-elected Rudd government could avoid another, surplus-shattering disaster sometime in the next three years?
It took the last Labor government thirteen years to accumulate $96 billion of debt but this Labor Government expects to do the same in less than half the time. It took a change of government to get Labor’s debt paid off last time and, once again, the quickest way to get rid of this debt will be to get rid of this government.
Everyone wants our country to succeed and many still hope that our Prime Minister is up to the job but there’s always this question: why should his latest promises turn out to be more credible than the ones that he’s already broken? Amidst all the self-congratulation about how historic this budget is, you almost expected the Prime Minister to declare that fixing the deficit is the greatest moral challenge of our time.
In his 2007 Budget reply, the then opposition leader, now the Prime Minister said “we must remain committed to keeping taxes low”. But he has just increased the cigarette tax and added a new mining tax to the 125 separate taxes that Australia already has.
He said then that a Labor government would withdraw an existing regulation for every new one imposed on business. In office, he has introduced 9997 new or amended regulations and withdrawn just 52.
He said then that he would pursue “a conservative fiscal policy” but proceeded to unleash the greatest spending spree in Australian history, turning a $20 billion surplus into a $27 billion deficit in just one year.
The Prime Minister said then that he was committed to “working families hit hard by the cost of mortgage repayments, food prices, petrol…and childcare”. His spendathon has contributed to six interest rate rises in the last eight months, with housing affordability at record lows and a $4500 a year hit on families with a $300,000 mortgage.
He’s abandoned his fuel watch and grocery watch schemes, though prices keep going up, and he’s dumped his childcare commitment after building less than 40 of the promised 260 centres.
The Prime Minister said then that the “economic cost of not acting (on climate change) will be far greater than the cost of taking early and responsible action”.  As recently as November he said that to delay action would be “absolute political cowardice”, and an “absolute failure of leadership”.
But he now won’t do anything about it till sometime next term for fear of fighting an election on tax. Instead, there’s a different great big new tax that will now be the issue on which the election turns.
Mr Rudd observed in 2007 that “mining booms don’t last forever”. They certainly don’t when governments threaten to kill them with a new tax that will eventually choke the goose that’s laid the golden egg for Australia. Despite its name, this is not a normal tax on super profits. It’s a super tax on normal profits.
Every company extracting non-renewable resources will have to pay an additional 40 per cent tax, as well as normal tax, once its rate of return on capital exceeds the long term bond rate or about 6 per cent. The new tax applies to the extraction of phosphate, sand and stone as well as to the extraction of minerals, oil and gas. It’s a tax on small quarries as well as big miners.
It will impact on the price of fertilisers and building materials as well as on the price of energy. It’s a triple whammy tax on the jobs of half a million mining and related workers, on the superannuation of millions of retirees with mining shares and on the cost of living of everyone who uses power.
It will increase the effective rate of tax on all mining from 44 to 57 per cent. Already, Australia heavily taxes the extraction of resources. The proposed new 57 per cent rate would make Australian taxes the highest in the world.
It’s amazing how quickly BHP and Rio Tinto have gone from being lionized to demonized. The government says that this new tax is needed to stop foreign companies ripping us off. In fact, there would be no wealth to redistribute if those same companies and their shareholders had not invested serious money to turn untapped resources into national wealth.
Imposing a prohibitive rate of tax on returns above 6 per cent sends an implicit message to business people that they would be better off putting their money in the bank. After all, who would bother to take the risks of investing in actual production if there’s an extra penalty on success?
This great big new tax has already put all investment decisions on hold. Rio has said that its investment in Australia will be reviewed. Xstrata has indefinitely suspended new exploration in north Queensland. BHP has raised doubts about new coal mines in Queensland, iron ore and uranium mines in Western Australia and, particularly, the $22 billion expansion of the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia.
It is hard to overstate the seriousness of this. A 40 per cent tax on so called super profits coupled with a 40 per cent government rebate for losses penalizes good projects and rewards the duds. Perversely, it gives an unfair advantage to projects backed by foreign sovereign wealth funds which won’t need to satisfy normal commercial risk assessment. These projects could then transfer price profits out of Australia and sell ventures at a loss subsidised by Australian taxpayers.
By this budget’s bizarre logic, putting a new tax on cigarettes means less smoking but putting a new tax on resources means more mining. If this tax is going to be so good for the resources sector, why aren’t other industries lining up to beg for a super profits tax to be imposed on them?
The budget formula assumes the best terms of trade in 60 years, assumes that higher taxes have no impact on investment, assumes a 4 per cent growth rate and, presto, the deficit disappears three years early without the need for any hard decisions. If only company promoters could get away with such a prospectus.
Yet if growth really is such a sure thing, why does the government also keep warning that “we’re not out of the woods yet”?
A responsible government would understand that it’s better to reform your way through hard times than to try to spend your way out of them. Even the worthy-sounding measures in this budget are unlikely to make much difference to the real problems that people face.
The government’s savings cameo, for instance, has a person earning just $40,000 a year putting aside $50 a week for several years to generate $20,000 in savings bank deposits for a $177 a year tax break. No one with any idea of the cost pressures on low income earners would find this very plausible.
More GP “super clinics” sound like a good idea too except that 36 were promised at the last election and only two are actually operational. In fact, fee-for-service under Medicare has already produced hundreds of private sector equivalents and these don’t deserve unfair competition from government-funded rivals.
Of course, there should be an electronic health record but hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent to make this a reality and no more should be spent until it’s certain that we’re not throwing good money after bad.
Of course, there should be more defence spending but not to produce 1500 more “suits” and 500 fewer “uniforms”. In these respects, this budget is more about looking good than doing good.
Before the last election, Labor promised to eliminate wasteful government advertising. Instead, it’s eliminated auditor-general scrutiny of government ad campaigns and has just put aside $74 million for taxpayer funded pre-election blitzes about climate change, the national broadband network and hospital reform.  
Then there’s the dishonesty of the government’s sales pitch. The mining tax was not a recommendation of the Henry review. Henry recommended a replacement tax not an additional one and an offsetting 5 per cent not a 2 per cent cut in corporate tax.
The mining tax does not fund the increased superannuation. That’s funded by a separate 3 per cent levy on payroll that will be an additional cost to business or forgone wages to workers.
The mining tax is not an onshore version of the existing resource rent tax on offshore projects.  That tax substituted for state royalties which don’t apply offshore, was prospective not retrospective, and only cuts in after a much higher rate of return.
If a 6 per cent rate of return is a “super” profit for mining, how can it be just “modest” for the government-owned national broadband network – as one minister claimed - and what other unpopular industries might be the next target of penalty taxes?
It’s true that Australia has so far survived the Global Financial Crisis in better shape than almost any other nation. The issue is whether this success is due to the spending spree of the current government or to the reforms of previous ones; whether it’s due to the government’s management skills or to our resource exports to China? The question, I think, only has to be asked for the answer to be obvious.
There is a low road and a high road to achieving a surplus. The high road is expenditure restraint and economic reform. The low road is increasing taxes and making assumptions about economic growth.
The budget’s projections depend more on the success of the Chinese economy than on any decisions that the Rudd government has taken. In opposition, Labor often accused the then government of riding the China boom.
Say what you like about John Howard and Peter Costello but they didn’t shirk the hard reform and they didn’t need to hit miners with extra tax to generate a surplus. Their surpluses were the result of tough decisions, not new taxes.
Let me make this clear: the Coalition will oppose the mining tax in opposition and we will rescind it in government.
I have one message for Mr Rudd. It’s one he should be familiar with: this reckless spending must stop.
Until Labor’s debt and deficit has been dealt with it’s not hardness of heart but economic prudence to say “no” even to good causes. In other circumstances, you could fund a company tax cut and depreciation allowances for small business but not at the cost of an economy-stopping tax on our most successful export industry.
It would be robbing Peter to pay Paul and playing to the kind of class war envy that Mr Rudd’s Labor predecessors have mostly been too honourable to exploit.
It’s my goal to return the budget to surplus at least as quickly as the government proposes but not the lazy way through a great big new tax that threatens miners’ jobs, retirees’ incomes and everybody’s standard of living.
Fostering a savings culture is important but the government should come clean about whether higher superannuation contributions are to be paid out of workers’ pockets or by their employers. If it means an extra three per cent tax payroll tax on every business, that’s a $20 billion a year handbrake on economic growth.
The Coalition will spend more on health but only where we’re certain that extra spending will produce extra services. Improved Medicare rebates, for instance, would be a better way than phantom clinics to deliver improved primary care.
I’m happy to let the Labor Party win any race to raise taxes. Taxes and spending will always be lower and government will always be smaller under the Coalition. That should also mean that economic growth will be higher and that the size of government will always be about one per cent of GDP less under the Coalition.
For nine years, I was a minister in a government that delivered lower taxes and higher surpluses because it did not shirk the hard decisions needed to reform our economy. I was part of a government that understood that you can’t spend what you haven’t got and that you can only create real wealth by hard work.
I know, as anyone who has spent time in remote indigenous townships should, that you can’t have much of a community without an economy to sustain it.
The first principle of government should be: “do no harm”. The Coalition wants lower taxes, smaller government and greater freedom. It wants a fair go for families and respect for institutions that have stood the test of time. These instincts are in our DNA.
The Coalition wants an Australia that is prosperous, united and respected; where families’ choices are taken seriously by government; where pensioners and carers are regarded as people who have served and are serving our country; where officials understand that the public are their masters not their servants; where migrants are welcome but borders are secure; where people’s taxes give them decent hospitals and proper highways; and where the armed forces represent our country’s best values. But we also know that government can’t solve all problems immediately and that over-promising and under-delivering politicians are the cause of so much cynicism about public life.
A good cause never justifies wasting money. On coming to government the Coalition would immediately restructure the school hall programme and provide further funding to school communities, not to state bureaucracies. Parents are normally better than bureaucrats at getting value for their school.
The latest industry data suggests that, had parents been distributing the money, they could have obtained almost twice the build for half the spend.
Likewise, the Coalition won’t go ahead with the National Broadband Network avoiding the creation of a $43 billion white elephant. Better access to faster broadband should not mean a new nationalized telecommunications monopoly and Telstra shareholders should not have their assets subject to coerced acquisition.
The former government’s workplace reforms went too far but they helped to create more than 2 million new jobs, lift real wages by 20 per cent and more than double net household wealth between 1996 and 2007. We’ll seek to take the unfair dismissal monkey off the back of small businesses which are more like families than institutions.
We’ll make Labor’s transitional employment agreements less transitional and Labor’s individual flexibility agreements more flexible. We have faith in Australian workers who are not as easily pushed around and exploited as the ACTU’s dishonest ad campaign is already making out.
If elected, we will be faithful to the liberal conservative tradition. But we will strive to be better than the former government, not just a copy of it. We will be a contemporary government, not just a conservative one.
For starters, there’ll be a fair dinkum paid parental leave scheme which gives women six months leave at their full pay. That’s real time and real money to care for their newborns.
Parental leave is a workplace entitlement not a welfare one. It should be paid for by business but not in way which could lead to discrimination against female staff or hurt small business. Only the Labor Party habitually increases businesses’ cost burden and if the current government had not completely blown the surplus it wouldn’t be necessary.
But all benefits have to be paid for and the fairest way to have a paid parental leave scheme anytime soon is through a modest levy on companies’ taxable income over $5 million a year. It will be a universal scheme but, importantly, won’t mean any extra cost for small business.
The Coalition’s paid parental leave policy is good for women who will finally have more realistic choices to combine work and family. It’s good for all those families that need two incomes to pay the mortgage helping them when they are most financially vulnerable.
And it’s good for the economy which won’t lose some of the best workers because they can’t do justice both to their jobs and to their families. More freedom for mothers to work, if that’s their choice, is a productivity measure not just a social reform.
The Coalition will fight Mr Rudd’s means test on the private health insurance rebate because it’s yet another one of his broken promises and because strong private hospitals take the pressure off public waiting lists.
It’s previously been calculated that every dollar the government spends on the rebate brings more private money into healthcare saving two dollars that government would otherwise have to spend on health. As well, we’ll ensure that Medibank Private really is private by selling it and using the proceeds to reduce government debt.
Before becoming Prime Minister, Mr Rudd attacked the “bloating” of the federal bureaucracy but has since added nearly 20,000 to the 258,000-strong Australian Public Service.
To rein in spending, the Coalition will introduce a two year recruitment freeze to reduce public servant numbers through natural attrition. The freeze will apply on an agency-by-agency basis but uniformed and frontline service positions including, for example, the federal police, customs and quarantine, the Australian Defence Force and Centrelink customer service staff will be excluded.
There will be no redundancies but for two years 6,000 bureaucrats who retire or resign each year will not be replaced. This should deliver a modest reduction in public sector numbers without compromising essential services and save about $4 billion over the forward estimates.
As well, the Coalition would not proceed with the budget increase to the renewable energy future fund and will cut government advertising by 25 per cent. These savings will pay for the Coalition’s direct action on climate change policy, the Green Army and the retention of the current private health insurance rebate.
 Next Wednesday at the National Press Club, Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey will announce further measures to reduce spending and to increase productivity including a detailed response to the new spending and new savings proposals in the budget.
The final costing and funding details of Coalition policy will be released nearer the election but all policies will be fully costed and fully funded because the Australian people are entitled to reassurance that the alternative government’s promises are responsible and achievable.  
The Coalition has changed over the past two and a half years. We’ve heeded the lessons of defeat. We’ve learnt from our mistakes.
We know, unlike our opponents, that governments shouldn’t ignore expert advice about the lethal dangers of their programmes, shouldn’t decide to change the health system without taking the premiers into their confidence and shouldn’t decide, with minimal Treasury input, to put a new tax on mining without first talking to the people whose livelihoods are on the line.
The government has changed too. It no longer seems to stand for many of the things it used to, like combating climate change and ending the blame game. Conversely, it does seem to stand for things that no one would once have expected, like a chronic inability to take advice and a dangerous tendency to make policy on the run.
In the end, it’s a judgment about who can be trusted with the fate of the country that decides elections. This budget rests on the government’s new mining tax and the election should turn on this too.
Australia’s future depends on the bulk carriers travelling to Asia just as surely as it once rode on the sheep’s back. This election, like the budget, will pit a party that thinks it’s reasonable to make Australian miners the world’s highest taxed against one that doesn’t.
The die is cast. Neither side will retreat. The only way to stop this great big new tax on the people who saved us from the recession is to change the government.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,48,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2010-05-13,"—It gives me great pleasure to speak tonight on the alternatives which the Australian Greens would have put forward in the budget context and will be moving to implement in this parliament, in the consequent parliament and in coming fiscal years. I first of all want to pay a tribute to my colleagues, Senators Christine Milne, Rachel Siewert, Sarah Hanson-Young and Scott Ludlam, who are prodigious workers in this place and who ensure that the Greens as the third political party in this nation are not only across all issues but in advance of the big parties in advocating alternatives for a nation which badly needs a lead, which badly needs innovation, which badly needs imagination in politics and which badly needs a closer connection with the Australian people, who pay us to be here.
A little less than a year ago, the country was faced with the prospect of recession. All of us will remember the projections from Treasury, which showed that by the final quarter of last year we would be in recession unless the government acted swiftly in the face of the global downturn. In that circumstance, in February last year the government brought forward a package of some $42 billion to stimulate the economy. The first thing the opposition did, the Liberal and National parties, was to announce that they would block that stimulus program. That immediately threw the challenge to us Greens. In consideration with my colleagues, we recognised that while we did not support all the components of such a huge taking of taxpayers’ money and applying it to, in no small measure, the big end of town as well as to such worthy projects as a building program for 9,000 schools across this country, we would support that package and we did so.
We took the responsible option of negotiating with Treasurer Swan, the Prime Minister and several other ministers to improve that package. As a result, a jobs dividend came from the Greens work and thousands more Australians were employed. Not only that, those people who did not survive with their businesses or jobs intact got a much better deal from the government to tide them over until the worst of the recession had passed. We Greens are proud of that arrangement we made with government. It did involve $100 million to stimulate jobs right across rural and regional Australia, including in the refurbishment of this nation’s great heritage, for which there was no budget line until the Greens arrived and got $60 million put into these job-rich projects, and another $40 million for bikeways in all states and territories of the country.
We are also aware now that, in hindsight, it is the consensus of social commentators and economists that it was that stimulus package which the Greens made possible—and I pay tribute to our two crossbench colleagues, by the way, who were essential to its success—that prevented the country from heading to double-digit unemployment, and we are talking about hundreds of thousands of Australians out of work had the coalition succeeded in its negative attitude, which is ‘block everything the Labor government puts forward’. In this budget the country now has a forecast of 4.75 per cent unemployment by next year. What a remarkable achievement that is. Without the Greens that would not have happened. We are very proud of the role we took, responsibly, in the economic management of this country when the National and Liberal coalition failed at a moment of crisis for the nation.
Climate change is still coming rapidly upon the planet, and Australia is one of the most exposed and potentially damaged countries in the world. Yet the government has decided to set aside for three years further action on climate change, and the opposition have a polyglot of proposals which do not take government responsibility seriously should they be elected to government. Faced with a proposal which included a $20 billion waste of public money, if I correctly interpret the Grattan report of just a couple of weeks ago, the Greens have been proven right in not accepting the government’s proposal nor its failure to adequately tackle climate change with a prescription for five per cent downturn in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 rather than 25 to 40 per cent, which is required if we are really going to be successful in protecting the Great Barrier Reef, our snowfields, the productivity of the Murray-Darling Basin and a great deal more that is at stake in Australia in the coming century.
Instead, the Greens earlier this year took up Professor Garnaut’s proposal for an interim carbon tax. You will know the details of that. I want simply to point to what some of the commentators have said about the Greens’ proposal, which in this parliament and in the run to the election is the only consistent, nationally directed action plan to tackle climate change. I might add that, rather than costing taxpayers billions of dollars, as the government’s ETS proposal would be doing in this and subsequent budgets, the Greens’ proposal would bring in some $10 billion a year from a pollution tax on the 1,000 biggest polluters in the country, $5 billion of it earmarked to help households facing climate change right across the country. It would be a community dividend as well as a stimulus to business and a reorienting of our economy to green in an age when we must do that if we are going to face the challenge of much bigger and stronger economies—witness China and India for two.
Dr Frank Jotzo, a leading environmental economist from the Australian National University and an adviser to the original Garnaut review, said the Greens’ proposal:
… is a very sensible proposal. It was first suggested by Professor Garnaut to start the emissions trading scheme system with a fixed price and I believe that it’s even more relevant now in the political deadlock that we’re finding in Parliament.
Mr Acting Deputy President, on carbon tax generally you might listen to these comments from Geoff Carmody—no Green but a co-founder of Access Economics and before that a senior officer in the Commonwealth Treasury—who said:
A carbon tax allows a steady, predictable, ramping up of the price of carbon over time, allowing business (and, ultimately, consumers) to plan against this prospect and shift to lower emissions technology and more efficiency in energy use.
Professor Joseph Stiglitz from Columbia University, a Nobel laureate, said:
Economic efficiency requires that those who generate emissions pay the cost, and the simplest way of forcing them to do so is through a carbon tax … Indeed, it makes far more sense to tax bad things, like pollution, than to tax good things like work and savings.
Dr Richard Denniss is Executive Director of the Australia Institute and an adjunct associate professor in economics at the ANU. He said:
But the beauty of a carbon tax compared to an emissions trading scheme is that it is easy to design complementary policies, such as investments in energy efficiency, public transport and renewable energy, to augment the impact of a carbon tax.
Professor William Nordhouse, Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale, said:
The international community should move quickly to replace the current cap-and-trade structure with one in which the central economic mechanism is a tax on greenhouse-gas emissions.
These are comments that absolutely back the wisdom of the Greens’ proposal for a carbon tax at $23 a tonne of emissions now, ramping up at four per cent plus CPI into the future, allowing the way for a much more successful emissions trading option or carbon tax option in the future. It is to be noted that carbon taxes have been imposed in Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom, for example. As Kenneth Davidson commented in the Age last year:
Sweden is the most successful country in the world in reducing its carbon footprint … Between 1990 and 2006 Sweden cut its emissions by 9 per cent, exceeding the target set by Kyoto, while at the same time real growth increased 44 per cent.
This Greens prescription is central to the emerging political reality that it is the Greens who will present a positive alternative when neither of the big parties steps up to the mark with proposals that meet the biggest potential economic challenge of the age, which is climate change.
Finally, I quote Professor James Hansen, the director of NASA’s Goddard Institute and dubbed ‘the godfather of climate science’, who was in Australia recently and was quoted in the Age. He said:
If we had a democracy where decisions were based on the public’s best interest, then that—
that is, the Greens’ proposal—
would be taken up in a heartbeat … Neither of the major parties gets it—or they don’t want to get it.
That speaks for itself.
The mining boom tax has been seriously panned by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, in the House of Representatives tonight. It cannot pass notice here, of course, that the government’s proposed mining boom tax, which the Greens support, is a progressive tax on the huge, multibillion-dollar profits coming to the big mining corporations, which, as the Prime Minister pointed out, have massive transfer of funds overseas from those profits, using the Australian people’s own ore resource in the Australian ground.
I remember, because I was in this place, that the GST was favoured by Mr Abbott in the Howard government. It was a regressive tax which hit people right across the board. The lower your income, the greater was the impact of the tax. Mr Abbott tonight spoke about the impact of a mining boom tax on average Australians. As the Greens see it, properly applied it will be a boon for average Australians, not like the GST, which as a fundraiser has added a great deal to Australian society but which hit the poor much harder than it did the very wealthy, the multimillionaires, who are organising the current protest against this mining boom tax.
The Greens would, however, see a sovereign fund set up, as the Norwegians have done with their windfall profits from mining and from the petroleum and gas reserves of the North Sea. That small country, with fewer than five million people, has put aside $450 billion for its future infrastructure and the progress of its society. The Australian government would do well to do the same. The Greens will be pursuing that strongly when legislation comes into this parliament, if it does, in the coming year to ensure that we wisely put aside money for the nation’s future and not simply return it, as the government would do, to instant proposals, including the building of infrastructure for the very same mining corporations to export coal faster through taxpayer funded railways and port facilities—including those on the Great Barrier Reef—to line the pockets of people other than average Australians.
The Australian Greens support the government’s $7.3 billion per annum health reform package, as we did the private health insurance rebate, which was unsuccessful in this Senate but which was supported by the Greens alone when the government brought it forward earlier this year. We are very strong advocates for better spending in the areas of mental health and dental health for this country. We believe we now have the resources to do that and we should be pursuing it. The Greens are calling for a minimum of $350 million per annum for mental health over the next four years. That would put $100 million a year worth of incentives at the primary care level to target those in need—the vulnerable and long-term clientele within the community and the NGO sector. That would also afford $150 million per year for early intervention mental health programs, including the youth mental health service, ‘headspace’, and early psychosis prevention services. It would also mean $100 million a year for alternatives to emergency department treatment such as multidisciplinary community based subacute services that support stepped or two-stage prevention and recovery care for people suffering mental problems or illnesses.
Denticare is the clear concept of paralleling Medicare by ensuring that all Australians have ready and easy access to dental health care. The failure of government to provide dental health care to everybody in this country remains a black hole—caries—in the delivery of health care in the country. A full national scheme would cost about $4.8 billion per annum. One billion dollars or so is spent on dental health care in current schemes. We could well fund that amount by, for example, reducing the fuel tax credit scheme for miners by $1.7 billion. How much better to be putting that into dental health care for people who have to wait months otherwise for treatment of their dental problems. We could add to that the rethinking of the $0.7 billion for coal and mining infrastructure out of the mining boom tax, which I just referred to. The $1 billion per annum dished out each year in the fringe benefit tax rebate on corporate vehicle fleets could be diverted to a national dental healthcare system. This is no great difficulty. It is just a failure of policy, imagination and carry-through from both the big parties. This has been advocated for decades, but it is the Greens here who have funding proposals for a national dental healthcare system—funded from the wealth of this country at the moment.
On some particulars from the Rudd government’s budget, I note that there is $27 billion over six years on roads. We are in peak oil. We are facing an enormous cost, both in pollution and in real costs for transport, if we depend upon the road system. We Greens would do much more to advance public transport, bikeways and a high-speed rail system. It will not have passed your notice that the government and the opposition both in the last few days have voted down the Greens proposal for a feasibility study into high-speed rail. It is an extraordinary failure not just of imagination but also of determination not to look at this proposal. The proposal is a must for this nation’s future. It is a proposal for high-speed rail linking the big cities of the eastern seaboard, and later all the big cities of this country. We see it going ahead apace in Saudi Arabia; in Argentina; in the United States; in the United Kingdom; in China, where a train recently reached 510 kilometres an hour; and in France, where standard high-speed rail is at 340 kilometres an hour. But in Australia we have two major parties who cannot step up to the plate, who are failures when it comes to the delivery of innovative public transport and who have even voted down a proposal to even look at high-speed rail in 2010. It is a proposal which I wrote to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, about today—again—saying, ‘Let’s get together and talk about this.’ A $10 million injection of funds would get world’s best expertise into Australia in the coming 12 months so that we could look at this fantastic high-speed rail facility—not least between Sydney and Melbourne, the third or fourth busiest air route in the world. Passengers could comfortably travel between those two cities in peak hours as quickly as, if not faster than, they can at the moment by air. They have to travel through peak hour traffic and go through all the delays in airports. Instead, they can travel in comfort while being able to access computers, mobile phones and entertainment en route.
Unemployment benefits still sit at $231 per week. Through the actions of the Greens, pensions were raised last year by $30 to $332. We would lift the decreasing number—if projections are right for the next year—of people employed in this country. Unemployment is decreasing because of Greens actions—following on a Labor government proposal for the stimulus package—out of that level way below the poverty line.
The $2 billion being spent on Christmas Island at the moment is the most expensive way to deliver a system for vetting refugees coming to this country from extraordinary circumstances. Senator Hanson-Young has put forward the much more cogent, humane and cheaper options that the Greens would pursue there.
Overseas aid languishes at 0.33 per cent of gross national income, and the government’s target is 0.5 per cent by the year 2015, when it should be one per cent. Included in that aid is $760 million, or some proportion of that, committed by the government at Copenhagen for helping poorer countries in our neighbourhood and elsewhere tackle their own problems with climate change. This was taken out of our aid budget, against the United Nations’ wishes, instead of coming from other funds.
Now we have a childcare rebate pegged at $7,500—that is $500 less per child for eligible parents—which saves only $86 million in an area where there is a need for an injection of funds to meet the quality performance that government quite rightly is now putting into the area. But it is an area that is being neglected and squeezed because the government is applying the squeeze. The Greens see that as a basic need for parents and children across this country if the country is going to have the future it should have.
I might note here some of the other innovations which do not strictly come into the budget speeches of the government or the opposition but which the Greens have initiated in this place in recent years and which we are proud of but which have been knocked off because the big parties simply will not move in the region. One is euthanasia legislation, backed by more than 80 per cent of the Australian populace. Even when I moved to restore the territories’ right—the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory—to legislate in this area, again both the big parties opposed it. Another step was legislation to ensure that Australians are not involved in aiding the Japanese killer whaling fleets of the south—opposed by both parties. Container deposit legislation has had no chance in here under either coalition or Labor governments. Senator Milne’s national feed-in tariff, which would be a great boon to renewable energy, is not seeing the light of day despite experts in the field and business calling for this innovation, which other countries have had for years. A referendum on the republic gained great applause at the Prime Minister’s 2020 forum but there has been no action there at all. Truth in political advertising, which has been proposed by the Greens, was voted down by both the big political parties—that speaks for itself. I referred to high-speed rail earlier. There was the proposal that junk food advertising be banned in children’s TV viewing hours—the scourge of obesity cuts across the health and lifespan of increasing numbers of Australian citizens but, ‘no’ say the big parties to a simple move towards offsetting obesity by banning junk food advertising aimed at children in children’s TV viewing hours.
Yesterday I brought forward legislation to give citizens a far better go in the banking system, including to prohibit the rip-off $2 which banks charge at ATMs to citizens from pensioners right through if they happen to go to an ATM which is not that of their own bank. The legislation requires basic no-cost banking services for people who have simple banking needs wherever they might be in this country. Also, of course, there is the 26 weeks paid parental leave with super, which the Greens not only have before this parliament but will continue to promote, because that is at best standard fare in similar countries around the world. It is every parent’s and every child’s right in this nation in 2010.
I note tonight that the coalition is about to extend the threat to the Australian Public Service with a freeze for two years on new public service jobs. Imagine the incentive that will be for young people who have aspired to study hard and gain themselves a place in the service of the nation when we have an Abbott government saying, ‘If we get in, your road will be blocked now for at least the next two years.’ I quote from the opposition’s shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, on ABC TV’s Lateline as recently as April—apparently not understanding that there are 200-plus members of parliament here who do not bake bread, who do not fill potholes and who are not serving in Afghanistan—slinging off at the Public Service, without which this country would not be what it is and who work in the country’s interest. This sneering by the coalition had Mr Hockey saying:
There are 5,000 people in the Department of Health in Canberra and they don’t treat one patient—
and—
There’s 5,000 people in the Department of Education and they don’t teach one pupil.
The threat of the axe hangs above public servants right across this country. There are 2,000 facing it in the current Labor budget, but that will extend to tens of thousands if an Abbott government is elected. The voters of the ACT in particular, but also in my home state of Tasmania, which has a very healthy public service, will be looking carefully at that threat because it cuts right across their future employment and the employment of their children.
There has arisen to public notice in the last few days a wonderful opportunity for this government if it will take it—that is, to end the many decades of contention about the fate of the great forests of south-east New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. There is a current collapse of that industry. It is due to a glut of wood from around the world. It has been predicted by the analysts, including Judith Ajani from the Australian National University, for many years. It has arrived. The industry is in such a parlous state that it has asked the Greens in Tasmania to meet with it in council to find some way forward. This is a remarkable opportunity to do as Labor Premier Geoff Gallop, following on the work of his Liberal predecessor in Western Australia, did in 2004. When the industry was restructured 29 national parks were created. They are now a huge boon for jobs and productivity in the south-west region of Western Australia. The contention, which pitted people so much against each other, was taken out of that issue. I note that over 80 per cent of Australians in all opinion polls want the end of the destruction of our great native forests and their wildlife. Here is an opportunity for the Rudd government to work with the three south-east states of Australia to indeed achieve a historic outcome for a very small, I believe, outlay which will be in the interests of that industry and, of course, in the interests of Australia’s heirloom forests going on into the future.
As we head for the election, the Greens have a very proud record of responsibility, of taking government proposals in this place and treating them genuinely, of working hard on them and of getting better outcomes. Unlike the coalition, we are not simply naysayers. We do not block simply for the sake of blocking. We are not simply oppositionists, as the coalition is. We believe that if you say no to something you should come up with a better alternative. That is our credo and we will continue to do that. We have a long-sided view for the security of this nation and its future. That is why we are the experts, with the only standing positive proposal on climate change before this parliament.
We will go to the election with a fresh and alternative but very progressive and economically sound outlook and a raft of policies for the people of Australia to consider. We will continue in our role in the Senate to be responsible and economically forward thinking, and we will do so should we win seats in the lower house. Post election, we commit to negotiating responsibly for better outcomes with whichever government is elected. We will go to the people of Australia with the policies I have put forward tonight and more. We look forward to this exercise in democracy and a greater green presence in this parliament—and not least in this Senate, the constructive backstop of democracy for the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,48,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-05-13,"—It is a great privilege to provide Family First’s budget-in-reply speech. On Tuesday night the Treasurer delivered a budget which was all smiles on the outside but, beneath the surface, it was hiding a dark underbelly. The budget might be more aptly called a gangland budget—smiles on the surface but a dark underbelly. It is a budget that promises financial responsibility but abandons its responsibility to ordinary, hardworking Australians—or, as the Rudd government calls them, working families.
Family First welcomes the news that the budget figures are better than last year. We are pleased that the return to a surplus will come three years earlier than expected. But the question is: at what price has this come? Where are the cuts and what are the clawbacks the Rudd government has forced onto the Australian people? Fiscal responsibility is more than just balancing the numbers; it is knowing where to spend and knowing where to cut. We need to ask if the government has got its priorities right. The answer is a clear no, because the Rudd government has ripped into some of the most important items for ordinary Australians while looking after its own den.
Firstly, the Rudd government’s budget has ripped into child care. That is right: our kids; our future. It has ripped into our kids and their parents. Of course, this means that the government has abandoned its pledge to help its ‘working families’ when it comes to accessible and affordable child care. It has done this by slashing the childcare rebate and putting mums and dads out of pocket by an extra $278 per child per year. For a family of two children, this means that the family budget will be worse off by more than $500. Any parent who pays more than $57.70 in childcare fees per day for five days a week will be worse off under this budget announced by the Rudd government. It is a kick in the guts to mums and dads who are already struggling to pay their childcare bills as it is. What is more, on top of this, the childcare rebate will no longer be indexed to the CPI like it has been in the past. This means that, as the childcare expenses go up and up each year, Australian families will be left more and more out of pocket. Instead of listening to the recommendations of the Henry tax review which suggest giving low-income families a 90 per cent subsidy for child care, the government has gone out and done the exact opposite, by hiking up the childcare costs for those who depend on it most.
This latest attack on working families comes only a few weeks after the government broke its election promise by scrapping plans to build 260 childcare centres. These 260 new childcare centres were badly needed because there are already many families who have trouble finding an affordable spot for their kids. The Prime Minister claims he is committed to helping working families. But how are working families supposed to go to work if there are not enough childcare centres to look after their kids at an affordable price? If childcare is too expensive for them to afford, how are they supposed to be ‘working families’? We know where that promise of 260 new childcare centres has gone. It has gone to the Labor election promise graveyard.
The second dark underbelly of the budget is housing affordability. Family First believes that the government has missed the mark when it comes to addressing this core issue for ordinary Australians of housing affordability. People trying to enter the property market will find it just as hard to buy a house, as the government has done nothing to make housing more affordable. Housing affordability is a crisis that is getting worse and worse and is being compounded by the fact that the government does not seem to care.
Housing prices in my home city of Melbourne went up 28 per cent in the 12 months to March this year, and in the past eight months interest rates have gone up by 1½ per cent. Put in real terms, this means that first home buyers who could not afford to get into the market last year have had to stump up $98,000 more to afford the average median home this year. And those who were under mortgage stress last year are now under even greater pressure and have to pay $270 more to the banks each month. What about the great Australian dream? It is the great Australian dream to own your home, and we should be doing everything we can to make it easier for people to live that dream. Instead, we have a government that does not care about housing affordability—and this budget does not give any hope to first home buyers.
I would liked to have seen the government look at the idea of letting first home buyers access part of their superannuation to put a deposit on a house so that they can at least get a foot in the door and have that great Australian dream of owning their home. Instead of making people wait 40 years until they can access their super, this money should be allowed to be partly put to another good use like owning your own home. This would not cost the taxpayer any money in government funding but would help go towards solving a housing crisis that is spiralling out of control. This would be a lifeline to thousands of young families desperately trying to escape the rent rut.
The third dark underbelly of the budget is medical costs. Family First is at a loss to understand the government’s decision to increase the net medical expenses tax offset from $1,500 to $2,000. It sounds like an increase but it is a slug on Australian families and their medical costs. I understand that some costs need to be reined in if we are to get this budget back into surplus but why would you go out and increase basic medical costs for those who need treatment the most? Why would you go out and make those people who are already paying the most for medical bills pay even more? The Rudd government has done this in a mean and tricky way by raising the net medical expenses tax offset. It sounds like it is better; it is worse. It does not make any sense. It is a heartless policy that slugs the sick and unwell.
What makes it all the worse is that, while the government is leaving families short-changed with their medical bills, the Prime Minister has given himself an extra 86 staff on top of the 65 additional staff he took on in last year’s budget. How many more people do you need? It just stinks to think that this is the second year in a row that Prime Minister Rudd has increased his staffing levels by more than 60 people. It is a real smack in the face to all Australians who are struggling to stay afloat when they see the Prime Minister feathering his own nest. At a time when Australians are told to cut back and make do, this excess by the Prime Minister is obscene.
The government cries poor and says it does not have the money to keep the net medical expenses tax offset as it is but it has no problems splashing out $18 million of taxpayers’ money to boost the Prime Minister’s office budget. I find the government’s priorities in this gangland budget amazingly warped. I find the government’s priorities all the more disturbing given that it is willing to spend cash on itself but when it comes to our veterans community this government is once again silent and pretends it has empty pockets.
Once again there is no mention in the budget of plans to implement a more appropriate and equitable indexation arrangement for the military superannuation schemes. It is a national disgrace the way this government has chosen to treat our veterans community and failed to recognise the unique nature of military service—and I think the government is going to get a whacking at the ballot box at the next election.
Family First does recognise that the budget allocates more spending on health reform and it is certainly a good thing that more money is going into this area of health; however, it is not enough just to pour money into health and leave it at that. We have to make sure that we are spending this money wisely. We need to get the best bang for our buck and ensure that this money actually goes towards fixing the health system once and for all—not just splashing it out on ineffective and useless reforms.
I still believe we need to be looking at the basics—that is, how many doctors, how many dentists, how many nurses, how many beds, how many other resources and how many other health professionals do we need per thousand people or per thousand families? This is what we have got to start to see. Once we work that out we need to look at whether there are enough doctors, dentists, nurses, beds, other resources and other health professionals in each region. Rather than just throwing money at it, surely we cannot continue to allow things to happen where we are turning away thousands of our young kids from studying medicine when we keep on importing doctors. It is ridiculous.
We should do this demand and supply planning immediately and urgently. Then we can look at this on a city basis, on a regional basis, on an outer suburban basis, on a country area basis and then on a state basis. Then you can work out whether we have got real health reform. The money needs to go directly to where the shortages are so that we stop living in a first-world country with a substandard health system.
This budget does not do enough for families and it does not deliver on the key areas which affect ordinary Australians. This budget is disappointing and Family First look forward to sitting down with the government and working together with them on making it work better for all Australians.
Debate (on motion by Senator Arbib) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>BUDGET</title>,<title>Statement and Documents</title>,Budget,48,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-05-13,—I table a statement relating to the order for the production of documents concerning the mako shark and porbeagle shark.,SENATE,<title>MAKO/PORBEAGLE SHARK FISHING</title>,<title>Return to order</title>,Motions,49,1
"Farrell, Sen Don",ALP,2010-05-13,"—I rise tonight to pay tribute to the work of St Vincent de Paul, especially in my home state of South Australia. More particularly, I want to draw the attention of all Australians to its national fundraising campaign, the CEO Sleepout. As I am someone raised and schooled in the Catholic tradition, St Vinnies, as perhaps the most identifiable Catholic charity, has long been on my landscape, particularly in its work for the homeless in South Australia.
Because of the depth and breadth of the Adelaide parklands and their heavy use by pedestrians and cyclists, homelessness is perhaps more readily apparent in Adelaide than in many other places. It is hard to ignore the scruffy camps, the makeshift swags of old blankets and cardboard and the blue plastic carry bags stashed under the bushes while the owners move around the city in search of food and lodging.
As I am sure you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, it is hard to ignore the people drifting across the lawns of Whitmore Square as evening draws near—homeless men hoping to get an early place in the queue for a bed and hot meal at the Vincentian Centre. The Vincentian Centre is a special work of the St Vincent de Paul Society in South Australia. The St Vinnies Night Shelter, as it was known for a long time, first opened in May 1961 and it has never closed its doors since. The new Vincentian Centre was built in 2002-03 at a cost of just under $3 million.
The centre is funded by the Saint Vincent de Paul Society South Australia Inc., by the South Australian Department of Families and Communities under the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, and by corporate and private sponsors. Professional staff—I had the opportunity just recently to meet them—deliver services to the homeless, and volunteers play a vital role in supporting the shelter in areas such as food preparation, maintenance and cleaning duties. The Vincentian Centre can accommodate up to 49 homeless men from the ages of 18 years up every night of the year and it also provides a range of services such as crisis accommodation, meals, showers, assessment needs, comprehensive case management services, referrals to other organisations and social support.
During the 2008-09 financial year the Vincentian Centre provided 9,531 bed spaces, 2,698 breakfasts, 6,573 evening meals and 4,797 suppers. St Vinnies also runs Fred’s Van—as you would be aware, Mr President—a mobile food service for homeless people comprising four vans operating in seven Adelaide locations: Adelaide city, Salisbury, Elizabeth, Gawler, Christies Beach, Semaphore and Ferryden Park.
The causes of homelessness make for a depressing litany of social ills. There is family or relationship breakdown, drug and/or alcohol addiction, mental health issues, income support issues, lack of access to affordable and safe housing, lack of living skills and gambling addiction—indeed a wide range of issues. The Vincentian Centre seeks to assist clients to address their problems in all of these areas. Homelessness is tsunami-like in proportion and charities like St Vinnies cannot even begin to address the magnitude of the problem without help and support from government, the private sector and the general public.
The mining magnate Lang Hancock once said that the best way of helping the poor was not to become one of them. I never took too much notice of Lang Hancock and in this instance he was clearly wrong. On Thursday 17 June 2010 the St Vinnies major homeless fundraiser, the CEO Sleepout, will take place in capital cities across Australia. Despite Lang Hancock’s exhortation, the CEO Sleepout invites people at the upper end of the socioeconomic scale to become one of the poor for the night to experience directly for themselves the humiliation, the desperation and the privation of homelessness.
Money is raised, certainly, but it is hoped that the people who participate go out into the community with fresh insights to drive change and progress on this very serious issue. The CEO Sleepout is a really creative way of engaging our business and community leaders, helping those of us who are fortunate enough to confront homelessness and destitution firsthand to understand just what the realities are. It is only by becoming one of the homeless ourselves, by experiencing it ourselves, that we can even begin to understand. It is only by truly understanding that we can start to put together truly meaningful solutions.
There are a range of CEOs and community leaders sleeping out on 17 June in Adelaide. I do not have time to acknowledge all of these South Australian participants, but they include, in no particular order: Ian Stone, the managing director of RAA; Claude Piscioneri, the district manager of ANZ Bank; Kristin Jeffery, the sales manager for Scott Salisbury Homes; Leesa Vlahos, the very new member for Taylor in South Australia; Stuart Price, the CEO of Kelly and Co. Lawyers; Philip Rundle, the managing director of CB Richard Ellis; Tom Kenyon, the recently re-elected member for Newland in South Australia; Rainer Jozeps, the chief executive of the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra; Jenny Brinkworth, the director of Catholic Communications for the Archdiocese of Adelaide; Tony Sherbon, the chief executive of the Department of Health; Matthew Evins, the managing director of Banner Hardware; Richard Ryan, the chairman of Editure Limited; John Haren, of course, the CEO of St Vincent de Paul itself; and last, but by no means least, Vickie Chapman, the member for Bragg and my local member of parliament. For those of you who do not know, she is a member of the Liberal Party.
In the case of homelessness, I know all sides of politics are committed to addressing this critical issue. This is beyond politics; it is an issue that touches all of us and our common humanity. I am delighted to be sponsoring South Australian Liberal parliamentarian Vickie Chapman’s sleep-out. I think it is terrific that she is doing this and she has my respect and support—moral and financial, but not political! They say the most intense hatreds are not between political parties but within them. Mr President, I can see you smiling there.
—Will you sponsor me?
—Yes, I will sponsor you if you ask, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. That is certainly the case with the South Australian Liberals. Having said that, for a great cause and across party lines I am delighted to be able to contribute in some small way to Vicky’s discomfort on this particular night. If others would like to contribute to this worthy cause by sponsoring one of the participants, I refer people to the website at www.ceosleepout.org.au and I urge people to log on and make this commitment.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>St Vincent de Paul Society</title>,Adjournment,50,1
