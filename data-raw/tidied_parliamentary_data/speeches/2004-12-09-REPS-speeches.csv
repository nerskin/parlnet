"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Agreement Validation) Bill 2004, which is before us at the moment, reflects the government’s response to a recent High Court decision commonly referred to as the Electrolux case. In September, the High Court delivered its judgement on what is called the Electrolux matter, that matter previously having been before the Federal Court. In essence, the case concerned a question as to whether bargaining agents’ fees, where employees are required to pay a fee to a union as a contribution to the cost of negotiating an agreement, could legitimately be included in a certified agreement made under the Workplace Relations Act. There is no doubt that this majority decision has led to uncertainty and some difficulty for people involved daily in the bargaining process. This is particularly so as a result of the various interpretations that have been made since the decision was handed down.
I want to indicate some of the interpretations made about the High Court decision and bring it back to the issues that the High Court really made decisions about. Firstly, although not determined by the High Court, it is at least arguable that certified agreements which include a matter not pertaining to the employment relationship are now void. Although the Electrolux decision went no further than its findings in relation to bargaining fees in determining what is, or is not, a matter pertaining to the employment relationship, the decision is being taken by some to support a contention that a significant number of matters, some of which may have been routinely included in enterprise bargaining, are no longer enforceable. The issue of which matters rightly pertain to the employment relationship in my view remains a significant matter of contention and debate and will for some time to come. We have already seen, for example, differences on the part of individual commissioners on issues such as whether leave for union training is or is not a matter pertaining to the employment relationship. It is disingenuous to suggest unanimity on these issues about what is or is not a matter pertaining, and it is disingenuous to believe that this is going to be resolved early and speedily by the commission.
However, the effect of this uncertainty and the varying interpretations since the Electrolux decision was handed down have certainly left employers and employees not knowing whether their current agreements, negotiated in good faith, are now enforceable—not only to the extent of the now pertaining matters but also in terms of the agreements in totality. There is certainly no certainty as to whether protected industrial action previously taken in accordance with the law is in fact now quarantined from future retrospective legal action. While a full bench of the Industrial Relations Commission may in due course resolve differences of interpretation within the commission, in my view this will not necessarily be finally determinative. Indeed, one can readily envisage further appeals on a whole range of matters being taken back to the Federal Court and indeed to the High Court again.
It is against this background that the agreement validation bill has been introduced into parliament. It does seek to address some of these uncertainties, but in my view it is a limited and unsatisfactory response in that it only deals with one aspect of the uncertainty—namely, the validity of agreements and individual contracts or AWAs which were certified before the handing down of the Electrolux decision. When you look at the details that are contained in this bill, it can only lead to a conclusion that the government’s response will not settle the uncertainties that are out there. The intent of this bill is to retrospectively validate all those parts of certified agreements and AWAs that pertain to the employment relationship, but only those parts. Presumably, those aspects considered non-pertaining would be unenforceable but would not undo the validity of the remainder of the agreement. In our view, the preferable response, and the one that has been advocated by the member for Perth, would be to validate the whole of the existing certified agreements that have been lodged and allow these to continue to have effect until such time as the agreement expires. That is the alternative proposition that is being advanced in response to the government’s fairly limited response to the Electrolux case.
Why do I say that the government’s response is limited? Let me go through a number of issues. If we were just to adopt the government’s bill, at best employers and employees would know that their previously negotiated agreements stand, but none of them would necessarily know which clauses are in and which are out, which clauses are matters pertaining and which are not. Far from resolving issues arising from the Electrolux decision, the bill allows uncertainty to continue because many clauses of existing certified agreements would have to be tested, and indeed may not be tested for some time to come. Under the government’s limited response, until each contentious provision in an agreement is properly and authoritatively considered, be it by the Industrial Relations Commission, the Federal Court or indeed the High Court, it will continue to remain unclear which parts of an agreement are enforceable. The proposal would retrospectively interfere with the substance of many thousands of agreements that have been negotiated and entered into in good faith by the parties.
A matter of concern that has also been discussed in the other place is the issue of the quarantining of protected industrial action that at the time was lawfully taken in reaching the agreement, insofar as an agreement may now be deemed to have matters contained within it that do not pertain to the employment relationship. The whole issue of retrospective quarantining of protected industrial action is an issue that I do not think this bill in any way adequately addresses. Nor do I think that the bill resolves uncertainty about bargaining and certification in the post-Electrolux era. Those aspects draw me to the conclusion that the bill is a limited response to a difficult situation that exists. I think that a bill which only partially validates certified agreements is neither sensible nor practical and will only fuel a climate of further uncertainty and continued speculation about matters which do and do not pertain to the employment relationship.
A more certain way forward would be for the government to accept the proposals from this side of the House. In so doing, it would lead to a situation where all existing certified agreements would be validated, allowing each provision within those agreements to continue to have effect until the date on which the agreement expires. This approach would have the following benefits: it would provide certainty by validating agreements in their entirety; it would recognise that the agreements were made in good faith and that often the conditions that finally appear in those agreements also involve a process where conditions have been negotiated away to achieve a final outcome. In the course of bargaining and reaching an agreement a lot of things are on the table and, as we know, some issues get bargained away for a final outcome. On top of that now, the government is suggesting, or leaving as an open-ended question, that even after the bargaining has occurred there still might be provisions and clauses in the agreements that do not pertain to the employment relationship. I do not think there is justice in retrospectively changing the elements of an agreement negotiated in good faith and in accordance with the law. If workers, at the time of negotiating their agreements, took industrial action believing it was protected under the law, they should continue to expect legal protection from any action which may be subsequently taken against them.
In concluding my remarks on this bill I want to make a few points about the government’s contradictory position on the issue of enterprise bargaining. We often hear about these issues, and my colleague the member for Rankin, in his former responsibility as shadow minister, would have been in this chamber on many occasions when the government kept talking about the need to get rid of third party intervention and allow employers and employees to reach their own agreements. We have often heard that, haven’t we? To put that in some context, it was the Labor Party that first moved towards enterprise bargaining and broke down the rigidities of what historically had been a highly regulated and centralised system. In so doing it was our intention, and I think the government at least purports to have the same intention, to allow people at the enterprise level to regulate their own relationships, rights and obligations, outside the scope of the commission’s intervention. As far as the commission was concerned, the number of allowable matters that could be included in arbitrated awards was reduced but the push was on to have the parties bargain at the enterprise level without restraint, providing it was in accordance with the law as was reflected in the Workplace Relations Act.
If parties at the workplace are expected to negotiate the substance of the rights and obligations which will govern their relationship, it seems logical that they should be given a broader scope to determine the range of matters that might be relevant to the employment relationship at each specific enterprise. The bill before the House really highlights a dilemma for this government. In rejecting Justice Kirby’s reasoning for a broader ‘pertaining to’ test for agreements, as compared to arbitrated awards, ironically the majority of the High Court have effectively strengthened the hand of state intervention in the employment relationship. The government’s bill in effect denies this parliament the opportunity to decide what matters legitimately could and should be included in negotiated agreements. As Electrolux shows, the Industrial Relations Commission, the Federal Court and the High Court can easily disagree on whether a provision or provisions pertain to the employment relationship, so protracted litigation and continuing uncertainty will continue until reliable precedents are established on each of the contentious provisions.
A quote in the Parliamentary Library’s brief sums up the dilemma that the government faces:
As well as generating uncertainty, Electrolux can also be seen as a re-exertion of active state intervention in workplace relations. Following more than a decade’s worth of reforms in which self-regulation at the workplace or individual level has been promoted, Electrolux requires the Commission and courts to play a more integral role in policing the borders of self-regulation. While employers and employees remain free to determine the content of agreements, subject to certain minimum requirements, the breadth of those agreements has been circumscribed.
I know this was not the outcome the Labor Party envisaged when we moved to the system of enterprise bargaining. Indeed, for the government the contradiction is even more obvious. How does the government justify its support for a decentralised industrial relations regime where parties are urged to come to their own enterprise specific agreements without outside interference? By ‘outside interference’ the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations means without the influence of unions. This is the talk we hear from the government, ‘Let the employers and employees sort out their own arrangements.’ But at the same time this government brings a bill before the House which will limit the matters that can be negotiated in good faith at the workplace level. That poses a real dilemma for the government.
I am not suggesting that the climate of uncertainty post-Electrolux is not a difficult one to grapple with, but I contend that the government response is very limited. It will do nothing to dampen down the uncertainty. It fails to appreciate that each of the potentially conflicting views about what is or is not a matter pertaining to the employment relationship is going to take considerable time to resolve. It could well be that matters relating to that go back to the High Court again.
The approach suggested by this side of the House is the sensible and practical response to a difficult and uncertain industrial relations climate. I think we would have greater certainty, and more people knowing and understanding their rights and obligations, if the government took the step of validating all existing agreements and individual contracts in their totality, while the matters are yet to be resolved in terms of what is and what is not a matter pertaining to the employment relationship.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AGREEMENT VALIDATION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,14,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—In the Electrolux decision, the High Court ruled that an agreement must be fully about matters that pertain to the relationship between the employer and employees. It found that any agreement containing provisions that do not pertain to the relationship between the employer and employees is invalid. That means that even if 20 items were contained in an agreement and just one of those is a non-pertaining matter, then the entire agreement is invalid. That is the effect of the High Court decision.
It also means, very disturbingly, as the member for Throsby has pointed out, that if industrial action took place in pursuit of that agreement and that agreement contained just one provision that did not pertain to the relationship between the employer and employees, then that industrial action, though legally protected at the time, could be judged to be illegal. An employer could pursue the organisation, normally a union, that organised that protected industrial action. What an outrageous situation we would have if, under the laws of the land as they applied at that time and under the Workplace Relations Act, a union validly took protected industrial action in pursuit of an agreement. If that agreement was then signed and certified by the Industrial Relations Commission but was subsequently found by the High Court to contain just one provision that did not pertain to the employment relationship, industrial action could then be found to be illegal. Legal proceedings could be taken successfully against the union. That is the impact of the High Court’s decision.
The government’s response is very inadequate, in my view. The Workplace Relations Amendment (Agreement Validation) Bill 2004 before us today validates those provisions in existing agreements that pertain to the relationship between an employer and employees, but does not validate any other provisions—that is, non-pertaining provisions. The problem here is: what is a non-pertaining matter? We do not know. The legislation today validates all the pertaining matters but not the non-pertaining matters—and we do not know what the non-pertaining matters are. The courts and tribunals are grappling with this at the moment, so if the government were fair dinkum about resolving uncertainty, it would validate all provisions of all agreements, whether they are pertaining or non-pertaining matters.
Is a non-pertaining matter a restriction on the use of casuals? If employers and employees come to an agreement in good faith that there will be some limitation on the use of casuals then presumably they should be entitled to do that. But the High Court may well have ruled that they cannot do that because perhaps it does not pertain to the relationship between the employer and employees. As another example: if an employer and employees—who may or may not be represented by a union, as it may be a non-union agreement—agreed to apply restrictions on the use of contractors, is that a pertaining matter or not? We do not know. What if they reached an agreement on the conditions under which a union could enter the employer’s workplace? Is that a pertaining matter or not? We do not know. What if they came to an agreement on deductions for union dues? We do not know whether or not that is a pertaining matter.
Relevantly for the coalition, perhaps an employer and its employees might reach an agreement where the employer, for example, says that it will pay some or all of the private health insurance premiums of its work force so that the work force has access to private facilities. It seems to me that, if they did come to that agreement, it is a matter for the employer and the employees. I do not know whether that is the case, though, because that could be a non-pertaining matter. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is at the table. Perhaps he would like to speculate on whether the payment by an employer of the private health insurance premiums of staff is a pertaining or non-pertaining matter? The worrying aspect of this legislation is that it does not clarify that at all and does not validate any such agreement. Perhaps there are agreements where such provisions have been inserted, but the minister will not be able to tell the parliament in his summing up whether that provision relating to private health insurance premiums, for example, is a pertaining or non-pertaining matter.
This legislation resolves some uncertainty, but there are very broad areas remaining that need to be clarified and could have been clarified in the legislation, as the member for Throsby has pointed out. The option that the government could have pursued and chose not to is to validate all of the pre-existing agreements—agreements reached in good faith, agreements that the parties have willingly signed and then taken off to the commission for certification. But the government will not do that, and it will not do it for one reason: far from being a non-interventionist, deregulatory government, this government wants to interfere in the relationship between employers and employees. Most particularly, it wants to interfere in a way that deunionises workplaces. So it does not want arrangements agreed between employers and employees through a union which may in fact be to the advantage of trade union membership.
Let us understand that this government talks the talk of noninterference, of enterprise bargaining and of governments and other third parties staying out of things, but it does not walk the walk. It does not walk the walk because it wants to interfere. It is all part of the Orwellian structure around this government, where it makes particular claims about freedom, flexibility and noninterference but, when it comes down to it, it wants to interfere all right.
The government says it is a great supporter of enterprise bargaining, as if it invented enterprise bargaining. Labor introduced enterprise bargaining as a central organising principle of the industrial relations system and Labor will retain enterprise bargaining as the central organising principle of the industrial relations system. But this government does not really believe in enterprise bargaining. I say that because the legislation that the government introduced in 1996 places no obligation whatsoever on an employer to bargain. An employer does not have to bargain with employees if the employer does not want to. Certainly the employer does not have to bargain with the chosen representative of employees. And if that chosen representative happens to be a union then an employer can veto negotiations with the union.
This cannot really be a notion of bargaining as everyday Australians would understand the term. Bargaining, as far as this government is concerned, as enacted in the legislation, is such that the employer does not need to bargain at all and the employer can veto negotiations with the employees’ chosen representative if the employer does not like that chosen representative—in this case, a trade union. The government certainly does not require bargaining, and it is hostile to the notion of collective bargaining.
The irony here is that this year the government, having reviewed the report of the Dawson committee inquiry into small businesses, decided that small businesses, where they supplied goods or services to a large business, would be able to bargain collectively—that is, to get together to maximise their bargaining power. Labor agreed with that. Labor agreed that small businesses should be able to get together and bargain collectively as suppliers to a larger business. But I asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations during question time whether he would now agree to employees—workers—being able to bargain collectively with an employer, and the minister’s answer was, ‘They can already.’
The fact of the matter is that, if an employer vetoes negotiations with employees who seek to bargain collectively, that is the end of the matter. A right to bargain collectively that is vetoed by an employer is no right at all. So here we have the giant contradiction of the government saying, ‘It is good that small businesses should be able to bargain collectively, but we will not give that basic right to the working men and women of this country. We will give and have given to employers the right to veto negotiations with a collective group of employees, whether represented by a union or by themselves in a non-union bargaining process.’ And that is why I say that they talk the talk of choice, freedom and flexibility but very rarely do they walk the walk.
The reason that the government is opposed to collective bargaining and in fact does not require bargaining at all is that its model, its dream for the Australian workplace, is individual bargaining through Australian workplace agreements. The minister is at the table—I do not think he would disagree with that proposition, because every second day he comes into parliament lauding the wonderful virtues of AWAs. He says they are terrific; they are the way to go, and that is what we should have. Get rid of all this enterprise bargaining; get rid of this collective bargaining; get rid of trade unions, and it should be just a direct deal between employers and employees through AWAs.
The government has been on about this for 8½ years. After 8½ years of vigorous promotion, no matter how the minister wants to manipulate the figures and say it is ‘14 per cent of the number you first thought of’ covered by AWAs, there is only one figure that counts, and that is that AWAs still cover less than three per cent of the Australian work force. If they are this marvellous instrument for unleashing productivity growth around Australia, if they are so fair to employees and if they are so wonderful for employers, why haven’t these employers and employees rushed to sign up to these marvellous AWAs? The answer is: perhaps employers and employees are not all that fond of them.
Perhaps employees, particularly those on low incomes, consider AWAs to be a device for violating basic safety net award conditions in a race to the bottom—to undermine their pay and their working conditions. I am not sure, but on the evidence of it, after 8½ years of vigorous promotion of these magical AWAs with all these productivity-unleashing benefits and the happiness that flows out of AWAs and these individual negotiations in the workplace, you would reckon 97 per cent of the work force would be on them. But 97 per cent of the work force have said, ‘No, we don’t like AWAs.’ But they are going to get them rammed down their throats in this term of parliament, because this legislation today—the manifest inadequacy of it—is all part of the government stripping away any alternative to AWAs.
The government started in 1996 by stripping away the automatic right of working Australians to bargain collectively. It stripped away the right of employees to bargain collectively and, indeed, stripped away the right of employees to insist that bargaining takes place. It allowed employers not to bargain at all, and yet it has the temerity to call this system ‘enterprise bargaining’. So for 8½ years it has been stripping away any and all alternatives to AWAs, and this legislation continues that process by validating only those provisions that pertain to the relationship between employers and employees and refusing to validate those provisions arrived at in good faith that may not pertain to that relationship.
There is plenty of method in the government’s madness, because they want the single instrument to determine the relationship between an employer and an employee to be an AWA. But let us be clear about this: they still do not like negotiation; they do not like bargaining in relation to AWAs. The government say, ‘What really should happen is that an individual should go up against a large, powerful employer with no collective bargaining power and negotiate these highly flexible AWAs.’ There is very little to zero evidence that any negotiation takes place.
I hear from people who are on AWAs and I have not heard of one who walked into a workplace and said, ‘I’ve had a look at this AWA and there are a couple of aspects that don’t suit me, so I’d like to negotiate that.’ I have not heard of one case where an employer has said, ‘That’s fair enough, because these are flexible instruments where we can get into a genuine negotiation and arrive at arrangements that are good for you and good for me.’ But I have heard a litany of examples of employers saying, ‘Hold on. We’re not actually negotiating these things. We’re not going to vary them, because if we vary one then we’re going to have all this trouble. Others will say, “I’d like a variation that suits my individual circumstances too. I’d like a variation”—so that there might be genuine flexibility in working hours, for example—“that suits my arrangements in relation to the work of my partner.”’
I have not heard of any cases where an employee has said, ‘I’d like an arrangement where I start a little earlier and leave a little earlier because I would like to pick up the kids after school.’ I do not hear of too many cases—I have not heard of one—where an employer has said, ‘You’ve got a good point there, because the government told us when they were bringing in AWAs that they are really for flexibility and for the best working arrangements that we can arrive at between the two of us.’ No—rather, AWAs are routinely uniform for a business. How do we know that? Because the Senate estimates process has told us; because the people on AWAs have told us.
Senate estimates has heard of a process called ‘streamlining’. Streamlining is another of these Orwellian euphemisms. Streamlining is the Office of the Employment Advocate getting a bunch of AWAs—say 100 at a time—picking out one, checking it out and giving them all a tick, knowing full well that the other 99 have exactly the same terms and conditions, because the Employment Advocate knows that there is no negotiation of these AWAs. They are laid down and prescribed by the employer for the employee, who is offered an AWA on a take it or leave it basis—that is, ‘Take the AWA or you do not get the job,’ or, if you are an employee already on staff, ‘Take the AWA or leave this place.’
So where is the evidence that these AWAs are unleashing all the productivity gains in the Australian economy? I have not seen one respectable report suggesting that AWAs have unleashed productivity gains for Australia. If you look at the Intergenerational Report, Productivity Commission reports and other academic reports, you will see that the truth of the matter is that there is no compelling evidence that the spread of AWAs throughout the Australian work force would unleash some magical productivity yield.
What AWAs are essentially about is not flexibility but further tilting the bargaining power to employers, who then can lay down, as the only viable instrument under this government, terms and conditions of employment that can breach the basic award conditions and provide those terms and conditions to the employee on a take it or leave it basis. There is no genuine negotiation in the overwhelming majority of AWAs—perhaps in 100 per cent of AWAs. I alert the House to this government’s agenda to compromise and so damage every alternative to an AWA that the AWA is all that is left. That is the Howard government’s dream, and it has nothing to do with productivity and everything to do with its ideology of making sure that working Australians have no collective bargaining power and that the employer can lay out the conditions of employment with no negotiation with employees.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (AGREEMENT VALIDATION) BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,14,1
"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—in reply—I thank all members for their contributions to this debate. The principal purpose of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Agreement Validation) Bill 2004 is to provide assurance and peace of mind to those parties who entered into agreements prior to the High Court’s decision in the Electrolux case. I thank members opposite for their recognition of the purpose of the bill in providing certainty as an important and urgently required measure. Passing the bill and ensuring that parties who have been operating under agreements in good faith can continue to rely on those agreements is the highest priority.
A number of members mentioned in the debate the validation of industrial action taken in support of non-pertaining matters. The government considered that there are strong legal, practical and policy reasons not to validate industrial action. In particular, there are constitutional limitations on conferring protected status on past industrial action that failed to meet the requirements of the act for protected action. The government considered that it was unlikely that anyone would sue in respect of past industrial action that was not protected due to the Electrolux decision. Generally, the purpose of such legal action is to obtain an urgent injunction to stop ongoing unlawful industrial action. It is rare that such matters continue beyond the interim injunction stage, because parties have usually settled their dispute by the time a matter comes on for final hearing.
The government is not aware that any person has initiated legal action since the High Court’s decision seeking damages over long-settled bargaining disputes. However, in the interests of securing the urgent passage of this bill, the government has accepted an amendment moved by the Democrats in the Senate that will validate past industrial action to the extent that it is constitutionally possible. Like certified agreements, the validation only applies to industrial action taken prior to the High Court’s decision on 2 September 2004. After that date parties were in no doubt as to the requirement that protected industrial action may only be taken to support claims that pertain to the employment relationship.
The government does not agree with the proposition advanced by members of the opposition that the bill should validate agreements in their entirety, including provisions in agreements that could be found to be non-pertaining matters. To validate matters in certified agreements and AWAs that do not pertain to the employment relationship would be to go against the intent of the Workplace Relations Act. It would also go against the long-held principle about what may be included in industrial instruments. While I note the opposition’s view that the government should validate the whole deal made between the parties and not just part of it, it remains open to the parties to continue to honour arrangements to provide non-pertaining matters outside their certified agreement. Indeed, Senator Murray recognised that such matters are already being dealt with by alternative mechanisms. Put simply, the government fails to see the necessity for such an amendment and, indeed, the opposition is not proceeding with it in the House.
The bill as it stands is merely reflecting the current state of the law. The approach taken in the bill provides for consistency between agreements certified prior to Electrolux and agreements going through the certification process now and in the future. The government does not agree with the Labor Party’s claims that the Electrolux ruling itself has created more uncertainty about the application of the ‘matters pertaining’ test. The High Court’s interpretation of the Workplace Relations Act is consistent with Hight Court and other long-established legal precedents that apply to awards. Validating all matters in agreements certified prior to Electrolux would result in two streams of agreements—one containing non-pertaining matters and the other without such matters. Effectively through this amendment the opposition would be asking the government to introduce new and different rights to the employment relationship. Indeed, too much of the Senate debate focused on what this bill does not do. The bill was never intended to solve all of the issues raised in the Electrolux case. The government stands firmly behind the bill, which addresses simply and effectively the principal concern of parties over the validity of their agreements. I once again commend the bill to the House.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I rise to speak in the second reading debate on the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004. The bill amends the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998 and also the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It implements the coalition’s election commitment to increase the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 years and to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and above. The Prime Minister made this commitment on behalf of the coalition on 22 August 2004. These additional rebates are available on both hospital cover and ancillary cover. The higher rebates will apply to individuals who meet the age threshold and to couples and families where one or more of the persons meets the age threshold. The bill makes provision for what should happen in the event of the death of the older family member or divorce or separation.
Like the existing 30 per cent rebate, the higher rebates will be available to be claimed as premium reductions through the private health funds, a direct payout from Medicare offices or a tax offset in annual income tax returns. The government claims that the cost of this provision will mean that premiums will be reduced by $100 to $200 a year over the existing cost for a couple or a family meeting the age threshold. The bill also contains an amendment that will ensure that people with a veterans gold card are not affected by the application of Lifetime Health Cover. This aspect of the bill is to take effect on 1 April 2005.
As we well know, the Howard government has had a great deal of difficulty keeping its promises when it comes to private health insurance. This is a government that promised that its policies would put downward pressure on premiums. Indeed, in the 2001 election the Prime Minister actually said that there would be downward pressure on premiums and that private health insurance would have to be more affordable and attractive to consumers. Back then he said that his government’s policies would ‘lead to reduced premiums’—and those are his words, not mine.
The truth is that, despite a suite of policies supporting private health insurance, the 30 per cent rebate and lifetime cover, private health insurance premiums have continued to rise. Indeed, in the last three years, private health insurance premiums have risen by an average of 22 per cent. We must remember that, when we are talking about averages, by definition many Australian families and pensioners are facing price increases that are much larger than that. Earlier this year, the Minister for Health and Ageing did not even have the courage to make the announcement of price increases himself. He obviously knew that he would be severely criticised for once again going out and doing media showing that the Howard government was breaching commitments that it had made to the Australian people.
We need to remember that this is the health minister who, on the very day when applications for premium rises were submitted to him—the applications that he is supposed to scrutinise and only tick if every cent claimed in the premium increases can be justified—basically shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘C’est la vie—such as life—prices go up and the price of private health insurance will continue to go up.’ It is against a background of broken promises in the area of private health insurance that the government made this new commitment and introduced this bill. Of course, we have to worry about what will happen with the price of private health insurance over the medium to long term.
Clearly the additional rebate for older Australians in the short term will provide an extra government subsidy to the cost of private health insurance for them and will bring the cost down, but we need to remember that prices will continue to go up. The track record of this government has been that, if the private health insurers ask them for a premium increase, they basically shrug their shoulders and say yes. When they shrug their shoulders and say yes, it is only a matter of time before the dollar advantage gained by older Australians out of this current bill is overwhelmed by the dollar disadvantage caused to them by the price of private health insurance continuing to go up. So someone over the age of 65 or 70 with private health insurance today who says, ‘That’s going to make my private health insurance cheaper and I won’t be paying as much in the short term,’ needs to remember that in dollar terms over the longer term they will inevitably be paying more as the Howard government continues to tick off private health insurance increases without adequate scrutiny or rigour. We know that will be the future of private health insurance.
I will now talk about what the bill does in the short term. We know that there are about one million Australians over the age of 65 with private health insurance. Of those, about 350,000 are aged 65 to 69. We know that the percentage of older Australians with health cover is less than the national average, which is currently at 43 per cent, and declines with increasing age. I think it is very important to note that, because the benefit of this bill in bringing down the cost of private health insurance for older Australians in the short term—though, of course, in dollar terms over the longer term they will end up worse off than they are now—by definition, is only assisting older Australians with private health insurance. And, given that the private health insurance of older Australians is actually at a lesser percentage than the national average, the vast majority of older Australians rely on the public system for their health needs. If they need something done—if they need a hip replacement or cataract surgery—they will be relying on the public system. There is, of course, absolutely nothing in this bill for them.
As we well know, with older Australians being the greatest users of our health system, many older Australians who are privately insured still need a strong and vibrant public system when they face ill health. The reality for an older Australian who faces a health emergency is that it is far more likely than not that they will be reliant at the end of the day on a public hospital emergency department for their initial treatment, and they may well end up being reliant on a public hospital bed for their ongoing treatment. This bill, aimed as it is at people with private health insurance, does not provide an answer for the vast majority of older Australians who rely on the public system and it does not provide an answer for the privately insured older Australians who are still reliant on the public system for either emergency treatment or some of the more complex procedures that are still only done in the public system.
Disturbingly, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you may be aware, evidence has been reported in newspapers that privately insured older Australians have actually been turned away by private hospitals, despite their insurance. They have been told to go and rely on the public system because of the complex and complicated nature of their condition, meaning that they are going to be a long-term stayer in a hospital bed and so they are not seen to be a profitable case that the private system is prepared to deal with. So despite having private health insurance they end up being turned away and they become reliant on the public system. These things have been a matter of public record and have actually caused some of the most senior doctors who deal with the needs of older Australians to talk about what bad value for money private health insurance can be for some older Australians, because when they need treatment they do not actually get to rely on the private cover that they have purchased with their very precious dollars. We need to remember, of course, that so many older Australians are on strictly limited incomes.
What will be the effect of this bill in the private health insurance market? There we run into the world’s greatest mystery—we run into a debate that the government cannot resolve, even amongst its own ranks. In the ordinary course of events you would figure that, if in the short term these additional rebates bring down the price of private health insurance for older Australians, there may be some older Australians who choose to join private health insurance funds for the first time. In making that determination we need to say that there are of course some policy complexities here because of the penalty arrangements coming out of the lifetime ratings cover arrangement. We have an arrangement now where if you get into private health insurance in your later years you pay a premium for joining private health insurance late rather than joining it when you were young. That is the effect of the government’s lifetime ratings policy. So there is an intersection point between the lifetime ratings policy and this rebate reduction, which means that there is truly only less expenditure in the short term for people who choose to join private health insurance if they fall in the age category above 70 and are on the 40 per cent rebate that is dealt with in this bill. You would figure that if private health insurance, at least in the short term, has been made less costly in dollar terms it would induce some more older Australians to get private health insurance. The very fundamental point as to whether these rebate increases for older Australians are going to encourage any more older Australians to take out private health insurance is a point that the government simply cannot agree on amongst themselves.
Mr Deputy Speaker, let me take you to two completely contradictory statements. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, stated that the rebate increase for older Australians would mean that more older Australians would take out private health insurance. His direct quote on radio 3AW in an interview with Neil Mitchell on 23 August 2004 was:
But we think there will be a modest increase in the total number of people with private health insurance as a result of this.
Obviously Minister Abbott was not listening to his Prime Minister, an unusual event for Minister Abbott, because his Prime Minister, on the day before at a press conference, had made the statement that this new scheme of arrangements was:
.... an additional reward for older Australians who really value their private health insurance to keep that health insurance, and it will be a valuable additional incentive for them to do so.
We have two completely contradictory statements: we have the Prime Minister saying that this additional private health insurance rebate for older Australians is basically a bit of a reward for older Australians who have private health insurance, not that it is going to encourage anyone new to join private health insurance, and the very next day we had Tony Abbott—clearly unaware of what the Prime Minister had said, or maybe for the first time in known history he was sustaining a different view from the Prime Minister—on radio saying, ‘No, this will induce more older Australians to join private health insurance.’
To have government ministers at odds with each other, making contradictory statements, is hardly a new event in this place. Anybody who has been watching question time over the last few days would well and truly know that happens as a matter of routine. But this is a very significant contradiction and it has a great deal of implication for private health insurance holding generally and for the cost of private health insurance premiums for every Australian. If I can just explain that: what we know from all of the published data is that older Australians take out more from the private health insurance system than they put into it by way of contributions. As a result of our community ratings system, older Australians are paying the same private health insurance premiums as younger Australians. Younger Australians are physically healthier on average and consequently they use the health care system less. The amount they take from the private health insurance pool is less than their contributions, so younger Australians are net contributors to private health insurance. Older Australians are net takers from the private health insurance pool—that is, the amount that they pay in their premiums is less than the amount they draw down on the private health insurance pool because of their disproportionate use of the health care system. The import of that is that the more older Australians we have in private health insurance being net takers out of the private health insurance pool, the higher the cross subsidy from younger Australians.
If Minister Abbott is right and the effect of this private health insurance rebate change is to induce more older Australians to take out private health insurance, then that necessarily means that the premiums of younger Australians will go up to support that additional burden on the private health insurance system. So we need to know whether Minister Abbott is right, because it has implications for every family in Australia who holds private health insurance. Every family in Australia has the right to know whether this policy measure will cause more older Australians to join private health insurance and, given they are net takers from the system, consequently cause premiums to go up for everyone. You would have thought that a government that was contemplating a measure like this—a measure that would be putting an additional impost in the form of increased premiums on all Australians who had private health insurance—would have produced economic modelling about this point which was absolutely robust and which could show us what premium increase is being contemplated. It is not rocket science. All you need to do from the data is work out the sensitivity of the demand for private health insurance to price and then work out from that data what will be the result for this group of Australians in the dollar expenditure on private health insurance being less in the short term. It is exactly the same as saying, ‘If you put the price of apples down, you are probably going to sell more apples,’ and an economist can come along and tell you how many more apples you should expect to sell as the price falls. An economist would be able to draw up a model which says, ‘If apples are $1 each, then you will sell so many of them; if apples are 1c each, then you will sell so many more of them’—they would be able to quantify the number.
That is all we are asking the government to do with this bill. We are asking it to draw up that kind of economic model—just a straight demand and supply curve—and to work out the elasticities. We are asking it to do that with this bill and to tell us its best robust assumption about how many older Australians will join private health insurance as a result of these new rebate arrangements and the consequences of that for the premiums of all Australians. It is a very straightforward inquiry, but, as on many other occasions, when you make a straightforward inquiry of the Howard government the last thing you ever get is a straightforward answer. It is because we have received no straightforward answer that it is the intention of the Labor Party, whilst allowing passage of the bill in this place, to ensure that that information is put before the public by sending this bill to a Senate legislation committee. We think that Australians who have private health insurance are entitled to know the premium consequences of this bill for them. That cannot be too hard an ask. It has apparently been too hard an ask to date. We have not had that information supplied to us, we have not seen that information supplied to the Australian people and we require it to be supplied.
There has been an assertion made by the government that the legislation will result in a one per cent increase in the private health insurance uptake. The assertion is that that translates into around 10,000 people or families and, further, that that has a negligible consequence for premiums. Perhaps that is right. But if it is, then it ought to be possible for the Howard government to produce the economic modelling that proves it is right. It has not been produced, and we require it to be produced. That will be the purpose of this bill going to a Senate legislation committee.
On the question of economic modelling, there is another issue about this bill which concerns me. I have raised this before in earlier debates about the Howard government’s policies on older Australians. Day after day in this House, we have Treasurer Costello wandering around talking about his much vaunted Intergenerational Report, talking about the consequences of ageing for Australian society and for policy settings of government and talking about what we may or may not need to do as a society to deal with the consequences of ageing to ensure that we have sustainable government policies. The Productivity Commission very recently produced a report which talks about the likely rise in the percentage of GDP that the government spends on health, modelled over 40 years. They say that, under current policy settings, government expenditure on health is about six per cent of GDP and that will rise to 10.8 per cent of GDP by 2044-45.
Treasurer Costello points to these statistics and says that as a society we have got to be very careful about what it is we do to deal with the consequences of ageing and the intergenerational consequences of any policies that we adopt. I agree with Treasurer Costello that we should be looking at intergenerational modelling and modelling, over 40 years, of changes to health policy. Unfortunately, that has not been done here. Here is another change to—and expenditure on—the health-care needs of older Australians, who we know to be a growing class of Australians. The Treasurer makes it his business, day in and day out, to talk about the intergenerational consequences of policies, yet here is the Howard government committed to a new expenditure for older Australians and it has done no intergenerational modelling of the cost. My simple question is one that ought to be answered by a government purportedly concerned about these things: what does the 40-year modelling show about the expenditure on this measure, given we know that the class of Australians to which it applies will increase over time? That is not a hard question for an economist to answer. There would be people in the department and beyond that could whip up an answer to that pretty quickly. They could do it over a 40-year cycle and tell us what the cost of this will be to the Australian community in 2044-45, what percentage of GDP will be devoted to this policy by 2044-45, what percentage increase is predicted on expenditure of this policy over that 40-year cycle and whether this policy is sustainable in view of that.
The Howard government cannot have it all ways. You cannot send Treasurer Costello in here to say, ‘Intergenerational equity and intergenerational modelling are diabolical. We have got to deal with the consequence of ageing and, because of that, we have got to hike up the price of prescription medicines by 30 per cent.’ You cannot have the Treasurer say that one day and then have the Prime Minister and the minister for health announce something on another day, without paying any regard to those intergenerational consequences. If it is good enough for the Treasurer to say, ‘Let’s hike up the cost of prescription medicines by 30 per cent because of intergenerational equity issues,’ then it should be good enough for the Howard government to produce the 40-year modelling of this policy setting. We have not seen it, and we will be pressing the government for it.
There has been some strong expert criticism of these policy measures because of the sustainability issues for private health insurance. One of the strongest economic proponents of the government’s 30 per cent private health insurance rebate is Professor Ian Harper, who produced the economic work on which the government relies most frequently to prove, in its view, that the private health insurance rebate at 30 per cent is an effective policy. Professor Ian Harper is the expert of choice for the Howard government when it comes to the proposition that the economic modelling supports the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. Given that, it is fairly important to look at what he says about this policy measure. In the Australian on 5 February 2004 he said:
You could feasibly ask the question: ‘what about a bigger rebate for under-30s?
When the Howard government made their election announcement, Professor Harper said:
If I were John Howard, I would have increased the rebate for younger people ...
That was reported in the Age on 28 August 2004. Here is the government’s expert of choice suggesting that this is a flawed policy measure, and that the best thing to do for the long-term sustainability of private health insurance is put in additional rebate arrangements for young Australians, obviously with the aim of getting more of them into private health insurance. As I said before, they are net contributors to, not net takers from, the system.
I think some of the questions that the Howard government should answer are: whether or not it has looked at that suggestion from Professor Ian Harper; whether it has modelled the consequences of that suggestion for the sustainability of private health insurance; and why, when the government is electing to make this expenditure, it has chosen to make it on private health insurance rebates for older Australians instead of on private health insurance rebates for younger Australians. If it were going to devote the money that is to be spent in this bill to the purpose of supporting additional private health insurance rebates, why wouldn’t it do that at the younger end of the population spectrum rather than at the older end? We have not had an answer to that.
Finally, on the question of modelling, we have not had a clear answer—and we believe that we deserve one and certainly the Australian people deserve one—to what the presumed increase is year-on-year that private health insurance premiums are going to have. Obviously if you say, ‘We’re increasing the rebate,’ you have to make an assumption each year as to how much premiums are going to increase and therefore how much your rebate expenditure is going to increase, because it is a percentage. So the department has made such an assumption but it is not broken down in the figures. There is all this mumbo-jumbo about why it is or is not broken down, but we think we are entitled to know what the Howard government are expecting the future of private health insurance to be and what they believe premium increases are likely to be.
On that point, the best information we have had is the information from the department of finance when it costed Medicare Gold. Inherent in the assumptions of the department of finance was that it was expecting an escalation in private health insurance premiums of 14 per cent each year. Some experts who have looked at these figures for us suggest that modelled into these figures is an expectation that private health insurance premiums are going to go up by 15 per cent each year. If that is the case, if the government are expecting private health insurance premiums to go up by such extraordinary amounts—14 per cent or 15 per cent—then we believe that they should be honest about it. As I have said, it is not our intention to hold up passage of this bill in this place but we will be pressing for these details when the Senate committee meets. I move:
That all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
‘whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to:
ensure that private health insurance provides real choice in health care;
ensure that private health insurance delivers real value for money;
adequately address the health care needs of all older Australians; and
provide modelling and data about the impact of the provisions of this bill on the cost of private health insurance for all Australians, thus necessitating the referral of this bill to a Senate committee’.
 (Hon. A.M. Somlyay)—Is the amendment seconded?
—I second that motion.
—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Lalor has moved an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The question now is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Tuckey, Wilson, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—Might I say that I have just heard quite an amazing speech from the member for Lalor in which she has put a case for risk rating in the health insurance area. In other words, presumably by government subsidy in this case, she has put a case for the removal of community rating. To be honest, I personally hope that she does have her Senate inquiry, because I can give her all the figures she says do not exist. She is so interested in the figures that when you start to tell her how the system would work under private insurance she runs out of the chamber. She is demanding that people need to know; she is demanding that all the detail be put on the table. I am going to take up her invitation and give her some round figures now. I look forward to the inquiry when I will go and demonstrate how it will work—as we did in 1988 when it was tested for accuracy by actuaries and leading economic people, who were used by the Labor Party in the last election. This is just the point. I have said of the member previously that she appears arithmetically challenged and she carries on with the fact that there is no cost if you put people back in the public system.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The speech by the member contained an imputation. I ask you to bring him back to order.
—The member for O’Connor will confine his remarks to the bill.
—I was referring, in terms of arithmetic, to the arguments put by the member for Lalor when talking about the cost of private health insurance. She would like to know the exact cost of these rebates, which I support fully. By the way, I must declare an interest: I will be a beneficiary. But the fact of life is that there seems to be an assumption that the more people you move into the public system the less money it costs. Of course, that is not supported by budgets that have been written since this occurred. It is a fact that everybody who takes out private insurance, even under the maximum rebate proposed in this legislation, will still contribute out of their own pocket 60 per cent of the cost of their medical treatment. If you shift people over to the public system on certain occasions when the private hospitals cannot provide the service, the appropriate health fund continues to pay the public hospital. Public hospitals are out there every day looking for privately insured patients to help with their underresourced budgets. Of course, public hospitals are typically funded on the basis of a block budget, which makes every patient a liability to the financial managers. When one gets into private health insurance, the hospitals concerned get paid by the private health company for the service rendered. If the number of patients doubles, they get double the money and have the capacity to double the infrastructure and services, and that is the real problem with Medicare.
The member for Lalor has just put forward a powerful case suggesting that maybe there should be a rebate for younger persons for a policy of risk rating. In 1988, a policy that I prepared did just that. I put to the House an interesting situation which nobody would contemplate—that is, a government deciding to tell the Australian people that everybody who earned less than, say, $20,000 did not have to insure their home anymore and that the government would pay for it if it burnt down. Just stop and think about what would happen to the premium costs of all those who earned more than $20,000 if that great block of premiums were taken out of the system. Nobody in their right mind would contemplate that. The fundamental principle of insurance is to maximise the number of policyholders to minimise the premium by spreading the payout for the loss of a home, for instance, across so many people. Of course, your home burning down is a highly unpredictable event.
The member for Lalor just reminded us that older people put the greatest burden on the health system. We know that, and I trust we all have the compassion to accommodate their needs. When one risk rates the community based on the principle that everybody is in private health insurance and cannot forum shop as they do today, one sees that young people think (1) I am paying a Medicare levy and the government therefore owes me something and (2) I am virtually indestructible. Young people can accept with some confidence that Medicare will look after them if they get hit by a bus or have a premature heart attack, but if at a younger age they suffer a worn-out hip or a sporting injury—which young people do—that will be considered elective surgery and either they will pay for it out of their pocket or, as quite often happens, their football club will pay for it. They will be treated like everybody else—as a liability to the budget of a public hospital—and they will wait their turn.
I want to consider some relativities about what each age profile in the community takes out of the health system. I will quote the figures from 1988 that we put together with the aid of leading actuaries on exactly that principle. As I said, the figures were not questioned at the time. We found that, when everybody under 18—children, if you like—was put in one category, the premium required to support them was about $6.50 each per week. These figures can only be relative today. When we looked at the group of people between the ages of 18 and 60, the cost was somewhere around just under $10 each per week. When we looked at those above the age of 60, the cost was $26 each per week.
This legislation takes us one step closer to what was proposed at the time. The interesting thing about those figures is that, if everybody was put into private insurance at that point in time and the government chose to pay 100 per cent of the premium costs for every kid in the country—a very generous move, I imagine, considering the wealth of some parents—as well as for every aged pensioner and if the government provided, as we later did, a budget commitment of 80 per cent of the $26 premium for every person of pensionable age and addressed the issues of the unemployed and the middle-aged, the cost of all those subsidies, targeted as they were, would have been $4.3 billion. The cost of Medicare in that year was $7.3 billion. So, considering that the Medicare levy was just over $2 billion, you could have refunded that levy to all Australians, had some money in the bank as a government and had everybody privately insured with no waiting lists. I checked it out with every hospital in my electorate. They are small hospitals, and each and every one of them would have been better off financially under an arrangement of being paid per service rather than by being paid as they were by the state government with a block grant.
We would have provided a service, we would have maximised the benefits of putting all the money into private health insurance, we would have targeted people, and no Australian would have paid more than $10 a week for full access to doctors and hospitals at any one time. If the member for Lalor is so interested—and I do not think she has put up a bad argument—in the amount that people are charged for their private health insurance, she should get real about private health insurance. The minute you run parallel systems and all the good risks take the system they think costs nothing, you immediately end up with the outcome we have that she explained. She said—shock, horror!—‘Old people take more out of private health insurance than they put into it.’ Of course they do! And people who live in a forest tend to have their houses burnt down more often but they pay a risk rating for that purpose and nobody complains about it. These are the realities. The same applies with a car and other things. That is how commercial insurance operates.
As I said in the beginning of my speech, the situation with any other form of insurance where you encourage certain people not to insure is that the cost to others goes up. This legislation is designed to go further in a universal way—and I must question that approach—than one proposed years ago. I think I am with the member for Lalor: I would like to see everybody in private insurance. We cannot do British National Health. The Australian Constitution forbids the conscription of doctors. You cannot ring them all up one day and say, ‘As of tomorrow, whether you like it or not, you are on the government payroll.’ We can never have British National Health, but we have a group of people who think that only a public entity can deliver a service. That is the real issue. This is the philosophical issue which my side of politics supports. They think there are votes in it.
I think there would be votes in it if everybody knew that they had a genuine equal right to hospital services and that those services would be available to them if they were all privately insured. I have quoted the figures in this regard. I would like to think that this committee being proposed by the member for Lalor might try to update them and be honest about the situation. The commercial and arithmetic fact is that running a government health insurance system and a private health insurance system in parallel will always create distortions. Because of a constitutional requirement, Australia has only one choice to sort out that problem. I know it is not going to happen. I hear my minister every day tell us what a wonderful scheme we have, yet people are still on waiting lists. What would happen if we were to change sides in this House? In Western Australia, we saw what the Gallup government tried to do pre the last election in relation to the health system. They were going to fix it. They promised. But what we now have is a situation where ambulances go around the Perth metropolitan area every day to try to find somewhere to put patients. That is all that they achieved: nothing. As I said, when you have a public system where you are not paid for each patient, you have to be terribly careful as a financial administrator about how many patients you let through the front door. That is the downside of the system.
More people would take on private insurance if it were risk rated. I have given the House an indication of figures provided to me by actuaries at that time as to what that risk rating would be. Furthermore, it is appropriate for the government to say that everybody in need gets a subsidy. What is also rather interesting is that, instead of having a huge bureaucracy, sending money back and forth, approving applications and all that, you could provide that subsidy, for instance, to an aged pensioner—on evidence of having private health cover—simply by increasing their pension. You just have to reprogram the computer. We have a variety of ways of funding children, and you might add to those. In other words, if you subsidise people on their purchase of private health insurance, you need have no special administrative body at all. That is a clear cost saving.
Because I know other members want to speak, I make this point: if you want to start arguing the cost of private health insurance, as the member for Lalor has, if you want to investigate it, investigate it on the basis also of it being the sole provider. State governments can then make up their minds whether they want to be in the business of funding hospitals. They might choose to sell them and we could get a proper competitive market-oriented system. But you cannot have both if you want to give a good service and do it at a fair cost to the individual. I have quoted those figures in that regard. I am looking forward to a letter from the member for Lalor asking me to come along and give the committee the benefit of research that was properly conducted which goes back to 1988, which I still have in my possession.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I start by acknowledging that the previous speaker has very strongly-held beliefs in relation to Medicare and takes quite an anti-Medicare position. I would like to remind him of some of the problems that existed before Medicare was in place. The main problem was the fact that many people who went through the health system were unable to pay for their treatment. They were unable to afford to take out insurance, and when they failed to pay their hospital bills they were prosecuted. I do not think that that is the type of system we need in Australia. I do not think that is the type of system that the majority of members of this House would like to see in place. I think that the previous speaker is really out of kilter not only with what we believe on this side of the House but also with what the government has put forward. I would like to put on record that I totally oppose the system that the member for O’Connor was talking about. I do not think that it would benefit the majority of Australian people. I do not think it would benefit the older people whom this legislation looks to help. And I certainly do not think that it would benefit the majority of people whom I represent in this House.
The Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004 is the vehicle that the Howard government is using to deliver on its election promise to increase the private health insurance rebate for people between the age of 65 and 69 from 30 per cent to 35 per cent, and for people over 70 years of age from 30 to 40 per cent. This applies to both ancillaries and hospitals. This election promise was announced by the Prime Minister on 22 August. I believe that it is not based on sound health economic principles. I believe that it is based on flawed principles. I do not think that it is the best and most efficient use of our health dollars and there are some major problems with it. While Labor will let this piece of legislation go through the House, I strongly support the amendments moved by the shadow minister, and I will talk about that a little later.
The Prime Minister used this as an election bribe in the lead-up to the election. He did not think about the implications of it in terms of delivering health services and in terms of health costs. He did not look at it from the point of view of the long-term implications of actually keeping the costs of health insurance down. It is based on some of these premises that this legislation is very flawed. I do understand that the Prime Minister likes to look after his friends in the private health insurance industry and I think he is doing this here. Rather than delivering health care dollars directly to the Australian people—directly to health services—he is giving health dollars to the insurance industry. That whole process is quite flawed.
This rebate, as I have already mentioned, is bad policy. I will deal a little bit with the legislation here: like the existing 30 per cent rebate, the higher rebate will be able to be claimed as premium reductions through a private health insurance fund, a direct payout from Medicare offices or a tax offset in annual income tax returns. The premium discount option is used by 95 per cent of taxpayers and the cash payment option is available for those retirees who no longer pay income tax. The simple fact that 95 per cent of premium payers take it in that discount option demonstrates that premiums are very high and that the government’s policy in this area has not really worked.
I would like to mention at this point that despite the introduction of the 30 per cent increase there has been a continual spiralling in the cost of health insurance. It went up by 4.9 per cent in June 1999 and by 1.8 per cent in March 2000. I give full credit to the previous Minister for Health, Minister Wooldridge. He vetoed a 3.25 per cent increase that HBF wanted to introduce in that year. But, come 2002, the premiums went up 6.9 per cent. In March 2003 they went up 7.4 per cent, and in February they went up by 7.58 per cent. It has hardly done much to stop the increase in private health insurance, has it? In addition to that, the money that is going into propping up the health insurance industry is money that could be spent within the health industry providing health services and health care to all Australians.
Currently, over one million Australians over the age of 65 have private health insurance. Of these, 350,000—or a bit over—are aged between 65 and 69. The percentage of older Australians with private health insurance is less than the national average, which is currently 43 per cent. That declines with increasing age. Many older Australians held private health insurance before the introduction of Medicare and Medicare Private. Some of them have retained it, but they really do struggle to keep up with the rising cost of premiums. The Prime Minister is giving this little token to them, but this in itself will not remedy the situation. The Prime Minister has given statements which conflict with those of the Minister for Health and Ageing. The Prime Minister, on 22 August, said this increase was:
... an additional reward for older Australians who really value their private health insurance to keep that health insurance, and ... a valuable additional incentive for them to do so.
But the minister said he thought that this would lead to a modest increase in the total number of people taking out private health insurance. It is quite interesting to look at the effect that the 30 per cent rebate has actually had on increasing the number of older people who take out private health insurance. I have the figures here. There has actually been a decline in the number of people over the age of 75 taking out private health insurance—a decline of about one per cent since the rebate was introduced. Older people are voting with their feet. They know that the services that are available in private hospitals are limited. Private hospitals work on the premise of getting people in, treating them and getting them out fairly quickly. That is great for operations like cataract operations but not for the more complex operations. When it comes to more complex operations, older Australians tend to need the services that are provided in our major public teaching hospitals. To think that this legislation will encourage more older people to take out private health insurance is flawed. To be quite honest, I think the Prime Minister is living in fairyland.
Whilst the premiums that private health insurance companies are charging are constantly increasing, the profits that they are making are also increasing. I do not think you can justify that in any way. I was looking at the disclosure of interests for councillors following the last council election in my area. NIB, one of the private health insurance companies, gave political donations to a group of candidates. I am yet to understand how local government relates to private health insurance, but NIB gave donations to the conservative grouping that was running for the Newcastle Council. To my way of thinking, that is not good use of policyholder money. I have been contacted about this matter. The members of that private health insurance company were most distressed that their money was being used not to deliver better health insurance to them but rather to fund a local government election.
Members of private health funds raise with me the fact that they go to hospital and have their operation but when it comes time to pay their bills they find that there is a gap. In some cases it is a very significant gap and it places them in extreme financial hardship. The government should be looking at and addressing the relationship between private health insurance companies and private hospitals and looking for a way that they can remove this gap. It is all very well saying, as the previous speaker did, that everybody should be forced to take out private health insurance and that that would be the only system we would have in place. If that were the situation, I would hate to think how many people in this country would be unable to afford to have the health treatment that they needed.
The policy of private health insurance has always been fraught with problems. It is quite interesting that private health insurance premiums have risen by 22 per cent over the last three years and by about 33 per cent over the last five years. At the current rate of premium increase, the benefit of the five per cent rebate in dollar terms will be wiped out in less than a year. So the lower premiums promised to all those aged 65 to 69 will be eroded in only one year. That is hardly a good outcome for them. The 10 per cent that is going to be offered to people aged 70 years and over will be eroded in only two years.
I will spend a bit of time on the amendments that the shadow minister raised—I think that would be in the interests of the House and everyone in this debate. The first amendment highlights the fact that private health insurance does not provide real choice in health care. As I have mentioned, there are significant costs for people who take out private health insurance, and there are real limits—some procedures are not covered through private health insurance. Last July BUPA stopped paying no-gap benefits for medical perfusion procedures, which are utilised during cardiac surgery; Australian Unity has restricted some psychiatric and rehabilitation benefits; and the Howard government are hot to trot on legislation to limit gap coverage on prostheses. I do not understand how this is real choice. It is not real choice for a pensioner with very limited finances who is told that they can have a procedure in a private hospital because they have private health insurance, but at the end of the day they are going to have to pay a gap of somewhere between $1,000 and $2,000, and maybe well over that. To my way of thinking, that is not real choice.
That links to the second part of this amendment—that is, ensuring that private health insurance delivers real value. I do not think it does. This government has a strong philosophical commitment to anything that is private, but for us to go down this path we need to be sure that this is the best way to deliver benefits to people and to ensure that they get the health treatment that they are entitled to and deserve. Money spent on health is about better services and better health care. I honestly cannot see how this legislation will deliver that.
The third point in this amendment is about the government failing to address the health care needs of older Australians. The other issue, which I have not spent time on, relates to modelling. The modelling that has been done is flawed to say the least—in fact, I think it is as good as nonexistent. Good modelling that systematically examines this issue needs to be conducted. This is particularly important regarding the question of whether older Australians can be induced to take out private health insurance through real or perceived decreases in prices. When it comes to lowering the cost of health insurance, the real issue, as previous speakers have mentioned, is trying to get more young people to take out private health insurance. This legislation does nothing towards that.
This government is philosophically committed to private health insurance and that clouds its judgment. The Howard government has failed to deliver real health benefits to older Australians. This legislation is not about delivering health services and care to older Australians; it is about propping up the health insurance industry and looking after its friends. This is a government of ideologues who are committed to private health insurance at all costs. It is not a government that is about delivering positive health outcomes for all Australians in the most timely and economically efficient and effective manner. This is a government driven by its philosophy, not by what is best for Australia and Australians. In no area of policy is this more obvious than in the area of health. I urge the members to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister. (Time expired)

Debate (on motion by Mr John Cobb) adjourned.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—There should be commemoration and remembrance by all Australians today because it has been ten short weeks since Medicare Gold was proposed by the opposition spokesperson for silly ideas, as I will explain later. On a more reflective note, the end of this year could well have been the time where private health insurance fell to such a low level that it ceased to exist in this country. In 1995 it was falling at 2.2 per cent per annum and in the absence of three brilliant policy interventions by the coalition government there could well have been adverse selection, leading to only the sickest taking out private health insurance, falling numbers of people going into private hospitals, spiralling costs of private health care insurance and eventually—possibly—the end of the private health insurance sector that we know today.
Today also marks a somewhat ideological aphasia on the other side of this House to even acknowledge that there can be any form of health provision apart from a strictly universalised and government provided one. But today health is no longer a handful of proven drugs and a very rudimentary surgical arsenal. Health today offers many choices that Australians can enjoy in both the public sector and the private sector.
Against the policy incentive that is being moved today, the opposition continue to plead universality then concede that point by talking about an 85 per cent reward for bulk-billing. They deny private health insurance and allow it to wither away while in government but on the other hand tolerate a 30 per cent rebate—purely because soft Labor voters in internal polling clearly support it. They first object to a PBS copayment and then support it. In the interests of universality they will scrap a safety net. Then finally they come here today to speak against what is effectively a finessing of the private health insurance rebate.
I noticed that the member for Lalor was at a loss to find figures that would be of any use to her in ascertaining whether an increase in the private health insurance rebate would be effective. And yet here it is in front of us. On August this year, Palangkaraya and Yong published a paper titled Effects of recent carrot-and-stick policy initiatives on private health insurance coverage in Australia. It is there to read. In it, they acknowledge that the issue is extraordinarily complex and that these figures will not necessarily become clear cut and easily available. They refer to lifetime health cover having an influence on between 42 per cent and 75 per cent of the overall increase in PHI membership. These are not precise figures.
At what point have the opposition found it difficult to extract the figures they need from a rather fulsome left-wing health-economic-academic sector to which they have a number of ties? Perhaps they should ask one more time. Keep in mind, Mr Deputy Speaker, that these are serial policies introduced by the coalition government that are overlaid—one on top of the other. It is not easy to tease them out and work out which one of them is actually responsible for any increase in PHI levels, because each year, as someone becomes a year older, the lifetime health cover penalty goes up two per cent. One cannot easily tease that out without removing lifetime health cover altogether and trying to look at two populations. Remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, as we increase the private health insurance rebate—as we are doing today—with an incentive, the effect of the two per cent increase in the lifetime health cover premium is also slightly decreased. It is an incredibly complex analysis, and a problem to which I suspect even the health spokesperson for the opposition will never find an answer.
Australians are a varied people. We value choice—we always have—in the private and public sectors. But against these ideas today are the opposition, with a single-stringed violin playing the same old tunes about universality long after they have been rejected by the bulk of the Australian people. There is an ideological resistance there to PHI, and they will die in the ditch to stop the rebate, then let it through, then come along today and dissemble about the lack of data to back up the proposal that we increase it.
Let us put this into perspective. There is $3,600 spent on every Australian for public health insurance and, for an increase of $300, we move 44 per cent of Australians onto private hospital waiting lists and off state public hospital waiting lists. Today we are talking about raising it by between $50 and $200 for a family. These are only relatively small expenditures compared to what we spend every day on public health insurance, yet they have an enormous impact at state level. Needless to say, most state hospitals simply turn down the dial, cut back a couple of surgical lists each week, make nursing theatre staff that little bit harder to find, and they capture all of the surplus and all of the savings that accrue through nearly half the population having private health cover.
This government believes in the spectrum of choice for Australian health care consumers. As Australians we all value different services in health or education, or even choices within the private sector, that we are capable of making every day. There is evidence of choice. The opposition might have an argument if only the 44 per cent of wealthiest Australians chose private health cover, but it is not the case. A third of the top three deciles choose not to take it. Nearly a third of the poorest three deciles choose to take it. This is not a case of rich versus poor.
Enter Medicare Gold. I move slightly away from the bill because this is the counterpoint. The alternative presented by the opposition spokesperson for silly ideas—that was the member for Lalor—was a proposal that we spend not $2.6 billion—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Bowman should refer to the opposition spokesperson for health by her proper title.
 (Mr Quick)—Yes, I would remind the new member of parliament that he should refer to honourable members by their titles.
—That is at least the third time that he has used that name.
—The member for Lalor has proposed spending not $2.6 billion to cover nine million people and move them into private health cover but double that, $5.2 billion, to cover just 1.2 million people. Instead of $6 billion coming into the overall health system through PHI, we have 400,000 senior Australians moving out of that health pool who are the loyal and long-term members with private health insurance. Women predominate in these age groups; they are more risk averse and more likely to take out private health insurance. They would all be lost in this age group had PHI been done away with.
What has been proposed as an alternative to this bill, in the form of Medicare Gold, is triage by birth certificate. Australians cannot be divided into two neat groups of those under 74 years of age and those over 74. That is effectively what would happen. To quote the Prime Minister, eliminating waiting lists for those over 75 is great for those over 75. We know from state governments and their health systems that that can only lead to penalising those under 75. So, the alternative to the incentive in this bill is a government-sponsored entitlement mentality that, as soon as you reach the age of 75, all services are available; but for those under 75 they are not. It was effectively a clayton’s form of PHI—a private room and a doctor of your own but nothing that made a great deal of difference to health outcomes. We today support the incentive and the increase. But it is important to underline that it is not being done specifically to raise the numbers in private health insurance. It is a reward for long-time loyalty to making the choice and taking the decision to look after one’s own health.
The member for Lalor was concerned that she had no data on elasticity of demand. I do not think that is a terribly important figure today. If she has to know the estimated elasticity of demand—that is, how much one increases the PHI rebate and then how much of an increase one gets in PHI membership—it is negative 0.23, if that really makes a difference to gaining her support for this bill. But it is predominantly cushioning, if you keep in mind that lifetime health cover targets about 72 per cent of the population between 30 and 65. It is entirely appropriate then to do something else for those over 65.
There is one last very good reason for doing so. In any health care encounter with a hospital, it is typically going to be either emergent care or elective care. As one gets older it is more likely to be emergent than elective, simply because of the logical assumption that with age one becomes less healthy and requires more visits to medical providers. As one becomes older, the provision of emergent care through a state public system is reasonably reliable and PHI thereby becomes slightly less attractive. The evidence for that is the fall in PHI levels. Insurance levels fall from the 40 per cent or so for those under 65 years of age down to 30 per cent and down to as low as 20 per cent for those over 80 years old, which the member for Shortland alluded to. So, for many of these people, an incentive, a reward or a cushioning for increasing private health insurance costs is entirely appropriate.
There is also a notion of intergenerational equity, because many Australians—and we have the figures from the work by Elizabeth Savage—have had private health coverage for a long period of time. The greatest impact of the coalition government’s three initiatives has been for people aged 40 to 65. It is entirely appropriate then to have an incentive that benefits those who are over 65. To say that perhaps there should be a reward for those under the age of 30 is just a matter of policy options, but keep in mind that lifetime health cover remains an extraordinarily effective policy intervention for individuals below the age of 30.
Today’s legislation is effectively about a finessing of the private health insurance system which is part of a broad range of health services which is internally contestable, accountable and provides choices—whether a person wishes to have public or private care. It is also a measure of the Australian people’s demand for choice. This is not so much an agenda being pushed by this government as a reflection of Australians’ preference for choice in health—as they have with access to a universal Medicare rebate, as they have with a safety net, and as they have with ancillary and combined private health insurance coverage. Finally, this is about health insurance which is becoming more affordable. I commend this bill because, in effect, it makes private health cover easier and more affordable to retain into one’s senior years of life.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,1
"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I rise to speak to the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004. The purpose of this bill is to increase the private health insurance rebate from 30 per cent to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69; and to increase it to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over. This was a commitment made by the Prime Minister during the election period, and I think that is one aspect we really have to analyse: what was the purpose of making this commitment during the election period? I think that one could say that, at the end of the day, regrettably, this was just one part of a large swag of proposals put forward by the Prime Minister as a bid to buy votes. We have contradictory views about what really is the benefit of the bill. When interviewed on 3AW, the Minister for Health and Ageing said:
We think there will be a modest increase in the total number of people with private health insurance as a result of this.
That was 23 August, the day after the Prime Minister launched this policy and said:
It is an additional reward for older Australians who really value their private health insurance to keep that insurance.
Was the Prime Minister being more honest and up front in admitting that this was about an additional payment or—if I can describe it as such—an additional bribe to older voters? Or is it in fact what the health minister would have us believe, and that is that it has some purpose in health policy—that it is a contribution to making our health system more efficient? I think, unfortunately, in this case, the Prime Minister would appear to be closer to the mark. And that is the tragedy of this legislation—a piece of legislation that has a cost of around $450 million a year.
One of the debates that we need to continue to have if we are going to spend these large amounts of money is whether the money can be directed more efficiently to get better outcomes for improving our health system. I think that we need greater contributions to the debate than the sorts of contributions that we have had here today that decry the opposition’s genuine attempt during the election campaign to put forward an alternative proposal, the Medicare Gold proposal, to extend and build on the success that has been Medicare and Medibank.
In the minister’s second reading speech, he indicated that the people who will benefit from this bill are a generation that believes in self-reliance. He said:
This is a generation whose byword is self-reliance and whose commitment to private health insurance cover has helped to keep the whole system going.
Thirty years ago, when Medibank was put in place—when there was no universal health cover—it did not take much self-reliance to understand that private provision through private health insurance was something that should be looked at. This is a generation that can remember an era before Medibank, when access to all aspects of the health system was dependent on a person’s ability to pay. We forget this sometimes. Perhaps one of the reasons that younger people are not enamoured with private health insurance is that they know that the universal provision gives them access to what is acknowledged to be a fine health system—a system that we can make better. But when you hear the stories of the people of the generation that this bill is attempting to benefit, people who remember when it was not only the journey to the general practitioner but also any subsequent admission to hospital that was dependent upon a person’s ability to pay, you see that it was a different era and a different mind-set that people had to have. Thank goodness we have moved on from when a patient could be in the ward and the hospital arbiter came along and negotiated a fee and decided to what extent a patient would be a charity case. Sometimes there really needs to be a recognition of what the health system was like a short time—30 years or a generation and a bit—ago.
The figures show that private health insurance take-up is directly inversely related to a person’s ability and household income. The member for Bowman neatly aggregated figures to one-thirds to try to make it appear that the percentages were not that far out of whack. But in households where the income is under $20,000 there are 23 per cent of people with private health insurance, and in households with incomes over $100,000 the percentage is 84 per cent—and the points in between form a curve that just goes up. That is a different statistical analysis to that given by those opposite in trying to justify that there is not much difference. It is clear that there is a great difference. It is even clearer if we look at the age of the people in those households. It is acknowledged that older Australians already have a higher percentage, no matter what their income is. And those who have had private health insurance will get the benefit of the increased rebate.
But if in fact it is as Minister Abbott suggests—that is, that this is an attempt, at a cost of $450 million a year or whatever the figure is, to increase the level of private health insurance in the age groups in question—let us look at the capacity and the ability to pay, just on the basis that, for those aged 65 to 69, there will be a five per cent differential or, for those over 70, a 10 per cent differential. Then, let us look deeper and take in other aspects of the policy, because, in different circumstances, the cost of private health insurance can be quite considerable and quite different for people in similar circumstances. That is because of the lifetime health cover penalty. For example, a 68-year-old person who wants to take out comprehensive cover might pay in the order of $1,400 a year after the 35 per cent rebate. If they had bought private health insurance before July 2000—and therefore were not subject to the lifetime health cover penalty—they would pay only $845. If we are really serious about tackling the problem that the government suggests that we have with providing health services to older Australians, let us go to things like that. So the incentive in this bill for people to take out cover really loses all impact.
Older Australians are aware of what has happened since the private health insurance rebate came into existence. They are aware that it has not curtailed the way in which the premiums have increased. Again, this goes against what was suggested at the time that this policy was put in place. If in the past the Prime Minister and the ministers responsible have not been able to assess the impact properly, why should we believe that on this occasion they are going to do any better? Why should we believe that there will in any way be downward pressure because of these rebates? In fact, if we look at the different costs for treatment of different age groups, it is clear that there will be greater pressure if this bill is successful in increasing the numbers taking out private health insurance in the age groups that we are suggesting.
Some of the justification that is given for a measure like this that is targeted at older Australians is that the government has re-found its Intergenerational Report of 2002-03, which was put down in the 2002 budget. We have the Treasurer going around the countryside saying ‘demography is our destiny’—that is his catchcry—‘and these are the issues that we have to look at.’ But in an interview on the ABC on Thursday, 25 November, what did the Treasurer say about health costs by age group? He said:
The cost of health care for somebody between 35 and 54 is $1,700, on average. If you’re over 85, it’s $7,900. So in that older group of Australians, health care costs per person are four times what they are for younger Australians.
That was the Treasurer setting out the facts.
During the election campaign, when Labor talked about Medicare Gold and indicated that, because private health insurance hospital cover would be taken over by Medicare Gold for older Australians, premiums should drop for younger Australians due to the differential between the amount of resources required, it was pooh-poohed. But that is what we are facing. We acknowledge that senior Australians will have this impact. I say to anybody who suggests that any of the proposals that are put forward are unaffordable: does that mean that we should give up?
The differential between the costs for older Australians and the costs for younger Australians will not change because of the way that the bills are paid. The differential will not change if they are paid direct from public coffers, if they are paid in a shandy between private and public provision or if they are paid directly by private provision. Basically, the core of those costs is about the treatment that is involved, its complexity and the way medical technology makes treatments available.
The challenge for Australia—having acknowledged that fact—is to be serious about the way the effort is shared. We have a system that has the complication that the public provision and public effort, under a federal system, is shared between the Commonwealth and the states—and that brings with it certain problems. It is also shared because we have private provision and public provision. To the extent that those opposite champion private provision and self-reliance, it is consistent that we have a piece of legislation like this because it is an attempt to encourage a shift across that divide.
But is it the most efficient way? It is not often acknowledged or mentioned now that the 30 per cent rebate was put in place because of the crisis we had with waiting lists for people to gain treatment in hospitals. The 30 per cent rebate now goes across the wide range of things that private health insurance provides, but at the time it was introduced it was an attempt to acknowledge that waiting lists in hospitals were a problem that needed to be tackled. All we hear about now is that it is about the magical limits and the percentage of the population that has private health insurance, without going into what that means. At best, the evidence is conflicting about the effect this has had on waiting lists. I believe it has had a negligible effect on waiting lists, on the basis of the stories and cases that come through my office. So until we get back to trying to set goals which are achievable, which we understand and which are not at the periphery, we are never going to tackle some of these issues properly. We are never going to tackle them properly unless we have the bigger debate.
We have a system that is based on the 30 per cent rebate, which is support of an industry sector—the health insurance industry—which indirectly leads to provision of health services, and we never understand what is lost by putting in these measures with the steps removed. When people suggest that perhaps it would have been better if the money had been directly given to the health system—that it would have been more efficient—again, people think that is nonsense. It is the aspect that is overlooked in the discussion on Medicare Gold, which was about creating efficiencies, avoiding the nonsense of duplication and avoiding the nonsense of competing interests between federal and state governments—which mean nothing to older Australians; they just want access to treatment. If there is a measure that can bring savings of $500 million to $600 million to the system, shouldn’t we be looking at that? But, no—in the argy-bargy after the election, we just throw it out; it is not worth continuing the debate. That is nonsense; it is worth continuing the debate.
The other aspect I want to go to relates to the comments the Treasurer has made about the response to the Intergenerational Report, which he has now picked up on again. In an interview on the ABC, in tackling the ‘demography is destiny’ question, he said:
We’ll either deal with it in small licks early on, or be forced to deal with it in larger dislocation later on.
If we are dealing with it in ‘small licks’, I would like to be assured that the small licks, when aggregated, are actually moving in the same direction. I am not sure that they are, and I do not think the Treasurer knows whether they are. I think this is piecemeal. When measures come out of the blue during an election campaign, I simply ask: what is going on? Where is the context for these measures? Has there been development of policies that this might be one part of? What is the next move from this government? Do they know? I do not believe they do. I say to the Treasurer: forget about the small licks. I agree with the ‘early on’ bit, but let us get the solution up front. If he has to put in partial measures, I am happy to do that—if the resources are not available—but do not have this nonsense that we are going to do it in small licks when the small licks do not relate to each other. That is the aspect that is destroying this debate about public policy: it should be in context. If the Australian public are to have a whole system that is effective, they deserve that we operate that way. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,21,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—The opposition’s history in government is fairly chequered as far as delivery on its election promises is concerned. The Howard government though, having put forward policies to the Australian people prior to the last legislation and having received a mandate to implement those policies, is particularly keen to receive the support of the parliament to enable us to deliver in full and on time the promises that we made. We were re-elected at the last election with an increased majority, and the principles contained in the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004 implement a promise made to Australians aged over 65 with private health insurance.
I do find it somewhat astounding in the second reading amendment to see the Australian Labor Party wanting to refer this bill off to a Senate committee. The government put forward a platform prior to the last election and said to the Australian people, ‘If you re-elect us, we will bring in a bill which will implement our policy,’ and this bill implements that policy. We went to Australian people and we said, ‘If you re-elect us, this is what will happen’—and the Australian Labor Party possibly wants us to break our promise to the Australian people. They are not happy that this bill implements what we said we would do for the Australian people. They want to send it off to a Senate committee and to see that committee probably butcher the bill so that as a government we are unable to deliver in full.
The Australian health system is an excellent one; it is a system that is being presided over by this government. On the Sunshine Coast, more than 10,000 people in my electorate of Fisher will benefit directly from this proposed increase in the private health insurance rebate for older Australians. I suspect that, if honourable members opposite took a sampling of public opinion in their respective electorates, they would find that thousands—in some cases, tens of thousands—of people would benefit from the proposed increase in the private health insurance rebate for older Australians. I do find it somewhat difficult that some of these members could actually stare down their constituents who would benefit from this proposed improvement in the private health insurance rebate and somehow say that they want to make it more difficult for their older Australians to remain in private health insurance.
This bill represents a real win-win situation for all Australian health service consumers. As I said, in my electorate of Fisher, taking in part of the Sunshine Coast and hinterland region, more than 10,000 people aged over 65 will benefit from the policy change included in this particular bill. More than 10,000 people aged over 65 have private health insurance. In total, 49 per cent of adults—almost 40,000 people—in the electorate have health fund cover.
I have to say that I thought it was really unfortunate that during the election campaign the Labor Party, Greens and Democrats all indicated that they opposed the higher rebate for people aged over 65; indeed, even worse given the statistics, that the Democrats and the Greens are opposed to the existing 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance and want it abolished. It took quite some time for the Australian Labor Party to commit itself with respect to the 30 per cent rebate. I am not convinced that, if the Australian Labor Party were ever re-elected to the Treasury bench, the rebate would survive. But the Greens and the Democrats have been up front; they have said that they are opposed to the existing 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance and they want it abolished. Is it any wonder that many people have deserted the minor parties when they see that the minor parties are simply unable to stand up for older Australians who, during their working lives, have worked so hard to make Australia the wonderful nation that it is.
Australia is a wealthy country and I believe that we owe to our pensioners and retirees incentives to enable them to remain in private health insurance. Many of those people, during their working lives and during the period when they had fewer medical needs, were in private health insurance. Part of the aim of the legislation currently before the chamber is to make it possible for as many of those people as possible to remain in private health insurance.
Opposition to the government’s proposal is very short-sighted indeed. In effect, opponents of the higher rebate are saying that they want older people to pay more for their health insurance than would be necessary if the higher rebate were provided. At the same time, we find that honourable members of the opposition tend to whinge and whine and bleat and complain about the unacceptable public hospital waiting lists, particularly for elective surgery. We ought to appreciate, of course, that public hospitals are the responsibility of the state governments. I just think it is really short-sighted for the Australian Labor Party to say that a policy such as that being implemented by this bill ought not to be supported, because the obvious consequence of the failure of this legislation to pass would be that more people who, with the benefit of this legislation, would be able to access private hospitals would be forced back on to public hospital waiting queues, making it even more difficult for those people who cannot afford private insurance—even with the rebate—to receive public hospital cover.
Without this rebate, many older people who have paid private health insurance cover for years would simply be unable to remain in private health insurance. Many of these older people are on fixed incomes and you would find that they would be disadvantaged at a stage in their life when the nation ought to be making it possible for us as a community to say thanks to them for their wonderful contribution in prior years. Potentially many older Australians may suffer from serious illnesses and would have a high priority for a public hospital bill and, if they drop out of private health insurance, it means the public hospital waiting queues will grow ever longer. I would have thought it should have been compelling logic that if we are able to encourage as many people as possible to remain insured, especially senior Australians, that is good for the overall health system.
Most honourable members would be aware that, statistically, people aged over 65 use more hospital services than any other age group. In the electorate of Fisher for example—and I suspect that our statistics are probably not dissimilar to those from other electorates, although Fisher is one of the oldest electorates in Australia—almost 8,000 people over 65 used their private health insurance to cover hospital treatment last year. To put it another way, combined they spent more than 32,500 days in hospital. These figures prove that if opposition to the proposed higher rebate forced even small numbers of older Australians to drop their cover the impact on the public system could be devastating. The 30 per cent rebate has made it possible for many older people on fixed or low incomes to remain insured, and the increases proposed by the government which have been opposed by our opponents will make it even more affordable for them to remain insured.
As I said, this bill implements a key election commitment to Australians aged over 65. Indeed, it implements a key election commitment given to the Australian community, and this policy was one of the reasons why this government was returned and the opposition languishes on the other side of the House. This bill implements a key election policy, and that should be sufficient reason for this parliament to pass it. I said before that it also makes good health sense as far as our health system overall is concerned to have this policy implemented into the law of Australia. This bill will give Australians aged over 65 the continuing choice of doctor, hospital, priority of care and amenities such as private rooms that Labor’s Medicare Gold—often called fool’s gold—would have taken from these Australians.
Even the opposition would concede that the government campaigned strongly in the election campaign on this issue, especially with respect to Medicare Gold. Nobody could seriously suggest that the government does not have a mandate to implement its policy. The government certainly has a mandate to have passed by the parliament the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004. The aim is to increase the affordability of private health cover for older Australians at a time of life when they are most likely to need health services. These people contributed to private health insurance during their working lives, during their younger years when they enjoyed good health, yet we so often find that people have been to see me as a local member and, I suspect, other honourable members to explain how they simply cannot afford to remain in private health insurance at a time when they have increasing health needs. That is why this government will not apologise for the incentives which were promised during the election campaign and the incentives which it seeks to implement through the bill currently before the chamber.
Older Australians, particularly those on fixed and low to moderate retirement incomes, deserve a further reward for contributions paid over many years of health fund membership. How on earth could the opposition in some way, shape or form suggest that it is equitable that people who have struggled to pay private health insurance premiums over the years should be forced out of private health cover because they simply no longer have the income to remain in private health cover? Not only is this policy—the proposed change included in this bill—something for which we have a mandate, it is also giving decency and equity to senior Australians.
The higher rebate will mean a saving on a typical couple or family policy of around $100 to $200 a year over the 30 per cent rebate. The opposition would have us believe that the measure rewards the older and sicker health fund members and does nothing to help bring or encourage younger and fitter people into private health cover. Of course, our 30 per cent rebate did a lot to encourage people to resume health cover. Older people taking out private health insurance are people who should be supported by the community, because as a nation we owe so much to those people. The Australian Labor Party opposed this policy in the last election. I have to say, given in particular the ageing of the Australian population, it is extraordinarily difficult to understand how they could justify such a punitive and discriminatory approach to Australians who, during their working lives, helped to make this nation what it is today. I suppose it does indicate just how out of touch the Australian Labor Party has become, just how removed it is from ordinary middle Australia, just how it has lost the ability to understand what older Australians need.
This government brought forward the policy which increased the rebate from 30 to 35 per cent for people aged 65 to 69 and to 40 per cent for people aged 70 years and over because we thought it was fair, equitable, appropriate and the right thing to do. As with the current 30 per cent rebate, the new rebates will be able to be claimed as a premium reduction through private health insurance funds—and this happens in about 95 per cent of cases presently—as a direct payment from Medicare offices or as a tax offset in annual income tax returns. The higher rebate will be available for hospital cover, ancillary cover and combined cover. The higher rebates will apply to individuals who meet the age thresholds and to couples and families where one or more of the persons covered in the policy meet these age thresholds. They will also be available for people who do not pay income tax. It is absolutely incredible that the Australian Labor Party, by seeking to refer this bill to a Senate committee, is seeking to force the government to break a key promise made to the Australian people prior to the last election. I strongly urge members to support the Private Health Insurance Incentives Amendment Bill 2004 and, in doing so, assist the government to implement an election promise made to senior Australians.

Leave not granted.",REPS,<title>MINISTER FOR VETERANS' AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Motion</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,32,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith:
That this House censure the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs for:
her maladministration and rorting of the Regional Partnerships Program;
repeatedly misleading the House of Representatives and failing to provide accurate information to the Parliament; and
failing to deal with clear conflicts of interest in the allocation of grants and breaching the Ministerial Code of Conduct in relation to the employment of Mr Ken Crooke.
What we have seen here is the classic Howard government charade, the classic Howard government defence of saying it is merely a clerical error and merely noncompliance with the ministerial code of conduct. The truth is the clerical error is about the allocation of $220,000 of public money, and the noncompliance is in fact a stunning breach of the ministerial code of conduct.
Let there be no doubt about the extent of the breach. The ministerial code of conduct says:
At the time of commencing their employment, ministerial consultants and members of ministers’ staff (including electorate officers) are required to complete statements of private interests on forms supplied by MaPS. The employing minister endorses the statement in writing after satisfying him or herself that there is no conflict of interest.
We now find out that Mr Ken Crooke did not lodge the statement of interest, that the ministerial code had been breached, that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs subsequently became aware of his conflict over the allocation of funding to A2 milk marketers, that she did not tell the Prime Minister and that she was sworn in as the new minister under false pretences. The Prime Minister would have the House believe that that does not matter and that it was simply a short-term contract and a short-term matter that was quickly dealt with.
What was dealt with was the fact that Mr Ken Crooke, who previously worked for Joh Bjelke-Petersen, came to Canberra for four months to allocate $400 million of regional pork rorts. This was no small matter. This was no mere bagatelle, no passing parade through Parliament House; this was someone sent by the Queensland National Party to support the member for Dawson in the misallocation of $400 million of regional pork rorts. Why wouldn’t the Australian taxpayers be worried about that? Why wouldn’t the hardworking Australian taxpayers say that it matters when someone has staffing responsibility and is working for a parliamentary secretary who is allocating $400 million of regional pork rorts in the lead-up to the federal election? Why wouldn’t they say that a parliamentary secretary who failed to have the appropriate paperwork and the appropriate declaration lodged under the ministerial code of conduct should be dismissed?
The truth is that she was sworn in as the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs under false pretences. She had breached the ministerial code of conduct as the parliamentary secretary. The Prime Minister calls it non-compliance. It is a clear breach and it again demonstrates that this Prime Minister will not take responsibility for the misconduct and the maladministration of his executive government. He tries to excuse it away as a clerical error. Most Australians would love to make a clerical error to the tune of $220,000 for a funding grant and lose the letter and effectively lose the grant for three months. Most Australians cannot dream of that amount of money coming their way in a three-month period, let alone dream that their expectations that $400 million of regional funding grants might be treated seriously by the government.
The Leader of the House has a Costello-style smirk on his face. He knows for a fact that Ken Crooke was a man on a mission. He came to Canberra for four months to assist in the distribution of $400 million of the regional pork rorts, mostly under the SONA secret guidelines. Why wouldn’t people take this seriously? The government wants to give us lectures about economic management but what sort of government excuses away the maladministration of $220,000 in a grant as a clerical error? What sort of government says that a pecuniary interest in the allocation of these massive programs does not matter? It is a government that has no economic credentials and standards of its own. If the government is willing to excuse away maladministration and dishonesty of this kind and breaches of the ministerial code of conduct, it will excuse away any bad behaviour and mistreatment of public funding by the executive government.
This minister must go. She was sworn in as the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs under a fraud—the fraud that she was a cleanskin and the fraud that she had complied with the ministerial code of conduct as parliamentary secretary. She told the House today that that was not the case and the Prime Minister admits that the code has been breached but he has failed to take action. Now the House should take action by censuring this minister. What we are seeing here through the Prime Minister’s failure to act is the massive arrogance and hubris of the Howard government. We have seen it through the three weeks of parliamentary sittings, best summarised by the Deputy Prime Minister’s statement at the end of one of the question time periods when he said: ‘We won. That is about the end of it.’ Basically, the parliament and the opposition can go jump.
We can find conflicts of interest relating to $400 million funding programs. We can find maladministration relating to significant grants but, according to the government and the Deputy Prime Minister, the government won and that is about the end of it. It is true that the government won the election but it does not own the money of this country. That is owned by the Australian taxpayers and part of the legitimate role of the opposition is to say that it should be spent properly, that the ministerial code of conduct should be complied with and this joke of a minister should be dismissed from the executive government.
We have seen a record level of rorting, the shocking abuse of public money through the regional pork rorts and the secret SONA slush fund. In the case of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, we have seen a record display of ministerial meltdown. The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs has only been in the job for six weeks but she has already racked up a serious conflict of interest through the infamous and well-named Ken Crooke and through the breach of the ministerial code of conduct. She knew about the directorship. She knew he had not lodged the paperwork or made the statement about the breach and the conflict of interest. We have also seen the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs twice mislead the parliament about the Horse Australia project in Rockhampton. We have seen one extraordinary statement of ministerial correction prior to question time to try and get Mr Abbott off the hook, given his misleading of the public earlier in the day. We have seen umpteen lost letters and grant announcements. She still cannot tell the parliament how many of these lost letters have emerged since the election to be date-stamped and sent out as part of her maladministration. We have seen her extraordinary inability to answer questions in the House of Representatives, yesterday hiding behind her feeble statement. Plus we have seen her problems in the media in trying to explain whether or not her husband works for her and whether or not he has a parliamentary email address. All of this is contrary to the ministerial code of conduct. What we have seen from Minister Kelly is a land-speed record for ministerial meltdown. She has had problem after problem and inability after inability to explain herself in the House of Representatives. You know she is going badly when you hear the whispering on the government back bench saying, ‘Bring back Danna’ or ‘Crikey! She makes Wilson look good’ or ‘Even Bronwyn would be doing better than this.’
—Order! The Leader of the Opposition will refer to members by the name of their seats.
—This is how well she is going. On Brisbane radio earlier today the member for Fisher said, ‘I’m not suggesting for a moment that Ms Kelly has handled this matter as elegantly as we could have. I do understand the frustration when a number of questions are asked and what do appear to be less than complete answers are given.’ The host of the radio program said, ‘She looked highly evasive though, Peter, didn’t she?’ The member for Fisher replied, ‘Well look, I’m not suggesting that she has performed well at all.’
You’re going bad when the member for Fisher puts in the slipper! This is a bloke who cannot even open a toilet door, and he is saying, ‘The minister’s got to be flushed away.’ She is hopelessly incompetent. She has been found guilty of maladministration and breaches. She cannot answer questions. She hides behind the statement that was made yesterday. I have to say that this statement of course looked simple enough. To members in the House yesterday, who got a copy of the tabled statement, it looked pretty simple: 2½ pages of verbiage from the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. But it turned out that it was actually an encyclopaedia of information. Every single thing you could conceivably ask the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs could be answered by the statement. If you had asked her yesterday who was going to win the second race at Randwick, she would have said it was in the statement. If you had asked her what Santa is going to bring you for Christmas, it was in the statement. Who was going to win the footy next year? It is all in the statement.
This is a minister who humiliated herself yesterday with an inability to handle the basic discharge of executive government by answering questions in the House of Representatives. In reality, she has no explanation for her behaviour and no defence for the rorting, the maladministration and the breach of the ministerial code of conduct. Yesterday, she was hauling that folder up and down, clinging to it like a security blanket. We were all wondering what was in the folder—probably 200 copies of the statement. That is the best she can do.
It is a minister who has been guilty of gross incompetence, breaching the ministerial code of conduct, losing letters, losing grants—massive maladministration over a six-week period; a land-speed record for ministerial meltdown. She should go and this Prime Minister at long last should display some decency in standards with regard to his executive government and find himself a new Minister for Veterans’ Affairs.
—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>MINISTER FOR VETERANS' AFFAIRS</title>,<title>Motion</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,32,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I second the motion. Another calamitous day, with the member for Dawson well and truly up Dawsons Creek. Just like yesterday, she was relying on her statement about the Horse Australia grant. Such was her reliance on the statement, no matter what we asked, she referred to her statement. Even when we stopped asking about horse rorts and started asking about milk rorts, she still referred to her statement. Today, we learnt a couple of new things. The first thing was that we got the collective noun for rorts: a batch of rorts. So when we asked her, ‘How many letters?’, she told us there was a batch of letters. The second thing we learnt today was that the ministerial code of conduct had not been complied with. The relevant documentation had not been filled out and no statement had been obtained—a breach of the code of conduct. Never mind, the Prime Minister was happy to excuse it.
When we asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs about Mr Crooke’s retention of the directorship and the question of conflict of interest, she said she gave Mr Crooke permission to retain his directorship on the condition that he would not carry out work as a director of this company. It was extraordinary. Presumably he told the minister he would not carry out this work. But he went off to the Queensland minister for primary industries, armed with his business cards as a director of that company, in the company of other directors and personnel from A2 Dairy Marketing Pty Ltd. Who was it that Mr Crooke was purporting to introduce as his replacement at the meeting with Mr Palaszczuk? No-one else at the meeting was introduced in a government or public liaison capacity. Beyond that, the minister told us she did learn of this meeting. Clearly that implied a breach of the code of conduct because Mr Crooke, notwithstanding whatever understandings he had given the minister, went to this meeting and talked about matters to do with the A2 milk project. But did she advise the Prime Minister when she became aware of his attendance at this meeting of the breach of the code of conduct? No, she did not, and she answered in the House, ‘No, no, no.’ It was a matter of no concern to her. The ministerial code of conduct is a matter of no concern to her.
We believe that this minister needs to be censured for her breach of the ministerial code of conduct. We believe she needs to be censured for misleading the House. We asked her again today how is it that she could believe that a press release was sent out at the time of her signing the Horse Australia grant yet, at the same time, write to Mrs Clelland of Horse Australia asking her to keep news of the grant confidential. She had no explanation for that matter. Notwithstanding that, when the Prime Minister says that he believes the principal charge against this minister is about that Horse Australia grant, that is not correct. The question which the Leader of the Opposition proposed was about the grant to A2 Dairy Marketers and the fact that $1.2 million of taxpayers’ money went to a company, the lobbyist for whom was a staff member in her office. The fact is that the minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Prime Minister have been unable to give us an acceptable explanation as to how this occurred. They have not been able to give us an acceptable explanation for this breach of the ministerial code of conduct.
We have a minister who has breached the ministerial code of conduct, misled the parliament and the people of Australia and not produced documentation to back up her claims that this is all about clerical errors. You would believe it was a departmental madman if you took the minister at her word on this. She has not come clean with the Australian people. She has improperly awarded $1.27 million to the A2 milk company. She has failed to deal properly with the conflict of interest issues involving her employment of Mr Crooke. What a calamity! The House deserves better than this. We deserve proper explanations for what has happened with these grants. We deserve the provision of documentation, and we deserve to have ministers who can administer this program in the public interest, not in the National Party’s electoral interest, not as some kind of National Party slush fund but something genuinely supporting regional Australia. We have had grants to the city—$220,000 in the electorate of Wentworth. (Time expired)

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—I would be the first to admit that the last fortnight is probably one that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs has not enjoyed. Of course, it has not been an easy time for her. But I will tell you this: the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, tough though she has found the last fortnight, has not found the last fortnight nearly as tough as the man temporarily occupying the Leader of the Opposition’s chair has. I have no reason to doubt the Leader of the Opposition’s statement that the member for Fisher said on radio today that he was not particularly impressed with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. The member for Fisher’s judgment of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is a lot less harsh than opposition frontbenchers’ judgment of the Leader of the Opposition temporarily occupying that chair.
The Leader of the Opposition has talked a lot today about $220,000 in public money—yes, that is important. It is important that money be administered properly, as it has been in this case. But he would have a lot more credibility talking about $220,000 in public money if he would give up the $42 million that he is trousering because of the maladministration of—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on two points of order. On the first point of order, you should get the Leader of the House to withdraw the last expression that he used. The last expression he used is a clear implication of impropriety; it is most inappropriate. We are about to have a debate on the royal commission to which the Leader of the House refers, and we had better set some standards now as to how it is going to be conducted or it is going to be a bit of a free-for-all on both sides, Mr Speaker, I can assure you—
—Order! I remind the member for Lalor that it is not orderly to threaten the chair.
—On the second point of order, I refer you to page 327 of House of Representatives Practice, which deals with the question of what is in and beyond relevance on the question of the suspension of standing orders. It clearly says that it should not be a means of putting before the House or canvassing matters outside the question as to whether or not standing orders should be suspended.
—On the first point, if the Manager of Opposition Business found an expression offensive I would ask the Leader of the House to withdraw it.
—I am happy to withdraw.
—The Leader of the House has just withdrawn, and I am about to rule on the second point of order. On the question of relevance to the debate, I have been listening carefully to the Leader of the House and he has been picking up points that were made by the mover and seconder of the motion. I call the Leader of the House.
—Returning to the motion—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. While the Leader of the House was sitting listening to the Manager of Opposition Business, as is his style he made a deeply offensive and unparliamentary remark about her and he should withdraw that as well.
—I do not know what it was but I am happy to withdraw whatever it was.
—Okay.
—Let us turn to the subject matter of the allegations made against the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. The first allegation is that she improperly made a grant to the horse centre in Rockhampton. It should now be abundantly clear, even to the slow learners opposite, that the grant was quite properly approved on 31 August, prior to the commencement of the caretaker period. All that happened was that a hardworking departmental liaison officer, in error—it was a minor clerical error—date-stamped letters 2 December that had been signed on 31 August.
Then there is the allegation that she improperly employed a Mr Ken Crooke. As she has made abundantly clear in statements to this House both written and oral, she was aware of his consultancy work for A2 milk and required him to sever his commercial relationship with A2 milk prior to his employment, and he did so. The third allegation is that the meeting which Mr Crooke subsequently had with the Queensland Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries was in breach of guidelines. As Mr Crooke has pointed out in his statement, which was tabled to the public last week, the consultancy arrangement had terminated and he only went to that meeting as a courtesy because an earlier meeting had been cancelled by the Queensland minister.
The fourth allegation asks: how could she have believed that the grant to the Rockhampton horse centre had been announced, given that she had written to the proponent of the scheme saying that the announcement would be made by Senator Boswell? It is simple—she understandably thought that Senator Boswell had issued a press release. There is nothing sinister about that. The fifth allegation claims that she must have misled the parliament because she said on Queensland radio on 17 September that the Queensland minister supported the project and he had not put out a press release about it. There are many ways of finding out the attitude of a Queensland minister apart from either (a) having a press release from him or (b) being informed about a meeting in breach of a statement that you had earlier made to the parliament. She told us precisely how it had happened today.
Finally, the sixth allegation against the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is that she failed to adhere to the ministerial guidelines in respect of her non-requirement of a formal statement of interest from Mr Ken Crooke. As the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs has made abundantly clear to this parliament, it was a very short-term contract of just three months. As the Prime Minister has made clear to the parliament, yes, it was a technical breach but the fact of the matter is that there was nothing wrong with any of the grants that were handled by the minister when she was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. There has been nothing improper, nothing immoral and nothing corrupt about her behaviour. On those grounds, she certainly does not deserve to be sacked because of what is at most a mere technical breach. In fact, she has abundantly complied with the substance of the guidelines. Let me quote her statement, ‘I was aware of Mr Crooke’s consultancy work for A2 milk and required him to sever his commercial relationship prior to his employment.’ As Mr Crooke said, ‘By arrangement with De-Anne Kelly I ended my consultancy work with A2 milk when I entered into this short-term contract with her.’
What are the ministerial guidelines all about? The ministerial guidelines are all about ensuring that there is no conflict of interest—and the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs did precisely that. She informed herself of the relevant issues and she required her short-term staff member to do everything that could possibly be required under the spirit of these guidelines. There was no conflict of interest.
—She didn’t put a form in.
—All right, she did not put a form in. Paul Keating, as Prime Minister, did not put a form in for two years about his tax returns. These are the people who are enjoying $42 million in taxpayers’ largesse based on maladministration and now they claim to be outraged by the mere non-lodgment—
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is precisely the same point I have made before—

An opposition member—He is frothing at the mouth.
—Precisely; he is frothing at the mouth. Mr Speaker, Minister Abbott is well away from the topic of the suspension and there is a question about the parliamentary or unparliamentary nature of the language being used.
—Mr Speaker, let me make this point: the more noise they make, the less evidence they have got; the more points of order they take, the weaker their argument. The fact is that this whole thing has been a smokescreen for the imperilled position of the Leader of the Opposition. He has abundantly demonstrated by his conduct in this House over the last week that he is nothing but toxic shock for our political system and the sooner members opposite get rid of him the better.

Mr Abbott interjecting—
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Leader of the House clearly just used an unparliamentary remark and it ought to be withdrawn. Referring to another member of parliament using that terminology has to be unparliamentary. It ought to be withdrawn if it is going to become part—
—If the Manager of Opposition Business found those words offensive, I will call on the Leader of the House to withdraw them.
—Mr Speaker, I know how sensitive she is and I am happy to withdraw out of respect for you and her.

"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2004-12-09,"—I present a schedule of outstanding government responses to reports of House of Representatives and joint committees, incorporating reports tabled and details of government responses made in the period between 23 June 2004, the date of the last schedule, and 9 December 2004. Copies of the schedule are being made available to honourable members and it will be incorporated in Hansard.
The schedule read as follows—
THE SPEAKER’S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO REPORTS OF HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND JOINT COMMITTEES
(also incorporating reports tabled and details of Government responses made in the period between 23 June 2004, the date of the last schedule, and 9 December 2004) 9 December 2004
THE SPEAKER’S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO COMMITTEE REPORTS
On 9 December 2004, the Government presented its response to a schedule of outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports tabled in the House of Representatives on 24 June 2004.
It is Government policy to respond to parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. In 1978 the Fraser Government implemented a policy of responding in the House by ministerial statement within six months of the tabling of a committee report. In 1983, the Hawke Government reduced this response time to three months but continued the practice of responding by ministerial statement. The Keating Government generally responded by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. In 1996, the Howard Government affirmed the commitment to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of their presentation. The Government also undertook to clear, as soon as possible, the backlog of reports arising from previous Parliaments.
The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 24 June 2004. It also lists reports for which the House has received no government response. A schedule of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.
The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government’s response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, the House of Representatives Committee of Members’ Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are not included.
Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. However, responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within 6 months of tabling a report. The committee monitors the provision of such responses. The schedule includes reports with policy recommendations.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—I ask leave of the House to make a ministerial statement relating to the report of the inquiry by the Hon. David Hunt, royal commissioner, into the Centenary House lease.
Leave granted.
—The document I am tabling today provides a compelling picture of a disgraceful financial arrangement between the Australian Labor Party and a Commonwealth government agency. It is an arrangement entered into while the Australian Labor Party was in office, charged with providing good government and looking after the interests of taxpayers.
In 1992 the Australian Property Group (APG), on behalf of the Commonwealth, entered into a lease with John Curtin House Ltd to accommodate the Audit Office in Centenary House. As we know, John Curtin House Ltd is a Labor Party company.
The agreement comprises:
A 15-year lease with an option of a further five years;
A starting rent based on a much higher position 15 months before any agreement was reached, and then escalating that figure by more than 10 per cent per year until the building was completed; and
An escalation clause so that the rent rose by nine per cent every year for the duration of the 15-year term of the lease.
After considerable pressure, the Keating government established an inquiry in 1994. However, the findings of the 1994 inquiry did not end the disquiet.
Earlier this year the Senate passed a motion calling on the government to instigate a review of the findings of the 1994 inquiry in the light of later evidence. Former Justice David Hunt was commissioned to inquire into the Centenary House lease. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Hunt and his team for the hard work they put into this inquiry.
I table a document that outlines the differences between the findings of the 1994 inquiry and the 2004 inquiry.
Are the terms of the lease reasonable?
Unlike the 1994 inquiry, Commissioner Hunt found that the terms of the lease were neither reasonable nor prudent from the Commonwealth’s perspective but “exceptionally beneficial” for the Labor Party.
The inquiry found that the rent paid was well above market:
“the rent it [the Commonwealth] has paid for the Audit Office space in Centenary House has always been well over market and will probably remain so.”
When the lease commenced in September 1993, the fair market rate for office space in Centenary House was $290 per square metre a year. But the actual starting rent paid by the Commonwealth was $367.95 per square metre a year.
By September 2004 the Commonwealth was locked into paying over three times the fair market rent for its office space in Centenary House.
I table a graph based on valuation evidence presented to this inquiry which shows the stark difference between the fair market value of the lease at Centenary House and what the Commonwealth actually pays.
Commissioner Hunt also found a number of the terms of the lease are unprecedented, particularly the way the starting rent was calculated and the fixed nine per cent per annum escalator over 15 years. Indeed because of the rent escalation, Commissioner Hunt found that the lease amounts to a “high risk futures contract”.
The commissioner also found that the lease as a whole is not supported by reference to any other transaction occurring in the market at the time.
The commissioner found at the end of the lease the ALP will emerge with a building fully, or almost fully, paid for by the taxpayer. For the ALP it will have been constructed at no financial risk and having had the benefits of a regular and significant surplus cash flow throughout the term.
In simple terms, the inquiry found that the lease represented a huge windfall to the ALP at the expense of the Commonwealth:
“The result was very unsatisfactory for the Commonwealth and exceptionally beneficial for John Curtin House Ltd.”
Commissioner Hunt points out, given the levels of rent to be paid under the lease, the Commonwealth should have been able to acquire the building for a nominal consideration at the end of the lease—since the Commonwealth has effectively paid for the building.
It found that there “had been no negotiation of the terms of the lease in the commonly understood sense”.
The commissioner made adverse findings against former Commonwealth officers in a number of agencies.
Dominic Collins, the Commonwealth officer responsible for negotiating the lease, was thoroughly out of his depth and overwhelmed by the negotiators acting for the ALP. Mr Collins never understood the strength of the Commonwealth’s position or, if he did, he failed to take advantage of it.
The inquiry found that the lease was not negotiated with commonsense in mind:
“Notwithstanding the firmly expressed and strongly pursued wish of the Auditor-General, Mr John Taylor, to be accommodated in the Parliamentary Triangle, it was not essential for the Audit Office to be housed there. Other accommodation was available elsewhere in Canberra where the market was lower than in Barton. Nor were the needs or wishes of any other Commonwealth agency at that time so great as to require the abandonment of ordinary principles of commonsense in the negotiations for the Centenary House lease.”
Commissioner Hunt found that systemic administrative failures in the Audit Office and the Australian Property Group such as failure to investigate the terms of the lease, a lack of candour between Commonwealth officers and lack of understanding of arrangements for funding property expenses also contributed to the extraordinary lease.
The inquiry found that the Department of Finance, at that time, failed in its obligations to maintain budgetary integrity:
“Budgetary integrity is not protected or maintained if agencies can, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into commitments they cannot afford.”
Although the commission found that no criticism should be levelled at the conduct of the ALP and John Curtin House, or that there was any evidence of corruption, the fact nonetheless remains that this lease—so very disadvantageous to the Commonwealth and extraordinarily generous to the ALP—was negotiated under the authority of the Keating Labor government.
Responsibility for all this maladministration firmly rests with the government at that time and a succession of Labor ministers who would appear, at best, to have been asleep at the wheel. Their inability to manage a government department says volumes about their ability to manage an entire economy.

Improper fee offered to Commonwealth

At some stage during the course of dealings between Labor’s representatives Lend Lease and the APG, a so-called ‘fee’ of $50,000 was offered to the APG. The 1994 inquiry found that, whilst the offer should not have been made, the person making the offer, Ms Penny Morris of Lend Lease—a former official of the Australian Property Group—did not perceive the impropriety of making the offer.
However, the further examination of witnesses and documents by this inquiry allowed Commissioner Hunt to conclude that not only was the offer improper but as a former Commonwealth official Penny Morris knew of its impropriety.

Labor’s view

This inquiry found the rent for the Centenary House was way over market.
The inquiry found the negotiating process was badly lacking.
Despite these findings, remarkably, the Labor Party submitted to the inquiry that:
“a new high quality building for the Commonwealth to occupy could not be obtained at that time on any terms more favourable to the Commonwealth than those upon which JCH built Centenary House.”
The inquiry found that unlike other political parties, Labor regularly leased its premises to the Commonwealth:
“Only the Labor Party has leased commercial office space to the Commonwealth with any regularity and frequency. It has done so systematically in John Curtin House since 1975 and in Centenary House since 1993.”
It is clear the ALP did know precisely what was happening. In 1992 former Liberal senator Warwick Parer warned the Labor Party, before it had signed the lease, that the deal was unsound.
The inquiry also found that the Labor Party’s national executive was informed:
“The National Executive was aware at all times of the essential ingredients of the lease transaction.”
Perhaps it is worth inquiring as to who was on the ALP national executive at this time, but I think that is something the inquiry has left for others.
We now ask why would the ALP—which was in government at that time—agree to something so unsatisfactory to the taxpayer?
Commissioner Hunt notes that, following the 1990 federal election, the Australian Labor Party found itself with a substantial debt of $4 million. The ALP took the view that it was important to find some way of placing itself on a more secure financial footing for the future.
This then set the parameters for any leasing arrangement of the proposed Centenary House—the building would be self-funded and would generate a cash surplus every year.
Labor wanted the “‘provision of a long term income generating asset which will assist the ALP to become self-sufficient with respect to campaign and administrative funding’ and ‘minimisation of costs and risks and fixing of variable parameters’, including interest rates and rent escalation.”
So, rather than the terms of the Centenary House lease being negotiated they were decided in advance by representatives of the ALP based on what was necessary to present a risk-free investment.
Why did this inquiry reach different conclusions to the 1994 inquiry?
It is important to be aware of the resources available to this inquiry and the way in which it was conducted because it provides an interesting comparison with the previous inquiry set up by the ALP.
The 2004 inquiry was conducted pursuant to the Royal Commissions Act 1902. The commission was provided with appropriate administrative and legal support, including senior and junior counsel assisting and a team of experienced solicitors.
By comparison, the 1994 inquiry was conducted informally and was largely guided by submissions filed by the parties and the documents they voluntarily provided.
In particular the 2004 inquiry found the parties to the 1994 inquiry generally provided a unified front, apart from the two Liberal Party parliamentarians who appeared unrepresented.
The use of a more adversarial procedure in this inquiry in order to test the common front presented by the parties in 1994, produced a much more detailed picture of the negotiations.
It demonstrated that the impression of a market-determined transaction was incorrect and misleading.
It is understandable that, with the limited resources obtained, and the absence of counsel assisting, it would have been difficult for the 1994 inquiry to obtain or manage the volume of documentation obtained by this inquiry.
It is also clear that counsel assisting this inquiry engaged in a much more thorough, critical and sceptical examination of witnesses than it would have been reasonably possible for the 1994 inquiry to have achieved with only the help of an administrative assistant.
Any government seriously wanting to inquire into these matters would have insisted on a better resourced, more rigorous approach. If the Keating government had properly established the 1994 inquiry and insisted on counsel assisting then it may—and I emphasise that—have uncovered the truth.

Conclusion

I have instructed my department to examine whether any action should be taken against any individuals who are the subject of an adverse finding in the royal commission report, particularly the finding of impropriety of the offer of a $50,000 payment.
This inquiry has demonstrated that as a result of the maladministration of Commonwealth funds and resources by the Labor Party in government, Australian taxpayers propped up the Labor Party’s discredited property deal. Ministers at the time did not act in the public interest and they failed in their duty to protect taxpayers.
The inquiry has found that at a fair market rate the Commonwealth would have paid $25.66 million over the course of the 15-year lease.
Instead the Commonwealth will have paid more than $68 million by the time the lease expires.
This means that taxpayers will have overpaid in excess of $42 million by 2007 to help finance Labor’s property deal and their election campaigns.
This inquiry has shown that this whole lease is inappropriate and improper.
John Curtin House, the Australian Labor Party and Mark Latham, at the very least, have a moral duty to immediately agree to a renegotiation of the lease on terms that are fairer to the Australian taxpayer.
I table the ministerial statement and I present a copy of the report of the inquiry by the Hon. David Hunt, Royal Commissioner, into Centenary House.

Leave granted.
—I move:

Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Centenary House Lease</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,39,1

—A $2 million fizzer.
—this would have to rate right up there.

Mr Randall interjecting—
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The member for Canning is warned!
—For the benefit of all the members of the House who are here, who I am confident have not seen or read the report, because the Attorney was very concerned about its release prior to making this statement—

Mr Randall interjecting—
—The member for Canning will remove himself under 94(a).
—that they will be embarrassed that the commission’s report gives a clean bill of health to the Labor Party and to John Curtin House and finds no impropriety at all, in a document which is 250 pages long. Members will be interested to know what the Attorney, the first law officer of this country, said in here as he finished his speech. He said that the Labor Party, Mark Latham and everybody else on this side of the House has a moral duty to renegotiate the lease.
—It is a moral duty.
—The first law officer of this country knows that the royal commission report says, contrary to his urgings, that they would be legally unable to renegotiate this lease.

Mr Ruddock interjecting—
—Order! The member for Gellibrand has the call.
—I will take the time in speaking on this debate to look at the royal commissioner’s report. I am interested in the Attorney’s interjections, because he believes there is a moral duty that can be performed, even if it is contrary to the laws of this country—which is an interesting position for him to take—and even if it is contrary to the findings of the royal commission. So I am going to take the time to go through this. What is the reality? I know it is painfully clear that the government is aware of this, as well as the Attorney, because they have waited until 4 o’clock on the last sitting day of the parliament, when everyone is packing up and ready to go home, to get this report out. As they know, there is no interest in it, there is no value for them, because the findings that they set out to have this commission make have not been made. They know that after spending $4 million plus of government money, of taxpayers’ money, all it has shown is that, according to the words of the royal commission, no criticism can be levelled at the ALP or John Curtin House.
It is no wonder to us that they have sought to bury this report in the way that they have. I feel for the Attorney because he put on a brave face when he considered the report of the royal commission today, but it is very clear that there is nothing in this report that provides any foundation for the allegations that were made day in, day out by the Minister for Health and Ageing and others here. It has been a shocking waste of public money and it has been one of the coalition’s greatest obsessions. It actually seems to us that advancement in the Liberal Party depended on a quite unhealthy interest in Centenary House. In the early nineties we know it was the member for Mackellar’s greatest obsession, and she is even here today to make sure that she continues that. It obviously did not work, in her situation, to provide the advancement that she might have thought, but it was nevertheless her great obsession. Then it was Senator Campbell’s obsession; most recently it has been Senator Brandis’s obsession. Of course in this place we have all been treated to lectures day in and day out about Centenary House from the Minister for Health and Ageing. But now, not for the first time but for the second time, Labor has been cleared of any impropriety.
Let us not forget that this is the second royal commission into Centenary House. In fact, two of the last five royal commissions ordered by the Commonwealth have been into Centenary House. You would think that, of all of the pressing issues that there might be in running the country—social issues and problems that might be investigated, the history of a whole range of other matters, and a number of our concerns we could list that have never been subject to a royal commission—the government might have found some other things to spend this money on, but not them. It is a measure, I think, of their arrogance that they would waste this money on a wholly political exercise.
Let us look as some of the royal commission findings, because I think that members, particularly on the other side of the House, will be enlightened that the Attorney decided to leave a few of these out of his statement to the House, so much so that I am not sure that he actually read the same copy of the royal commission’s report that I did. There is an entire chapter in the report which is entitled ‘Whether John Curtin House Ltd or the Australian Labor Party should be criticised’. I will read, for the benefit of the House, a number of quotes from the commissioner’s report:
… it is appropriate that I do state that no … criticism should be levelled at the conduct of John Curtin House Ltd or the Australian Labor Party.
I think even members on the other side of the House would be able to understand what that means. The Attorney himself includes that in his ministerial statement. But still the Attorney can come in here and suggest somehow that there is something that is improper, even though this is the second time that the Labor Party and John Curtin House have been cleared. I am sure the minister for health will try to also do this. The royal commission also found:
The lease was negotiated on behalf of John Curtin House Ltd by representatives of Lend Lease and at arm’s-length.

Mr Ruddock interjecting—
—Further, it found:
No conduct on the part of John Curtin House Ltd was unconscionable or constituted undue influence, unfair pressure or unfair tactics such as might in another context amount to conduct warranting statutory or equitable relief.
Again, the first law officer of the Commonwealth is sitting here, yelling interjections across the table, knowing full well that the royal commission made this finding which said that there was no conduct which constituted any of those matters which might amount to conduct warranting statutory or equitable relief. It also found that the ALP was absolutely scrupulous in ensuring that the highest standards of propriety were observed. As I said, there was an entire chapter devoted to this. If members in this House are truly interested in the matter, may I recommend that they read chapter 15, which makes clear what the position and the findings of the royal commission are in relation to the Labor Party and John Curtin House. As for the government’s contention that there was some sort of sweetheart deal made, the royal commission found this:
There was no evidence before this Inquiry or the 1994 Inquiry that any Labor politician or executive exercised any undue or improper pressure, tactics or influence over any public servant who had involvement with the transaction.
That is pretty clear, even for members on the other side of the House. The commissioner went on:
Nor is there any solid foundation in the evidence to justify a finding that any of those public servants acted in an inappropriate fashion calculated to please his or her political masters ...
The report is absolutely unequivocal about this. The report shows there was no suggestion of corruption, fraud or political impropriety on the part of any person involved in the Centenary House lease. It shows that no misleading statements were made in the negotiations which led to the execution of the lease. The idea that the Keating government had some hand in forcing the Audit Office to enter into this lease has been proven, once and for all, to be an absolute furphy. Nothing could be clearer than that.
But the report goes even further. Observers of this parliament would be aware that the whole driving force for the establishment of the royal commission—and we remember it only too well on this side of the House, because the minister for health was like a broken record raising this matter, day in, day out in the House—was a suggestion that the Commonwealth, the landlord, was unable to renegotiate the rent for the Audit Office. What did the royal commission find on this point? This point is central to the whole debate and makes a mockery of the Attorney’s ministerial statement. The royal commission found on this point that no renegotiation was possible. Let me quote once again from the report. Minister Abbott, who I know will be following me in this debate, may wish to take careful note of these findings, because I know it is an area that he has a particular interest in. The report says:
When the Audit Office attempted on a number of occasions to renegotiate or vary the terms of the lease, the directors of John Curtin House Ltd stated that the company was unable to reduce the rent payable under the lease because of its obligations under its contracts with the project’s financiers and the directors would be in breach of their own fiduciary duties to the company to do so.
This is an important quote for members of the House to be aware of. It goes on:
The directors sought and obtained legal and financial advice about their own position and that of the company. The contracts with the financiers of the Centenary House project prevented the company from varying the terms of the lease in such a way as to reduce the rent.
The government cannot come in here and say time and time again, as they choose to, ‘The rent should be renegotiated; the lease should be renegotiated—there is a moral obligation for it to be renegotiated,’ when they know that the company that could renegotiate, in their terms, is legally prevented from doing so. The commissioner has so found. This puts an end to that argument once and for all.
Day in, day out Minister Abbott came into this place to demand that the ALP renegotiate the rent. The royal commission, as I have said, has found what the directors of John Curtin House Ltd were saying all along: such a renegotiation was not possible. I note that the Attorney is now suggesting across the table that it is only a contractual arrangement—which I seem to remember the Treasurer being asked a question about during question time earlier this week or maybe last week. There was a question of payments about to be made to the outgoing head of Telstra, Mr Ziggy Switkowski. It is interesting because Mr Costello, the Treasurer and a colleague of the ministers who are here at the table, Minister Ruddock and Minister Abbott, made very clear that the government thought that the payments to Mr Switkowski were entirely appropriate because the company had indicated that they would honour the contract. The Treasurer said:
... as the majority shareholder in the company, we believe that the contract should be honoured. That is the way in which corporations operate. When they enter into contracts, reputable corporations tend to keep them. We would say that this is a reputable company and that it is obliged to keep its contracts.
What we have instead is the Attorney saying that he does not think it matters if the Labor Party, John Curtin House or anyone else involved throws out of the window their contractual arrangement. His ministerial colleague answers a question in this House, saying, ‘On our side of the House we think you must abide by a contract because that is a legal obligation, and we’re all nice fellows on this side who make sure we keep to our word and keep to the documents we have signed.’ But, astoundingly, the Attorney is the one person who thinks that, if you sign a contract, you should not stick to it.
—You could renegotiate it.
—The commissioner does not think there is any reason to. In fact, he says that the assertions that have always been made by John Curtin House were right, that they could not renegotiate, because of the terms of their lease, and that the other party to the contract would not—

Mr Ruddock interjecting—
—It is interesting—and I am disappointed I have to go back to Contracts 101 for the Attorney and point out that you need more than one party to a contract and that the other party might have to consent to a change—because the findings actually make clear that the other parties to the contract, the banks or the financiers, would not have consented to such a change. So it is quite wrong and quite ridiculous for the government to come in, time and time again, with the normal conduct of the Attorney, which is just to assert that something can be done, the same way he asserts a number of other legal things—from the way evidence obtained by torture can be used, to all sorts of other legal obligations—and just assumes that no-one will bother to find out if he is telling the truth.
In this instance, I will put my money on the findings that the royal commissioner has made. We spent $4 million of taxpayers’ money to get his view. His view is not consistent with the Attorney-General’s. I have to say that on this side of the House and—I am pretty willing to punt—in the rest of the community the findings of the commissioner will be believed ahead of the views of the Attorney-General or the Minister for Health and Ageing.
The whole basis for this inquiry—the alleged unreasonableness of the directors of John Curtin House in refusing to renegotiate the lease—has been completely demolished and put finally to rest by this second royal commission, even though it was set up in the most political of contexts. People will remember that it was established in the lead-up to the federal election in a clear attempt to discredit the Labor Party and to distract it from fighting the election campaign. Members of this House will also remember that it was initially timed to report on 15 October, the day before many people believed and expected that the federal election would be called. This second royal commission has trodden over ground that is now 15 years old. It conducted 37 days of public hearings, examined more than 80,000 pages of documents and issued 75 compulsory notices to produce. Despite all this, there is nothing that reflects adversely on the Labor Party. The royal commission has been an expensive embarrassment for the government. They have thrown away nearly $4 million of taxpayers’ money in pursuit of one of their own political obsessions. They are the ones who owe an apology to the Australian public.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Centenary House Lease</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,39,1
"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—Earlier today, we had members opposite frothing and foaming about $222,000 worth of public money which, they say, has been improperly spent. What we have today is the report of a royal commission which has demonstrated that $42 million was wrongly paid to the Australian Labor Party. It is true that the royal commission did not make adverse findings against the Labor Party, but it did make adverse findings against the Labor government. This is the most spectacular piece of maladministration in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia and the beneficiary has been the Australian Labor Party.
I used to talk about the ‘lease fleece’ and the ‘rent rort rip-off’. ‘A mere $36 million,’ I used to say. I am prepared to say that I misled the parliament and I am sorry. We now have the royal commission’s report—it is $42 million that has been ripped off the Australian public by members opposite. This is the mother of all rorts, orchestrated by the Labor government for the Australian Labor Party. They knew from the beginning that this whole thing was a set-up. This whole thing was a set-up from the start. Let me quote from the royal commission’s report:
The main thrust of this project—
the commission was quoting an internal Labor Party document—
is to provide long term financial support to the ALP.
Within this general criteria ... the proposals, when they are finalised, will be reviewed in detail with a view to maximising cash flow and tax benefits ...
There it is: the Australian Labor Party out there on a tax scam—as well as a scam to rip off the taxpayer—and minimising its costs and risks. The Labor Party were in tremendous financial trouble. So what did they do? They went into business—funny business. Not business with the private sector, because they knew no private sector businessman would be stupid enough to enter into this deal. They could not be sure of the private sector, but they could be sure that their own government would enter into a deal of such monumental incompetence and stupidity.
Let me quote the report of the royal commission and detail all of the Australian government agencies and instrumentalities which acted incompetently, on Labor’s watch, to benefit the Australian Labor Party:
... the Australian Property Group and the Australian National Audit Office failed to fulfil their duties competently ...
... the Australian Valuation Office failed to provide appropriate advice ...
The Department of Finance did not fulfil the role it was required to perform ...
Here is a succession of government officers and agencies all performing incompetently under a Labor government to benefit the Australian Labor Party. Do you smell a rat? I think the Australian public does. The rats were the people in the Australian Labor Party who nudged and winked their way to this outrageous $42 million rip-off of the Australian public.
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the minister is going to be relevant to this debate, perhaps he could refer us to the page number in the report where there is such a finding, because there is none.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—There is no point of order.
—Let me satisfy the member for Gellibrand by quoting the report. Let me point out to the member for Gellibrand that the royal commission found that this was a monumentally inept deal. It was the mother of all rorts. It should never have been entered into. The report says on page 156:
The National Executive—
of the Australian Labor Party—
was aware at all times of the essential ingredients of the lease transaction.
The royal commissioner finds there was a rort. He finds that it should never have been done. He finds that the national executive of the Australian Labor Party was aware at all times of the essential ingredients of the lease transaction.
For the benefit of the shrieker opposite, let me just point out who was on that national executive of the Australian Labor Party which knew at all times the essential ingredients of the lease transaction. There was the member for Brand—the shadow leader, the leader-in-waiting—yet again. There was Senator John Faulkner, known to Senator Conroy as Frankenstein. There was Senator Robert Ray. There was the member for Brisbane. There was Senator Peter Cook. There was Senator George Campbell. There was Senator Mark Bishop. There was Senator Chris Evans. There was Senator Sue Mackay. They were all members of the national executive of the Australian Labor Party, which was at all times aware of the essential ingredients of the lease transaction—a lease transaction which should never have been entered into. It was the most incompetent deal in the history of the Commonwealth. They are the guilty party. These are the guilty men. They are guilty in government. As members of the national executive of the Australian Labor Party, they are guilty of knowing about the deal and not doing anything to prevent it.
They were warned. It is not just wisdom after the event that the government now has. Before this deal was ever entered into, members opposite were warned by Senator Warwick Parer, an opposition senator. They were warned back in 1992 of precisely what this problem would be. On 15 January 1992, Senator Warwick Parer issued a press release which said this:
Now that this appalling rort is exposed ...
He knew that before the deal was even signed. If he knew that, why didn’t the member for Brand and all these other geniuses know about it? The press release went on:
Now that this appalling rort is exposed, the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus, must publicly advise the Australian Property Group to cease all further negotiations with the Australian Labor Party.
Senator Parer was absolutely right then. The royal commission is absolutely right, and it has found that this is the most incompetent deal in the history of the Commonwealth. And they are still benefiting from it and they are still defending it even this day.
We heard the member for Gellibrand say, ‘It is the law.’ Not even a partner in Slater and Gordon would fall for this one. But the member for Gellibrand comes into this House and says: ‘The law stops us from renegotiating this contract. The law makes us rip off the taxpayer. We are compelled by law to steal $42 million from the people of Australia.’ It is not the law; it is the contract. Mr Speaker, you may not be able to change the law but, by jeez, you can change the contract. Contracts get renegotiated every day, every minute and every hour. If there was a shred of decency about members opposite, they would be slinking out of this chamber today, going to their mortgage holders and saying, ‘We have got to renegotiate this mortgage.’ They may not be able to renegotiate the lease under the terms of the mortgage but they can sure renegotiate the mortgage. Go and talk to the bank. Come on, they are not that unreasonable. They do not want you to be embarrassed. They certainly do not want you to be ripping off the Australian taxpayer to the tune of $42 million a year. Ask them for a renegotiation and I think you will find them very cooperative indeed.
There is a challenge here, a fundamental challenge of ethics and morality. It is a challenge faced by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is the ultimate beneficiary of the $42 million now found to have been ripped off from the taxpayer by the Labor Party through this deal. We know he does not like Bob Hogg very much. We know Bob Hogg does not like him very much. Why doesn’t he say, ‘One in the eye for Bob Hogg,’ and repudiate Bob Hogg’s deal. Senator Parer and former Senator Bishop, now the member for Mackellar, are the real heroes of this story. They have consistently campaigned to expose this rip-off. There is one chapter left, and that is for the Leader of the Opposition to give back the money. (Time expired)

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—Of course, we are approaching Christmas and, around Australia at Christmas time, families have certain traditions. Some always put up the Christmas tree on the same date; some always bake the Christmas cake on the same date. Today we are seeing the birth of another important Christmas tradition, and that is the last-sitting-day Minister Abbott fiasco. That is the new Christmas tradition in Australia. Let us remember the last sitting day we were here last year before we went on our Christmas break when Minister Abbott gave a stupid and disgraceful speech which then caused him to be repudiated by the Prime Minister. The first instalment of the Minister Abbott last-sitting-day fiasco was last year when he gave a speech which then led to headlines like these: ‘PM chides Abbott over low blow’, ‘PM bags Abbott’, ‘PM tells Abbott to drop personal jibes’, ‘Abbott told to mind his tongue’ and my personal favourite, ‘Howard tries to break a nasty Abbott’.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The debate concerns the taking note of the paper, which is the report, not a dissertation on what occurred 12 months previously.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—I have the substance of the point of order. The debate has been fairly free and wide ranging. I call the member for Lalor.
—We are now on the second instalment of the tradition of the last-sitting-day fiasco courtesy of Minister Abbott. It is kind of cute that this is the week in which The West Wing came back on Australian TV. Of course, in The West Wing the media advisers all hunker around late on a Friday afternoon. They talk about ‘putting out the trash’. Putting out the trash means late on Friday night they are going to slip out the stories that are so embarrassing for the government that they do not want any coverage of them.
Here we have, in this parliament today, the Australian equivalent of putting out the trash, because so embarrassing is this for the government that they have squeezed it in between a ministerial scandal and Christmas valedictories in the desperate hope that nobody notices. Why is the government so embarrassed? Mr Abbott’s last-sitting-day fiasco is really about this government wasting $4 million of taxpayers’ funds in a completely unnecessary royal commission. It is a first: a royal commission into a royal commission. And this government, for a political stunt, thought it was worth spending $4 million of taxpayers’ money.
This government wasted $71.32 per minute on this inquiry. Australian taxpayers contributed $4 million to this government’s political stunt—a royal commission into a royal commission. It cost $71.32 per minute of the inquiry. All of that money was wasted. They wasted $4 million to find what? Absolutely nothing. The government are putting out the trash today because they are embarrassed that they wasted that $4 million and found absolutely nothing. That is why we are back here with another end-of-sitting-day fiasco courtesy of Minister Abbott.
He must be a deeply embarrassed and sorrowful man today. Consequently, we saw his overacting at the dispatch box to hide his true disappointment. This has been a curious, odd, mad obsession writ large that started in 1994. He proudly announced that the first question he ever asked in this House was about Centenary House. It has been a decade-long obsession starting from the first day he was able to ask questions in this House. We all remember the performances that he used to put on at the end of question time. We used to refer to them as the ‘kicker’ because you would know that question time was about to be brought to an end when Minister Abbott got to his feet. This obsession was so absurd. I have just had a quick look at the statistics and let me tell you that Minister Abbott took 24 questions on Centenary House. Indeed, other government members and senators referred to Centenary House 68 times in questions without notice. This is truly amazing. It is a government out of an agenda and not knowing what to do next. There were 142 speeches made on the matter by government members.
Minister Abbott is in the depths of a decade-old mad obsession that has taken him absolutely nowhere. During the course of this decade-old mad obsession that has taken him absolutely nowhere, Minister Abbott used terminology against the Leader of the Opposition and others like ‘fraud’, ‘fake’ and ‘Tammany-Hall thug’. Today we have seen that bile choking Minister Abbott’s throat because, at the end of his decade-long obsession, having wasted $4 million of taxpayers’ money, he has found absolutely nothing. The Liberal Party stand exposed as having hijacked taxpayers’ funds for their own cheap political stunt. Here they are today, embarrassed and wounded, putting out the trash between a ministerial scandal and valedictories and hoping that no-one notices. Their mad obsession has been brought to an end as a spectacular failure for everybody involved in it.
I think it is a pity that the Attorney-General, as the first law officer, involved himself in this mess. It is one thing for the Leader of the House—who we all know is capable of these acts of obsession, who spent two weeks being hapless and helpless and who almost accidentally destroyed a speaker along way—to be involved in stunts and cheap political tricks like this; it is quite another matter for the chief law officer of the country to stoop so low. I say to the Attorney-General that he ought not to have done so.
Let us be absolutely clear about what this royal commission found—and you need to draw the distinction between what Mr Abbott ranted about and what he actually quoted. The only thing he quoted as a conclusion of the royal commission was that the royal commission used the word ‘inept’. If we were going to have that kind of moral outrage and ranting and raving about ineptness, we would see it in here about the Howard government every day. If there is going to be this kind of obligation put on ineptness, what has the Howard government got to say about accidentally mislaying $8.1 billion of Defence assets? I have not heard an explanation about that. If we want to talk about ineptness, I think mislaying $8 billion worth of stuff might be up there with ineptness. But, of course, we did not see any Howard government ministers’ heads rolling. We did not see any Howard government minister out there saying, ‘There is a moral obligation on the Howard government to resolve the matter of this ineptness—the $8.1 billion of stuff that we have accidentally lost.’ Of course they did not do that. The only thing that the minister could quote was the word ‘inept’, and inept is not a foundation at all for the rest of the speech that he gave in here. All the rest of that speech was flim-flam to try and hide his embarrassment that the bile that he used to spout about this matter is now scalding his throat as it sits there.
As we are about to embark on Christmas holidays—a very important event in the Christian calendar, with the birth of our Lord being celebrated around the world—I say that the Minister for Health and Ageing as well as others in the House might well remember that biblical injunction to not go looking for a speck in your brother’s eye and ignore the log in your own. I remind members of this House of that biblical injunction. Today this government effectively said, ‘The ministerial code of conduct does not matter. Rip that up. There is no code. You can do anything you like. It does not matter.’ The Prime Minister can get up at the dispatch box and say, ‘Yes, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs breached the code, but code shmode. Who cares? There are no obligations. There are no rules. There are no responsibilities. Nothing happens if you do anything wrong.’
—Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The debate is about taking notice of the report handed down by the Attorney-General. The member is straying far from the debate in talking about matters in question time today. I ask you to bring her back to the substance of the debate.
—I am sure the Manager of Opposition Business will come back to the debate.
—I am just asking people to take note of the absurd double standards of the Howard government, which says, ‘A breach of the ministerial code does not matter. Regional rorts do not matter. Pork does not matter. That is okay.’ (Time expired)

"Bird, Sharon, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I rise today to take the opportunity to congratulate a group of students in my electorate who will be competing against students from around the world in an international competition. Normally, one would think that students in my electorate involved in an international academic competition would be students from the University of Wollongong—a world-class institution—but that is not the case on this occasion. This time the competitors are year 6 students from the Illawarra Grammar School. Lauren Aitcheson, Nisha Fernandez, Quynh-Dan Nguyen and Naomi Wootton make up the Illawarra Grammar School’s junior team which recently won the national finals of the Macquarie Bank Future Problem Solving Program.
The Future Problem Solving Program is aimed at the development of critical, creative and futuristic thinking skills. I understand the program has been operating in Australia since the early 1990s and more than 5,000 students from across the country have participated. In the national finals in Melbourne, 13 junior teams, 29 middle teams and 17 senior teams competed. In this competition students are presented with a scenario and are given two hours to brainstorm 16 potential problems with that scenario, from which they select one problem to create an action plan on how to solve it. It would be nice if we could all pick the problems we want to solve, but it is a good learning experience for the students. They then have three hours to write and perform a three-minute skit to present the problem and how they would solve it. To add to the difficulty of the task, they are required to include given phrases and mystery props. It encourages the students to think outside the box on challenging and difficult issues and is an excellent competition. It teaches the value of time management, team work, critical thinking and decision making—skills that will no doubt be important to them in their future endeavours.
During this year’s program the team has grappled with issues such as smart clothes, bullying, artificial intelligence and the influence and impact of the media. In the international competition their scenario will be based around the topic of business crime. This year’s junior team is not the only team of skilled problem solvers from the Illawarra Grammar School. It had nine other teams in the national finals in Melbourne, four of which won places. In fact the Illawarra Grammar School is no stranger to success in competition on the international stage. However, the girls heading off to compete at the University of Kentucky next year are the first junior team from the school to compete at an international level. I wish to take the opportunity today to extend my best wishes to the team and to their dedicated coach, Ms Jan Hales, as they prepare for the competition. I am sure their hours of preparation will pay off and I wish them all the best in this international competition. I know they will do our area very proud on the world stage.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Cunningham Electorate: Illawarra Grammar School’s Future Problem Solving Team</title>,MISCELLANEOUS,53,1
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—Out of respect for you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will resist the temptation to respond to the member for Hinkler.
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—The standing orders require that you speak to the bill.
—I simply make the point that the Labor Party’s problem with these regional projects is not the projects but, of course, the process, and he knows that only too well.
I rise to speak on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2004. This omnibus bill simplifies and brings into alignment the financial management provisions of a number of Commonwealth acts associated with accrual accounting and generally updates the financial frameworks arrangements. These amendments will align the financial management provisions of 85 acts with the provisions of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, which was amended by the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999.
The amendments to the FMA Act were part of the adoption by the Commonwealth of the accrual budgeting and reporting framework on 1 July 1999. These amendments add to the information requirements for a determination made by the Minister for Finance and Administration that establishes a special account under section 20 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act. The amendments also transfer from the Treasurer to the finance minister powers and functions under 25 acts to approve investments, money raising and guarantees for specific entities that are legally separate from the Commonwealth, and to provide the finance minister with the power to delegate these powers and functions. The bill also updates, clarifies and aligns other financial management and reporting provisions.
Despite the merits of the proposed amendments, it has taken the government over five years to act on any inefficiencies of government departments and entities. The Department of Finance and Administration, which is responsible for developing and maintaining the financial framework of the Commonwealth public sector in terms of accountability and transparency, has been recently examined in an Australian National Audit Office report. This report assessed departmental financial management and reporting against that established by the Department of Finance and Administration. The Auditor-General’s report No. 15, Financial management of special appropriations, was scathing in its findings. The report clearly highlighted that the Department of Finance and Administration’s financial management framework has not been followed. This reflects the lack of transparency in the public accounts reported to the parliament. This, of course, raises the question: why did the government allow this financial incompetence and mismanagement to continue for over five years? And, more importantly, what responsibility does the Prime Minister take for this financial incompetence?
In trying to seek answers to these questions, it is important to note some of the Auditor-General’s criticisms, including (1) drawings by five departments/entities relying on incorrect appropriations from 1998-99 to 2002-03 totalling some $393 million; (2) spending by one department against legislation that had not been passed by parliament between 2001 and 2003, in this instance totalling some $7.26 billion; (3) spending by two entities that was not approved by the parliament totalling $23 million, $6.96 million of which was in breach of section 83 of the Constitution; and (4) failure by two entities to disclose payments totalling some $13.1 billion.
I invite the parliamentary secretary, when she is summing up on this bill, to explain to the parliament why this financial mismanagement continued for so long. I challenge her to explain the situation to the House today. Why were the minister and the government asleep at the wheel? Let me give the parliamentary secretary an example: why did the Department of Veterans’ Affairs operate an illegal operating overdraft in 2002-03 in breach of its contract with its bank? Parliamentary Secretary, these are important issues, asked in the correct spirit—in the spirit of accountability in this parliament—and I invite you to respond.",REPS,<title>FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,54,1
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—in reply—I thank those who have spoken in the debate on this legislation. I particularly thank the member for Hunter for his contribution to the debate, although he seems to be a good reader of newspapers rather than a student of the bill itself. The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill 2004 is a comprehensive and detailed bill, and it proposes amendments to 112 acts and the repeal of 28 acts. The FFLA Bill, as I will refer to it, has been subject to external scrutiny. An exposure draft of the bill was considered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, culminating in the tabling of its report on 20 August 2003. The JCPAA was broadly supportive of the bill and recommended that it be introduced into parliament as soon as was feasible.
I would now like to turn to schedule 1 of the FFLA Bill. About three-quarters of the contents of the bill represent amendments of a housekeeping nature, in particular aligning financial management provisions in 85 acts with changes made to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, the FMA Act, on 1 July 1999. The changes made to the FMA Act were made by the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999 and were designed to facilitate the adoption of accrual budgeting from that date. The FMLA ACT 1999 abolished separate accounting funds, adopted the concept of a self-executing consolidated revenue fund and introduced the concept of special accounts to replace two of the accounting funds created in the FMA Act. These changes streamlined the financial framework with the best view of how the government’s finances are dealt with in a constitutional sense.
By bringing up to date the text of 85 acts and so replacing the deeming provisions of the FMLA Act 1999, the FFLA Bill will improve the understanding and operation of the financial framework of the Australian government, particularly in relation to special accounts established by acts. Schedule 1 of the FFLA Bill delivers on the commitment made by the previous Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration in his second reading of the FMLA Act 1999, which he made on 10 February that year. He stated that a consequential amendments bill would be introduced to ensure that terminology in other acts is consistent with the FMA Act as amended by the FMLA Act 1999.
The FFLA Bill also enhances a framework applying to special accounts established in determinations of the finance minister. It does this by specifying additional information to be included in a determination that establishes a special account. Parliament will benefit from this amendment because such determinations are disallowable by parliament over a period of five sitting days before they take effect.
In regard to schedule 2 of the FFLA Bill, most of the amendments proposed in schedule 2 provide for the transfer of powers from the Treasurer to the finance minister to approve investments, money raising and guarantees of certain bodies that are legally and financially separate from the Australian government. This type of amendment covers 25 acts, and most of the bodies affected are authorities subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The transfer of these approval powers will co-locate with the finance minister powers relating to the financial oversight of bodies that are mainly funded from the budget. This will provide for more efficient and effective decision making in relation to the resources available to these entities. A similar transfer of power is also included in relation to the High Court of Australia. The amendments in most of the acts also provide for the delegation of powers from the finance minister to an official defined in the FMA Act as a person who is an agency or is part of an agency. Providing delegation powers will facilitate efficient public administration.
The member for Hunter was concerned about the long gestation period of the FFLA Bill. Obviously, this bill is extraordinarily large and complex. It was subject to a JCPAA inquiry, and we required the agreement of all portfolio ministers. In particular, the deeming provisions in the FMLA Act 1999 change terminology in enabling acts.
We have an extraordinarily well-organised financial management structure and system in our country, one which has delivered to this country one of the longest periods of sustained economic growth. To suggest that Australia is anything other than an extraordinarily well-run country in terms of its financial management by the Australian government is a lot of nonsense.
Finally, I recommend that the House of Representatives agree to the FFLA Bill. When enacted, the bill will update, clarify and align a wide range of financial management provisions applying to a range of activities and entities, thereby continuing to enhance the financial management framework of the Australian government generally—which is, I might add, the envy of the developed world. I commend the bill to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to the debate on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004. When we talk about water efficiency and especially about the supply and use of fresh water, it is worth remembering a few important facts. Some 97.5 per cent of the world’s water is salt water and is unfit for human use. The majority of fresh water is beyond our reach, locked in polar snow and ice. Less than one per cent of fresh water is useable, amounting to only 0.01 per cent of the earth’s total water. This could be enough to support the world’s population three times over, but only if used with care.
Water, just like population, is not distributed evenly. Asia has the greatest annual availability of fresh water and, disturbingly, Australia has the lowest. Australia’s rainfall is the lowest of the continents, excluding Antarctica. This low rainfall, combined with very high evaporation, leads to low river flows. Despite this, Australia has one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world. While two-thirds of all the people on earth use less than 60 litres of water a day, the average Australian uses more than twice that amount during a single shower—something we should all think about in our personal lives.
Access to clean, safe water is fundamental to public health and our quality of life. Australians expect that, when we turn on our taps, the water that comes out will be clean and safe. That expectation is deeply ingrained in our way of life. We take it for granted, but many people in the world cannot. However, Australia’s growing population, combined with our drought-prone climate, means that we simply have to learn to do more with less. Indeed, we are likely to have droughts more frequently if the predicted effects of global climate change kick in. Nevertheless, I am hopeful. I believe Australia can become one of the most water efficient communities in the world; however, we all have to rethink where water comes from, how it is used and how it is reused. Water shortages in New South Wales, Western Australia, Victoria and South Australia in recent times have shown us that the efficient use of water is not simply a response to the current drought. It is an essential step in learning to live with less water without compromising our way of life.
There are no simple solutions to our water shortage. What is needed is a multifaceted approach that combines new sources, new efficiency measures and innovative ways of reusing our waste water. Clearly, water use is one of the key environmental challenges for Australia. Indeed, after climate change, I think it is the most serious issue. There have been manifestations of this in recent times. Over in Perth, there are plans for a desalinisation plant costing an estimated $350 million, simply because there are no local sources of water to meet that city’s water needs. In Adelaide, a great deal of work is being done on salt interception schemes around the Murray River. These schemes are aimed at preventing the deterioration of Adelaide’s drinking water. The work is pretty important because, if nothing is done, by the year 2020 Adelaide’s water will not meet the World Health Organisation guidelines on two days out of five. Just think about that: on two days out of every five in Adelaide—a major capital city in Australia—the water will effectively be undrinkable according to international standards, unless we act.
Melbourne was on stage 2 water restrictions for most of 2003. Sydney’s problems with water have a very high profile. I know the issues all too well. In Sydney we cannot use sprinklers or watering systems at any time and there are restrictions on washing cars, filling pools and general watering of gardens. As of last Thursday, Sydney’s main water supply, Warragamba Dam, was only filled to 43.4 per cent of its capacity. Everyone in Sydney knows water use is a serious issue. The question of water use and water efficiency that is before us in the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is a very serious challenge facing this nation.
The purpose of the bill is to provide for the establishment and operation of a scheme to apply national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to certain water use products. The aim of water efficiency labelling is to encourage the uptake of water efficient products and appliances in domestic and commercial areas. This bill’s objects are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, to provide information for the purchasers of water use products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology. It provides for the establishment of a national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme to be implemented cooperatively by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. It provides for penalties to be put in place for those who fail to comply with the registration, labelling and minimum efficiency and performance requirements and for an enforcement regime. It is estimated the bill will reduce consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent by 2021.
This is an objective which the Labor Party supports, but in fact we determine that it is an inadequate objective. We need to do much more. We really need to use water better and reduce our consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent in a much shorter time frame. We need to reduce water consumption much more rapidly than by 2021. It is also expected that there will be some greenhouse gas reductions through reducing water heating associated with these measures. The legislation is being funded from savings identified in the Measures for a Better Environment package and it picks up on recommendation 4 of the Senate inquiry into urban water use.
It is my understanding that those who have been consulted, including the product suppliers and retailers, have actively supported the introduction of this scheme. It addresses the mandatory labelling of most water use products, but in relation to mandatory performance standards it only applies to toilet use. It is the view of the opposition that the legislation is weaker than it could have been, that the environmental benefits would not be fully realised and that there is a case for standards to apply much more broadly. It is the view of the Labor Party that water efficiency performance standards ought to apply to more water use products. It is for that reason that I will be moving, as a second reading amendment:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government:
has failed to deliver water efficiency standards for indoor water use products other than toilets, forgoing a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption even further; and
should be condemned due to the failure of the Measures for a Better Environment package, from which funding has been drawn to finance this Bill, to deliver environmental outcomes”.
We make these points against the background that Australia is one of the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. In Australian households, each person uses around 350 litres each and every day, yet our national reuse of effluent is just 14 per cent. If we could do more to reclaim and reuse stormwater, treated sewage effluent, treated industrial discharge and grey or household waste water, we would be in a much better position to deal with shortages and it would boost our environment and indeed have economic benefits as well.
An integrated approach which considers all sources of water available to urban areas is needed to achieve a significant improvement in water use efficiency in urban areas. Reclaimed water can be used for a whole range of purposes, such as irrigation of city parks and sports ovals, industrial applications and cooling water. Surplus floodwater can be used to recharge natural aquifers, and safe, treated urban effluent can be used on crops. There are many other uses besides. The government should be working with the states and territories to improve water quality and the environmental outcomes of urban water management. The government should be investigating incentives for promoting stormwater and wastewater reuse and the integration of these issues in strategic planning of urban areas. The government should be using the COAG process to implement national initiatives to promote water saving measures such as rainwater tanks, water saving showerheads and tap fittings, dual flush toilets and increased use of grey water.
Another area I want to mention in relation to urban water use is the research effort. The Commonwealth research effort in this crucial area has largely dried up. The government should be renewing the role of the Commonwealth in research and development in irrigation, water reuse and innovation. Promoting water reuse research will yield many dividends including better design and value from experimental projects and monitoring, covering gaps, integrating project results, ensuring quality control and disseminating information effectively to those who need it. Establishing an urban water research program would support innovation in reuse of stormwater, reuse of effluent, water conservation, water sensitive urban design and urban water planning and management practices.
The government should establish a national program of research to promote sustainable water use in Australia with a particular focus on water reuse. This is a very significant challenge facing Australia in relation to domestic water use. Domestic households account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains supplied water in Australia. That is the second largest share of mains water use after the agricultural, forestry and mining sectors, as you might expect. Per household, the amount of water used for indoor purposes appears to be reasonably similar across many of Australia’s larger capital cities. The main indoor use is showering, which accounts for around 29 per cent of indoor consumption, followed by toilet flushing and washing machines, which each account for about 26 per cent. Taps over baths, sinks, handbasins and laundry tubs account for 18 per cent and dishwashers account for one per cent.
In terms of overall domestic consumption, it is worth noting that the amount of water used for outdoor purposes varies considerably between cities, with Perth using five times as much per household as Sydney, although some of the Perth supply comes from bores rather than main sources. I think both sides of the chamber might take this up with our Western Australian colleagues, because it certainly surprised me that there was such an extraordinary difference between the east and the west coasts of the continent.
Between 1996 and 2001, the supply of water to households in the main urban areas of Australia increased at around 3.4 per cent per annum. According to information from the Water Services Association of Australia, water consumption in two state capitals is already beyond the safe yield level, meaning that additional supplies or effective demand measures are required immediately. According to the association, three other capitals will be beyond the safe yield level between 2012 and 2020. That is a very serious situation and it requires action.
Back in December 2002, a Senate committee completed an inquiry into Australia’s management of urban water. The committee commented extensively on the issue of urban demand management, saying that there is considerable scope to reduce water use and achieve efficiencies so that water efficient appliances such as dual flush toilets, low flow showerheads, washing machines and dishwashers can dramatically reduce water use in homes. This approach can be coupled with water efficient gardens, minimal lawns and the use of native plants and efficient watering systems. The committee found that the fundamental factor in a successful demand management program was changing behaviour away from habits such as hosing down driveways and gutters, watering lawns during the heat of the day and having long showers.
So, what will be the impact of the labelling scheme which is provided for in the bill? According to modelling undertaken in developing the regulatory impact statement, the impact of the labelling component of the scheme will be to reduce total household water use by about five per cent by 2021, as compared with the ‘business as usual’ approach. No modelling has been done for the introduction of efficiency standards across all of the six products that were considered: washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. The regulatory impact statement suggests that, for water users, the cost of water-efficient products will most likely be higher, but consumers will benefit from a net saving because water bills will be lower.
The regulatory impact statement also considered manufacturers and importers, noting that labelling will come into force 12 months after the regulations under this bill are finalised. Consultations with manufacturers and importers indicate that this notice period will be enough to ensure that products are labelled correctly. As water efficiency labelling has an influence on consumer preference, the extent to which the sales of various manufacturers and importers are affected will depend on the water efficiency of their product ranges; manufacturers and importers that offer only products of low water efficiency will obviously be disadvantaged.
Retailers that carry at least some water efficient models should be advantaged. Those that specialise in low-cost products with low water efficiency will be disadvantaged. As the awareness of water labels is likely to build up over time, retailers should have ample time to sell their old stocks and order in more efficient models from a water perspective. The regulatory impact statement also says that the impact of water efficiency labelling on plumbers and builders is likely to be gradual. Plumbers and builders will still be free to select or recommend products irrespective of water efficiency, as many do now, and will be able to remove the water efficiency labels before end users see them; however, the labelling requirement should assist those plumbers and builders who take an interest in, or seek competitive advantage from, advising clients on water and energy efficient products.
We need to involve as many people in the community as possible. We particularly need those in the trades who supply these products to be very conscious of doing their bit by supplying products which minimise water use. We need to promote a culture which encourages consumers to use those products which in the longer term are necessary if we are not to go down the road of being in an increasingly precarious position with regard to the supply of fresh water. There are already programs under way to raise plumbers’ awareness of water product efficiency, including the GreenPlumbers program, run by the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Australia, which gets some funding from the Greenhouse Office. I congratulate them for that.
It is also worth noting that the introduction of water efficiency labelling for various indoor water use products is expected to have only a modest effect on household consumption, and that effect will take some time to materialise. The requirement for labelling foreshadowed by the bill is a positive step, but it is only one aspect of managing the demand for water by Australian households. In this context, it would certainly be worth while for modelling to be done on how the introduction of compulsory water efficiency standards for other products, like new showerheads and new washing machines, would affect household consumption.
In conclusion, water is a very substantial challenge for Australia. It is a substantial challenge for our environment. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in rural areas and to maintain healthy river systems. It is also a substantial challenge to get our water use right in urban areas, to take action concerning ocean outfalls, to lift our water reuse and recycling and to reduce our water demand so that we can have sustainable practices in our cities and our rural and regional areas. Against that background, we support the legislation. However, we do not think it goes far enough. The opposition believe the government ought to be acting with a great sense of urgency. In our second reading amendment we indicate that the government ought to be delivering water efficiency standards for a range of indoor water use products and that it ought to be taking up what is a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption. I move:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that:
the Government has failed to deliver water efficiency standards for indoor water use products other than toilets, forgoing a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption even further; and

"Scott, Bruce, MP",NATS,2004-12-09,"—I rise with great pleasure today to talk about the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004. One of the main objectives of this bill is to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, and that is the responsibility of all Australians. It should not just be sectioned out; it is for all of us to consider. The other objectives are to provide information to purchasers of water use products and to promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology—something I certainly want to talk about in my contribution today. We all share in the responsibility to use water more efficiently. We talk about Australia being the driest continent on earth. The fact is that the water that we have today is the water we will have in the future. We do not and will not have any more water than we have today, unless we look at other options such as the desalination of the ocean waters surrounding this great island continent.
This is not just an issue for rural dwellers; it is not just an issue for people on the land. Representing a rural electorate as I do, I often get rather upset at those who seem to shift the blame to farmers as being the villains in so many areas of water consumption in Australia. Many of our farmers are taking up new technologies and using greater efficiency measures with the water that they have, which is the lifeblood of their enterprises. It is for all of us to consider. I think we have to be in partnership with our city and urban dwellers and with our industries, whether they are mining, industries in our cities or the great sporting fields and golf courses that are being built day to day around Australia. We all share in the responsibility to make sure that we use water efficiently now and in the future, to make sure that it is sustainable in the long term.
One of the great challenges in Queensland is the growth of the population in the south-east corner. I am delighted to have with me in the Main Committee today the member for Blair. He and I share a common vision of the waste water in the south-east corner being shared, rather than what is happening to it now—being pumped into Moreton Bay, which is going to create a significant environmental problem in the future. I will talk a little bit more about that later.
One of the proposals that was worked on by the Page Research Centre was about the involvement of local government in this responsibility of using water more efficiently. Water today does have a value. Once upon a time I think the perception was that water came out of a tap and it had no value. And it was treated that way. We in this parliament have probably all seen it that way from time to time—we have turned the tap on to clean our teeth and just let it run because we thought it had no value and it has an endless source. But it has a very real value.
The Page Research Centre, which I was working with, released a paper on the way local governments price water to their consumers. Various methods are used by local governments around Australia to price the cost of water to their ratepayers. One of the things that I think were fairly constant, but not universal, was the fact that local governments would set a water charge to their ratepayers—which obviously included the cost of delivering the water, their infrastructure and making sure that the water meets world health standards. They are all costs which local governments deal with and, in order for them to be able to remain viable in delivering this water, they have to be able to charge their ratepayers.
One of the things that I noticed was that many local governments were charging ratepayers for an allocation of water. If those ratepayers, who are metered, went over that allocation then they would be charged excess water rates. What the governments were not doing was giving a rebate to those water users who used less than that allocation. In other words, those ratepayers who used less than the allocation that was set by the council as the allocation for their residents were actually being penalised. They were not being encouraged to use less, so they would use the allocation because they were paying for it. Those who went over the allocation paid excess water rates, but those who used less than their allocation did not get a rebate.
I would like to see local governments around Australia—and many have started to use the model that was put out by the Page Research Centre—universally start to price their water on the basis of the amount of water people use: the more people use, the more they will pay. Once again, that is an encouragement to use water more wisely and to invest in water-efficient methods around the home. In other words, instead of paying for more water because it is not being used wisely or efficiently, people invest those savings in water-efficient saving measures in and around the house.
I will now talk about a little project in my electorate that I think is innovative and shows great vision by the Dalby Town Council in the way they are now providing water to their ratepayers in the town of Dalby. For many years the town of Dalby and many communities along the Condamine-Balonne river system in my electorate have drawn their water from the Condamine River. For years and years, nearly every summer there would be water restrictions in the town. They are addressing that issue in various ways. One of them is to tap into the underground water reserves—but of course the underground water reserves in that part of Queensland carry too much salt for domestic consumption. So they have invested in reverse osmosis technology—in other words, they are cleaning the water and removing the salts carried in that water so that it can be used within the township of Dalby. That has certainly been a great cost to them, and I acknowledge that they have had some financial support from the state government of Queensland to invest in this reverse osmosis technology. It is not new technology—it has been around for years—but every year the technology improves. That technology is something that can also obviously be used along the eastern seaboard and all around our nation to meet some of our requirements for water.
I commend the Dalby town council for their investment in the reverse osmosis plant. It now provides something like 30 per cent of the town’s water supply. By tapping into the underground water reserves, it releases water for environmental flows into the Condamine. They are replacing what they used to pump from the Condamine for the town supply with underground water that they have converted, through the reverse osmosis process, from water carrying too much salt; and that now supplies part of the town’s water needs.
It also means that there is a greater water supply available to industry. In many of our rural communities, investment in industry has been held back because there is not sufficient water. The first thing any industry would be looking at in coming to a town in the inland of Australia is what water is available. If a town is already on restrictions for much of the year for its residents, usually it finds it very difficult to encourage industry to come to the town, because it would put a greater penalty on the existing residents as the water just is not available. Lack of available water with which to encourage industry to establish in our rural communities has held back many of our rural towns.
There is another project in which I know the member for Blair would share my interest. It is one of those great visionary projects and it has been on the political agenda and the agenda of the communities of the Lockyer Valley, Toowoomba and the Darling Downs probably for 10 to 15 years. I have to commend all those—including local government, farmers and bankers—who have been involved in what was originally called Vision 2000. The year 2000 has passed us by and they have now converted to the name ‘NuWater’. I am a strong supporter of the NuWater proposal. As a group, they have been working for about 10 years now on the proposition of bringing part of Brisbane’s waste water to the Lockyer Valley and over the range to the Darling Downs.
Brisbane currently, as I understand it, produces something like 130,000 megalitres of grey water each year. With the growth in the south-east corner of Queensland, that amount is going to continue to grow to something like 180,000 megalitres of water per year in the next 20 years. Currently, nearly all of that water is just pumped into Moreton Bay. It presents an environmental hazard today, and it is going to increasingly present greater environmental hazards to beautiful Moreton Bay, around which Brisbane is built.
The proponents of NuWater are in the final stages of their engineering and economic studies. In fact, they have been a recipient of some of our Regional Partnerships money to do those economic, feasibility and engineering studies. This project is going to cost something like $500 million. The farmers, the bankers who are backing the farmers, and the industries in the Darling Downs and in the Lockyer Valley around Gatton are backing this. The amount that the banks are prepared to lend them is something like $1,000 per megalitre of water. This is not just an ask on government; these people see the need for this project and are prepared to invest heavily themselves. They have the financial backing of their bankers, and I am hopeful that, as next year progresses and as they complete the engineering and feasibility studies, they will be successful in their application for some of the $2 billion Water Fund moneys that the government announced during the federal election.
The other thing that I think is terribly important about this project is that it is a win-win situation. It is an environmental win for Moreton Bay; it is also an environmental win for the Lockyer Valley and for the sustainability of the communities that depend on agriculture in the Lockyer Valley. Also, the 85,000 megalitres that they propose to pump over the Dividing Range and into the Darling Downs will replace water that is currently drawn from the Condamine-Balonne river system on the Darling Downs. So it will release water that otherwise would have been pumped and used for farming and industry in that part of Queensland. So it will be an environmental benefit to the Condamine-Balonne, which is at the headwaters in Queensland of the great Murray-Darling Basin. There are huge environmental wins for the coastal areas, for the Lockyer Valley and west of the Dividing Range into the Condamine-Balonne river system, where the water would enter just below Toowoomba.
—All the way to Adelaide.
—Absolutely. This is a project that I, the member for Groom, the member for Blair, who is the chamber at the moment, and state members have been working on with NuWater for the last eight to 10 years. We hope that they will be successful in their application for some financial assistance under the Australian water fund. We also hope that we can get the Brisbane City Council to see the merit of this great project, because it is their water and they have to do something with it in the interests of the environment. We can see a great use for it, where the environment wins, regional Queensland wins and, of course, the Murray-Darling Basin wins.
In conclusion, piping water great distances is nothing new in this nation. There was a similar project in Western Australia over 100 years ago. I am sure the member for Hasluck, who has just joined us here, will remind us all of that great project, which took water from Perth over 300 miles—I will be corrected when the member for Hasluck speaks—to Kalgoorlie. This project is similar in many ways, bringing water from a coastal region into the Lockyer Valley over the Dividing Range. So it is nothing new. The engineering has been around for more than 100 years. We now have to see whether it will stack up environmentally and economically and whether the proposition is ultimately able to get the support of bankers and, more importantly for me, the member for Maranoa, the member for Blair and, I am sure, member for Groom, whether it will get the support of the Commonwealth government through the Australian water fund. We want to see what is a dream for so many of us become a reality in the next 12 months because of the reasons I have outlined in my contribution today.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,55,1
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I come to this debate not claiming any great degree of expertise. I was very interested in the comments made by the member for Maranoa when he said, I think quite rightly, that we have grown accustomed to not placing value on water. To that I plead guilty, but I think it is a healthy sign in our community that we are becoming much more conscious of the need to conserve our natural resources. I see the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 as part of an ongoing education campaign to assist the community in taking actions that, at an individual level, can contribute to the conservation of one of our most precious natural resources.
I think the bill is a good start but, as our amendment indicates, it does not go as far as we would like. However, it is a good start in that it will establish a national scheme which will progressively apply water efficiency labelling requirements and minimum water efficiency standards to certain water use and water saving products. The initial emphasis will be on the labelling of those products, and I think we can take heart from the success that we have seen with the similar energy rating program. That in itself is to be welcomed. We are a little disappointed that the efficiency standards are at this stage only applied to toilets. We believe that there could have been scope for a broader application of performance standards.
One hopes that through the actions proposed in this legislation we can play our part in urging the community to take up water efficient products and appliances, for household use as well as commercial use. Through the scheme we will be able to provide information for purchases of water use products and in so doing promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology.
I want to pause at that point to say that what I find very interesting in what has hitherto been rather a polarised debate about issues to do with employment and environmental outcomes is that in areas like this we can actually see the potential for the creation of a whole host of new employment opportunities in the community. In time, the information we will be providing and the take-up of these more efficient water use products will help promote new ideas, new technologies, new innovation and new ways of working, and hopefully there will be a spin-off in new jobs being created to help in the environmental outcomes we are all committed to.
It is good to see the scheme is proposed to be implemented cooperatively by all levels of government. You cannot do this one-out. At the end of the day it appears from the outcomes that we are looking at that it might help to substantially reduce the usage of water and to conserve our scarce supplies. What is interesting is that the issue of water conservation is not just affecting our nation but that, as with the issue of greenhouse gas emissions and the debate we had in the House yesterday, this problem is a global one. It is very worrying for those communities that are struggling to advance their own living standards and economic development that they will be really hard hit. According to United Nations estimates, water scarcity will affect two out of every three people by 2025. Alarmingly, one hears people say that, if there were to be a war—God forbid—then it would more likely be a war about water. That is how serious the situation is becoming.
All these things are interrelated. Global warming, as everybody appreciates, could significantly harm water availability. A warmer atmosphere could lead to higher rates of evaporation, causing droughts and more severe weather. Faster run-off rates and slower infiltration of groundwater could follow. Warmer water may also promote detrimental algal blooms, which may lead to more waterborne illnesses. Ironically, as the climate heats up people will want to use more water for drinking, bathing and watering. So the interconnections are very important, and people have to have confidence that every small step that they take is a step that adds to the totality of our consciousness about the need to preserve our precious natural resources.
It is interesting that in terms of greenhouse emissions we lead the world on a per capita basis. With water it is the same: Australians are among the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. That is something that we need to be cognisant of. To the extent that this bill provides some scope for raising these issues in the public domain it is to be supported. I was alarmed in reading the background brief to this bill to see that each household uses around 350 litres a day. To that I plead guilty as well. As the member for Maranoa was saying, the lack of attributing value to water means that on many occasions we are less conscious than we ought to be about the necessity to preserve this resource. Domestic households now account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains supplied water in Australia. In context, it is the second largest share of mains water use after the agriculture, forestry and mining sectors. Within the home the main indoor use is showering, followed by toilet flushing and washing machines.
So at every level within the home we can act to conserve water. We need to act to conserve it because, with population growth, the demand for water is increasing by around 3.4 per cent each year. This was driven home very forcefully in my state by the worrying signals we had about the water supplies in our dams and reservoirs being at an all-time low, and there was debate in the local community about whether or not it was time to seriously think about the introduction of desalinisation plants. I think everybody out there in the community is much more mindful of this precious commodity and the fact that we need to play our part in reducing consumption and looking after this natural resource. I do commend the government for bringing this bill to the parliament. I think it is a good step. It is not the total solution to these issues, but every step contributes to the broader picture.
I want to end by saying that, in trying to raise awareness and consciousness of these issues and saying that every little step we take matters, in my own electorate Sydney Water has piloted the Shellharbour Residential Retrofit Program. It involved the installation of water-efficient devices in homes to try to introduce measures which would save water in the flushing of toilets. I was surprised that even a simple measure like this resulted in a significant decrease in water use for the households that participated in the Shellharbour Residential Retrofit Program. It was very surprising too that, even in the homes that were not retrofitted, there was a marked decrease in water use in participant households who received educational materials alone on the issue of water efficiency—although, naturally, higher savings were achieved by households that had all the available equipment installed.
I note that in recent figures released by Sydney Water there has been an average reduction of about 29 per cent through all the local government areas that draw on Sydney Water. That is heartening in itself—that the issue is being taken up at the local government level, that local government with the instrumentalities are promoting community specific programs that are having an impact.
Water, like greenhouse gas emissions, is a very substantial challenge for our nation. It is a substantial challenge also for our environment and for the principle of intergenerational equity. We have to get our water use right, not just in urban areas but also in rural areas. We need to take action on the issue of ocean outfalls, which the member for Maranoa referred to; I think that is a growing and important issue. We need to lift our water reuse and recycling levels, and reduce our demand so that we have sustainable practices in both city and country areas. Against that background, I am happy to support the legislation that is before us in this bill. As indicated in our amendment, while supporting it we do believe that the situation is getting very critical and we would have been happy to see more of a broad-brush approach in the details of the bill.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,55,1
"Henry, Stuart, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004, as I think it is one that will provide fantastic support for our community in addressing issues of water conservation and water efficiency. It will also provide support for the leadership role that I believe plumbers and the plumbing industry generally have taken across Australia in educating our community and promoting water efficiency through a number of programs, such as the Waterwise plumbing program in Western Australia, where plumbers are trained to carry out audits, to develop knowledge on the range of products that are available for water efficiency and to promote those to their customers. Who better to be educating our communities than those who are out there servicing our communities dealing with and addressing water issues every day? I certainly compliment that industry for their efforts. I have had almost 20 years in the plumbing industry, so I can speak with some appreciation and some understanding of those issues and the challenges. This bill will reinforce those initiatives and those efforts.
One of the speakers on the other side mentioned the GreenPlumbers program, which is run by the Master Plumbers and Mechanical Services Association of Australia. That is certainly a program to be commended. I guess it arose out of some of the other programs that were initiated earlier in Queensland and Western Australia which adopted the Waterwise logo and promoted water efficiency. As I mentioned, I have been involved in the industry for some lengthy period of time at a local, national and international level.
This bill is one that makes Australia a leader in addressing issues of water efficiency at a community level. This bill’s introduction is very timely because 2004, as I understand it, is the Year of the Built Environment. The issue is one that the plumbing industry and plumbers generally have made a significant contribution to over a long period of time. In fact, if I might just briefly reflect on that, 100 years or so ago in Perth we had a population of about 5,000 people living on 3,000 acres. At that particular time, 40 per cent of that population suffered from waterborne diseases like typhoid, dysentery and cholera. Doctors approached the government and said, ‘We need to do something about this. We cannot continue this way.’ Fresh water supplies were severely contaminated by human waste, which led to the serious disease situation. Those doctors made a recommendation that plumbers be trained and registered to ensure that they had the skills and the competency to carry out the work. Plumbers were first registered and licensed in 1910 in Western Australia.
It is interesting to note that 100 years on we have buildings such as Parliament House and buildings in Perth and other parts of Western Australia that probably house 5,000 people—people who are supplied with fresh water and appropriate sanitation without that disease impost and without those potential challenges to human society. Yet we all too often take it for granted. For example, a number of developing countries do not enjoy the level of amenity that we do, including the delivery of fresh water and the sanitary services provided by plumbers. They do not have high-rise cities to provide the level of comfort and amenity that we enjoy here. They still have considerable outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery et cetera. That is a great demonstration of the effect that plumbing has had. This bill is another step forward in increasing the sophistication of the range of beneficial services that we provide to our communities in Australia.
Water efficiency, as other speakers have mentioned, is an issue that is very important in Australia. The member for Maranoa mentioned that Australia is one of the driest countries in the world and there is no doubt that we have significant issues with water and we need to do everything we possibly can to conserve water. Not only that: we need to ensure that we educate our communities about the benefits of water efficiency and conserving water and about the advantageous environmental impact that will have. It is very important that we ensure that our communities appreciate the value of fresh water. Indeed, in Perth and Western Australia we have had water restrictions for a number of years. As a result of this—and the significant education programs that have been conducted—most of our constituents and most of the communities in Perth and Western Australia are very much aware of the need to conserve water.
Indeed, the Water Corporation and others have been working with schools on a range of projects to ensure that our young people appreciate that. They have been involved in retrofit programs where they have installed water-efficient products, dual flush systems and a range of other products, such as those referred to in this bill, to reduce water consumption in those schools. Those projects have been very successful and have provided a great educational base. We need to educate not only our young people but also everybody else about the use of water and how we need to manage that process.
For Perth the circumstances, I understand from the Water Corporation records, are that over the last 20 years our rainfall has been only about 50 per cent of the 100-year average. It demonstrates again how seriously we have been impacted by what may well be part of a cyclical process but which has reduced our water reserves quite considerably, to the extent that at the moment—as we move into a dry summer—we only have about 30 per cent of that capacity.
I mentioned earlier that plumbers have shown a leadership role with respect to water efficiency. In 1994, I was involved with the master plumbers association in Western Australia and we developed a water efficiency strategy for the plumbing industry for 2000; in fact, it was called Directions 2000. But it was interesting because as part of that strategic review we looked at some of these usage situations and the way water was valued. There were some areas of concern and questions were asked: will our society continue to allow 10 per cent of existing consumers to consume 25 to 30 per cent of the existing water supply; will society allow 25 per cent of existing consumers to continue to use over 50 per cent of the existing water supply; will society allow new and further capital expenditure when half of this expenditure will service only 25 per cent of new consumers if we maintain our current water practices; or will the community expect us to adopt the best management practices and use our existing resources more efficiently? I think they are important questions for us as governments at all levels in Australia about how we address the issue of water supply and the demand for water and how we manage it in our societies.
The member for Maranoa mentioned the issue of charges for and costs of water. One of the critical and strategic ways of addressing that is by ensuring that people understand that the products they are using are water efficient. The labelling system that is proposed in this bill will go a long way towards achieving that outcome.
This bill is also timely, because it does need the support—and I understand it does have the support—of state governments across the country. That is going to be a very important aspect of getting the full benefit of this particular bill across the Australian community. It happens to coincide with some other national initiatives that have been introduced and developed by the National Plumbing Regulators Forum, which is made up of all the state and territory bodies involved in the regulation of plumbing in Australia. That organisation has been meeting this week and has agreed nationally to introduce, accept and take into regulation the Plumbing Code of Australia, which has a plumbing product approval system. I note the Water Efficient Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 does appoint a regulator from the appropriate Commonwealth department, and that person will be responsible for the regulation and the policing of this process in terms of accreditation for a product and making sure that it is used in the appropriate way.
It seems to me that there could well be some sort of duplication between that particular authority and regulator and the National Plumbing Regulators Forum. It may well be that that responsibility could be delegated to that body looking after plumbing across Australia. For all intents and purposes, the majority of the products that are going to be involved in this water efficiency rating program are plumbing products which will be installed by plumbers in various buildings and properties across Australia.
This is the first time that the Plumbing Code of Australia has been adopted, and it will go a long way to addressing a number of issues with respect to water efficiency, energy efficiency and environmental efficiency where there is practical application to plumbing installations. There will also be an element of third party certification, which is very important in verifying manufacturers’ claims of compliance, thus ensuring protection of the consumer.
I will take some time to look at the objectives of this scheme, which is very much parallel to what this bill intends to achieve. The objective of the new scheme is to establish an efficient product approval process for plumbing and drainage products in Australia. As I mentioned, a number of products listed to be covered by this labelling process with respect to water efficiency are plumbing products. State and territory governments have responsibility for regulating plumbing and drainage installations in order to protect public health and safety of the environment and consumers. As I said, there are a number of parallels between this bill and these initiatives.
Australia has had plumbing product approval since about 1920, so it seems to me appropriate for those people who are associated with those sorts of programs to be involved with the water efficiency labelling process. In the past, three separate marks have been applied to plumbing products: a standards mark, a water mark and a type test mark. Now those have been consolidated into one mark, which will be the water mark. It is also proposed, under this new process through the National Plumbing Regulators Forum, that products coming from overseas will also be certified and accredited for use in Australian markets. As I understand it, there is also a memorandum of understanding between the National Plumbing Regulators Forum and Australian Standards—who are responsible for the standards that apply to plumbing products—that third party certification will apply. The notes to the bill refer to the water mark being applied in those sorts of arrangements.
I think this bill is very timely. It will provide an opportunity for further education of our community about the value of water efficiency. I think that water efficiency and water management in Australia are something that we are significantly challenged by, and there are a number of new initiatives that we ought to be looking at, such as harvesting stormwater in our cities. In Chicago, I understand that there is a system of tunnelling that has the capacity to store stormwater at about the same capacity as Sydney Harbour. That is fairly significant and something which could perhaps be considered here. Obviously there would be considerable cost, but I think we really need to be innovative and look at initiatives well beyond what might be the norm in terms of ensuring that we have got sufficient water to supply our communities.
There has also been talk about grey water reuse. I think grey water reuse is going to become an increasingly important aspect of water use in Australia, and we need to ensure that we have got people committed to developing initiatives and innovations to provide the best possible outcome in the safest possible way. I am a great proponent of grey water reuse and I think there are opportunities for it to be done on a community basis. For example, the Water Corporation in Western Australia has a grey water recycling process in Kwinana where grey water is being recycled for industrial use. I compliment them on that; however, I think it is also important to look at the number of people in our community—for example, in the electorate of Hasluck—who would like the opportunity of using a grey water recycling process for their gardens and lawns. I think it is a great way of using water. They have already paid the cost of having water to be delivered to the house, and it is simply a matter of installing a grey water recirculation system that would allow them to do that at no expense beyond the cost of installation of the system. The benefit of grey water recycling is that it has the potential to create as much as 22 gigalitres of additional water resources in Perth and Western Australia.
We also need to look at improvements in irrigation techniques and infrastructure, moving away from canals and open channels to piping arrangements to reduce the significant evaporation that occurs. In Western Australia the state government has already moved to build a desalination plant, yet there has been concern raised by many people who have considerable experience and expertise in this area about the environmental impact. I am concerned about the environmental impact and the location of the desalination plant in terms of Cockburn Sound, where there is significant potential for a detrimental effect on the marine life and the marine ecosystem in Cockburn Sound as a result of the hypersalination by-product produced by desalination.
Another aspect that needs to be seriously considered by water utilities is the distribution network itself. I am sure that there is considerable leakage across Australia through those systems, and it needs to be addressed to improve the amount and the volume of water available for use by our communities. I know full well that our systems are much more efficient than those in some other places. In my various capacities I have had the opportunity to look at places such as Samoa, where I understand they lose as much as 54 per cent of their water through the distribution systems, and Hyderabad, India, where water supply losses are as much as 38 per cent. As I said, I am sure it is much less here in Australia, but I am sure we could improve our efficiencies in terms of those distribution networks.
I am a great supporter of this bill. I think it is going to achieve a lot of very positive outcomes by educating our community about the principles of water efficiency and enabling them to select products where there is no loss of amenity. They can enjoy the benefits of a water efficient shower rose and a dual flush toilet in their house and make a significant contribution to our society.
In conclusion, in terms of the water audits plumbers are doing, it might be something that we could look at in Parliament House. I have had a quick look around, and we could certainly use water efficient showers and toilets here to help conserve water. Whilst the bill does exempt installations that have been installed prior to the bill, it might be of some value to demonstrate a leadership role. I commend the bill to the House.
 (Hon. B.K. Bishop)—Before I call the member for Wills, I remind members that in this chamber they are able to ask questions of people who are giving speeches on the second reading debate. The speaker may elect not to answer the question, but it is a useful intervention if members wish to use it.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,55,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—Water is one of the key critical environmental challenges for Australia, and there have been some clear manifestations of this in recent times. The member for Hasluck referred to the fact that over in Perth they are now examining a desalination plant which would cost an estimated $350 million. They are looking at that in Perth simply because there are no alternative local sources of water to meet that city’s needs.
The member for Hasluck referred to the fact that Perth’s water reserves are down to around 30 per cent. He referred to this as being a cyclical process. It sounded suspiciously as if he is just one more of those coalition members who is in denial over the cause of our water problems. The situation of reduced water in Perth over the course of the last 25 years is climate change, pure and simple. You have a different climate from the climate you used to have. Unfortunately, there are too many coalition members who simply do not get it and are in denial over the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the world’s climate. I encourage the member for Hasluck to follow the example of the Western Australian Farmers Federation, who do get it and who have written to the Prime Minister urging him to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change and get serious about cooperative international efforts to tackle this problem.
In Adelaide a great deal of work is being done on salt interception schemes around the Murray River aimed at preventing the deterioration of Adelaide’s drinking water, which, if nothing is done, by the year 2020 will not meet the World Health Organisation guidelines for two days out of five. In Melbourne, my home city, we are now on stage 2 water restrictions, and in Sydney and many other cities there are very serious water issues as well.
The question of water use and water efficiency that is before us in the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is a very serious challenge facing this country. The purpose of the bill is to provide for the establishment and operation of a scheme to apply national water efficiency labelling and minimum performance standards to certain water use products. The aim of water efficiency labelling is to encourage the uptake of water-efficient products and appliances in domestic and commercial areas. The bill’s objects are to conserve water supplies by reducing water consumption, provide information for purchasers of water use products and promote the adoption of efficient and effective water use technology. It provides for the establishment of a national water efficiency labelling and standards scheme to be implemented cooperatively by Commonwealth, state and territory governments; for penalties to be put in place for those who fail to comply with the registration, labelling and minimum efficiency and performance requirements; and for an enforcement regime.
It is estimated that the bill would reduce consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent by 2021. That is an objective which the opposition supports and I am sure all Australians would support, but I rather think it is inadequate. We really need to use water better and reduce our consumption of water in households and non-residential buildings by five per cent in a much shorter time frame. We need to reduce water consumption more rapidly by 2021. It is also expected that there would be some greenhouse gas reductions through reducing water heating associated with these measures.
This bill is being funded from savings identified in the Measures for a Better Environment package, and it picks up on recommendation 4 of the Senate inquiry into urban water use. It is my understanding that those who have been consulted, including the product suppliers and retailers, have actively supported the introduction of this scheme and that it has not been opposed. It addresses the mandatory labelling of most water use products, but in relation to mandatory performance standards it only applies to toilets. It is the view of the opposition that the legislation is weaker than it might have been, that environmental benefits will not be fully realised and that there is a case for standards to apply more broadly. It is our belief that water efficiency performance standards ought to apply to more water use products, and on that basis I support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Grayndler.
Labor have developed a framework for national water policy, which seeks to get better water management in urban Australia. We note that Australia is one of the highest per capita consumers of water in the world. In Australian households each person uses around 350 litres per day, yet our national reuse of effluent is at just 14 per cent. If we could do more to reclaim and reuse storm water, treated sewage effluent, treated industrial discharge and grey household waste water, we would be in a much better position to deal with shortages and it would boost our environment and our economy. I heard the member for Hasluck indicating his support for a greater emphasis on harvesting storm water and grey water reuse. I would support that. I hope he has more success than some of his colleagues, because so far the federal government has been doing precious little in this area.
An integrated approach which considers all sources of water available to urban areas is needed to achieve significant improvement in water use efficiency in urban areas. Clearly, reclaimed water can be used for a whole range of purposes—irrigation of city parks and sports ovals, industrial purposes and cooling water. Surplus floodwater can be used to recharge natural aquifers, and safe treated urban effluent can be used on crops. There are many other uses besides. We think the Commonwealth government should be working with the states and territories to improve water quality and the environmental outcomes of urban water management. We think the government should be investigating incentives for promoting stormwater and waste water reuse and the integration of these issues in strategic planning of urban areas.
I want to make a passing reference to the problem of ocean outfalls. Large and growing human populations on the coastal fringe place pressures on coastal ecosystems, particularly through the disposal of sewage waste in coastal waters. There are over 140 sewage outfalls discharging into the ocean and estuaries within the vicinity of beaches in Australia. We should be working with the state and local water authorities to dramatically reduce the amount of water being discharged via ocean outfalls, and we also want to reduce urban water demand. Increasing the reuse will reduce the need to build costly water storages, which have been shown to have a serious impact on the ecology of Australian rivers.
Another area I want to mention in relation to urban water use is the research effort. The Commonwealth research effort in this crucial area has largely dried up. We need to renew the role of the Commonwealth in research and development in irrigation, water reuse and innovation. Promoting water reuse research will yield many dividends, including better design and value from environmental projects and monitoring, covering gaps, integrating project results, ensuring quality control and disseminating information effectively to those who need it. An urban water research program would support innovation in the reuse of stormwater, the reuse of effluent, water conservation, water-sensitive urban design and urban water planning, and management practices. We really need to establish a national program of research and coordinate the work presently being done to promote sustainable water use in Australia, with a particular focus on water reuse.
There is a very significant challenge facing Australia in relation to domestic water use. Domestic households account for around 16 per cent of the consumption of mains-supplied water in Australia, and we do need to do better. We have the capacity to do better. Back in December 2002, a Senate committee completed an inquiry into Australia’s management of urban water. It commented extensively on the issue of urban demand management, saying:
There is considerable scope to reduce water use and achieve efficiencies. Water efficient appliances such as dual flush toilets, low flow shower heads, washing machines and dishwashers can dramatically reduce water use in homes. This can be coupled to water efficient gardens, using native plants, minimal lawns and efficient watering systems.
The committee made a series of recommendations and was very anxious to see us implement successful demand management programs and change behaviour away from habits such as hosing down driveways and gutters, watering lawns during the heat of the day, having long showers and the like. The committee recommended that we have a national water policy, with standards including national water efficiency standards and rating schemes for appliances and building systems. That is something which the opposition strongly endorses.
According to the modelling undertaken in developing the regulatory impact statement, the impact of the labelling system provided for in the bill will be to reduce total household water use by about five per cent by 2021 compared with the business-as-usual approach. No modelling has been done for the introduction of efficiency standards across all of the six products that were considered—washing machines, dishwashers, toilets, showerheads, taps and urinals. The regulatory impact statement suggests that, for water users, the cost of water-efficient products will most likely be higher, but consumers would benefit from a net saving because their total water bills would be lower.
The regulatory impact statement also considered the impact on manufacturers and importers. It is its view that giving them 12 months after the regulations under this bill are finalised will be enough to ensure that products are labelled correctly, and it is to be expected that water efficiency labelling will have an impact on consumer preference. Our view is that that is not a bad thing. We want to encourage people to purchase the products which have high water efficiency rather than low water efficiency.
In conclusion, water is a very substantial challenge for Australia. It is a substantial challenge for our environment. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in rural areas and to maintain healthy river systems. It is a substantial challenge to get our water use right in the urban areas, to take action concerning ocean outfalls, to lift our water reuse and recycling and to reduce our water demand so that we do get sustainable water practices in our cities and in the country.
Against that background, we support the legislation, but we do not think it goes far enough. We think the government ought to be acting with a greater sense of urgency, and in our second reading amendment we indicate that the government ought to be delivering water efficiency standards for a range of indoor water use products and that it ought to be taking up what is a significant opportunity to reduce household water consumption.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,55,1
"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2004-12-09,"—I would like to start by saying I welcome the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 today because it will provide consumers with the information they need to be able to make informed purchasing decisions about water-efficient products. Introducing minimum water efficiency standards for all toilets is an excellent step, but we could do more.
This legislation is expected to save about five per cent of national domestic water use by 2021. That is 87,000 million litres or, to draw a South Australian comparison, the equivalent of more than two South Para reservoirs or almost eight Happy Valley reservoirs. In South Australia we have already had dual flush toilets in all new developments or renovations since the early eighties. But there is more to a water-efficient toilet than simply being dual flush, so I certainly welcome the introduction of a minimum standard.
Our toilet water use as a percentage of total household water use is around 11 per cent. Baths and showers use about 20 per cent and our gardens use about 40 per cent. So it is clear that, while the minimum water efficiency standards for toilets are a step in the right direction, we also need standards applied to all shower heads, taps and washing machines. If we are really serious about water conservation, these standards have to be extended to garden watering systems, hose nozzles and all other watering devices.
One does not have to look very far to see that water conservation is a massive issue for us in this country, certainly in South Australia. Just outside, there are empty garden beds surrounding Parliament House this summer because of water restrictions that are in place in the ACT. So why impose minimum water efficiency standards for toilets but stop short of that for other high water use products?
In South Australia alone, it is estimated that households could save up to 33,000 megalitres by 2025 through the uptake of water-efficient products and the recent introduction of permanent water conservation measures on outdoor water use, which for example includes a ban on hosing down paved areas. This legislation is an opportunity to tighten efficiency requirements on other household water-using products, but for some reason the government is not taking that opportunity. Given everything we know about Australia’s water resources, the decision is staggering. If the argument is that more evidence is required to justify the inclusion of these other products with regard to minimum efficiency standards then why not collect more evidence? Given all of the work that has already been done around the country on these issues, that ought to be a fairly straightforward process, and I do not believe it would take very long at all.
Nationally, showers account for about 29 per cent of indoor household water use; toilets and washing machines, each about 26 per cent; and taps, around 18 per cent. So why are there minimum water efficiency standards on toilets but not on shower heads and washing machines? I can only assume that, during the industry consultation, industry said that they could cop standards on toilets but not on anything else. Given this country’s circumstances, industry objections to standards—if there are any—are not a good enough reason to back away from implementing measures which would help save our water resources.
Australians are more than ready to accept the necessity for this change. In South Australia last year, restrictions, followed by the introduction of permanent water conservation measures, led to a fall in water consumption of 14 per cent. So although it can be a hassle to have to water the garden early in the morning or late at night or to set your watering system so it does not water every day, people do understand how important it is. As consumers, they would accept that the products available need to be ones that will help reduce water consumption.
South Australians tend to be more acutely aware that there is no time to waste when it comes to water conservation. My colleague the shadow minister for regional development, Kelvin Thomson, has previously pointed out that if nothing is done to stop the decline of the Murray the drinking water in Adelaide will not meet the World Health Organisation guidelines for two days out of five by the year 2020. That is just 16 years away and it will come round sooner than the estimated five per cent water saving from this legislation will. Unfortunately, that estimate cannot factor in the unknown consequences of climate change on our water supplies and there are some in the scientific community who are concerned that climate change is happening far more rapidly than we had previously anticipated. Literally, as we debate this bill the health of the river continues to decline. The economic fallout if we allow that to continue is unfathomable.
Our other water resources in South Australia are also in trouble. In the Adelaide Hills, flows to the reservoirs have been reduced because of increasing competition between agricultural, domestic and industrial users. Furthermore, development in the catchment area has led to an increased level in pollution, which threatens the quality of water and the biodiversity of our creeks and rivers. Our ground water is already fully allocated, leaving no way to expand agricultural businesses. Ironically, in the electorate of Hindmarsh urban consolidation has contributed to an increase of incidences of flooding. There are times when people in parts of the electorate find themselves knee deep in water. In the driest state in the driest country it is hard to understand how this can happen. We need to capture it before it fills up our streets on its way to the sea. Stormwater run-off sends nutrients and other pollutants pouring into the Gulf St Vincent.
The Waterproofing Adelaide report, A thirst for change, says that about 160,000 megalitres of stormwater and surface water flow into the gulf each year. So while reducing our water use is essential, finding ways to harness other water sources will also make an enormous difference. A thirst for change estimates that improvements in our capacity to use stormwater and rainwater over the next 20 years will mean that we will be able to use about 20,000 megalitres a year. Currently, we capture between just 3,000 and 5,000 megalitres a year. That actually makes South Australia a leader in stormwater reuse.
Morphettville racecourse, which is in the electorate of Hindmarsh, captures stormwater and then uses it for irrigation. More of our open parkland areas will need to be able to do this if we are to become a truly water wise country. Another opportunity lies in reusing waste water. The nutrients in treated waste water make it very effective for irrigation. Currently, waste water reuse in South Australia is around 14,000 megalitres but A thirst for change estimates that figure could grow to 30,000 megalitres over the next two decades, which again would decrease water flow into the Gulf St Vincent.
It is quite clear that there is not enough water to go around and yet this legislation does not as an urgent priority place minimum water efficiency standards on any product other than toilets. Even though we support the legislation, is a great shame that this government is not trying to achieve more significant water savings than five per cent and far sooner than 2021.",REPS,<title>WATER EFFICIENCY LABELLING AND STANDARDS BILL 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,55,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2004-12-09,"—In rising to sum up on the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 let me say that this is a bill that it is a point of personal pride to be associated with. I believe it is credit not just to this side of the House but also to the other side that there is a bipartisan approach to water efficiency within Australia, although there are some points of disagreement. This is something about which the Prime Minister; the Deputy Prime Minister; the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell; I and so many of the members of the government have not just an interest but a deep commitment and passion. For those reasons, I am delighted to be able to lead the summation of the bill.
The challenge we face in Australia is twofold. The first challenge is controlling our domestic consumption, what we consume within our houses, the efficiency and reuse of the water within the domestic cycle. This bill specifically addresses that part of the equation. The second challenge is the infrastructure efficiency within our cities and our outfalls and the systemic approach to the reuse of the large mass of water which flows from the Australian urban environment. That is a problem which over the last three years, along with other members of the government, I have argued needs to be addressed not just at the state level but also at the national level. There has been a failure of state governments to address the core infrastructure needs which are within their areas of responsibility in relation to stormwater, water recycling and grey water. In this day and age the states in Australia are behind the international curve, and we need to take greater steps.
That brings me directly to the comments made by our honourable friends on the opposite side of the chamber. Two principal criticisms were advanced. The first was a notion that we need additional minimum standards, other than those provided within the bill. The answer is that the bill provides for exactly that. I would recommend that the opposition read and understand what is in the bill. The express provision which includes water from toilets as a minimum standard is simply the first of a series of measures. It is coupled with an approach which adds in labelling as a means to achieving these outcomes and then migrating other products to specific minimum standards. But first we have to establish a buying pattern; otherwise, we are going to be outlawing up to 80 per cent of domestic washing machines immediately. Make no mistake, this bill has a clear direction and an absolute mechanism. There are savings which will come from this bill alone. I say to our friends who are visiting the chamber that by the year 2020 we are looking at over 610 billion litres of water being saved, with up to 60 billion litres of water being saved per year. For a country that is poor in water resources, this is a critical saving. That was the first point made by our friends in the opposition.
The second point is rather curious. It is the notion that this government has been concerned about water reuse, despite the fact that water reuse is a responsibility of the states. Last evening the House of Representatives passed the final suggestions from the Senate and brought into being the National Water Commission Bill. That bill, which will now proceed to the Governor-General for formal approval, sets in place a $2 billion national initiative under the Australian water fund. That $2 billion initiative comprises $1.6 billion for the water smart Australia program, for water infrastructure, both urban and rural, on a scale never seen before in dealing with urban water in Australia. The opposition also talk about the need for research. Last night the Parliament of Australia approved allocation of $200 million for national water standards under the national water standards program, which is a component of the Australian water fund. The third component is water wise communities, which has also been granted $200 million.
When you take those three components together, you find the timing of today’s comment curious. Last night $2 billion of funding was allocated at the federal level for problems such as water recycling, grey water reuse, addressing the problems of rivers such as the Nepean River, and the many challenges around Australia. Three years ago I set the challenge for Australia to end ocean outfalls by 2025—the waste of water, the environmental impact and the health risks. That is a challenge to which I remain more committed than ever before. The passage of the National Water Commission Bill last night makes it more realistic and more viable. But I welcome the opposition’s interest and make no criticism of the fact that they wish to achieve this. I simply highlight to the House and to our friends in the opposition that all of the arguments which they were advancing were in fact achieved less than 24 hours ago.
I also want to pay particular tribute to the contributions by the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott, and the member for Hasluck, Mr Henry. The member for Maranoa set out before the chamber a very simple proposition. He is arguing for a major urban recycling program in Brisbane which will take that 85 gigalitres of waste water per year from the Brisbane system and use it in the Lockyer Valley. That is a proposal he wishes to advance before the National Water Commission as a national priority. I commend his endeavour and I ask him to put forward a considered and thorough program and to argue the case, because it is exactly the type of scheme which the National Water Commission is looking to implement.
In addition to that, the member for Hasluck set out the fact that he has had over 20 years in a national leadership role within the plumbing industry. Water reuse was a matter which he raised in his first speech before the House. As he set out, we must be looking not just at outfalls but also at harvesting stormwater. Those two things together are critical. I commend the member for Maranoa and the member for Hasluck for their contributions.
In summarising the debate and the position of the Australian government, I must say that that government’s position is quite clear. The Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is the first national scheme of its kind anywhere in the world. It means that Australia is leading the world in domestic water conservation. The new system of labels on shower heads, washing machines, toilets, dishwashers, urinals and some types of taps will help consumers choose appliances which use the least water. In that way, individuals can make a difference in their own homes. But, as I have said—and this is a point on which there is cross-partisan agreement—there also has to be major infrastructure work, which the states must carry out but which we are willing to assist with.
Moving on from that, we see that there will be water use standards for all toilets sold in Australia—clear standards which set in place a new basis and a new set of restrictions. Further, we go forward to the fact that water efficient appliances save hot water as well as cold, which reduces both electricity and water bills and also has an impact on greenhouse emissions. Simply by choosing more-efficient appliances, by 2021 the community stands to save more than $600 million in their water and electricity bills and, importantly, a collective total of 610 billion litres in domestic water use Australia wide and approximately 60 billion litres of water in each year approaching 2021. Those are the achievements of this bill.
The scheme has the support of governments around Australia. All states and territories will be introducing complementary legislation to ensure that water efficiency labelling and standards becomes a truly national scheme. I take this opportunity to commend the states and territories for their cooperation, to thank our friends on the other side of the House, to thank members on this side of the House for their contributions and to note that, ultimately, the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Bill 2004 is a quantum step forward in Australia in terms of water conservation. It has to be accompanied by the National Water Commission Bill 2004, and I urge the states to embrace the National Water Initiative and to put forward their National Water Initiative projects through the National Water Commission. Taken together, these two packages represent a critical step forward. I commend the bill to the Committee.
 (Mr Wilkie)—The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Grayndler has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That’ be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.
Question agreed to.
