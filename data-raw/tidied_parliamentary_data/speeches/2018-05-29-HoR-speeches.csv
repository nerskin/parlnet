Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (12:01):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, I present the committee's report entitled Making voices heard: inquiry into the e-petitioning system of the House of Representatives Petitions Committee, together with minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mrs WICKS:
  by leave—Today, I present the report for the inquiry into the e-petitioning system of the House of Representatives Petitions Committee entitled Making voices heard. When e-petitioning was introduced to the House at the commencement of the 45th Parliament, the aim was to engage more Australians in the petition process, many of whom were already used to accessing public services online. With over 300 e-petitions certified at the conclusion of the committee's inquiry, it is clear that the House e-petitions system has been successful in engaging Australians in petitioning the House. The committee's inquiry examined what is working well with the e-petitions system and how the system might be improved and enhanced. In doing so, the committee considered the experiences of jurisdictions around Australia and overseas that have also introduced e-petitioning. 


Most importantly, the committee heard directly from users of the House e-petitions system and spoke with stakeholders interested in the e-petitioning process. Users generally praised the introduction of the e-petitions system but considered there were some aspects of it that could be improved. Much of the feedback, however, focused on how the system could be made simpler and more accessible for all users. 


The committee found it valuable to hear about the experience of e-petitioning in parliaments around Australia and overseas. In particular, the committee extends its thanks to representatives of the parliaments of the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania, who took time to speak to the committee in public hearings. We also heard from a very enthusiastic group of year 5 and year 6 students from St Anthony's Catholic Primary School in Marsfield, Sydney. This was a highlight of the inquiry. It was a delight to hear how the students valued petitioning in the House, and it showed how petitioning can be used even by young Australians. The committee drew on their very helpful suggestions for improving the e-petitions system in formulating some of its recommendations to the House. 


The committee has proposed initial changes designed to improve the user experience of the e-petitions system and provide greater accessibility for all Australians, within current resources. Some issues raised during the inquiry were relevant to the practice and procedures for petitioning the House more broadly. The committee considers that these issues could be explored in a future inquiry into the role of the House Petitions Committee and the procedural framework of petitioning. 


I would like to express my thanks to the deputy chair, the member for Richmond, and also to my colleagues on the committee for their ongoing support of petitioning in the House and for their hard work and professionalism. I also acknowledge the previous chair, the member for Bonner, who launched the inquiry on the committee's behalf.


On behalf of the committee, I warmly extend my thanks to the inquiry participants who prepared submissions and who gave their time to the committee. It was important to hear such informed perspectives from a variety of stakeholders, including individuals, school children, organisations and parliaments from other jurisdictions. On behalf of the Petitions Committee, I thank all Australians who have enthusiastically lodged an e-petition or signed an e-petition to the House. I commend the e-petitions process and this report to the House.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond) (12:05):  by leave—I'm pleased to also be speaking on our Petitions Committee report relating to the inquiry, Making voices heard: inquiry into the e-petitioning system of the House of Representatives Petitions Committee. The inquiry examined the introduction of electronic petitioning and the public's response to it. Petitions generally—in whatever format, paper or electronic—are a really valuable way for individuals and communities to engage with all levels of government about issues that are important to them. In this day and age of increasing social media, it's vitally important that the parliament has adopted e-petitions, because we as parliamentarians know how our interactions with constituents are increasing through all these growing social media platforms.


Electronic petitioning has been discussed for a number of years, as e-petitioning was quite rightly seen as a means of reinvigorating petitioning the House and allowing people to generate support for their petitions online. It was great to see that, after a number of years in development, e-petitioning was introduced during the 45th Parliament. This inquiry allowed the committee to reflect on how the e-petition system has been received by both members of parliament and members of the general public. The committee looked at what was working well with the e-petition system and what could be done to improve that system.


The committee acknowledges all the users of e-petition system, and thanks those who made submissions to the inquiry or took time out to complete the online user survey. The survey received 293 responses. The committee received 18 submissions and two supplementary submissions to the inquiry. The committee held three public hearings in Canberra for the inquiry. As the committee chair referred to, it also included hearing from a group of enthusiastic primary school students via video link from Marsfield in Sydney. It was great to see years 5 and 6 students engaging with the petitions process and the wider workers of the House. The committee also heard from a number of other parliaments about their e-petitions experiences, including from the Scottish Parliament, the House of Commons in Canada, the House of Representatives in New Zealand, the House of Commons in the UK and the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament.


Since the introduction of e-petitioning to this parliament, the number of e-petitions presented to the House has closely matched or exceeded the number of paper petitions over the same period. What a great result that people are embracing it. The committee believes e-petitioning will continue to grow as people use social media and other online platforms to gain support for their causes. The changes to the e-petition system proposed by the committee aim to make submitting or signing an e-petition easier for all users. It is a great initiative in terms of having e-petitioning encouraging all Australians to get more involved their parliament and make their voices heard.


I would like to conclude by thanking the chair, the member for Robertson, and all members of the committee who embraced the opportunities around electronic petitioning. I know all members of the House are committed to improving electronic petitioning. I would also like to thank the secretariat for their work in terms of this inquiry and, indeed, at all times for the committee as well. I think e-petitioning has a great future under this parliament and provides so many more opportunities for the general public to engage with their government.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-05-29,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (12:09):  I was three-quarters of the way through this speech on Thursday when we ran out of time, so I am continuing today. I had been acknowledging the CLAN group of care leavers in my electorate. I had been talking about the impact of the royal commission and, in particular, the impact of the diocese of Sandhurst, which is in my electorate. I had got to the stage in my speech where I was talking about the role of alternative models of redress that were being used by the Victorian Women's Trust and I was about to outline three principles that the Victorian Women's Trust has found useful. They talked about them in their publication The paradox of service. The three main principles that they use are: having a champion in your corner, transparency of institutionalised responses and education about the nature of abuse.


I will take a few minutes to talk about the importance of having a champion in your corner. The Victorian Women's Trust talks about the experience they've had with nuns who have left religious orders. The trust talks about their ability to advocate on behalf of the nuns to get appropriate redress. They said that each of the formerly religious people have been able to rely every step of the way on having an advocate who is trusted and effective in representing their position and in their efforts to gain some personal relief.


The trust also talks about a significant aspect of this experience: religious orders have come some way in profound recognition for past hurt. In a large measure this is because they've not just had to listen in the right spirit to the formerly religious people but also had to deal with trusted brokers with a commitment to see some form of redress. That seems to me to be a really important element in what we're trying do with the survivors that we're addressing today with this redress system: the need to have a champion in your corner—someone who'll stand up for you.


The second principle is the transparency of institutionalised responses. It can't just be done in private. We need public recognition from our institutions that serious hurt has been caused, that they are going to make appropriate changes to the way they do things and that they are going to work with survivors to improve the situation—not just to make it better, but to actually improve the situation. While I understand some of the institutions have gone some way in this regard, I think there is a lot more in terms of humility and in terms of practical signs of sorrow that they could show to our survivors.


The third principle is education about the nature of abuse. Again, this is a major area I think we need to do a whole lot more work on, particularly the major religious institutions. There are many recommendations in the royal commission about what the institutions should do to improve the education, the culture and the understanding within our institutions about what causes abuse, why it happens and to then make the necessary changes that it never ever happens again.


In bringing my comments to a close, I would really like to acknowledge the work of the care leavers in my electorate, to Rhonda and her team—what a fantastic job you've done—and to say how grateful I am for the work that they do. My final comment is to use the dictionary definition of 'redress'. Redress means to rectify, to repair, to cure and to heal. My hope is that, in passing this legislation, we are able to do that in some way to the many, many survivors of our institutions. I'd like to finish by acknowledging, honouring and thanking them for their resilience, their persistence, their empathy, their tolerance, their patience and, most of all, their courage.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (12:13):  With a degree of concern and with a heavy dose of sadness, but ultimately with a complete sense of amazement, I stand here today in support of the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. I've been connected to the issue of those fellow Australians—half a million of them—who grew up in orphanages around Australia for as long as any issue I've been connected with in this place. Indeed, I started my connection with this issue prior to becoming elected to the House of Representatives. I was the preselected candidate for the electorate of Corio when Leonie Sheedy, director of the Care Leavers Australasia Network, affectionately known as CLAN, rang me and told me about this issue. She said I had an obligation to make this a key part of my work in this place and she invited me to become a patron of CLAN. This was out of the blue. I wasn't sure what to make of this phone call, but, after two hours, I absolutely signed up.


The basis on which she said I had a particular obligation to become a patron of CLAN was the particular story of Geelong—the city on which my electorate is based—as to those who grew up in orphanages. There were more orphanages in Geelong than in any other non-capital city in Australia. That means, I suppose, that today there is a higher proportion of those who have grown up in orphanages in my electorate than in perhaps any other in the country. The issue of those people who have been in orphanages and the abuse that they have suffered is a national story, but there is a very strong Geelong story which is a part of it. It became clear to me that being a patron of CLAN was something that I needed to do.


It was also a point of connection with an existing member of the class of 2007, Jason Clare, the member for Blaxland, who also knew Leonie Sheedy and became a patron of CLAN at the same time. Very quickly, Jason and I teamed up in providing advocacy around this issue. Now there are many people in this place and in the other place who are patrons of CLAN.


Those who grew up in orphanages suffered sexual abuse, as has been outlined by the royal commission. But it was more than that. People were removed from their families—often from situations of no more than simple poverty—and placed in large institutions where there was an absence of familial love. The point that Leonie made to me is that the overwhelming, consistent feature that has been experienced by everyone who has grown up in an orphanage is that: an absence of familial love—not being seen as being special to anyone, which is at the heart of a healthy childhood and something that those of us who have grown up in families take completely for granted.


In 2009, along with Steve Irons, the member for Swan, and Senator Claire Moore, we worked with the minister for family and community services at the time, the member for Jagajaga, on having an apology made to the forgotten Australians and the former child migrants. This occurred in 2009 in this building, and it was a remarkable day—a day soaked with tears, but a day on which, for the first time, people who had horrendous stories, which they had been telling all their lives and which, by and large, had not been listened to, finally were acknowledged as having told the truth.


In November 2012, the then Gillard government followed up the apology by announcing the establishment of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The final report of that royal commission was handed down in December of last year. It recommends the establishment of a national redress scheme, which is, of course, the subject of the bill that we are debating today.


The royal commission was a remarkable phenomenon for the country and for those who participated in it, many of whom I have spoken to. It was a place of pain. It was an unexpected place, which took this story in directions that none of us thought it would go. But ultimately it was a place of healing. The ability to have individual stories told and listened to and acted upon was deeply powerful. To this day, I think that the royal commission stands as one of the lasting achievements of the Gillard government.


So, as I stand here today, I'm filled with emotion. I'm filled with emotion about the journey that it has taken to get to this point. I'm filled with emotion in thinking about the people who I've met along the way—people who, when you look at the cards that they were dealt in life, were given a horrendous set of options for their life and yet faced up to them with enormous bravery and determination and, in the process, changed our nation. They are the bravest people I have met in this role. They are the people from whom I have taken the most inspiration in what I do here. This makes this debate that's going on in the House today enormously significant.


I do have mixed emotions, because there are aspects of this legislation which are not perfect. The quantum which is being provided via this legislation is $50,000 less than that which was recommended by the royal commission. It's a pity that the full $200,000 was not provided as the cap. The indexation provision for those people who have received payouts via other actions previously feels unfair. That indexation over a number of years, measured against what payment may be available through this process, may see some people getting not much at all. It would be better if that were changed. Part of the story, very sadly, of those who have grown up in orphanages, those who have suffered sexual abuse as children, is the path that it set them on in their lives, and often that is a path that has led to incarceration for themselves. It is a very significant number. It is a community that is overrepresented in our custodial institutions, and that people with significant criminal records will be prevented from gaining compensation through this redress scheme is also a pity. It denies a fundamental justice to people who started their lives with profound bad luck. The other point to make—and it goes back to the terms of reference for the royal commission to begin with—is that this only relates to people who have suffered sexual abuse. There were, of course, so many other forms of abuse which occurred for people in orphanages, and they are not part of this scheme.


That said, this redress scheme, and that it will be happening on 1 July this year, is hugely significant. It is a hugely significant moment, and I can barely believe that, from the time that Leonie Sheedy first said to me that this is what needed to occur, and it seemed to me unlikely that it ever would, we stand here in this place in a bipartisan way, knowing that a national redress scheme will be in place from 1 July this year for those who grew up in orphanages who suffered child sexual abuse. Of all that I've seen in this place over the last decade, that is as remarkable a set of events and as remarkable an achievement as I have witnessed, and I spend a moment to contemplate that.


I want to acknowledge the Minister for Social Services, the member for Wannon, for what he has done in bringing the redress scheme to a point of conclusion, to a point of operation. He deserves credit. I want to acknowledge the member for Jagajaga. From the outset, she was the person who carried the policy debate. She did so with wisdom and practicality, but she did so with an enormous sense of purpose, and her judgements in dealing with difficult issues were done with a sincerity and an integrity which represent a form of inspiration, I think, for all of us in this place who seek to represent Australians through the political process. She is an inspiration for our calling.


I want to acknowledge Leonie Sheedy, who is the head of CLAN. She is a force of nature. Her own story is tragic, and she has had her own personal demons to deal with throughout her life, and it would have been understandable if it had taken her down a more destructive road. But instead she has created a phenomenon. She is compassionate, she is generous, she has empathy, she has determination, and the number of hours that she has spent listening to the stories of those who have suffered renders her an angel. The achievement of the national redress scheme is as much hers as it is that of any person in this nation, and she deserves to be very much acknowledged at this moment.


But I want, finally, to remember her brother Anthony Sheedy, because Anthony is a person who will miss out. Anthony was dealt just the most appalling set of cards during his life in orphanages, and this was detailed in a wonderful piece written by Danny Lannen in the Geelong Advertiser. He says Anthony:


… became state ward 69411 and his 16-year journey to adulthood was spent within 10 institutions, including Geelong's St Augustine's boys home.


He entered these institutions at the age of two. Anthony tells this story from when he was 12:


""I first saw my parents at 12 years when they came to see me at St Augustine's. I didn't believe the Christian brother who told me to go upstairs to get dressed to see your parents.


""I said no because I didn't think they were my real parents. So I got the strap by the Brother and forced by his hand to go to the front door.


""My mother said 'Why are you crying?' I said 'Brother hit me for being naughty', as this is what the Brother had told me to say.""


That was not the beginning, at the age of 12, of a wonderful homecoming: Anthony's parents left that day and he stayed at St Augustine's. He continued to live there.


Danny takes the story up again of Anthony, aged 15. He said:


He told of being held in solitary confinement at Melbourne's Turana home, forced to sleep on a mattress with no blanket, and of being transferred as a young teen by train from Turana to Bendigo Training Centre in handcuffs.


He told of beatings and sexual abuse by fellow state wards and the people charged with his care …


That began a life that Anthony lived on the edge. For 30 years—for 30 years!—he didn't see any of his siblings. It was a life that was soaked with alcohol, which he ultimately weaned himself off in his late 40s because he had seen so many others go down a path of ultimate destruction by pursuing the drink. He said:


""My life has been terrible. I have been lonely just about all my life until I was 62 years old.


It was at that age that he opened, after six months, a letter that had been sent by his sister Leonie, who was in search of him. It gave him nine years of comfort, a number of which were spent volunteering in my office. The person we knew was actually cheeky, he was cheerful, he was diligent, he was a keen supporter of the Geelong Football Club, he loved Frank Sinatra and he loved talking about Frank. In fact, he would continue to talk as much as we would let him talk.


On 22 June 2011, Anthony died very suddenly. He died on the very day that a letter, sent by his lawyers, for a settlement conference for compensation had arrived at his house. He will not get compensation. He is one of thousands of those who grew up in orphanages for whom 1 July is too late. This is a day on which we need to remember Anthony and everyone like him. Ultimately, for its failings, this scheme is a huge achievement for this country; it will make an enormous difference for thousands of Australians. In the process, though, today I remember Anthony Sheedy.

Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (12:28):  I join with many colleagues in this place to talk on the National Redress Scheme, and I want to commend the member for Corio for his contribution. Anthony's story is one of many, many, many that men and women have told. Anthony is one of many who went through appalling abuse in our orphanages and our institutions whom we have lost and for whom this compensation scheme, this redress scheme, comes too late. It is their voices we hear echoing through this chamber, and it is important that we have resolve to get this done.


My community of Ballarat, of course, knows too well the legacy of child sexual abuse. There have been countless cases highlighted through the royal commission. The Ballarat cases warranted their own part of the commission's inquiry, their own booklet as part of the inquiry, as there were so many of them. There will be others who have never come forward to this day and have never spoken about their abuse, and there are many others who we have lost to suicide or early death. Our community has had an incredibly deep hurt inflicted through its heart, a hurt that lingers to this day and will take generations to heal. Child sexual abuse hurts everyone in a community. It affects every one of us, from the children growing to adults through to their children and their partners. It affects our police, our welfare workers and our teachers—all of us. That is why the royal commission has been so important: shining a light on what has occurred and providing a powerful symbol to the many, many survivors, that they are heard and believed across the breadth and the depth of this nation—that we believe you.


At hearings across the country, the royal commission heard from tens of thousands of Australians and shone a light on a shameful part of our history—a part of our history that has been ignored and denied for too long. In Ballarat I attended these hearings and I saw personally both the hurt and the strength of those who told their stories. I echo the member for Corio's words, that these men and women are some of the bravest people I know. There was the sight of some of these men attending Rome when Cardinal George Pell had been unable, or unwilling, to attend Australia to be part of those hearings. The survivors in Ballarat went to Rome to highlight that case and to speak with him, to encourage him to come and tell what he knew. They are some of the bravest people I know.


Of course, when Prime Minister Gillard established the royal commission, it was more than about symbols. It was established to provide redress and to make changes across all policy areas to ensure the protection of children and to make sure this does not happen again. In recognition of this important role, the commission deliberately handed down an interim report on redress so that the policy work on implementing such a scheme was not delayed. While this legislation has been a long time coming, it's an important step. And while I respect the complexity of negotiating such a scheme on behalf of the many people of my electorate who this affects directly, it would be remiss of me not to point out its shortcomings.


This is not the redress scheme recommended by the royal commission. When I talk to survivors, there are several things that they tell me. One is that the constant retelling of their stories to health professional after health professional and counsellor after counsellor perpetuates the harm. They need ongoing, lifelong access to counselling and other health services that provide them with dignity and continuity of care. They need recognition financially that many have lost jobs, housing and financial security—if they were ever able to get these in the first place—and it's been a direct result of the trauma that they experienced. This scheme does some of that, but falls well short of what many in the community need and expected.


While we are still trying from this side to seek improvements to this legislation, we are deeply conscious that many survivors have already been waiting too long and that the scheme is due to start on 1 July. My criticisms of the scheme are already on record, but they include, firstly, the government's decision to allow states and institutions to opt in, which, in essence, handed over all of the negotiating power to them. It's resulted in the Commonwealth having to make substantial concessions to get them into the scheme. We still do not have all states or institutions in.


There is no excuse for any of these bodies not to sign up to this scheme. No institution could possibly justify a decision not to offer the redress that means so much to more than 60,000 survivors of institutional sexual abuse. The failure of some institutions to sign up to the scheme adds a further hurdle to many survivors. The failure of some institutions means that, despite no recommendation from the royal commission, the government's bill states that only one application to the redress scheme can be made for each survivor. That means that some survivors may have to make the difficult choice of whether to delay pursuing a claim in the hope that all institutions responsible for the abuse sign up, or deciding to access redress when only one or some of them have opted in. This would be a particularly difficult decision for the survivors who are nearing the later years of their lives.


Secondly, one of the concessions that the government has made to get states and institutions into the scheme has resulted in the maximum cap for redress claims being watered down. Whereas the royal commission recommended a $200,000 maximum for redress claims, the bills before the House specifically say that the maximum available will be $150,000. This amount is important not only because of the possibility that the amount of redress offers but because those who accept an offer of redress made under the scheme will lose their right to make a civil claim against the institutions responsible for their abuse. I've heard countless stories of survivors of abuse who have never been able to work or who have in later years lost jobs and businesses and are suffering from significant financial insecurity. While redress is not a compensation scheme, it should also not be so low as to afford little recognition of this harm. The issue of indexation of previous payments made is also of significant concern, meaning that there will be some recipients who are entitled to redress actually ending up receiving absolutely nothing, because of the indexation of past payments.


One of the more contentious measures of the original legislation has been improved but is still of concern. The government has now allowed that people imprisoned for five years or more may be considered eligible for the scheme so long as providing the person with redress does not bring the scheme into disrepute. As someone who spent the early part of their career working with people in prisons and youth training centres, I get it—they have often done terrible acts and committed unforgivable crimes—but I also know that very few of them that I worked with had not experienced some form of abuse, some of them sexual abuse, while in the care of institutions. There is considerable evidence that a history of childhood abuse and trauma can increase the likelihood that an adult will engage in criminal behaviour. The later decisions and crimes of these survivors do nothing to negate the abuse that they as innocent children suffered. This childhood trauma may have been a significant cause that led to their later crimes. These bills seek to potentially deny them justice and redress.


Thirdly, the bills also go against the recommendations of the royal commission regarding access to counselling. The commission recommended access to counselling and psychological care be provided for the rest of their lives if required and not be limited to a lump sum payment. These bills fall far short of this. The bills state that either counselling will be provided through an existing state service for the life of the scheme or a payment for counselling of up to $5,000 will be made to the survivor. This is one of the key areas I think the government needs to rethink. Survivors who've suffered abuse at the hands of state-run institutions may not be able to or wish to use state- or institution-run services. This needs to be taken into account by states when delivering these services. In such a case, the $5,000 payment will not be adequate to provide access to lifelong support. As I said at the commencement of my contribution, it is this issue that is so important to ensuring the future health and wellbeing of survivors. The government has not got this right in this legislation. It is deeply unfair and it does not recognise the incredible harm done.


Labor has long argued that the recommendations of the royal commission should be implemented as intended and that no changes be made that limit the benefits the scheme offers to survivors around Australia. In light of these many concerns, Labor has referred these bills to a Senate inquiry so that the community can be consulted more thoroughly before a vote is taken. As a gesture of good faith in our ongoing discussions with the government to resolve these concerns and in acknowledgement of our longstanding commitment to the establishment of a national redress scheme, Labor will support, as the member for Jagajaga said, the bills in the House today, but we need to do much better.


On 24 May in my local newspaper, the Ballarat Courier, some survivors spoke about their disappointment with the redress scheme. As I conclude my contribution I want to quote from that so that their voices are heard here in this chamber. Gary Sculley said:


The redress is quite poor in a way, going against a lot of the Royal Commission recommendations and whittling it down to the point where it is insulting.


…   …   …


Survivors are put in a position now where it's basically take the redress, go away and die; it is appalling …


Stephen Woods said that there is so much frustration and anger. He said:


The survivors and families … we are all still holding on.


Like so many others, my life has been a small percentage of the potential I have, of what I could have achieved.


They are important words for us to hear. Whilst I don't want to underestimate the moment that we have here of actually achieving a national redress scheme, I have to speak for the many voices of the men and women of my community who have been so deeply affected. This isn't the scheme that the royal commission recommended. We do need to do better, particularly in the area of access to counselling and other healthcare services for the lives of these men and women. We know many of them have been deeply traumatised by what happened and are deeply traumatised still to this day. Every day of the commission, and every day this is debated in this place, more and more of them talk about the harm done. They are exhausted by the process. They want us to get this done, but they also want to make sure that what we do is right by them.


As I say, whilst we'll support these bills, it's important for us to hear where the scheme needs to be improved, and it's important for us to hear the words of the many survivors. It's important for us to remember that, whilst the commission has done its work and it's concluded its work, ours has only just started and we still have a very long way to go. I thank the House.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (12:40):  I rise today to contribute also to this important debate on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and the associated National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. Together these bills establish a national redress scheme which, to a very large extent, mirrors the recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, an inquiry that was established by the former Gillard Labor government back in 2012 to investigate decades of the most appalling sexual abuse and terrible violence in institutions across Australia.


I want to acknowledge at the outset that, if it were not for the courage, tenacity and persistence of survivors, this royal commission would not have happened and we would not be standing here debating the creation of a national redress scheme in the Australian parliament today. To the survivors, I want to say: while we took far too long to respond to your pain and suffering, to expose the nature and extent of the systemic violence, abuse and cover-ups, and to ensure that your voices were heard and believed, the establishment of a national redress scheme is a critical part of the healing process for both you and, indeed, our nation. The scheme before the parliament today will give victims and survivors of child sexual abuse access to three elements of redress, including a monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services, and the opportunity to have a direct personal apology from the institution responsible for the abuse.


The life and work of the royal commission is deeply embedded in the Newcastle and Hunter region. In communities that I and my neighbouring Labor colleagues live in and represent, there are few who don't know somebody who bears the scars of this appalling abuse, perpetrated by the very organisations that should have protected them as children. Indeed, a lot of the reporting that helped build the case for the royal commission was printed over many years in the pages of my local newspaper, the Newcastle Herald. Much of that was written by the Herald journalist Joanne McCarthy, who pursued one of the most formidable investigations of abuse on behalf of local victims and survivors. Over many hundreds of articles, Ms McCarthy documented terrible cases of both abhorrent abuse and callous, cynical cover-ups by many of the most respected people in some of the most trusted institutions in our community. This truly was journalism at its finest, and in today's era of fake news we must never forget the critically important role that a free press has in shining a light in the darkest corners of our society and calling wrongdoers to account.


The shocking cases that were uncovered by Ms McCarthy, along with revelations from a local detective inspector, Peter Fox, contributed significantly to the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's decision to launch the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in November 2012. This was a marathon campaign, and I again pay my tributes to all of those people who found the courage to speak out at a time when their voices were at best questioned and, indeed, many times rebuked.


In launching the royal commission, Prime Minister Gillard gave a voice to the tens of thousands of survivors of abuse, who not only had their childhoods ripped away from them but who had been repeatedly accused of malice or deceit when they dared to speak out. The royal commission allowed survivors to tell their stories, without judgement, for the first time. In doing so, it lifted the veil of secrecy and revealed shameful systemic abuse, enabled by an insidious culture of cover-ups that lay deep at the heart of so many religious institutions, not-for-profit bodies and state care providers and agencies.


Since 2012, more than 16,000 people have made contact with the commission and it heard more than 8,000 personal stories face to face. It is a dangerous path to single out any voice in that royal commission but I do want to pay a special tribute to former Anglican bishop Greg Thompson, who, in the course of his duty of trying to take care of a diocese reeling from the trauma that was being spoken of on a daily basis in front of the royal commission and in our media, revealed that he too was a victim of child sexual abuse—had been groomed through the Anglican Church and abused by the very people in the diocese he later came to govern as bishop. I raise that case because Bishop Greg Thompson knows full well the impact of people who questioned your motives for talking about that abuse. He was dealt great resistance from the diocese he represented. It is to my great sorrow and regret that we, as a community, were clearly unable to provide him with enough support to remain in that role. He has now retired and I have no doubt he will go on to ensure that justice and redress are sought, and he'll continue that work in many ways. It is one example of just how difficult cultural change comes in these institutions, that we were unable to lend the support required for him to retain his role when he dared speak up, when he drew a line saying zero tolerance to sexual abuse in the diocese of Newcastle. When he insisted that the culture of the Anglican diocese had to change, the resistance and pushback he felt were astonishing.


My community is now under the leadership of a new bishop, who, thankfully, shares many of those concerns. I know he will be working tirelessly to ensure that the diocese of Newcastle is reformed so that the culture that enabled that abuse to take place, that enabled that silence to be normalised in some way, is intolerable. The community will not stand for it any more and the church must change. They know that and I know they are making serious attempts to do that. But everybody is on notice that the entire community is watching very carefully the institutional cultural changes that must happen.


As a result of the royal commission, more than 2,500 individuals were reported to authorities and it's estimated there are some 60,000 victims and survivors of abuse that occurred in as many as 4,000 institutions across the country. Those figures are just staggering. The extent and the scale of that systemic abuse is truly shocking. This was reiterated in the final report, which stretches to tens of thousands of pages across 17 volumes and contains more than 400 recommendations. Eighty-two of the final recommendations related directly to the establishment of a national redress scheme as a fundamental right of survivors and a critical part of the healing process.


As I mentioned earlier, the courage of survivors who shared their stories cannot be overstated. Their contribution to calling out and putting an end to appalling systemic abuse will never be forgotten. Now, it is time for justice to be delivered. While no-one suggests that the redress scheme can make up for the pain and trauma of the past, it will lay foundations; it is the start of our making amends. In establishing this scheme, we must be unswervingly focused on ensuring that every decision we make is in the best interests of the victims and survivors of this abuse. That is the prism through which we must consider this bill and all of the work we do in this space. I understand that the bill before us today is the outcome of negotiated agreements with the New South Wales and Victorian governments. It will supersede the earlier Commonwealth legislation. Every state, aside from Western Australia, has now signed up to the scheme, which is excellent news. The scheme, of course, only works if it is truly national. I again welcome the calls this morning from some of the Anglican churches and others who are urging all of their groups across the nation to sign up to this scheme.


Labor was first to announce support for a national redress scheme when it was recommended by the royal commission's interim report back in 2015. We know that the victims and survivors of child sexual abuse in institutions waited decades for that royal commission, and we know that they should not be waiting any longer than necessary for an adequate and just scheme to be put in place. As previous speakers have said before me, whilst Labor will be supporting the bills before us, it is not without concern and there are some very real areas that need further investigation, on behalf of government, to make this redress scheme the very best it can be. One of those areas is the issue around the maximum redress value. We know the royal commission recommended that be set at $200,000. This bill only allows for a monetary value of $150,000. I remain unconvinced by the government's argument that this can't be revisited, and I would strongly urge some rethinking in this area.


Likewise, the issue of indexation is proving to be extremely problematic for survivors. Certainly, under this bill, any payment offered under the redress scheme would take into account any payments received for institutional child sexual abuse. Whilst that component is fair, the notion that we would somehow be indexing those payments over time has very real implications for survivors, where we may in fact end up in a situation where there is virtually nothing left in the redress scheme for those people. A payment indexed annually for decades-old payments could see survivors ending up with a pittance, and that would be an unjust outcome. I don't think anybody in this chamber thinks that's a fair outcome. That needs some rethinking from the government. On the time frames for acceptance, I'd also like to see the government reconsider the period of time that survivors are given to decide whether to accept a redress offer or not. While the royal commission recommended a year, this bill only allows for six months.


The other area of concern for Labor is the decision that survivors who have been given a custodial sentence of five years or more must apply for special permission in order to access the scheme. We believe this is unfair. I know that there are some very difficult cases that the redress scheme will have to deal with; I've no doubt about that. As much of the evidence made clear in the royal commission, people weren't offenders when they were children; they were just children who were sexually abused and they went on to lead lives of great trauma. For many, many reasons, there is an incredibly disproportionate group of survivors of child sexual abuse who now find themselves in the criminal justice system. The idea of somehow excluding those people from the redress scheme is unfair and problematic, and I think that the government would do well to revisit that decision


The final issue I now raise relates to the provision of counselling. Under the royal commission's recommendations, survivors would have access to counselling and psychological services for as long as they need. I cannot stress enough the importance of that. People need lifetime access, because we have no idea whether people are going to need access in six months time or 10 years time. That should be available to people in the same way as we don't ask veterans to put a time limit on post-traumatic stress; we enable free and lifelong access. The same privilege should be afforded to victims of child sexual abuse. I trust the government will work with Labor on all these matters and also the issue of the funder of last resort. We will support this bill but will continue to work tirelessly with the government for a fairer and more just outcome for victims of child sexual abuse.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (12:55):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate, as this issue about the effect that child sexual abuse in institutions around this country has had has been something that I have worked with survivors in my own electorate to address, discuss and shed light upon. I was incredibly proud to stand as part of the Gillard government in 2013 when we announced the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Many people had been calling for this for some time. Quite frankly, once we saw the outcome of that royal commission, as the evidence and information provided started to snowball, it galvanised everyone's view that this was so important, timely and critical. Over five years the commission held 57 public hearings over 44 days, and heard evidence from more than 1,300 witnesses.


I need to place on record here thanks to all of those that shared their personal stories. It is really hard to talk about yourself. As politicians we come in here and advocate on behalf of others; it is much more confronting to talk about your own personal experiences, especially when they are such private experiences that have been associated with such difficulties, personal shame and a whole range of other emotions. It is so difficult to talk about those, and I need to acknowledge here in this place those survivors that got up and were able to share their stories. When I spoke to a number of those survivors, I found that their motivation wasn't for themselves; it was to make sure that this never happened again, that no other child had to endure what they had to endure. I think that needs to be placed on the record—that this was for many a very brave and difficult moment, motivated by not only telling their story and seeking justice for themselves but also trying to make sure that this never happened again. I would like to thank on record all of those that were brave enough to tell their story.


I would also like to thank all those advocates who, even before the royal commission, had been advocating so powerfully for these stories to come out, for government to do something to address the wrongs of the past. Many organisations have been part of that. CLAN, led by Leonie Sheedy, has been one of those. They have done an amazing job at ensuring that governments dealt with this issue instead of forgetting it, ignoring it or pushing it under the carpet. I place on record my great thanks to them because, as a result of their bravery and advocacy, we now have these important pieces of legislation before the House today.


The National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018 are critically important, and I am very pleased to be supporting them today. I am pleased that the majority of states and territories have come on board. It does need to be a national redress scheme, so I would absolutely urge that the government continues to negotiate with those states that have not signed up and that it continues to pursue this. We need a truly national redress scheme. We also need a redress scheme that is in line with the recommendation of the royal commission. Labor were very clear once the recommendation came out from the royal commission that we supported a national redress scheme. We were very clear about it, and that is why we want to work constructively with the government to make sure that it comes to fruition. 


Labor has some concerns, and I certainly have some concerns, with the current bill. In particular, most of us are concerned about the limitation on access to counselling for the survivors. I think anyone who listened to the stories that were presented to the royal commission and who spoke with any of those individuals would have to acknowledge that this abuse has had lifelong consequences. It has affected many, many aspects of those individuals' lives. There is grief that comes with it about 'what could have been'. 'What could my life have been like without this terrible situation that happened to me?' 'What have I lost as a result?' It is a deeply difficult issue to deal with. I don't think it's too much to ask that those individuals get proper access to counselling in a way that actually helps them address the issues that they face. Therefore, I absolutely understand that the royal commission did recommend that recipients of redress be able to access counselling for the rest of their life. However, this bill only provides access to state-provided services for the length of the scheme or a payment of up to $5,000 to be put towards counselling. 


As I have said, these circumstances are woefully inadequate. I certainly join with the shadow minister and the rest of Labor to call on the government to give assurances that this will be addressed. I think survivors often consider that government is responsible for their abuse and do not wish to use state or institution-run services, and this does need to be taken into account by the states when delivering services. This is something which we do need to work on with our state colleagues to address. For survivors who receive the $5,000 payment, this amount of money will not provide adequate access to services. So I call on the government and urge the government, as previous speakers have done, to seriously address this issue. We need to seriously look at the upper limit that we place on the amount of redress. The upper limit set by this bill is $150,000. The royal commission recommends that the maximum payment be $200,000. I guess we need to understand the logic that the government has made for not implementing the full recommendation. Why aren't we seeing the royal commission's recommendation in full and why aren't we seeing the maximum payment of $200,000? 


Also, we have concerns that the bill gives applicants only six months to make this decision, while the royal commission recommends a year. Once again, it is unclear as to why the government has chosen this limit. I think we do need to acknowledge that, for many people, this is a deeply distressing process. It is difficult to take that first step, to take the second step or to take the third step in the redress process. So, limiting this time does put, I think, a large amount of pressure on individuals that is just not necessary. Why will the government not just accept the royal commission's 12-month period? There are a number of other issues that have been raised, and certainly I support Labor's concerns in this regard. We want to see the government work in way in which we can actually achieve a really good step towards a truly national redress scheme. 


In conclusion, I want to draw the House's attention to an area that was a direct result of the Commonwealth's mismanagement. A lot of the institutionalised sexual abuse that we saw was in churches and other religious institutions, as well as in state-run institutions. But, of course, the royal commission also looked into and examined the Department of Defence, and the ADF's responses to allegations of child sexual abuse at some of the institutions that were directly operated by the Commonwealth and the ADF. They concluded that from the 1960s to 1972 the system of management at HMAS Leeuwin was ineffective in preventing and responding to child sexual abuse. The Royal Navy failed in its duty to care for junior recruits who were children.


It was also found that there was a failure to adequately address harmful bullying conduct and that the culture of intimidation by older apprentices and staff represented a failure in duty of care by the Army to provide a safe environment for junior apprentices at the Australian Army Apprentices School at Balcombe. Further, during the 1970s and 1980s the system of management at Balcombe was ineffective in preventing and responding to abuse, a failure in management which allowed sexual abuse to occur.


At the time of the public hearing of the royal commission, the approach taken by DVA in assessing claims for child abuse at these two locations was incorrect in requiring assessors to reject any claim that was not supported by independently corroborated evidence. Following the hearing, Defence confirmed that DVA had put into effect a new policy for determining claims for child abuse. So we can see that evidence that occurred in the royal commission about abuse that happened directly as a result of the Commonwealth's mismanagement has now led to a change in process, and that is critically important in moving forward.


The royal commission also found that the impact of abuse on these individuals has been lifelong and severe, and include physical injury, mental illness, suicide attempts, alcohol abuse and broken relationships. It found that, since at least 2000, policy guidelines and training manuals of the ADF cadets were incomplete and misleading in regard to the legal age of consent and the effect of special care provisions.


We have seen, really, that not only was it the states and territories in their responsibilities, and also that of private institutions, but, indeed, that the Commonwealth itself did let those under its care down. They let those under its care down, and this royal commission and the redress scheme are critically important to setting those wrongs right. It is incumbent, I think, on all of us to continue to ensure that this is not a set-and-forget policy, that we continue to recognise the impact of what past behaviour has had on individuals—the continuing lifelong impact that has had. We must continue as a parliament and as a nation to recognise this and to ensure that we do everything in our power to say sorry and also, importantly, to bring in a national redress scheme that actually goes some way in this. We can never change the past and we can never make up for all the damage that has been done, but if we get this redress scheme right—if we make sure that it's truly national and that it's in line with the royal commission's recommendations—then we can go some way in saying that we got it wrong but we're trying to make amends. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (13:09):  I'm proud to rise and make a contribution to the debate on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. Over the last five years we have heard about the most heartbreaking of stories, from the bravest of people, at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. I, like my colleagues in parliament, want to make it clear that we believe them. We know they were victims of horrible crimes, we know they were let down by people in institutions that were meant to keep them safe and we know that they deserve adequate redress for this. The persistence and strength that they have shown in this fight has been an inspiration, and we commit to dutifully providing a national redress scheme that recognises the injustices that they have suffered, the struggle they have gone through to get here and be heard, and the tough road that lies ahead for so many. That's why Labor will work with survivors and the government to implement legislation that realises the recommendations of the royal commission and acknowledges the hardship of so many survivors. This must be a scheme that is inclusive, accessible and adequate. It would be offensive to the courage shown throughout this process and to the hard work which paved the way to a royal commission to accept anything less.


In 2013, the Gillard Labor government took responsibility and created the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and I'm proud to be able to thank my predecessor, Greg Combet, the tireless activism of dedicated Hunter locals and of course Ms Gillard for this achievement. In June of that year, Prime Minister Gillard put aside what was a chaotic moment in Australian politics to focus on an issue that she knew was more important. After years of Australian governments ignoring mounting evidence, the Gillard government took action. Members in that government still cite this royal commission as one of their most important moments and one of their proudest legacies. None has been more stalwart in their pursuit of justice in parliament than the member for Jagajaga. I know how proud she is of what this movement has achieved and how deeply she cares for the thousands who have been let down in this country over the years. This parliament is united in its recognition that the creation of the royal commission was one of the most significant moments in our history. To those who worked so hard for so long—like Julia and Jenny, and like so many survivors—we are grateful.


However, these fighters and gutsy survivors have been quick to remind us of our responsibility, saying that the hard work of those who came before us was not for show, and that, while the chance to tell their story and be heard was a welcome relief, the job was not done yet. We have a duty to this nation and to those who bravely shared their experience with the royal commission to deliver real justice and appropriate redress. The Labor Party established this commission. We have supported it throughout the process. And we will not be giving up now. We have a chance here today to deliver on the promise of the royal commission, to turn appreciation and belief into action, and I look forward to working with the government to address a national redress scheme which achieves these outcomes.


I turn now to the Hunter, because the truth is: this process has impacted the Hunter region as much as anywhere else and more than most. As a community, we've been shocked by the extent of, and the lack of response to, child sexual abuse right on our doorstep. One of the most shocking stories of abuse in our region was that of the crimes committed by James Patrick Fletcher, a priest who preyed on young boys in the Hunter for decades. We now know that this abuse was allowed to take place thanks to a culture of cover-ups and deceit that permeated the entire diocese of Maitland-Newcastle for many years.


In 1976, Peter Creigh reported the abuse he had suffered at the hands of Mr Fletcher to the then priest, and later Archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson. Mr Wilson not only concealed this abuse from the authorities but also allowed Mr Fletcher to continue working as a priest with boys in that area. This not only saw Fletcher avoid professional criminal consequences for his actions but in fact allowed him to continue abusing young boys in the Hunter for years to come. The royal commission has shown us that that is an all-too-familiar pattern, and that the culture of protecting child abusers has permeated institutions in this country to the highest of levels.


Last Tuesday in Newcastle, Archbishop Wilson was found guilty of concealing these crimes in a courtroom populated by many who should have been spared the abuse that was allowed to continue. He is the world's highest-ranking Catholic official ever convicted of concealing child sexual abuse and did so in my home region of the Hunter. In the verdict handed down last week, the magistrate said of Mr Wilson: 'You have to ask why the accused did not do what he himself says he would do now'—that is, to go to the police—'in the same situation. The answer, I believe, relates to the accused having a sense of knowing what he was hearing was a credible allegation. In addition, the accused wanted to protect the church and its image.' As Daniel Feenan put it on the steps outside court: 'If this bloke had done something in 1976, which was the year that I was born, my life would have been a lot different to what it is today.'


My thanks go to former detective Peter Fox for his hard work in putting James Fletcher behind bars and for his continued work in this area which led to the New South Wales special commission of inquiry which was the predecessor of the royal commission. To him and the current Strike Force Lantle police for their investigation and prosecution of these crimes, I and many in the Hunter are grateful. I also want to acknowledge the tireless work of the Newcastle Herald, Joanne McCarthy and their Shine the Light team.


The frequency and severity of this abuse has been so damaging to so many in our region. I want to pay tribute to the commission for giving these survivors a platform to share their experience and shine a light into these dark corners. It is because of this that we're now able to begin a process of healing and to reach out to our neighbours, friends and family to support each other.


In late 2012 more than 400 Hunter residents attended a forum of what became known as 60 years of shame for the region in terms of child sexual abuse. Tracey Pirona was there to tell a story of her husband John who took his own life months earlier. John was one of 12 others who is no longer with us due to the actions of a single priest. Tracey's words painted a familiar picture.


That man alone—


the priest—


… changed the path of John's life from such a young age and teachers and principals knew what was happening to these children and they condoned it by not reporting it …


On the royal commission's website you can read thousands of stories of abuse, neglect and betrayal in institutions across this country. I would like to share one of these now from the Central Coast, another part of my electorate damaged by such abuse.


After suffering sexual abuse at the hands of her father, and subsequently being forced to live in unsafe conditions which saw her badly burned by a family friend, Corrine was made a ward of the state. She was sent to a children's group home on the Central Coast of New South Wales at the age of 11. Corrine and many others at the home were forced to perform sexual acts on other children and forced to assault other children due to a lack of supervision and a lack of security in that home. Corrine was placed into foster care at the age of 14 where she was again repeatedly sexually abused by one of her guardians. She left this home and nobody from community services supervised where she was or checked on her wellbeing at the age of 14. As a teenager, she had two children to her husband who also abused her, and she eventually fell into an addiction of painkillers. Corrine has struggled with suicide ideas and has continued to live with anxiety. For Corrine a chance to speak openly about her experiences helps her heal after such a long period of trauma. This story paints a picture of constant failure of institutions to provide the care and protection that she was entitled to. This betrayal has stayed with Corrine, who said to the commission:


No-one has ever, ever said sorry for what happened to me in care when I was a child. I was supposed to be looked after.


The royal commission has methodically exposed institutional abuse in our nation, in churches and in schools by coaches and by carers to boys and to girls.


These stories from the Hunter, from the Central Coast and from communities around Australia turn feelings of hopelessness and fear into solidarity and anger. A public that looked the other way for too long has taken notice and is demanding action. That is what we are here to do now. We're in this parliament to take action and respond to these irrefutable findings. This legislation must not fail survivors. Having finally heard their stories, this is now our first chance to start the process of change, to demonstrate that institutions in this country will do what it takes to make sure we do not let them down again.


Labor looks forward to the findings of the Senate inquiry into this legislation, but there are some initial concerns worth highlighting. We want to make sure that any legislation guarantees support services are accessible, regardless of where a survivor lives or what language they speak. We want this bill, as it stands, to bring some measures into line with the recommendations of the commission. As it stands, survivors would have six months to decide whether to accept an offer to of redress, despite the royal commission recommending a year. The bill offers a limit of $150,000 for survivors compared to the $200,000 called for. Legislation must not be limited, as it currently would be, to Australian citizens or those living in Australia. This ignores the large number of child migrants and the abuse of children in immigration detention. I want to also say the legislation must be fair to those with criminal records.


We know from evidence to the royal commission, from experts in the field and from undeniable statistics that suffering abuse such as these people have often leads to addiction, to mental health issues and to crime. On this basis, to exclude people let down by a system meant to protect them is totally unacceptable. We must be brave. We must go beyond a fear of a few tabloid headlines about providing compensation to people who have been in prison to recognise that this abuse has led to addiction and has led to massive mental health issues, and the inevitable result of that is criminal convictions. We must provide redress and we must provide justice to all survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, even if they have gone to prison. I urge the Senate inquiry to give this issue particular consideration so that all survivors have access to compensation. That is why we're having the Senate inquiry. 


Getting this legislation right is so vital in supporting survivors now and into the future, and I trust that my Senate colleagues appreciate the gravity of this task. This is not a partisan issue. This is as clear as it gets in politics. This goes to the heart of why we're here, why each of us wants to be in this House, and that is the chance to make a genuine, positive impact on the lives of Australians. I am confident that we will come together across the aisle and deliver justice on the back of the hard work of so many. 


In conclusion, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has brought into the public eye something that has been an ongoing feature of every community across this country for far too long. If you have not done so already, I urge you to read some of the 4,000 stories from survivors, available on the royal commission's website, because this is not just an issue for me or for parliament; this is an issue we all have to face together as a nation. We need to be united. State governments, churches, schools and all institutions must together make a statement that survivors have been wronged and deserve better. I want to place on the record my sincere and humble thanks for all those who have made this happen and to commit myself to working with the Hunter region and the Central Coast region to support survivors and to change this devastating culture. 


I finally want to acknowledge all those who have lost their lives and livelihoods because of this institutional abuse, and to pay respect to those who have fought to this day but who were not around to receive the justice they so deserved. I am so tremendously sorry.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (13:22):  I rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018.


Child sexual abuse is abhorrent. I cannot state that in strong enough terms. It is vile. For way too many years it was hidden and too often suspected but unspoken of and not reported. And that is our great shame. Too often, too many of us turned our backs on the horror of child sexual abuse. We were afraid to confront the dreadful truth, to even acknowledge the victims' stories, let alone believe them, and then to seek justice on their behalf. But, as the scorching light of the royal commission has been shone on this hidden horror, we have listened, we have been shocked and we have believed. I say again: we believe you. 


We now accept without question that the horror of child abuse has occurred and that, too often, it was right under our noses. As I speak on this bill, I acknowledge that there has been a societal change in the wake of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and the change is this: where once we turned our backs, now we look and listen. Where once we heard through a filter of doubt and scepticism, now we hear the full horror of shattered lives. Where once we may have said, 'It's none of my business,' now we know that protecting children is everyone's business. This is a fundamental change that will have a lasting impact on the protection of children in Australia. This change has occurred not because of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse—although the work the royal commission has done has been invaluable—and certainly not because of the institutions who have been shamed during the royal commission. It is squarely because of the bravery of the victims of child sexual abuse who came forward to tell their stories. They came forward even though some of them had told their stories before and not been believed. And some had never before told their stories, not to a single soul. I don't think any of us can understand what courage that takes. I know I can't. The lasting legacy of their courage will be that, when the next child speaks out—and the child after that—they will be believed. We will never again turn our backs as a nation.


The work of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has been extraordinary. I am very proud to have been a member of the parliament in November 2012 when Prime Minister Gillard announced that she would recommend to the Governor-General that a royal commission be appointed to inquire into institutional responses to child abuse. Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, the then Governor-General, announced in January 2013 that six commissioners, led by Justice Peter McClellan, would undertake the task of conducting the inquiry. I particularly mention Bob Atkinson, the former police commissioner from Queensland, for the great work he did as one of the royal commissioners. The royal commission handed down its final report in December 2017. The commissioners made a total of 409 recommendations. The workload of this royal commission was phenomenal. I thank all of the royal commissioners, and particularly their staff, for their considered work over five years. The horrors they must have waded through will no doubt leave a lasting imprint on all of their lives as well. Carrying that distilled horror and heartache is a great burden for any human, so I thank them again.


The royal commission received 42,041 calls, and 25,964 letters and emails; held 8,013 private sessions; and made 2,575 referrals to authorities, including the police. The royal commission's terms of reference were:


… to inquire into institutional responses to allegations and incidents of child sexual abuse and … what institutions and governments should do to better protect children against child sexual abuse …


The evidence the commission received was shocking, perhaps more so because we have all been part of those institutions that ignored or, even worse, covered up the abuse. The institutions that were referred to the commission including schools, childcare centres, sporting and recreation clubs, religious institutions, youth detention facilities and the armed forces. In one way or another we have all been involved in at least one of these institutions. We were there while these horrific crimes were taking place. We didn't see—or chose not to—the lives being shattered in our midst, the quiet crumbling of spirits right alongside us.


For the victims the impact of child sexual abuse can be devastating, life-changing, life-limiting and, sadly, as we have heard too often, life-ending. It is especially important to look beyond the shattered husks of lives gutted before they had even begun. When a child is abused at school, they won't want to go to school. That's not too hard to understand. Their education has been stolen from them along with their childhood. Without an education, and suffering from extreme trauma, their capacity to work is reduced, and it is not surprising that victims of child sexual abuse can then as adolescents become vulnerable to the call of criminal activity. We have to acknowledge with much sympathy the path that the survivors have been led or pushed down. Where survivors have been led into crime and convicted, they have taken responsibility and paid their debt to society, just like everyone else who is convicted of a crime. The government has sought in this bill to place restrictions on the redress that can be accessed by survivors who have a criminal history. I believe this is wrong and deeply unfair. The redress scheme is an important step in the healing process for survivors.


There are three elements of the redress scheme: it will provide a monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services, and the opportunity to receive an apology from a representative of the institution responsible for the abuse. Applicants who accept an offer for redress will be required to waive their civil law rights against the responsible institution by signing a deed of release, support services and legal services will be provided to applicants throughout the redress scheme process, and financial advice will be provided to applicants who accept an offer of redress. I have some concerns about the proposed scheme contained in the bills. There must be sufficient support services available for the survivors to access, wherever they are living and no matter what language they speak. The bill gives applicants six months to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. The royal commission recommended they be given a year to make this decision. For survivors this will be an emotional and overwhelming process. Applicants are allowed only one application to the scheme. There is no policy rationale for limiting the time for applicants to make this important decision. I am concerned that rushing survivors into making this once-only decision may not be in their best interests.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-05-29,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (12:09):  I was three-quarters of the way through this speech on Thursday when we ran out of time, so I am continuing today. I had been acknowledging the CLAN group of care leavers in my electorate. I had been talking about the impact of the royal commission and, in particular, the impact of the diocese of Sandhurst, which is in my electorate. I had got to the stage in my speech where I was talking about the role of alternative models of redress that were being used by the Victorian Women's Trust and I was about to outline three principles that the Victorian Women's Trust has found useful. They talked about them in their publication The paradox of service. The three main principles that they use are: having a champion in your corner, transparency of institutionalised responses and education about the nature of abuse.


I will take a few minutes to talk about the importance of having a champion in your corner. The Victorian Women's Trust talks about the experience they've had with nuns who have left religious orders. The trust talks about their ability to advocate on behalf of the nuns to get appropriate redress. They said that each of the formerly religious people have been able to rely every step of the way on having an advocate who is trusted and effective in representing their position and in their efforts to gain some personal relief.


The trust also talks about a significant aspect of this experience: religious orders have come some way in profound recognition for past hurt. In a large measure this is because they've not just had to listen in the right spirit to the formerly religious people but also had to deal with trusted brokers with a commitment to see some form of redress. That seems to me to be a really important element in what we're trying do with the survivors that we're addressing today with this redress system: the need to have a champion in your corner—someone who'll stand up for you.


The second principle is the transparency of institutionalised responses. It can't just be done in private. We need public recognition from our institutions that serious hurt has been caused, that they are going to make appropriate changes to the way they do things and that they are going to work with survivors to improve the situation—not just to make it better, but to actually improve the situation. While I understand some of the institutions have gone some way in this regard, I think there is a lot more in terms of humility and in terms of practical signs of sorrow that they could show to our survivors.


The third principle is education about the nature of abuse. Again, this is a major area I think we need to do a whole lot more work on, particularly the major religious institutions. There are many recommendations in the royal commission about what the institutions should do to improve the education, the culture and the understanding within our institutions about what causes abuse, why it happens and to then make the necessary changes that it never ever happens again.


In bringing my comments to a close, I would really like to acknowledge the work of the care leavers in my electorate, to Rhonda and her team—what a fantastic job you've done—and to say how grateful I am for the work that they do. My final comment is to use the dictionary definition of 'redress'. Redress means to rectify, to repair, to cure and to heal. My hope is that, in passing this legislation, we are able to do that in some way to the many, many survivors of our institutions. I'd like to finish by acknowledging, honouring and thanking them for their resilience, their persistence, their empathy, their tolerance, their patience and, most of all, their courage.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (12:13):  With a degree of concern and with a heavy dose of sadness, but ultimately with a complete sense of amazement, I stand here today in support of the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. I've been connected to the issue of those fellow Australians—half a million of them—who grew up in orphanages around Australia for as long as any issue I've been connected with in this place. Indeed, I started my connection with this issue prior to becoming elected to the House of Representatives. I was the preselected candidate for the electorate of Corio when Leonie Sheedy, director of the Care Leavers Australasia Network, affectionately known as CLAN, rang me and told me about this issue. She said I had an obligation to make this a key part of my work in this place and she invited me to become a patron of CLAN. This was out of the blue. I wasn't sure what to make of this phone call, but, after two hours, I absolutely signed up.


The basis on which she said I had a particular obligation to become a patron of CLAN was the particular story of Geelong—the city on which my electorate is based—as to those who grew up in orphanages. There were more orphanages in Geelong than in any other non-capital city in Australia. That means, I suppose, that today there is a higher proportion of those who have grown up in orphanages in my electorate than in perhaps any other in the country. The issue of those people who have been in orphanages and the abuse that they have suffered is a national story, but there is a very strong Geelong story which is a part of it. It became clear to me that being a patron of CLAN was something that I needed to do.


It was also a point of connection with an existing member of the class of 2007, Jason Clare, the member for Blaxland, who also knew Leonie Sheedy and became a patron of CLAN at the same time. Very quickly, Jason and I teamed up in providing advocacy around this issue. Now there are many people in this place and in the other place who are patrons of CLAN.


Those who grew up in orphanages suffered sexual abuse, as has been outlined by the royal commission. But it was more than that. People were removed from their families—often from situations of no more than simple poverty—and placed in large institutions where there was an absence of familial love. The point that Leonie made to me is that the overwhelming, consistent feature that has been experienced by everyone who has grown up in an orphanage is that: an absence of familial love—not being seen as being special to anyone, which is at the heart of a healthy childhood and something that those of us who have grown up in families take completely for granted.


In 2009, along with Steve Irons, the member for Swan, and Senator Claire Moore, we worked with the minister for family and community services at the time, the member for Jagajaga, on having an apology made to the forgotten Australians and the former child migrants. This occurred in 2009 in this building, and it was a remarkable day—a day soaked with tears, but a day on which, for the first time, people who had horrendous stories, which they had been telling all their lives and which, by and large, had not been listened to, finally were acknowledged as having told the truth.


In November 2012, the then Gillard government followed up the apology by announcing the establishment of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The final report of that royal commission was handed down in December of last year. It recommends the establishment of a national redress scheme, which is, of course, the subject of the bill that we are debating today.


The royal commission was a remarkable phenomenon for the country and for those who participated in it, many of whom I have spoken to. It was a place of pain. It was an unexpected place, which took this story in directions that none of us thought it would go. But ultimately it was a place of healing. The ability to have individual stories told and listened to and acted upon was deeply powerful. To this day, I think that the royal commission stands as one of the lasting achievements of the Gillard government.


So, as I stand here today, I'm filled with emotion. I'm filled with emotion about the journey that it has taken to get to this point. I'm filled with emotion in thinking about the people who I've met along the way—people who, when you look at the cards that they were dealt in life, were given a horrendous set of options for their life and yet faced up to them with enormous bravery and determination and, in the process, changed our nation. They are the bravest people I have met in this role. They are the people from whom I have taken the most inspiration in what I do here. This makes this debate that's going on in the House today enormously significant.


I do have mixed emotions, because there are aspects of this legislation which are not perfect. The quantum which is being provided via this legislation is $50,000 less than that which was recommended by the royal commission. It's a pity that the full $200,000 was not provided as the cap. The indexation provision for those people who have received payouts via other actions previously feels unfair. That indexation over a number of years, measured against what payment may be available through this process, may see some people getting not much at all. It would be better if that were changed. Part of the story, very sadly, of those who have grown up in orphanages, those who have suffered sexual abuse as children, is the path that it set them on in their lives, and often that is a path that has led to incarceration for themselves. It is a very significant number. It is a community that is overrepresented in our custodial institutions, and that people with significant criminal records will be prevented from gaining compensation through this redress scheme is also a pity. It denies a fundamental justice to people who started their lives with profound bad luck. The other point to make—and it goes back to the terms of reference for the royal commission to begin with—is that this only relates to people who have suffered sexual abuse. There were, of course, so many other forms of abuse which occurred for people in orphanages, and they are not part of this scheme.


That said, this redress scheme, and that it will be happening on 1 July this year, is hugely significant. It is a hugely significant moment, and I can barely believe that, from the time that Leonie Sheedy first said to me that this is what needed to occur, and it seemed to me unlikely that it ever would, we stand here in this place in a bipartisan way, knowing that a national redress scheme will be in place from 1 July this year for those who grew up in orphanages who suffered child sexual abuse. Of all that I've seen in this place over the last decade, that is as remarkable a set of events and as remarkable an achievement as I have witnessed, and I spend a moment to contemplate that.


I want to acknowledge the Minister for Social Services, the member for Wannon, for what he has done in bringing the redress scheme to a point of conclusion, to a point of operation. He deserves credit. I want to acknowledge the member for Jagajaga. From the outset, she was the person who carried the policy debate. She did so with wisdom and practicality, but she did so with an enormous sense of purpose, and her judgements in dealing with difficult issues were done with a sincerity and an integrity which represent a form of inspiration, I think, for all of us in this place who seek to represent Australians through the political process. She is an inspiration for our calling.


I want to acknowledge Leonie Sheedy, who is the head of CLAN. She is a force of nature. Her own story is tragic, and she has had her own personal demons to deal with throughout her life, and it would have been understandable if it had taken her down a more destructive road. But instead she has created a phenomenon. She is compassionate, she is generous, she has empathy, she has determination, and the number of hours that she has spent listening to the stories of those who have suffered renders her an angel. The achievement of the national redress scheme is as much hers as it is that of any person in this nation, and she deserves to be very much acknowledged at this moment.


But I want, finally, to remember her brother Anthony Sheedy, because Anthony is a person who will miss out. Anthony was dealt just the most appalling set of cards during his life in orphanages, and this was detailed in a wonderful piece written by Danny Lannen in the Geelong Advertiser. He says Anthony:


… became state ward 69411 and his 16-year journey to adulthood was spent within 10 institutions, including Geelong's St Augustine's boys home.


He entered these institutions at the age of two. Anthony tells this story from when he was 12:


""I first saw my parents at 12 years when they came to see me at St Augustine's. I didn't believe the Christian brother who told me to go upstairs to get dressed to see your parents.


""I said no because I didn't think they were my real parents. So I got the strap by the Brother and forced by his hand to go to the front door.


""My mother said 'Why are you crying?' I said 'Brother hit me for being naughty', as this is what the Brother had told me to say.""


That was not the beginning, at the age of 12, of a wonderful homecoming: Anthony's parents left that day and he stayed at St Augustine's. He continued to live there.


Danny takes the story up again of Anthony, aged 15. He said:


He told of being held in solitary confinement at Melbourne's Turana home, forced to sleep on a mattress with no blanket, and of being transferred as a young teen by train from Turana to Bendigo Training Centre in handcuffs.


He told of beatings and sexual abuse by fellow state wards and the people charged with his care …


That began a life that Anthony lived on the edge. For 30 years—for 30 years!—he didn't see any of his siblings. It was a life that was soaked with alcohol, which he ultimately weaned himself off in his late 40s because he had seen so many others go down a path of ultimate destruction by pursuing the drink. He said:


""My life has been terrible. I have been lonely just about all my life until I was 62 years old.


It was at that age that he opened, after six months, a letter that had been sent by his sister Leonie, who was in search of him. It gave him nine years of comfort, a number of which were spent volunteering in my office. The person we knew was actually cheeky, he was cheerful, he was diligent, he was a keen supporter of the Geelong Football Club, he loved Frank Sinatra and he loved talking about Frank. In fact, he would continue to talk as much as we would let him talk.


On 22 June 2011, Anthony died very suddenly. He died on the very day that a letter, sent by his lawyers, for a settlement conference for compensation had arrived at his house. He will not get compensation. He is one of thousands of those who grew up in orphanages for whom 1 July is too late. This is a day on which we need to remember Anthony and everyone like him. Ultimately, for its failings, this scheme is a huge achievement for this country; it will make an enormous difference for thousands of Australians. In the process, though, today I remember Anthony Sheedy.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (12:28):  I join with many colleagues in this place to talk on the National Redress Scheme, and I want to commend the member for Corio for his contribution. Anthony's story is one of many, many, many that men and women have told. Anthony is one of many who went through appalling abuse in our orphanages and our institutions whom we have lost and for whom this compensation scheme, this redress scheme, comes too late. It is their voices we hear echoing through this chamber, and it is important that we have resolve to get this done.


My community of Ballarat, of course, knows too well the legacy of child sexual abuse. There have been countless cases highlighted through the royal commission. The Ballarat cases warranted their own part of the commission's inquiry, their own booklet as part of the inquiry, as there were so many of them. There will be others who have never come forward to this day and have never spoken about their abuse, and there are many others who we have lost to suicide or early death. Our community has had an incredibly deep hurt inflicted through its heart, a hurt that lingers to this day and will take generations to heal. Child sexual abuse hurts everyone in a community. It affects every one of us, from the children growing to adults through to their children and their partners. It affects our police, our welfare workers and our teachers—all of us. That is why the royal commission has been so important: shining a light on what has occurred and providing a powerful symbol to the many, many survivors, that they are heard and believed across the breadth and the depth of this nation—that we believe you.


At hearings across the country, the royal commission heard from tens of thousands of Australians and shone a light on a shameful part of our history—a part of our history that has been ignored and denied for too long. In Ballarat I attended these hearings and I saw personally both the hurt and the strength of those who told their stories. I echo the member for Corio's words, that these men and women are some of the bravest people I know. There was the sight of some of these men attending Rome when Cardinal George Pell had been unable, or unwilling, to attend Australia to be part of those hearings. The survivors in Ballarat went to Rome to highlight that case and to speak with him, to encourage him to come and tell what he knew. They are some of the bravest people I know.


Of course, when Prime Minister Gillard established the royal commission, it was more than about symbols. It was established to provide redress and to make changes across all policy areas to ensure the protection of children and to make sure this does not happen again. In recognition of this important role, the commission deliberately handed down an interim report on redress so that the policy work on implementing such a scheme was not delayed. While this legislation has been a long time coming, it's an important step. And while I respect the complexity of negotiating such a scheme on behalf of the many people of my electorate who this affects directly, it would be remiss of me not to point out its shortcomings.


This is not the redress scheme recommended by the royal commission. When I talk to survivors, there are several things that they tell me. One is that the constant retelling of their stories to health professional after health professional and counsellor after counsellor perpetuates the harm. They need ongoing, lifelong access to counselling and other health services that provide them with dignity and continuity of care. They need recognition financially that many have lost jobs, housing and financial security—if they were ever able to get these in the first place—and it's been a direct result of the trauma that they experienced. This scheme does some of that, but falls well short of what many in the community need and expected.


While we are still trying from this side to seek improvements to this legislation, we are deeply conscious that many survivors have already been waiting too long and that the scheme is due to start on 1 July. My criticisms of the scheme are already on record, but they include, firstly, the government's decision to allow states and institutions to opt in, which, in essence, handed over all of the negotiating power to them. It's resulted in the Commonwealth having to make substantial concessions to get them into the scheme. We still do not have all states or institutions in.


There is no excuse for any of these bodies not to sign up to this scheme. No institution could possibly justify a decision not to offer the redress that means so much to more than 60,000 survivors of institutional sexual abuse. The failure of some institutions to sign up to the scheme adds a further hurdle to many survivors. The failure of some institutions means that, despite no recommendation from the royal commission, the government's bill states that only one application to the redress scheme can be made for each survivor. That means that some survivors may have to make the difficult choice of whether to delay pursuing a claim in the hope that all institutions responsible for the abuse sign up, or deciding to access redress when only one or some of them have opted in. This would be a particularly difficult decision for the survivors who are nearing the later years of their lives.


Secondly, one of the concessions that the government has made to get states and institutions into the scheme has resulted in the maximum cap for redress claims being watered down. Whereas the royal commission recommended a $200,000 maximum for redress claims, the bills before the House specifically say that the maximum available will be $150,000. This amount is important not only because of the possibility that the amount of redress offers but because those who accept an offer of redress made under the scheme will lose their right to make a civil claim against the institutions responsible for their abuse. I've heard countless stories of survivors of abuse who have never been able to work or who have in later years lost jobs and businesses and are suffering from significant financial insecurity. While redress is not a compensation scheme, it should also not be so low as to afford little recognition of this harm. The issue of indexation of previous payments made is also of significant concern, meaning that there will be some recipients who are entitled to redress actually ending up receiving absolutely nothing, because of the indexation of past payments.


One of the more contentious measures of the original legislation has been improved but is still of concern. The government has now allowed that people imprisoned for five years or more may be considered eligible for the scheme so long as providing the person with redress does not bring the scheme into disrepute. As someone who spent the early part of their career working with people in prisons and youth training centres, I get it—they have often done terrible acts and committed unforgivable crimes—but I also know that very few of them that I worked with had not experienced some form of abuse, some of them sexual abuse, while in the care of institutions. There is considerable evidence that a history of childhood abuse and trauma can increase the likelihood that an adult will engage in criminal behaviour. The later decisions and crimes of these survivors do nothing to negate the abuse that they as innocent children suffered. This childhood trauma may have been a significant cause that led to their later crimes. These bills seek to potentially deny them justice and redress.


Thirdly, the bills also go against the recommendations of the royal commission regarding access to counselling. The commission recommended access to counselling and psychological care be provided for the rest of their lives if required and not be limited to a lump sum payment. These bills fall far short of this. The bills state that either counselling will be provided through an existing state service for the life of the scheme or a payment for counselling of up to $5,000 will be made to the survivor. This is one of the key areas I think the government needs to rethink. Survivors who've suffered abuse at the hands of state-run institutions may not be able to or wish to use state- or institution-run services. This needs to be taken into account by states when delivering these services. In such a case, the $5,000 payment will not be adequate to provide access to lifelong support. As I said at the commencement of my contribution, it is this issue that is so important to ensuring the future health and wellbeing of survivors. The government has not got this right in this legislation. It is deeply unfair and it does not recognise the incredible harm done.


Labor has long argued that the recommendations of the royal commission should be implemented as intended and that no changes be made that limit the benefits the scheme offers to survivors around Australia. In light of these many concerns, Labor has referred these bills to a Senate inquiry so that the community can be consulted more thoroughly before a vote is taken. As a gesture of good faith in our ongoing discussions with the government to resolve these concerns and in acknowledgement of our longstanding commitment to the establishment of a national redress scheme, Labor will support, as the member for Jagajaga said, the bills in the House today, but we need to do much better.


On 24 May in my local newspaper, the Ballarat Courier, some survivors spoke about their disappointment with the redress scheme. As I conclude my contribution I want to quote from that so that their voices are heard here in this chamber. Gary Sculley said:


The redress is quite poor in a way, going against a lot of the Royal Commission recommendations and whittling it down to the point where it is insulting.

Survivors are put in a position now where it's basically take the redress, go away and die; it is appalling …


Stephen Woods said that there is so much frustration and anger. He said:


The survivors and families … we are all still holding on.


Like so many others, my life has been a small percentage of the potential I have, of what I could have achieved.


They are important words for us to hear. Whilst I don't want to underestimate the moment that we have here of actually achieving a national redress scheme, I have to speak for the many voices of the men and women of my community who have been so deeply affected. This isn't the scheme that the royal commission recommended. We do need to do better, particularly in the area of access to counselling and other healthcare services for the lives of these men and women. We know many of them have been deeply traumatised by what happened and are deeply traumatised still to this day. Every day of the commission, and every day this is debated in this place, more and more of them talk about the harm done. They are exhausted by the process. They want us to get this done, but they also want to make sure that what we do is right by them.


As I say, whilst we'll support these bills, it's important for us to hear where the scheme needs to be improved, and it's important for us to hear the words of the many survivors. It's important for us to remember that, whilst the commission has done its work and it's concluded its work, ours has only just started and we still have a very long way to go. I thank the House.

Ms CLAYDON
 (Newcastle) (12:40):  I rise today to contribute also to this important debate on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and the associated National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018. Together these bills establish a national redress scheme which, to a very large extent, mirrors the recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, an inquiry that was established by the former Gillard Labor government back in 2012 to investigate decades of the most appalling sexual abuse and terrible violence in institutions across Australia.


I want to acknowledge at the outset that, if it were not for the courage, tenacity and persistence of survivors, this royal commission would not have happened and we would not be standing here debating the creation of a national redress scheme in the Australian parliament today. To the survivors, I want to say: while we took far too long to respond to your pain and suffering, to expose the nature and extent of the systemic violence, abuse and cover-ups, and to ensure that your voices were heard and believed, the establishment of a national redress scheme is a critical part of the healing process for both you and, indeed, our nation. The scheme before the parliament today will give victims and survivors of child sexual abuse access to three elements of redress, including a monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services, and the opportunity to have a direct personal apology from the institution responsible for the abuse.


The life and work of the royal commission is deeply embedded in the Newcastle and Hunter region. In communities that I and my neighbouring Labor colleagues live in and represent, there are few who don't know somebody who bears the scars of this appalling abuse, perpetrated by the very organisations that should have protected them as children. Indeed, a lot of the reporting that helped build the case for the royal commission was printed over many years in the pages of my local newspaper, the Newcastle Herald. Much of that was written by the Herald journalist Joanne McCarthy, who pursued one of the most formidable investigations of abuse on behalf of local victims and survivors. Over many hundreds of articles, Ms McCarthy documented terrible cases of both abhorrent abuse and callous, cynical cover-ups by many of the most respected people in some of the most trusted institutions in our community. This truly was journalism at its finest, and in today's era of fake news we must never forget the critically important role that a free press has in shining a light in the darkest corners of our society and calling wrongdoers to account.


The shocking cases that were uncovered by Ms McCarthy, along with revelations from a local detective inspector, Peter Fox, contributed significantly to the former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's decision to launch the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in November 2012. This was a marathon campaign, and I again pay my tributes to all of those people who found the courage to speak out at a time when their voices were at best questioned and, indeed, many times rebuked.


In launching the royal commission, Prime Minister Gillard gave a voice to the tens of thousands of survivors of abuse, who not only had their childhoods ripped away from them but who had been repeatedly accused of malice or deceit when they dared to speak out. The royal commission allowed survivors to tell their stories, without judgement, for the first time. In doing so, it lifted the veil of secrecy and revealed shameful systemic abuse, enabled by an insidious culture of cover-ups that lay deep at the heart of so many religious institutions, not-for-profit bodies and state care providers and agencies.


Since 2012, more than 16,000 people have made contact with the commission and it heard more than 8,000 personal stories face to face. It is a dangerous path to single out any voice in that royal commission but I do want to pay a special tribute to former Anglican bishop Greg Thompson, who, in the course of his duty of trying to take care of a diocese reeling from the trauma that was being spoken of on a daily basis in front of the royal commission and in our media, revealed that he too was a victim of child sexual abuse—had been groomed through the Anglican Church and abused by the very people in the diocese he later came to govern as bishop. I raise that case because Bishop Greg Thompson knows full well the impact of people who questioned your motives for talking about that abuse. He was dealt great resistance from the diocese he represented. It is to my great sorrow and regret that we, as a community, were clearly unable to provide him with enough support to remain in that role. He has now retired and I have no doubt he will go on to ensure that justice and redress are sought, and he'll continue that work in many ways. It is one example of just how difficult cultural change comes in these institutions, that we were unable to lend the support required for him to retain his role when he dared speak up, when he drew a line saying zero tolerance to sexual abuse in the diocese of Newcastle. When he insisted that the culture of the Anglican diocese had to change, the resistance and pushback he felt were astonishing.


My community is now under the leadership of a new bishop, who, thankfully, shares many of those concerns. I know he will be working tirelessly to ensure that the diocese of Newcastle is reformed so that the culture that enabled that abuse to take place, that enabled that silence to be normalised in some way, is intolerable. The community will not stand for it any more and the church must change. They know that and I know they are making serious attempts to do that. But everybody is on notice that the entire community is watching very carefully the institutional cultural changes that must happen.


As a result of the royal commission, more than 2,500 individuals were reported to authorities and it's estimated there are some 60,000 victims and survivors of abuse that occurred in as many as 4,000 institutions across the country. Those figures are just staggering. The extent and the scale of that systemic abuse is truly shocking. This was reiterated in the final report, which stretches to tens of thousands of pages across 17 volumes and contains more than 400 recommendations. Eighty-two of the final recommendations related directly to the establishment of a national redress scheme as a fundamental right of survivors and a critical part of the healing process.


As I mentioned earlier, the courage of survivors who shared their stories cannot be overstated. Their contribution to calling out and putting an end to appalling systemic abuse will never be forgotten. Now, it is time for justice to be delivered. While no-one suggests that the redress scheme can make up for the pain and trauma of the past, it will lay foundations; it is the start of our making amends. In establishing this scheme, we must be unswervingly focused on ensuring that every decision we make is in the best interests of the victims and survivors of this abuse. That is the prism through which we must consider this bill and all of the work we do in this space. I understand that the bill before us today is the outcome of negotiated agreements with the New South Wales and Victorian governments. It will supersede the earlier Commonwealth legislation. Every state, aside from Western Australia, has now signed up to the scheme, which is excellent news. The scheme, of course, only works if it is truly national. I again welcome the calls this morning from some of the Anglican churches and others who are urging all of their groups across the nation to sign up to this scheme.


Labor was first to announce support for a national redress scheme when it was recommended by the royal commission's interim report back in 2015. We know that the victims and survivors of child sexual abuse in institutions waited decades for that royal commission, and we know that they should not be waiting any longer than necessary for an adequate and just scheme to be put in place. As previous speakers have said before me, whilst Labor will be supporting the bills before us, it is not without concern and there are some very real areas that need further investigation, on behalf of government, to make this redress scheme the very best it can be. One of those areas is the issue around the maximum redress value. We know the royal commission recommended that be set at $200,000. This bill only allows for a monetary value of $150,000. I remain unconvinced by the government's argument that this can't be revisited, and I would strongly urge some rethinking in this area.


Likewise, the issue of indexation is proving to be extremely problematic for survivors. Certainly, under this bill, any payment offered under the redress scheme would take into account any payments received for institutional child sexual abuse. Whilst that component is fair, the notion that we would somehow be indexing those payments over time has very real implications for survivors, where we may in fact end up in a situation where there is virtually nothing left in the redress scheme for those people. A payment indexed annually for decades-old payments could see survivors ending up with a pittance, and that would be an unjust outcome. I don't think anybody in this chamber thinks that's a fair outcome. That needs some rethinking from the government. On the time frames for acceptance, I'd also like to see the government reconsider the period of time that survivors are given to decide whether to accept a redress offer or not. While the royal commission recommended a year, this bill only allows for six months.


The other area of concern for Labor is the decision that survivors who have been given a custodial sentence of five years or more must apply for special permission in order to access the scheme. We believe this is unfair. I know that there are some very difficult cases that the redress scheme will have to deal with; I've no doubt about that. As much of the evidence made clear in the royal commission, people weren't offenders when they were children; they were just children who were sexually abused and they went on to lead lives of great trauma. For many, many reasons, there is an incredibly disproportionate group of survivors of child sexual abuse who now find themselves in the criminal justice system. The idea of somehow excluding those people from the redress scheme is unfair and problematic, and I think that the government would do well to revisit that decision


The final issue I now raise relates to the provision of counselling. Under the royal commission's recommendations, survivors would have access to counselling and psychological services for as long as they need. I cannot stress enough the importance of that. People need lifetime access, because we have no idea whether people are going to need access in six months time or 10 years time. That should be available to people in the same way as we don't ask veterans to put a time limit on post-traumatic stress; we enable free and lifelong access. The same privilege should be afforded to victims of child sexual abuse. I trust the government will work with Labor on all these matters and also the issue of the funder of last resort. We will support this bill but will continue to work tirelessly with the government for a fairer and more just outcome for victims of child sexual abuse.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (12:55):  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate, as this issue about the effect that child sexual abuse in institutions around this country has had has been something that I have worked with survivors in my own electorate to address, discuss and shed light upon. I was incredibly proud to stand as part of the Gillard government in 2013 when we announced the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. Many people had been calling for this for some time. Quite frankly, once we saw the outcome of that royal commission, as the evidence and information provided started to snowball, it galvanised everyone's view that this was so important, timely and critical. Over five years the commission held 57 public hearings over 44 days, and heard evidence from more than 1,300 witnesses.


I need to place on record here thanks to all of those that shared their personal stories. It is really hard to talk about yourself. As politicians we come in here and advocate on behalf of others; it is much more confronting to talk about your own personal experiences, especially when they are such private experiences that have been associated with such difficulties, personal shame and a whole range of other emotions. It is so difficult to talk about those, and I need to acknowledge here in this place those survivors that got up and were able to share their stories. When I spoke to a number of those survivors, I found that their motivation wasn't for themselves; it was to make sure that this never happened again, that no other child had to endure what they had to endure. I think that needs to be placed on the record—that this was for many a very brave and difficult moment, motivated by not only telling their story and seeking justice for themselves but also trying to make sure that this never happened again. I would like to thank on record all of those that were brave enough to tell their story.


I would also like to thank all those advocates who, even before the royal commission, had been advocating so powerfully for these stories to come out, for government to do something to address the wrongs of the past. Many organisations have been part of that. CLAN, led by Leonie Sheedy, has been one of those. They have done an amazing job at ensuring that governments dealt with this issue instead of forgetting it, ignoring it or pushing it under the carpet. I place on record my great thanks to them because, as a result of their bravery and advocacy, we now have these important pieces of legislation before the House today.


The National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018 are critically important, and I am very pleased to be supporting them today. I am pleased that the majority of states and territories have come on board. It does need to be a national redress scheme, so I would absolutely urge that the government continues to negotiate with those states that have not signed up and that it continues to pursue this. We need a truly national redress scheme. We also need a redress scheme that is in line with the recommendation of the royal commission. Labor were very clear once the recommendation came out from the royal commission that we supported a national redress scheme. We were very clear about it, and that is why we want to work constructively with the government to make sure that it comes to fruition. 


Labor has some concerns, and I certainly have some concerns, with the current bill. In particular, most of us are concerned about the limitation on access to counselling for the survivors. I think anyone who listened to the stories that were presented to the royal commission and who spoke with any of those individuals would have to acknowledge that this abuse has had lifelong consequences. It has affected many, many aspects of those individuals' lives. There is grief that comes with it about 'what could have been'. 'What could my life have been like without this terrible situation that happened to me?' 'What have I lost as a result?' It is a deeply difficult issue to deal with. I don't think it's too much to ask that those individuals get proper access to counselling in a way that actually helps them address the issues that they face. Therefore, I absolutely understand that the royal commission did recommend that recipients of redress be able to access counselling for the rest of their life. However, this bill only provides access to state-provided services for the length of the scheme or a payment of up to $5,000 to be put towards counselling. 


As I have said, these circumstances are woefully inadequate. I certainly join with the shadow minister and the rest of Labor to call on the government to give assurances that this will be addressed. I think survivors often consider that government is responsible for their abuse and do not wish to use state or institution-run services, and this does need to be taken into account by the states when delivering services. This is something which we do need to work on with our state colleagues to address. For survivors who receive the $5,000 payment, this amount of money will not provide adequate access to services. So I call on the government and urge the government, as previous speakers have done, to seriously address this issue. We need to seriously look at the upper limit that we place on the amount of redress. The upper limit set by this bill is $150,000. The royal commission recommends that the maximum payment be $200,000. I guess we need to understand the logic that the government has made for not implementing the full recommendation. Why aren't we seeing the royal commission's recommendation in full and why aren't we seeing the maximum payment of $200,000? 


Also, we have concerns that the bill gives applicants only six months to make this decision, while the royal commission recommends a year. Once again, it is unclear as to why the government has chosen this limit. I think we do need to acknowledge that, for many people, this is a deeply distressing process. It is difficult to take that first step, to take the second step or to take the third step in the redress process. So, limiting this time does put, I think, a large amount of pressure on individuals that is just not necessary. Why will the government not just accept the royal commission's 12-month period? There are a number of other issues that have been raised, and certainly I support Labor's concerns in this regard. We want to see the government work in way in which we can actually achieve a really good step towards a truly national redress scheme. 


In conclusion, I want to draw the House's attention to an area that was a direct result of the Commonwealth's mismanagement. A lot of the institutionalised sexual abuse that we saw was in churches and other religious institutions, as well as in state-run institutions. But, of course, the royal commission also looked into and examined the Department of Defence, and the ADF's responses to allegations of child sexual abuse at some of the institutions that were directly operated by the Commonwealth and the ADF. They concluded that from the 1960s to 1972 the system of management at HMAS Leeuwin was ineffective in preventing and responding to child sexual abuse. The Royal Navy failed in its duty to care for junior recruits who were children.


It was also found that there was a failure to adequately address harmful bullying conduct and that the culture of intimidation by older apprentices and staff represented a failure in duty of care by the Army to provide a safe environment for junior apprentices at the Australian Army Apprentices School at Balcombe. Further, during the 1970s and 1980s the system of management at Balcombe was ineffective in preventing and responding to abuse, a failure in management which allowed sexual abuse to occur.


At the time of the public hearing of the royal commission, the approach taken by DVA in assessing claims for child abuse at these two locations was incorrect in requiring assessors to reject any claim that was not supported by independently corroborated evidence. Following the hearing, Defence confirmed that DVA had put into effect a new policy for determining claims for child abuse. So we can see that evidence that occurred in the royal commission about abuse that happened directly as a result of the Commonwealth's mismanagement has now led to a change in process, and that is critically important in moving forward.


The royal commission also found that the impact of abuse on these individuals has been lifelong and severe, and include physical injury, mental illness, suicide attempts, alcohol abuse and broken relationships. It found that, since at least 2000, policy guidelines and training manuals of the ADF cadets were incomplete and misleading in regard to the legal age of consent and the effect of special care provisions.


We have seen, really, that not only was it the states and territories in their responsibilities, and also that of private institutions, but, indeed, that the Commonwealth itself did let those under its care down. They let those under its care down, and this royal commission and the redress scheme are critically important to setting those wrongs right. It is incumbent, I think, on all of us to continue to ensure that this is not a set-and-forget policy, that we continue to recognise the impact of what past behaviour has had on individuals—the continuing lifelong impact that has had. We must continue as a parliament and as a nation to recognise this and to ensure that we do everything in our power to say sorry and also, importantly, to bring in a national redress scheme that actually goes some way in this. We can never change the past and we can never make up for all the damage that has been done, but if we get this redress scheme right—if we make sure that it's truly national and that it's in line with the royal commission's recommendations—then we can go some way in saying that we got it wrong but we're trying to make amends. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (13:09):  I'm proud to rise and make a contribution to the debate on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. Over the last five years we have heard about the most heartbreaking of stories, from the bravest of people, at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. I, like my colleagues in parliament, want to make it clear that we believe them. We know they were victims of horrible crimes, we know they were let down by people in institutions that were meant to keep them safe and we know that they deserve adequate redress for this. The persistence and strength that they have shown in this fight has been an inspiration, and we commit to dutifully providing a national redress scheme that recognises the injustices that they have suffered, the struggle they have gone through to get here and be heard, and the tough road that lies ahead for so many. That's why Labor will work with survivors and the government to implement legislation that realises the recommendations of the royal commission and acknowledges the hardship of so many survivors. This must be a scheme that is inclusive, accessible and adequate. It would be offensive to the courage shown throughout this process and to the hard work which paved the way to a royal commission to accept anything less.


In 2013, the Gillard Labor government took responsibility and created the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and I'm proud to be able to thank my predecessor, Greg Combet, the tireless activism of dedicated Hunter locals and of course Ms Gillard for this achievement. In June of that year, Prime Minister Gillard put aside what was a chaotic moment in Australian politics to focus on an issue that she knew was more important. After years of Australian governments ignoring mounting evidence, the Gillard government took action. Members in that government still cite this royal commission as one of their most important moments and one of their proudest legacies. None has been more stalwart in their pursuit of justice in parliament than the member for Jagajaga. I know how proud she is of what this movement has achieved and how deeply she cares for the thousands who have been let down in this country over the years. This parliament is united in its recognition that the creation of the royal commission was one of the most significant moments in our history. To those who worked so hard for so long—like Julia and Jenny, and like so many survivors—we are grateful.


However, these fighters and gutsy survivors have been quick to remind us of our responsibility, saying that the hard work of those who came before us was not for show, and that, while the chance to tell their story and be heard was a welcome relief, the job was not done yet. We have a duty to this nation and to those who bravely shared their experience with the royal commission to deliver real justice and appropriate redress. The Labor Party established this commission. We have supported it throughout the process. And we will not be giving up now. We have a chance here today to deliver on the promise of the royal commission, to turn appreciation and belief into action, and I look forward to working with the government to address a national redress scheme which achieves these outcomes.


I turn now to the Hunter, because the truth is: this process has impacted the Hunter region as much as anywhere else and more than most. As a community, we've been shocked by the extent of, and the lack of response to, child sexual abuse right on our doorstep. One of the most shocking stories of abuse in our region was that of the crimes committed by James Patrick Fletcher, a priest who preyed on young boys in the Hunter for decades. We now know that this abuse was allowed to take place thanks to a culture of cover-ups and deceit that permeated the entire diocese of Maitland-Newcastle for many years.


In 1976, Peter Creigh reported the abuse he had suffered at the hands of Mr Fletcher to the then priest, and later Archbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson. Mr Wilson not only concealed this abuse from the authorities but also allowed Mr Fletcher to continue working as a priest with boys in that area. This not only saw Fletcher avoid professional criminal consequences for his actions but in fact allowed him to continue abusing young boys in the Hunter for years to come. The royal commission has shown us that that is an all-too-familiar pattern, and that the culture of protecting child abusers has permeated institutions in this country to the highest of levels.


Last Tuesday in Newcastle, Archbishop Wilson was found guilty of concealing these crimes in a courtroom populated by many who should have been spared the abuse that was allowed to continue. He is the world's highest-ranking Catholic official ever convicted of concealing child sexual abuse and did so in my home region of the Hunter. In the verdict handed down last week, the magistrate said of Mr Wilson: 'You have to ask why the accused did not do what he himself says he would do now'—that is, to go to the police—'in the same situation. The answer, I believe, relates to the accused having a sense of knowing what he was hearing was a credible allegation. In addition, the accused wanted to protect the church and its image.' As Daniel Feenan put it on the steps outside court: 'If this bloke had done something in 1976, which was the year that I was born, my life would have been a lot different to what it is today.'


My thanks go to former detective Peter Fox for his hard work in putting James Fletcher behind bars and for his continued work in this area which led to the New South Wales special commission of inquiry which was the predecessor of the royal commission. To him and the current Strike Force Lantle police for their investigation and prosecution of these crimes, I and many in the Hunter are grateful. I also want to acknowledge the tireless work of the Newcastle Herald, Joanne McCarthy and their Shine the Light team.


The frequency and severity of this abuse has been so damaging to so many in our region. I want to pay tribute to the commission for giving these survivors a platform to share their experience and shine a light into these dark corners. It is because of this that we're now able to begin a process of healing and to reach out to our neighbours, friends and family to support each other.


In late 2012 more than 400 Hunter residents attended a forum of what became known as 60 years of shame for the region in terms of child sexual abuse. Tracey Pirona was there to tell a story of her husband John who took his own life months earlier. John was one of 12 others who is no longer with us due to the actions of a single priest. Tracey's words painted a familiar picture.


That man alone—


the priest—


… changed the path of John's life from such a young age and teachers and principals knew what was happening to these children and they condoned it by not reporting it …


On the royal commission's website you can read thousands of stories of abuse, neglect and betrayal in institutions across this country. I would like to share one of these now from the Central Coast, another part of my electorate damaged by such abuse.


After suffering sexual abuse at the hands of her father, and subsequently being forced to live in unsafe conditions which saw her badly burned by a family friend, Corrine was made a ward of the state. She was sent to a children's group home on the Central Coast of New South Wales at the age of 11. Corrine and many others at the home were forced to perform sexual acts on other children and forced to assault other children due to a lack of supervision and a lack of security in that home. Corrine was placed into foster care at the age of 14 where she was again repeatedly sexually abused by one of her guardians. She left this home and nobody from community services supervised where she was or checked on her wellbeing at the age of 14. As a teenager, she had two children to her husband who also abused her, and she eventually fell into an addiction of painkillers. Corrine has struggled with suicide ideas and has continued to live with anxiety. For Corrine a chance to speak openly about her experiences helps her heal after such a long period of trauma. This story paints a picture of constant failure of institutions to provide the care and protection that she was entitled to. This betrayal has stayed with Corrine, who said to the commission:


No-one has ever, ever said sorry for what happened to me in care when I was a child. I was supposed to be looked after.


The royal commission has methodically exposed institutional abuse in our nation, in churches and in schools by coaches and by carers to boys and to girls.


These stories from the Hunter, from the Central Coast and from communities around Australia turn feelings of hopelessness and fear into solidarity and anger. A public that looked the other way for too long has taken notice and is demanding action. That is what we are here to do now. We're in this parliament to take action and respond to these irrefutable findings. This legislation must not fail survivors. Having finally heard their stories, this is now our first chance to start the process of change, to demonstrate that institutions in this country will do what it takes to make sure we do not let them down again.


Labor looks forward to the findings of the Senate inquiry into this legislation, but there are some initial concerns worth highlighting. We want to make sure that any legislation guarantees support services are accessible, regardless of where a survivor lives or what language they speak. We want this bill, as it stands, to bring some measures into line with the recommendations of the commission. As it stands, survivors would have six months to decide whether to accept an offer to of redress, despite the royal commission recommending a year. The bill offers a limit of $150,000 for survivors compared to the $200,000 called for. Legislation must not be limited, as it currently would be, to Australian citizens or those living in Australia. This ignores the large number of child migrants and the abuse of children in immigration detention. I want to also say the legislation must be fair to those with criminal records.


We know from evidence to the royal commission, from experts in the field and from undeniable statistics that suffering abuse such as these people have often leads to addiction, to mental health issues and to crime. On this basis, to exclude people let down by a system meant to protect them is totally unacceptable. We must be brave. We must go beyond a fear of a few tabloid headlines about providing compensation to people who have been in prison to recognise that this abuse has led to addiction and has led to massive mental health issues, and the inevitable result of that is criminal convictions. We must provide redress and we must provide justice to all survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, even if they have gone to prison. I urge the Senate inquiry to give this issue particular consideration so that all survivors have access to compensation. That is why we're having the Senate inquiry. 


Getting this legislation right is so vital in supporting survivors now and into the future, and I trust that my Senate colleagues appreciate the gravity of this task. This is not a partisan issue. This is as clear as it gets in politics. This goes to the heart of why we're here, why each of us wants to be in this House, and that is the chance to make a genuine, positive impact on the lives of Australians. I am confident that we will come together across the aisle and deliver justice on the back of the hard work of so many. 


In conclusion, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has brought into the public eye something that has been an ongoing feature of every community across this country for far too long. If you have not done so already, I urge you to read some of the 4,000 stories from survivors, available on the royal commission's website, because this is not just an issue for me or for parliament; this is an issue we all have to face together as a nation. We need to be united. State governments, churches, schools and all institutions must together make a statement that survivors have been wronged and deserve better. I want to place on the record my sincere and humble thanks for all those who have made this happen and to commit myself to working with the Hunter region and the Central Coast region to support survivors and to change this devastating culture. 


I finally want to acknowledge all those who have lost their lives and livelihoods because of this institutional abuse, and to pay respect to those who have fought to this day but who were not around to receive the justice they so deserved. I am so tremendously sorry.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (13:22):  I rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018.


Child sexual abuse is abhorrent. I cannot state that in strong enough terms. It is vile. For way too many years it was hidden and too often suspected but unspoken of and not reported. And that is our great shame. Too often, too many of us turned our backs on the horror of child sexual abuse. We were afraid to confront the dreadful truth, to even acknowledge the victims' stories, let alone believe them, and then to seek justice on their behalf. But, as the scorching light of the royal commission has been shone on this hidden horror, we have listened, we have been shocked and we have believed. I say again: we believe you. 


We now accept without question that the horror of child abuse has occurred and that, too often, it was right under our noses. As I speak on this bill, I acknowledge that there has been a societal change in the wake of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and the change is this: where once we turned our backs, now we look and listen. Where once we heard through a filter of doubt and scepticism, now we hear the full horror of shattered lives. Where once we may have said, 'It's none of my business,' now we know that protecting children is everyone's business. This is a fundamental change that will have a lasting impact on the protection of children in Australia. This change has occurred not because of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse—although the work the royal commission has done has been invaluable—and certainly not because of the institutions who have been shamed during the royal commission. It is squarely because of the bravery of the victims of child sexual abuse who came forward to tell their stories. They came forward even though some of them had told their stories before and not been believed. And some had never before told their stories, not to a single soul. I don't think any of us can understand what courage that takes. I know I can't. The lasting legacy of their courage will be that, when the next child speaks out—and the child after that—they will be believed. We will never again turn our backs as a nation.


The work of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has been extraordinary. I am very proud to have been a member of the parliament in November 2012 when Prime Minister Gillard announced that she would recommend to the Governor-General that a royal commission be appointed to inquire into institutional responses to child abuse. Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, the then Governor-General, announced in January 2013 that six commissioners, led by Justice Peter McClellan, would undertake the task of conducting the inquiry. I particularly mention Bob Atkinson, the former police commissioner from Queensland, for the great work he did as one of the royal commissioners. The royal commission handed down its final report in December 2017. The commissioners made a total of 409 recommendations. The workload of this royal commission was phenomenal. I thank all of the royal commissioners, and particularly their staff, for their considered work over five years. The horrors they must have waded through will no doubt leave a lasting imprint on all of their lives as well. Carrying that distilled horror and heartache is a great burden for any human, so I thank them again.


The royal commission received 42,041 calls, and 25,964 letters and emails; held 8,013 private sessions; and made 2,575 referrals to authorities, including the police. The royal commission's terms of reference were:


… to inquire into institutional responses to allegations and incidents of child sexual abuse and … what institutions and governments should do to better protect children against child sexual abuse …


The evidence the commission received was shocking, perhaps more so because we have all been part of those institutions that ignored or, even worse, covered up the abuse. The institutions that were referred to the commission including schools, childcare centres, sporting and recreation clubs, religious institutions, youth detention facilities and the armed forces. In one way or another we have all been involved in at least one of these institutions. We were there while these horrific crimes were taking place. We didn't see—or chose not to—the lives being shattered in our midst, the quiet crumbling of spirits right alongside us.


For the victims the impact of child sexual abuse can be devastating, life-changing, life-limiting and, sadly, as we have heard too often, life-ending. It is especially important to look beyond the shattered husks of lives gutted before they had even begun. When a child is abused at school, they won't want to go to school. That's not too hard to understand. Their education has been stolen from them along with their childhood. Without an education, and suffering from extreme trauma, their capacity to work is reduced, and it is not surprising that victims of child sexual abuse can then as adolescents become vulnerable to the call of criminal activity. We have to acknowledge with much sympathy the path that the survivors have been led or pushed down. Where survivors have been led into crime and convicted, they have taken responsibility and paid their debt to society, just like everyone else who is convicted of a crime. The government has sought in this bill to place restrictions on the redress that can be accessed by survivors who have a criminal history. I believe this is wrong and deeply unfair. The redress scheme is an important step in the healing process for survivors.


There are three elements of the redress scheme: it will provide a monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services, and the opportunity to receive an apology from a representative of the institution responsible for the abuse. Applicants who accept an offer for redress will be required to waive their civil law rights against the responsible institution by signing a deed of release, support services and legal services will be provided to applicants throughout the redress scheme process, and financial advice will be provided to applicants who accept an offer of redress. I have some concerns about the proposed scheme contained in the bills. There must be sufficient support services available for the survivors to access, wherever they are living and no matter what language they speak. The bill gives applicants six months to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. The royal commission recommended they be given a year to make this decision. For survivors this will be an emotional and overwhelming process. Applicants are allowed only one application to the scheme. There is no policy rationale for limiting the time for applicants to make this important decision. I am concerned that rushing survivors into making this once-only decision may not be in their best interests.

Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (13:30):  I rise today to notify the House of the death of Dr Bruce Shepherd AM, orthopaedic surgeon, past president of the New South Wales AMA and the federal AMA, 1991 Father of the Year, founder of the Australian Society of Orthopaedic Surgeons and founder of the Australian Doctors' Fund. Most of all, Dr Shepherd will be remembered, with his wife, Annette, as the founder of the Shepherd Centre, at Sydney University, following the birth of their two children, Penny and Danny, with profound sensory neural deafness. The centre was started in 1970, following extensive investigation overseas of the best treatment for children with severe hearing loss. Subsequently, under the guidance of Bruce Shepherd, the Shepherd Centre promoted universal neonatal hearing screening for all Australian children, did pioneering work with the cochlear implant and developed world's best practice for the early intervention program for children with hearing loss.


Bruce Shepherd was a warrior in the cause of medical independence and fought a huge battle with the Hawke government, and specifically Dr Neal Blewett, the health minister, over the introduction of Medicare and payments for specialists who worked in the public hospital system. Bruce Shepherd always gave his best in every situation and will be remembered with gratitude by his friends, patients, colleagues and the many thousands of deaf children and their families. Vale Bruce Shepherd.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",IND,2018-05-29,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (15:12):  It goes without saying that Australia is a very lucky country. Australia is a very rich country. We have the 13th biggest economy in the world, and our per capita national wealth is second only to the Swiss. So it beggars belief that in Australia these days so many people are finding it so difficult when it comes to housing accessibility and affordability. Indeed, when I look at the most recent 2016 census figures, I see that 116,427 people are homeless. In a country with a relatively small population like our own, over 100,000 people are homeless. Even in my small state of Tasmania, over 1,500 people are homeless. In the electorate of Denison, over 500 people are homeless. It beggars belief. In fact, those who have been following the Tasmanian media in recent months would have seen the appalling situation of whole families camped out in tents at the showground. We even had a short period where people were camped out in tents on the lawns of our state Parliament House.


And that's just the homeless. When it comes to disadvantaged people who are relying on public or social housing, the latest figures are, just in Tasmania, over 3,400 families on the public housing waiting list. That's over 3,400 people and families on the public housing waiting list, and the delay to get public housing in Tasmania, for priority applicants, has now blown out to 63 weeks. When it comes to people buying a house, it's now judged that Australia is second only to Hong Kong when it comes to the unaffordability of buying a property.


It's not just Sydney or Melbourne, which do soak up a lot of the media attention. Just in Hobart in roughly the last 12 months, our market price has gone up by over 13 per cent—an unsustainable growth in the price of property and in buying property. Moreover, the affordability of rent is likewise going up steeply. When I look at the latest Rental Affordability Index, I see that Greater Sydney, Greater Adelaide and Greater Hobart are all judged as being unaffordable. When I look at the regions, the rest of New South Wales is judged as being unaffordable. This is a remarkable situation. The most unaffordable rental market in the country is Hobart. When you look at average local wages versus average local rents, you see that we are now the most unaffordable capital city when it comes to renting a home. This affects a whole raft of suburbs. The Hobart CBD, Sandy Bay, West Hobart, South Hobart, North Hobart, Kingston, Margate and Sorell are all judged as being unaffordable according to the latest Rental Affordability Index. 


I'm not having a go at any one state government, any one council or any one party here in this place. When you take a step back and look at the situation holistically, you can see there has been a failure of public policy right across this country—at the federal level, at the state level, at the local government level—for many years. This is a housing accessibility and affordability crisis in this country that has been coming for many years, and no party, no level of government, is beyond sin. However, just as it's been the federal government, the state governments and the local governments that have caused this problem, it is similarly within the power of the federal government, state governments, territory governments and local governments to fix the problem. But fixing the problem needs to start with a genuine national housing strategy. We need to take a step back and we need to look at how we can possibly combine public policy, the use of resources and the expenditure of money at the federal level, at the state and territory level and at the local government level to ensure that every person in this country has their fundamental right to a safe and comfortable roof over their head met. It's only when we take the politics out of this and we work collegiately in places like this—work collegiately between Canberra and the state and territory capitals, and local government—that we can really pull together a genuine national housing strategy. 


I'll give you a few ideas about the sorts of things that a national housing strategy might include. For a start, we need more crisis accommodation, because the people most in need of a roof over their head are those in crisis—people who, through no fault of their own, are literally sleeping in the bush, under bridges, in someone's garage, under their house, in their laundry. We need much more investment in crisis accommodation. I make the point again: measured by per capita national wealth, we are the second-richest people on the planet. Surely in a country as rich as ours, we shouldn't have over a hundred thousand homeless people, and many of them in abject poverty and in crisis. Surely we can afford to put a roof over their head. And we need more public housing and other social housing. Again, we can afford it. It's madness that in a place as small as Tasmania, in a country as rich as ours, we have over 3½ thousand families and people waiting for public housing and that the waiting time for priority applicants is over 60 weeks. That is unforgivable. And we need more supported accommodation for people with specific needs. We talk a lot about mental health in this place, although not nearly enough. We should be talking more about supported accommodation for people with specific needs. That's the way to start addressing things like the mental health crisis in this country—and for other people who have special needs. And we need to regulate Airbnb. I'm not anti Airbnb, but when you see a place like Hobart, where so many long-term rentals are being turned into short-term holiday accommodation, you start to understand why there are not long-term rentals available for Australians who need it. Airbnb needs to be returned to its original purpose of making spare rooms available. 


We do need to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax. It's regrettable that this issue has become a political football for the government and the opposition to just kick backwards and forwards. Why don't we put our heads together and say, 'Well, how can we genuinely reform such measures to make accommodation in this country more affordable and more accessible?' The states, particularly my home state of Tasmania, need to consider rent-to-buy public housing, which used to be the case around this country and is still the case in other countries. This is where particularly disadvantaged people on low incomes who, when they're paying that rent, are actually paying off that house, with a reasonable hope that one day they will own that property and turn that family's fortunes around. 


What about a 30 per cent increase in Commonwealth rent assistance—$20 a week? Just imagine what that would do for housing affordability and accessibility for disadvantaged and low-income people in this country? It would really start to turn it around. It would be a modest cost to the budget. The budget this year is about half a trillion dollars. We can afford to double our submarine fleet. We can afford our people in this place to be on $200,000 a year for sitting on the backbench and doing bugger all. Yet it's so hard to get $20 a week extra for people who most need it. 


The Commonwealth could abolish Tasmania's Commonwealth housing debt, because half of the money that comes to Tasmania for public housing goes straight back to Canberra in interest payments. The Gillard government, when it needed the support of South Australia for the Gonski reforms, was happy to waive the debt then, because it was politically expedient, but won't waive the debt now for a state like Tasmania, which would benefit mightily by the Commonwealth axing that debt. 


There are so many other things we could do, such as greater restrictions on foreign investment. I note that in 2015-16 foreigners bought over $40 million of residential property in Hobart. In 2016-17, foreigners bought over $20 million of residential property in Hobart. No wonder the price is going up. No wonder there is no property for local people to buy or to rent; it's because of forces like that. 


There are other innovative measures. I had an email just in the last several weeks from a constituent who said, 'What about not-for-profit funds where people could invest their spare money and then those funds could buy low-cost housing for people to rent, to make housing more affordable?' There are 1,001 ways that we could make property much more affordable and accessible for people in this country, but none of it will start until we get a national housing strategy to pull it all together.

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2018-05-29,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin—Assistant Minister to the Treasurer) (15:22):  I thank the member for Denison for raising this matter of public importance. I'll touch on some of the specific points that he has raised in relation to the government's strategy, but I would encourage the member for Denison, if he is indeed interested in this issue, to perhaps come and see me and speak to me about some of the measures the government has undertaken, because a range of the issues that the honourable member has raised are actually things that have been addressed either in last year's budget or in this year's budget. 


Firstly, the government's very strong view and consistent with our values is that secure, stable, affordable housing is one of the most important things for Australians. It's not just about having a roof over your head. We know, through all of the evidence, that, if you have secure housing, if you are, indeed, fortunate enough to own a home, the benefits that it has for your life, your family and your health, even, are quite significant. That's why, in the 2017-18 budget, I think it's fair to say that this government, the Turnbull government, took the most unprecedented steps into the housing market of any federal government in history, and that work has been led by the Treasurer, and that work continues to this day in bedding down a range of the measures, which I'll take the honourable member through. That was further supported by additional measures that we took this year in the 2018-19 budget, because, as the Treasurer and I promised in 2017-18, housing under a Turnbull government will be a permanent feature of our budgets. It's an issue close to our hearts and it will be an issue that we address in every single budget. 


Let me take you through some of the specific measures from the 2017-18 budget and how they are progressing. Firstly, we've engaged in negotiations with the states and territories, and the honourable member speaks about working collegiately with the states and territories to reform our National Affordable Housing Agreement. When we came into office, the Commonwealth was spending $1.3 billion a year in payments to the states through the National Affordable Housing Agreement. Notwithstanding those payments, which amounted to about $9 billion, we saw, on almost every measure, those KPIs go backwards—whether it was the amount of public or social housing stock or whether it was the quality of that public or social housing stock. Clearly, there were issues with that spend. So, we committed to reforming the National Affordable Housing Agreement, and through that process it's now become the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. 


One of the key matters that we sought to address in changing that agreement goes to a couple of the points that the member for Denison raised. Firstly, the MPI talks about a housing strategy. One of the conditions of the new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, which the Northern Territory has recently signed up to, and we are very thankful for that, is that every state and territory have a housing strategy. It might be a surprise to some members in the House, but not every jurisdiction in this country even had a housing strategy to start with. So, in making that request, I note that some jurisdictions have been a little tentative—that's probably a diplomatic way of putting it—in agreeing to a housing strategy, but I think we've got them all over the line and they've agreed to at least have a housing strategy themselves. 


Why is that very important, Member for Denison? It's important because, as you rightly point out, the issues that you're facing now in Tasmania—and that you've referred to specifically for Hobart—will be, in many respects, unique. Many of the issues that were issues in my electorate, and continue to be issues in my electorate in outer suburban Melbourne, particularly for first home buyers, were similar issues to those being faced in much of Sydney. Those issues were different to the issues that people were facing in regional Queensland, in Western Australia or in South Australia, for that matter. So, having every jurisdiction have its own housing strategy, we felt, was very important. That's one aspect of the reformed National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. 


We have worked very collegiately with the states and territories to do that. We've also asked the states and territories for much better data: what is the money being spent on, and how could we assure that that money is, in the end, doing what you've also pointed to, Member for Denison, which is to get more social and public housing dwellings on the ground? Because we saw, after eight years of the National Affordable Housing Agreement and $9 billion of additional funding from the Commonwealth, that on every measure, whether it was public or social housing, the number of dwellings went backwards and the quality of the dwellings went backwards as well. So, that reform is something that we have been very proud of. 


In exchange for some of the effort we're asking from states and territories now in developing those strategies and giving us real-time data, Treasurer Morrison announced that for the first time we would permanently index homelessness funding. An additional $620 million was provided in the 2017-18 budget—matched, I might add, by the states and territories—and for the first time ever it's guaranteed and it's indexed. The issue for a lot of homelessness providers in the past has been that the sword of Damocles hung over their head: would the agreement be extended and would funding be extended? No longer—that funding is now guaranteed. And not only is it guaranteed, it's indexed. Notwithstanding many of the issues we had with the Affordable Housing Agreement, it was clear to us that the homelessness providers were doing an exceptional job. 


A second aspect of the housing package was the National Housing Finance Investment Corporation. This is a government body that will, essentially, fulfil two functions. Firstly, it will administer the $1 billion infrastructure facility. The sole purpose of this $1 billion infrastructure facility, which is represented by $825 million in concessional loans and $175 million in grants, will be to help projects get over the line to get more houses and more dwellings into the market. Because, in the end, one of the issues that we found, particularly in the top of the markets in Sydney and Melbourne, was the inability of the market to respond quickly and get new dwellings into the market. What is the job of the infrastructure facility? It's not there to gold-plate projects that were going ahead already; the infrastructure facility will be there with an additionality principle, meaning that it will commit either a concessional loan or a grant only to help get over the line a project that otherwise wouldn't happen. If the member for Denison comes to see me, I can give him many examples of proposals that we are very confident will be put before the National Housing and Finance Investment Corporation on 1 July that require just a little bit of government investment to help all of a sudden unlock in some cases thousands of new dwellings, including affordable housing.


The second aspect of the Housing Finance and Investment Corporation which commences on 1 July is the bond aggregator. The bond aggregator is there to help funnel low-interest loans to community housing providers. Community housing providers were very pleased last year when I announced that it would be backed by a full government guarantee, which means that community housing providers, instead of having to go out and source their own loans in a credit-constrained environment, will now be able to get the lowest rate of interest possible and, in an aggregated fashion, access even more money to help them fund additional projects. The community housing providers sit on large assets. How can we make those balance sheets work for the community housing providers? If we do that, we get more affordable housing and social housing into the market.



Two other aspects of the government's housing affordability plan have been the first home super saver scheme, a tax cut to encourage first-home buyers to save through concessional contributions in superannuation rather than through their bank account. They get a huge tax cut on the way through, and they also get additional earnings in their super fund. The only condition is that money has to be used to buy a house. It's $15,000 a year to a maximum of $30,000, or $60,000 for a couple, which we know will accelerate the saving rate for first-home buyers by about 30 per cent, because one of the issues for first home buyers is that, as they're saving, the market has kept rising. Finally, our downsizing policy allows those who are downsizing from a family home to contribute up to $300,000 per person, $600,000 for a couple, into their superannuation if that's the proceeds of downsizing, because we don't want those people living in big family homes; we want them to sell them. There are a range of measures, and I'd encourage the member for Denison to come see me. (Time expired)

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fenner) (15:32):  In Tasmania today people are camping out in tents in the Hobart Showground. One of them, Rachel, is due to give birth in October, and she is having to suffer through icy Tasmanian temperatures. She says:


… if I can't see it, it's not happening. Just stay in a ball and you'll be fine.


That's Rachel's way of dealing with the homelessness crisis Tasmania is currently struggling with. One of my own constituents, Adrian, wrote to me about his family's struggles. His children and grandchildren are finding it difficult to get into the housing market. He currently shares his house with his married daughter and her husband. Since his eldest was born 40 years ago, he has had only six months of living without his offspring. Lina, a woman in my electorate, recently wrote to me about living out of a suitcase after losing her mother. Annie, an older woman, has been left with few housing options after finding herself with little superannuation and no family.


Australia's homeownership rate is now at 60-year lows, and for 25- to 34-year-olds the homeownership rate has collapsed from 60 per cent to less than 40 per cent over the past 30 years. Just in the time that the government has been in office, capital city house prices have soared by 30 per cent, with nearly 50 per cent increases in Sydney. Recent Reserve Bank analysis by Gianni La Cava, Hannah Leal and Andrew Zurawski measures the house-price-to-income ratio, and shows that in the early 1980s, it was less than two, and now it's over five. They ask what share of homes would be affordable to the typical first-home buyer, and find that nationally it is 32 per cent. In Sydney, it can be as low as 10 per cent. Compared with recent years, first-home buyers are finding themselves only able to afford homes with fewer bedrooms, further away from the centre of the city.


Now, there was a time when the Liberal Party was the party of home ownership. In his 'forgotten people' speech, Robert Menzies said:


The home is the foundation of sanity and sobriety; it is the indispensable condition of continuity; its health determines the health of society as a whole.


He didn't think that the policy of the government ought to be to look after the rich. In fact, he said:


… in most material difficulties, the rich can look after themselves.


But the successors to Menzies don't have the same attitude. When asked about housing affordability, the Prime Minister told ABC host Jon Faine just to 'shell out' and help fund his kids' entry into the housing market. The member for New England told people who couldn't afford rent to move to the country. Joe Hockey said people should just 'get a good job that pays good money'. Indeed, two years ago we had the spectacle of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer posing with the Mignacca family, who had just purchased a property for their one-year-old child, Addison. What kind of a country is it in which the party of Menzies is now the party defending negative gearing for one-year-olds? Under Robert Menzies, we saw the home ownership rate go from half to nearly three-quarters of the population. But under the Liberals we're seeing home ownership at a 60-year low.


Labor believes that the great Australian dream has turned into a nightmare under Malcolm Turnbull. We will do something about housing affordability through a plan that will reform negative gearing and the capital gains tax concession. It's a plan which is backed by experts across the political spectrum: Saul Eslake, Chris Richardson, Jeff Kennett, Joe Hockey, the Murray review, the Henry review and the Reserve Bank of Australia. Labor's policy will see the construction of over 55,000 new homes in Australia over three years, creating over 25,000 new jobs. We'll close a tax concession used disproportionately by the most affluent, with surgeons 16 times as likely to negatively gear as nurses. We'll also limit direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds, boost homelessness support for vulnerable Australians, get better results under the National Affordable Housing Agreement, re-establish the National Housing Supply Council and re-initiate a minister for housing.


Every Saturday in Australia, first homebuyers are being outbid at auctions by home speculators. It wasn't always the way. If you go back to the 1990s, the value of loans written for first homebuyers and investors was about the same. Now the ratio is four to one in favour of investors. Prior to the 2017 budget, Minister Sukkar told Sky News, 'The housing package will be extraordinarily large; it will be far-reaching.' But as John Daley from the Grattan Institute said afterwards, 'I can't see any reason why this budget is going to make any discernible difference to housing affordability.' This government has no plans for housing affordability. Labor will tackle the crisis.

"Gee, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-05-29,"



Mr GEE
 (Calare) (15:37):  The Labor Party and the opposition have absolutely no business lecturing the government on housing—or on anything else, for that matter. I think that many Australians will remember what life was like in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. It was a shambles; it was a litany of mismanagement, from the appallingly managed pink batts scheme, which remains a source of shame for those opposite, to the failed Building the Education Revolution, which was shockingly managed. And, of course, now they want to rip $60 billion from Australia's retirees. Australians don't trust those opposite to manage anything.


But, unlike those opposite, as the minister just pointed out a few minutes ago, we do have a multifaceted strategy—a multipronged strategy—to deal with housing. Obviously, firstly, there is the First Home Super Saver scheme, allowing first homebuyers to save for a deposit through superannuation. That's the first point. We're also helping older Australians to downsize by enabling them to make non-concessional superannuation contributions of up to $300,000 for singles and $600,000 for couples—again, to ease pressure on the housing market.


As the minister just pointed out a few minutes ago, we're indexing the homelessness budget, which provides certainty to providers. We've tightened up the capital gains tax laws and exemptions on foreign residents, again, to ease pressure on the housing market. We're establishing the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation and also the National Housing Infrastructure Facility.


We're also delivering a new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement with the states and territories. We are going to make sure that we get better outcomes with respect to the National Affordable Housing Agreement. This strategy goes across all sectors and touches Australians from all walks of life, including those with disabilities. I point out an example of that in my electorate. Through the government's Specialist Disability Accommodation Initiative, last year we turned the first sod on a new $830,000 facility to house people with disabilities in Orange, which is in the Calare electorate. The total spend is $1.6 million. It's a project of four units. It will have a counselling room and carers accommodation. I congratulate Housing Plus for undertaking that work. 


So it is a multifaceted and multipronged strategy. It's taking place against a backdrop of a softening housing market. National dwelling prices have softened in recent months, following several years of strong growth. National price movements have been led by developments in the Sydney and Melbourne markets. I point out that annual dwelling price growth across the eight capital cities fell by 0.3 per cent through the year to March 2018, marking the first negative through-the-year growth in capital city dwelling prices since 2012, with price declines being most pronounced in Sydney, where prices for both houses and units have declined steadily since peaking in the September quarter 2017. So prices are heading in the right direction.


Rental vacancy rates and rental price growth have remained stable at around five-year averages. Rental price growth is subdued and rental yields remained low but stable at 2.9 per cent in December 2017, just under the five-year average of 3.1 per cent. National auction clearance rates have also moderated since the beginning of 2017, falling from nearly 80 per cent in February 2017 to around 63 per cent in March 2018, just below their five-year average. 


In terms of home building, we've experienced one of the largest booms in home building in recent years, with record levels of high-rise construction in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. While the pace of construction has softened in recent quarters, going forward high levels of work in the pipeline, as well as recent strength in new approvals, are expected to keep dwelling investment and approvals elevated by historical standards. So the recent budget forecast dwelling investment to fall by three per cent before rising slightly by 1½ per cent in 2018-19 and remaining flat in 2019-20.


Nobody trusts those opposite to manage anything. In contrast with that, we on this side of the House have a multifaceted plan for housing. (Time expired)

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2018-05-29,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (15:42):  I first met Penny about six years ago. It was about 2011 or 2012. She came to a meeting that I held in Ascot Vale, a suburb in my electorate. It was a meet your local MP meeting. She came along and sat quietly for a while. Eventually she spoke up. She was quite reserved when she did. She said: 'I've never been to one of these things before, but I'm here because I went to uni and I've gone out and found work, but most my work is on contracts and it is a bit insecure. Rent is going up so much now that I can't afford to live near where I do most of my work, which is in the city. I just don't know what to do.' She was almost in tears. She said: 'I just don't think government and politicians understand. Why is it that you can do the right thing and still not be able to afford a roof over your head?' It's a very good question, and it has stayed with me for the last six years.


We are now becoming a society where doing the right thing is no longer enough. Doing the right thing will no longer guarantee that you will have a roof over your head. Part of the reason is that in this country we look at housing and our national tax system treats housing as if it were an investment class, like shares, not a human right. As a result, we've got a tax system that makes housing less affordable, all the while people are being locked out of getting a roof over their head.


What if we turned away tens of thousands of kids from schools every year? If we said to parents, 'You can't send your child to a public school because we just haven't built enough schools,' there would be an outrage, but it seems okay for us to have people sleeping on the street, people couch surfing and people homeless because the government hasn't organised to have enough affordable housing built. We need to start thinking about housing in the same way that we think about schools or think about health care. It is a public right to have a roof over your head, and if people in this country are going without one, we need to do something about it. 


Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know how many rental properties in the whole of Victoria were affordable for a single person on Newstart? Zero. If you are on Newstart and you are a single person, you cannot find an affordable property in Victoria. Because youth allowance hasn't increased, students now find that pretty much all of their youth allowance goes on just paying for usually part of a room, not even a whole room. This means that they have to work around the clock to make ends meet in order to progress their studies. If you're lucky enough to finish your TAFE or university and then go out and start to look to buy, well, you are almost priced out of the market now. It is almost a dream. If we go back to the 1990s, an average house cost six times an average young person's income. Fast forward a couple of decades to now, an average house costs 12 times a young person's income. 


We need to have a rethink about how we think about housing. The first thing we should do is get rid of negative gearing and capital gains tax exemptions. We should phase out capital gains tax exemptions completely and get rid of negative gearing for all new properties and say to people, including those members of parliament who have multiple investment properties, 'You can only have one investment property if you want to claim it on negative gearing, because housing is a human right; it's not there for you to use as an investment class to boost your own income, with the taxpayer picking up half the tab.' If we got rid of those unfair tax breaks, we would have an extra $5 billion a year. An extra $5 billion a year would build a lot of affordable housing. If we had rent control and European-style long-term leases, we would go a long way to making life more secure and more affordable for people who can't afford to buy their own home. 


The one thing that no-one seems to talk about, because it seems to be a dirty word now, the one way of bringing down rents and also increasing stock is building more public housing. Let's put some of that $5 billion into public housing, where the government says: 'If you live there, you pay 25 per cent of your income in rent. You stay there and we will look after the property.' We haven't had a large-scale public housing development built in Victoria—certainly in my area of Melbourne—since the 1960s, and as a result we have about 40,000 people on the waiting list. There is a big slab of public housing land in Flemington around the corner from me, in my electorate. The Labor government is about to knock down some of the public housing. They're about to build 820 new private developments and only 20 new public housing developments. If we're serious, let's have a rethink. Let's stop the sell-offs, build more public housing and have a national housing strategy.

"Landry, Michelle, MP",Nats,2018-05-29,"



Ms LANDRY
 (Capricornia—Chief Nationals Whip) (15:47):  I must say that the inference by the mover of this matter of public importance that there is not already a strategy in place for housing in this country is one of the most blatant cases of fake news I have come across. This coalition government has a strong and sensible strategy to continue to improve the opportunities for Australians to have and to own a house. These measures are many and varied, but I would like to focus on just a couple.


The government is establishing the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation. The NHFIC is a new corporate entity dedicated to improving housing outcomes for Australians. Set to be established by 1 July 2018, the NHFIC will house a $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility, which will partner with eligible recipients to finance critical infrastructure to unlock new housing supply. The NHFIC will also include an affordable housing bond aggregator, AHBA, which aims to provide cheaper and longer-term finance for community housing providers that will drive efficiencies and cost savings in the provision of affordable housing. These are real, sensible measures to deliver a market outcome, without punishing those hardworking Australians who have invested in the housing market, as those opposite would have us do. 


We've heard them mention negative gearing changes, but that's all we hear from them: 'Get rid of negative gearing and everything will come good.' It is a lie, Deputy Speaker. It is a lie they are trying to use to be popular, but it is a deadset falsehood. The most important thing we can do to help people afford their housing needs is to ensure we provide them with a strategy for a strong and vibrant economy. This fundamental need has been a driving force for me during my time in this place, and it is one that I'm proud to say my colleagues on this side of the House share. This coalition government—that has committed itself time and time again to improving the lives of our constituents and giving them more opportunities—takes from them less tax. On the job front, there are plenty of commentators and observers, including those opposite, who do not believe it is possible for this coalition government to deliver on its promise to create one million jobs. We made that undertaking and we delivered on that undertaking: more than 400,000 of those jobs were created across the country last year alone, an incredible feat. 


In dealing with the need to grow the economy, it is abundantly clear that you need to deal with real, job-creating infrastructure—real, job-creating infrastructure like better highways, like mobile phone towers, like damns and weirs, andreal, job-creating infrastructure like Rookwood Weir. Right across this country, this government has committed to real funding to see new water infrastructure developed. A suite of dams and weirs across the country received funding to see their feasibility tested. The long-awaited Rookwood project near Gogango received not only the $2 million it needed to conduct the business case study but also $126 million towards its construction. This contribution, once it is eventually matched by the Labor state government, means all required construction funding is on the table. Why has the state government not started building? 


Rookwood Weir promises to deliver over 200 jobs through construction and to produce an economic boom for Central Queensland worth over $1 billion and over 2,000 jobs. This is a huge benefit for our region and one that would see the cities of Rockhampton and Gladstone as well as the Capricorn Coast provided with the water security they deserve and need. The vast majority of jobs delivered in the long term will be through increased agriculture output thanks to the extra water landholders will have access to. We all know the phrase 'water is life', but what many don't realise is that water is life for not only plants and animals but communities. We need projects like Rookwood Weir to make our regional communities like Rockhampton stronger. 


Stronger regional communities with stronger regional economies mean more money in people's pockets and, therefore, greater access to housing. The Labor Party has made it abundantly clear that their support for major infrastructure projects is entirely dependent on political outcomes. They have no interest in supporting a project because it's a good idea—hence the long, drawn-out chain-dragging we've seen from the Queensland government on this project. It is hugely disappointing to see members opposite accuse this government of not helping Australians get in their own home, when it is only this coalition government delivering on the jobs and economic needs for all Australians.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-05-29,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (15:52):  While I'm delighted to make my contribution to this debate, I just can't let the comments from the member for Capricornia go unanswered. I'm a great supporter of infrastructure and know how important it is in our regions, and I understand the member for Capricornia is a really hardworking, sincere member of parliament, but what we need in this national strategy is real wins on the ground. While many of the things that she says might be true in Queensland, in my electorate of north-east Victoria we certainly have a real problem. I'd be calling on my colleagues in the National Party, many of whom are in the House today, to seriously work with their Liberal colleagues on developing a strategy for rural and regional Australia that addresses the real and significant problems that we are experiencing. 


Let me talk, for example, about some of the statistics in north-east Victoria, and I will talk about my major towns of Wodonga and Wangaratta. These statistics are provided by Beyond Housing, which is a community housing authority. They saw more than 2,700 people in the last year: 52 per cent were women, 42 per cent were families and 136 people in Wodonga and Wangaratta were sleeping in the open, in a tent or in a car. If you add that to that the story we've just heard about Denison, it's clear we're not making this up. These are people without housing, in the cold, in winter. So, there is a real problem in my electorate, and I'm really pleased to be part of this debate today. I did hear the minister speak. If he thinks he's doing enough, he is absolutely deluded. I'm here as a crossbencher, not a member of the opposition; my job is to speak for my electorate and to try to make the government's programs better. To support what I'm saying, I have some research that was done by La Trobe University, Housing affordability and homelessness in the Hume region – Victoria, which I would like to address. I would also like to finish on a very positive note. As is traditional in our country areas, and certainly in my electorate, my community is actively acting and doing something about this housing crisis. I would like to make reference to a forum that was held in Yackandandah two weeks ago to do something locally about this problem.


In the La Trobe study, they are telling us that housing affordability and homelessness are significant right across Australia, and they've got the data. They say that housing issues effect the population as a whole, and we've heard the story about that. We've heard that homelessness is complex and it's not solely related to housing; it's the lack of access to suitable forms of housing, transport, income and wellness in yourself. The absence of current policies targeting housing affordability and homelessness at both the Commonwealth and state level is problematic, says La Trobe University. It's totally independent and a very factual report on what we are trying to deal with. I would encourage my colleagues in the National Party to have a read of the La Trobe report and pay some attention to it. We've got a significant problem, and it doesn't only come out from the housing organisations or the service organisations that try and support people with emergency food, with travel, with trying to get to a doctor and with the counselling that goes with it. They are all coming to my office and saying that things are not working out well. It's a significant problem.


I would like to spend a few minutes of my time to talk about what my community is doing. Two week ago, in Yackandandah, 120 people turned up for an innovating housing forum, to look at how small rural communities can do something about what's actually happening in our community. They had a fantastic day, with attendees from Benalla, Wangaratta, Wodonga, Tallangatta, Mount Beauty and even Melbourne visiting. Not only did we hear ideas about the role of local government and about design; we also talked about the role of the health service providers. Annette Nuck, the CEO of Yackandandah Health, told the audience of the radical ideas that aged-care and health facilities are planning for Yackandandah. What's clearly evident is that our people and communities want to be part of the solution. They have ideas about what will work for them. They want to be part of the answer, not just a top-down government telling us what to do. Really and truly, we could involve our communities. Particularly, our regional communities are so keen to make sure that not only the homelessness problem is addressed but also in our old age we've got housing that actually works to our needs and works towards the long-term survival and sustainability of our country towns.


The final thing I want to say about the housing stuff and to the minister present is that it's not just a government solution by itself; you've actually got to work with communities, with local government and with the housing authorities. Clearly, and strongly from the backbench and the crossbench here, what you're doing is not working and it's certainly not working in my area of regional Australia.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2018-05-29,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (15:57):  It was very pleasing to hear the member for Fenner's contribution during this debate, talking about Robert Menzies's 'forgotten people' speech. I hope the member for Fenner reads that and studies it. He may learn something so that he can make a valuable contribution to this House rather than some of the rants that we hear.


When we talk about housing affordability—and I would like to congratulate the member for Denison for moving this motion, because, honourable member, you are correct: we do have an issue in this country with housing affordability and housing. You're absolutely right. We only have to look at some of the recent numbers. The median house price in Sydney is currently over $1 million. The median price is $1,180,000 in Sydney. In Melbourne, the median price is over $900,000. Now, if we make some comparisons to the USA, we look at places like San Antonio in Texas. The equivalent median house price there is $357,000—and that's Australian dollars. That's one-third of the median price in Sydney. In Austin, Texas, it's the equivalent of A$446,000. In Houston, Texas, it's the equivalent of A$399,000. In Dallas-Fort Worth, it's the equivalent of A$485,000. We can see how the cost of housing in this country has got out of control for the average Australian.


We ask why. The simple reason is that it goes back to those old equations of supply and demand. During the Howard years we had an average rate of migration of around 100,000, 110,000 or 120,000. Even then, we were struggling to keep up the supply of housing for that rate of migration. I'm not saying migration should be higher or lower; all I'm saying is that, whatever rate we have, we have to make sure that we match that with the housing starts.


But in 2007, during the first years of the Labor government we saw that, instead of the 100,000 we'd been used for the 10 years before, we had a net migration rate that was kicked up to 244,000; in 2008, it was kicked up to 315,700; and in 2009 we still had 264,000. So, in the first three years of the previous Labor government we had a net migration rate of 806,000 people. I am not saying that's good or bad. The problem is that we didn't build the houses to house those people. You cannot have a net migration rate of 800,000 people over three years without that number of housing starts. That is what has happened, and we have seen prices explode across the nation. For the average Australian, it is a false economy to think that your house has gone up in price, because all it means is that the gap is bigger if you want to upgrade. So, for most Australians, the increase we have seen in housing costs has benefited only a small number of people.


We hear the policy prescriptions. The coalition, as the minister at the table said, is working on a suite of policies to tackle this housing affordability issue. But what do we hear from the Labor Party—the old chestnut they dig up, the class warfare rhetoric? They want to tackle the so-called problems of negative gearing. We saw exactly what happened when Labor tried this policy before. Remember when Paul Keating did it—we had to tackle negative gearing, this horrible thing. And what happened? The price of rents in Sydney went through the roof. Where demand was tight and you got rid of negative gearing all that happened was that people didn't invest in investment housing that was needed for people who were renting, and chose to rent, and that put rents through the roof. Again, a typical Labor policy that causes more harm than good. That is exactly what the Labor policy would cause.


In contrast, I'm glad to see that we are doing many things, and I'm especially glad that we are doing something with superannuation. When I first started to work, superannuation was only three per cent and I was able to put some income away for a deposit on a house, rather than the government tell me what I had to do with it—to put it into some compulsory account where people would take fees and charges out. We are enabling young Australians to put $15,000 a year—a $30,000 maximum—into their super to use for housing. We need more of this and we need to work on this issue in a bipartisan way.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:02):  I'm pleased to stand here to speak on the urgent need for a national housing strategy and to follow the member for Hughes to provide some sensibility around this debate and not talk about house pricing in Texas. Recently, there was a second forum in my electorate of Lindsay, which was hosted by the Sydney Alliance and a number of housing providers. Not one single Liberal representative turned up—not a councillor, not a state MP, nor the duty senator. This isn't the first time they've snubbed their nose and not turned up. They weren't present at the last one I was at, back in February, either.


This tells you two things about the Liberal Party. They don't see housing as an issue worthy of their time or they don't care about those who are affected by homelessness or housing stress. Before I arrived in this place I was an active volunteer for Pay It Forward and the chair of the homeless interagency convened by Penrith City Council. Both of these gave me the opportunity to understand the complexities that contribute to and create the 116,500 homeless people, as counted on census night. I thank both of these organisations for their work in our community.


The number of homeless people aged 12 to 24 is over 32 per cent—which should bring us to our knees—which is a significant number of young people. The number of homeless people aged over 55 has steadily increased over the past three census counts. In fact, the fastest growing group of homeless people are older women—women who are have retired without enough superannuation, have been through a divorce or have had their casual job hours reduced, not to mention the persistent gender wage gap during their entire working lives.


Australians need a government with a plan. We need an urgent housing strategy that addresses the issue, not a government who's only plan is to fund an $80 billion windfall for big businesses. For a government who hates those who need help the most we shouldn't be surprised by this, though. They come in here all the time and beat up on people who are on support payments, telling them to get a job, a better education or rich parents. You could almost start a board game of 'They said what now?' and attempt to guess which politician made the most outrageous statement.


We know that the best contributor to reducing welfare dependency is stable affordable housing and that the opposite of that is one of the largest contributors to intergenerational inequality. You only need to look at our First Nations people to understand that.


We need a government with a housing strategy, not a Prime Minister who is so out of touch that his own housing arrangements include not moving into the prime ministerial residence at Kirribilli, preferring to stay in his own home at Point Piper, because it would be a downgrade. How would anyone as out of touch as that know what it's like to sleep rough or to be in housing stress, or what it's like to apply for five rental properties as a single parent and be denied every single time simply because you're a single mum?


We need a plan and a government to champion the people, not a government that sees rental stress on the rise—it has gone up more than 40 per cent since this government came to office. Since this government came to office, home ownership is now at a 60-year low, having dropped more than 40 per cent in the last 30 years.


We need a government that won't just champion big business tax cuts, hoping that it somehow magically trickles down if you shake the tree enough. It's now 12 months since the 2017 budget decision to establish a bond aggregator through the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Bill. I'd like to add, proudly, that this was a bread-and-butter Labor policy that we announced, and a policy the government has adopted. Congratulations! We welcomed this. But not one single state or territory jurisdiction has signed on.


We need a plan, and this government simply doesn't have one. It doesn't have one when it comes to wage theft, to closing the gender pay gap, to addressing unemployment or to fixing the housing crisis. Only Labor has a plan. A plan that begins with understanding the issue would be a great start for this Prime Minister.


The latest Productivity Commission report found that there are 527,588 households in rental stress—that is more than half a million people—defined as spending more than a third of their income on housing. Imagine that if you were a Newstart recipient. It's a shame that the member for Chisholm is not here. The effects of housing stress are well known, and, as this report finds, housing instability and homelessness can, in turn, increase vulnerability to adverse social and economic circumstances through, for example, poor outcomes in education, employment and health, and an increased risk of involvement with the justice system.


In my electorate of Lindsay, there are over 2,000 state-housing-authority-owned dwellings. The people of my community work hard for what they earn. However, the odds are stacked against them, sadly.


We have a plan for housing affordability. It's a plan that is good for the budget, good for productivity, good for jobs and good for my community in Lindsay. We have a plan to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax. I have somebody in my electorate who owns so many rental properties that his income from those rental properties is $1 million per month. He's also getting negative gearing tax credits on that. We need a government with a plan, not this shabby mob on the other side.

"Goodenough, Ian, MP",LP,2018-05-29,"



Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:07):  I've listened to the various contributions from honourable members on the need for a national housing strategy to promote housing affordability for all Australians. The coalition government has implemented a number of measures to promote investment in the housing market through increasing the supply of residential lots and the construction of dwellings to meet demand for housing, thereby promoting greater housing affordability.


Prior to entering parliament, I came from a local government and property-development background. Housing affordability is closely related to the release of land. What is required is a more streamlined town-planning and environmental-approvals process, working closely with state and local government authorities to ensure that new lots can be efficiently serviced with electricity, water and gas, sewerage and telecommunications. In addition, investment in infrastructure—roads; rail; transport infrastructure—by the federal government lays the foundation for more land releases in suburban areas around our cities.


As financing and holding costs account for a significant proportion of the cost of land, timely approvals processes and construction are an important factor in keeping costs under control. The promotion of medium-density development, smart cities and livable neighbourhoods is brought about by existing government policies and by working in partnership with the private sector through developer-contribution schemes for the provision of infrastructure and community facilities.


Similarly, the coalition government has a number of policies which promote investment in property development and create supply in the housing market. One such measure is maintaining the current capital gains tax discount at 50 per cent for assets held more than a year. In contrast, under Labor's proposal 75 per cent of capital gains will be taxed at an individual's marginal rate. A coalition government will also maintain the existing negative gearing arrangements to assist people to save and invest in property for their future financial security and independence.


To help create more housing supply, the government is replacing the National Affordable Housing Agreement, which provides $1.3 billion a year to the states and territories, with a new set of agreements requiring them to deliver on housing supply targets. The government is also establishing a $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility to fund City Deals that remove infrastructure impediments to developing new homes. The government is creating an online Commonwealth land registry detailing sites that can be made available for residential development such as the sale of surplus Commonwealth land such as that surplus of Defence Force requirements. The coalition is establishing a new Housing Finance and Investment Corporation to provide long-term, low-cost finance to support more affordable rental housing. We're also allowing managed investment trusts to be used to develop and own affordable housing, providing investors affordable housing with a greater income certainty by enabling direct deduction of welfare payments from tenants and increasing the capital gains tax discount tax for 60 per cent for investments in affordable housing. Finally, there is the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which allows individuals to make voluntary contributions up to $15,000 per year and $30,000 in total to their superannuation account to purchase their first home.


Housing affordability is one of the six focus themes that the coalition government has identified for action by City Deals depending on local priorities and issues, increasing the availability and affordability of housing near job opportunities and transport connections, which will deliver important social and economic outcomes while also contributing to improved liveability through smart design and reduced travel times. In addition, the budget, through disciplined fiscal management, ensuring that wage growth is matched by productivity growth, helps keep inflation under control, which in turns take pressure off interest rates. Maintaining a low-interest-rate environment is important to ensure housing affordability for millions of Australians paying off their mortgages in our suburbs.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (16:13):  In noting my concerns about the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse redress scheme legislation, I point out that I have concerns about the support services being provided and the time limits, but I also have significant concern about the monetary limits. The National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 limits the redress available to survivors to a maximum of $150,000 to any one survivor. The royal commission recommended that the maximum amount payable to survivors should be $200,000 and the minimum should be $10,000, with the average payment being $65,000.


By accepting an offer for redress, a survivor will be signing away their right to pursue a claim for compensation against the institution. It is important that survivors are adequately remunerated through the redress scheme. Obviously, no amount of money will ever, ever repair the emotional damage done to survivors or go any way to regaining their stolen childhood or recovering the life opportunities that they have missed, but nevertheless money can help rebuild lives. This will be the one and only chance for these survivors to seek redress. I want to make sure it is adequate to rebuild their lives.


We're all aware of the horrific abuse that occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants, and we're also aware that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention, but this bill limits the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia or are Australian citizens. It is unfair that survivors of child sexual abuse that occurred in Australia are not able to access the same redress scheme if they have returned to their country of birth and are no longer residing in Australia. So I call on the government to ensure that this group of survivors is also able to access the redress scheme.


The royal commission recommended that survivors who accept an offer under the redress scheme be able to access counselling for the rest of their lives, but the government bill only provides survivors with access to state-provided services for the length of the scheme or with a payment of up to $5,000 to put towards counselling. For survivors whose lives have been utterly shattered, who have had to face their tormenters to retell their stories and who will never truly get over the trauma that has been inflicted on them, the paltry provision of counselling in this bill is woeful. All of the elements of redress are important, but counselling needs to be ongoing to be of any utility at all. It is critical that the provision of counselling be addressed and revised urgently.


Survivors who have been led into criminality should not be denied access to redress. There is clear evidence that people with a history of childhood sexual abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. Denying this group of survivors access to redress not only will deny them the ability to rebuild their lives but is likely to foster recidivism. Attorney-General Porter, I would suggest to you that this exclusion is cruel, short-sighted and unfair.


Although I have concerns about this bill, as I've outlined, a national redress scheme is crucial to the more than 60,000 survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. No amount of money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced by survivors, but redress is an important step along the road to healing for survivors of child sexual abuse. When the royal commission released their interim report in 2015, Labor was the first to announce support for a national redress scheme. It took the Turnbull government until 2016 to commit to a redress scheme.  It is very encouraging that Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have all publicly announced that they will participate in the National Redress Scheme. I encourage the three other jurisdictions to also sign up to the scheme. For survivors to obtain justice, the scheme must be a national scheme. I urge churches, charities, and other institutions to stand up and be counted and to opt into the redress scheme now. I urge the parishioners and supporters, people connected with these institutions, to tell them to sign up for the scheme now. Whatever has happened is in the past, but it must be remedied in the future, and the future must include a national redress scheme. Working together, Australia can move forward. We must not forget the past, obviously, but we must make sure it is never, ever repeated again, and that is a task for all of us.


Labor will work with the government to address these concerns, because a national redress scheme is so important, and it's important right now. The bills have been referred to a Senate inquiry. This inquiry will allow the community to be consulted on points of difference in these bills and the earlier Commonwealth legislation. The inquiry is due to report to the Senate before the Senate next sits. With the proposed start date of the bills being 1 July 2018, barely a month away, the Senate inquiry will not delay the start of the scheme. Labor fully understands the importance of a national redress scheme, so we will support this bill in the House and, as always, we will continue discussions with the government to resolve the concerns that we hold about these bills. A national redress scheme is too important to delay any further, and it is too important, equally, to get wrong.


So, to all of the survivors who had the courage to tell their stories and to sit in those rooms, both public and private, with the commissioners I say thank you. I will do all I can make to make sure the National Redress Scheme is the best that it can possibly be. To the commissioners and all their staff, I again say thank you. I would like to finish with the words of a survivor in a note sent to the royal commission so that the words of these courageous people who spoke up are the final words in my speech, because it is because of their courage that we have this legislation in front of the House right now:


Thank you for the opportunity to tell my story—you cannot know what it meant to be listened to with such respect and made to feel what happened to me really mattered. I hope my experience will help to promote the change needed to prevent this ever happening to another child.

Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (16:20):  The implementation of a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse has been a long time coming for this country, as the member for Moreton outlined in his powerful address to the House today. Survivors of child sexual abuse have been waiting their whole lives for redress for the horrific crimes that were perpetrated against them as children. For decades they have suffered in silence, tormented by the truly awful acts committed against them over many, many years. We've heard it's a long road to recovery for these victims, but hopefully the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse will begin to heal the wounds that they have suffered.


I'm honoured to be a member of the joint select committee on the oversight of the implementation of redress-related recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, alongside my Labor colleagues the member for Newcastle and Queensland senator Claire Moore and alongside other senators and members in this place. The national redress scheme is as a result of the royal commission into institutional responses, which the previous Labor government, as we heard, created in 2013. Over the subsequent five years, 16,953 people who were within the terms of reference contacted the royal commission. The commission heard from 7,981 survivors of child sexual abuse, in 8,013 private sessions. They received 1,344 written accounts and referred 2,562 matters to police. Every single one of those statistics matters because every single one of those people matters. These striking numbers only begin to scratch the surface, clearly, of just how big this issue is for thousands of Australians.


I want to sincerely thank each and every single survivor who shared their story. I can only imagine that this took an enormous amount of courage and composure. Words are simply not enough to describe the harrowing nature and the horror of the stories that came forward. The average age of victims when first abused was just 10 years old, with 85 per cent of survivors saying they'd experienced multiple episodes of abuse. But actions speak louder than words, and we now have an opportunity to address the many wrongs of the past.


The royal commissioners outlined a clear vision for what a national redress scheme would be in their final report on civil litigation and redress in 2015. Like many of the colleagues who have spoken in this debate already, I want to add my thanks to the commissioners and all of their staff—in particular their staff—for their careful and considered work over five years. I simply cannot imagine what it was like to be a staff member dealing with this important issue. We understand that they did not make these recommendations lightly.


I believe that the recommendations should be implemented faithfully and as much as possible. But, like my colleagues on this side of the House and as the Leader of the Opposition outlined last week, I do have a number of concerns with the legislation before the House—the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018—as it's drafted. It is critical that any scheme provides survivors with the genuine opportunity to access justice and that it takes into account and caters for the unique needs of this group.


As we've heard, the bills have been referred to a Senate inquiry so that the community can be consulted on the points of difference in these bills and the earlier Commonwealth legislation. In the light of the proposed start date of 1 July 2018, this inquiry is due to report before the Senate next sits so that the inquiry does not delay the commencement of the scheme. As a gesture of good faith in our ongoing discussions with the government to resolve Labor's concerns and an acknowledgement of our longstanding commitment to the establishment of a redress scheme, Labor will support the bills in the House today. But, as we have heard, there is more work to be done, and it starts by working together. We know that the Victorian and New South Wales governments have already signed up to the redress scheme, with Tasmania also announcing their intention to join this week. I was particularly pleased to hear recently of my home state of Queensland also signing up to the scheme. That decision opens the door for Queensland based non-government institutions to join the redress scheme. In announcing that the Queensland government will pay its share to survivors of sexual abuse in government-run institutions, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said that it was an important milestone, acknowledging the suffering of those abused in care. As the Premier said, although no amount of money can return a lost childhood, it is important that we acknowledge what these victims have been through. Ten thousand Queenslanders are expected to be eligible: 5,000 abused in government institutions and another 5,000 in non-government institutions. It's certainly a step in the right direction, but, as I mentioned earlier and as other members of the opposition have indicated, we still have concerns with the bill as it stands. 


As the redress scheme begins operation from 1 July this year, we must ensure there are enough support services for all survivors who are considering making an application for redress and that the services are accessible, no matter where the survivor lives or what language the survivor speaks. We simply can't be left in a situation where we have an unfunded and under-resourced scheme which has been such a long time coming. There can be no excuses that we did not know. We need to make sure that survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. As we know, the bill gives applicants six months to make this decision, while the royal commission recommended a year. It's important that survivors have sufficient time to consider this decision, as only one application to the scheme is permitted. I think it's safe to say that for many this will be an emotional and overwhelming process and it will take time. 


There's no policy rationale for rushing this process. Simply choosing to apply will mean many survivors will have to relive their horrific past as they recall the acts committed against them. This will no doubt have a heavy emotional burden and will result in some survivors needing extended time to make a decision. The bill places an upper limit, as we know, of $150,000 on the amount of redress that would be payable to any one survivor. The royal commission, as we have heard, recommended the maximum payment be $200,000, that the minimum payment be $10,000 and the average payment be around $65,000. Accepting an offer will also mean signing away any rights survivors may have to pursue their claim for compensation through litigation. There are heavy pressures we will be placing on already very vulnerable people. 


The bill also limits eligibility to the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia or are Australian citizens. We know that horrific abuse occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants and that the abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention. I am concerned these people will not have access to redress if they have returned to their country of birth, and today I call on the government to confirm that provision will be made for these groups of survivors to access the National Redress Scheme.


I am also concerned that the counselling provided to survivors through the scheme will not be adequate. The royal commission recommended that people accessing the scheme be allowed counselling for the rest of their life. The bill only provides access to state provided services for a length of the scheme or a payment of only up to $5,000 towards counselling. These arrangements are woefully inadequate and I call on the government to give assurances that this will be addressed. Survivors often consider the government is responsible for the abuse and do not wish to use state or institution-run services. I really do think this needs to be taken into account by states when delivering services. Survivors who are granted redress late in the life of the scheme could also be disadvantaged because they will not be able to access services for the same length of time as survivors who are granted redress early in the life of the scheme. It's important that this is taken into account in any future reviews. For survivors that receive the $5,000 payment, this amount of money will not provide adequate access to support. 


The government has sought to place restrictions on survivors who themselves have a criminal history from accessing the redress scheme. We believe this is deeply unfair. This would require those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more to request special permission from the scheme operator to access the scheme. The rule ignores strong evidence that shows that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. The facts on this matter cannot and should not be ignored. For many, the root of their problems will be an horrific experience they suffered as a child and which clearly led them to a life of crime. To punish them unfairly now would be only to further deepen their already traumatic wounds.


In closing, there is no excuse for any state government, church, institution or non-government organisation not to join the redress scheme. With only a matter of weeks until the proposed 1 July start date, Labor urges all states and institutions to sign up to the scheme as soon as possible. Survivors of institutional child sex abuse have been waiting for redress for decades. They shouldn't have to wait any longer.


Redress means so much more to the 60,000 survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. I understand that no money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced by survivors. However, redress is a vital step along the path to healing for survivors of child sexual abuse. I believe it's incumbent upon all of us in this parliament to work together on further improvements to ensure we get the best possible redress scheme for survivors. I want to make it clear today that I will continue to work with the states and my colleagues towards making sure we address the issues of concern that I've identified today.


Once we've got the agreement in place and once all the states, churches and other institutions have signed up to an agreement, I believe only then may we have an opportunity in the future for us to build on this and for us to do much more as part of the healing process.

"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (16:31):  I rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sex Abuse Bill 2018. On 12 November 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced the appointment of a royal commission into institutional child sex abuse in Australia. She said at that time:


Any instance of child abuse is a vile and evil thing.


She continued:


… too many children have suffered child abuse.


We knew Prime Minister Gillard was correct. She continued:




They have also seen other adults let them down.



They’ve not only had their trust betrayed by the abuser, but other adults that  could have acted to assist them have failed to do so.


Prime Minister Gillard and the Labor caucus understood the importance of finally giving these people a voice:


There have been revelations of child abusers being moved from place to place rather than the nature of their abuse and their crimes being dealt with.


There have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil.


The commission received 41,770 calls, 25,770 letters and emails, held more than 8,000 private sessions and 57 public hearings, and made nearly 2,600 referrals to police and other authorities. Thousands of brave and courageous individuals shared thousands of brave and courageous conversations, many of them for the first time.


The sharing of these conversations, experiences and stories saved lives. The commission heard of experiences from over many decades from people with disabilities; from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; from people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and from those who were in prison at the time of their abuse.


The inquiry lasted five years and was recorded in the 17 volumes of the final report. Many people, as I said, were speaking for the first time. The report produced a range of recommendations, including providing victims and survivors with access to the appropriate support and treatment; reducing the stigma of child sex abuse; encouraging victims to speak out and seek support and treatment; and promoting best practice in providing treatment and support services.


No amount of money can ever repair the pain and hurt inflicted. I know everyone has said that in this debate. But it is also clear that these crimes cannot go unacknowledged and uncompensated. Redress is a vital step in the journey towards healing, and everyone—every single member of this chamber and this House—understands that.


It was clear that many victims and survivors were in need of a great deal of support and treatment. However, it is also clear that victims and survivors were simply not accessing compensation. They were either reluctant or otherwise unlikely to pursue compensation through the courts system. Survivors were less inclined to want to relive their experiences and traumas in the public hearings. Furthermore, the prospects of a successful claim for compensation were also not guaranteed. In many instances and especially with the passage of time, there would be great difficulty in collecting evidence or making contact with witnesses, let alone perpetrators. It was a very, very brave thing for people to give evidence. The capacity for perpetrators to provide for compensation was uncertain, and the liability of institutional entities for perpetrators was also unclear. Without redress schemes, many victims would simply not have the opportunity to access monetary compensation in relation to their injuries, whether physical, emotional of, of course, psychological.


Today I rise to acknowledge the injustices and hurts committed on the watch of various state, territory and federal governments and many church and other institutions. I rise today to acknowledge the victims and survivors who participated in this inquiry. I rise to support them, and I rise to support this bill.


The scheme provides three elements of redress, in the form of a redress payment, counselling and psychological services, and a direct personal response from the institutions. Survivors will be provided with access to legal advice services. The scheme will cover sexual abuse and any related non-sexual abuse that occurred when the person was a child and where an institution is primarily or equally responsible for that abuse. The intention of this payment is to recognise the wrong that person suffered, to acknowledge that trauma and to listen to the truth. Access to counselling or psychological services is intended to enable survivors to access trauma-informed and culturally appropriate counselling or psychological services. Survivors will also have the opportunity, if they wish, to receive a direct personal response from the participating institution responsible for that abuse. The survivor will have the chance to have their abuse acknowledged and tell their personal story of the abuse they suffered and the impact on them. This, to me, is the most important aspect of this scheme.


I want to take a moment to briefly discuss the significance of the scheme for First Nations people. The disproportionate impact of abuse on First Nations peoples was explored by the inquiry in its final report. The inquiry found:


… Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are significantly overrepresented in out-of-home care and youth detention, exposing them to environments with greater risk. Racism and lack of cultural safety can also increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's vulnerability and prevent them from speaking out.


It also said First Nations people were placed at significantly greater risk of abuse because of disproportionately greater prevalence of removal from family. It is clear that the consequences of abuse were compounded by, as the inquiry states, the impacts of colonisation, past social policies and the legacy of the stolen generations. First Nations people were placed at greater risk of abuse by reason of racism, denigration of identity and culture, and the destruction of language and intergenerational trauma. The stigma of sexual abuse further perpetuated the disconnection from family, community, cultural traditions and country. The inquiry found that widespread institutionalisation of children fractured whole communities, disrupting relationships and traditional ways of healing. The report also discussed the cultural base barriers inhibiting disclosure and seeking support. Survivors often said they tried to disclose during childhood but were ignored, dismissed or punished. These experiences meant that many First Nations survivors simply could not trust police, government and people in leadership positions. Many institutions simply did not respect, recognise or acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures.


But the report also made a finding about the importance of culture and identity in the healing process. The royal commission found that being strong in culture is protective for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's wellbeing because it can support strong identity, high self-esteem and strong attachments. Strong cultural identity, positive community connections and connections to culture are strong sources of resilience and healing. It is difficult to ignore how the issues of institutionalised child abuse and the removal of First Nations children are inextricably linked.


Before closing I, as have other members of this side of the House, will briefly reiterate our areas of concern, which have previously been outlined primarily by the member for Jagajaga but by other people making a contribution as well. Firstly, we want to make sure there are enough support services for all survivors of child sexual abuse and that they are accessible, no matter where the survivor lives. The bill also limits eligibility to the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia or Australian citizens. We know that horrific abuse occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants, and that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention.


Secondly, we want to make sure the survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. Accepting an offer will also mean signing away any rights that survivors may have to pursue their claim for compensation through litigation. This is a very major decision. We are also concerned that the counselling provided is not adequate. The royal commission recommended, as other members have said, lifelong access to counselling, but this bill provides only $5,000 worth of counselling. We believe the government's placement of restrictions on the ability of survivors with a criminal history, primarily people in jail, to access the redress scheme is absolutely wrong. This ignores the evidence showing that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. This part of the bill must be changed.


In conclusion, I take a few moments to recall my personal involvement with people who have been brave enough to give their story. Almost a decade ago in the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney as the then Minister for Community Services I led the state government's apology to the forgotten Australians. I also, along with many other people, was here in 2008 when Kevin Rudd gave his apology to the stolen generations. I was also here in the federal parliament when the apology was given to the forgotten Australians. You were in the presence of people that you knew had such a generosity, such a desire to heal and such a spirit that had been damaged as children, and you could see it in the faces of the people that participated in those apologies. You could also see resilience, pride and an absolute understanding that their stories, their experiences and their reality—their lives—were finally being acknowledged by all people in this country. They are extraordinarily powerful moments and things to do.


I thank the survivors for sharing their stories. I thank the tremendous staff of the royal commission, who assisted and supported survivors in what must have been an incredibly difficult process that I know many people thought long and hard about. I thank former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, former Attorney-General Nicola Roxon and the member for Jagajaga, as well as members of the government, for their tireless work in making redress a reality. All members from both sides of the House spoke with heart on this bill. The bill is the final product of many and will mean so much to many. We will continue to have discussions of the concerns we have outlined about this bill, but for now I commend this bill to the House, particularly on behalf of the many thousands of people who made submissions and gave testimony both in private and in public. It is their strength, their honesty and, above all, their bravery to share their stories that has lifted a lid on an incredibly ugly part of the Australian narrative. To them I dedicate the words that I say today.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (16:44):  We tell our kids that monsters don't exist, but that's a lie—they do exist. We have always known it. We have just chosen to ignore it or pretended that they're not there hiding in the darkness and in places that most people never see. But we can't do that anymore because the royal commission has dragged some of these vampires out into the sunlight. 


Stan was 12 when one of these monsters arrived at the Christian Brothers orphanage in 1953. His name was Brother Benton. A couple of weeks after he arrived he started raping Stan. Sometimes he raped him three times a week. That lasted for two years. Just try to imagine that. Just try for a minute to imagine the trauma that that little boy suffered for all that time and that as a man he still suffers to this day. 


It took Stan 59 years to tell anyone what had happened to him. A few years ago he told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. He never told the other boys at the orphanage what was happening to him. He never knew what was happening to them as well, but now he does. The same thing was happening to them. Two of them have since committed suicide.


There are thousands and thousands of stories like this—children raped and tortured by monsters in shepherd's clothing. No amount of money can compensate you for that. It can't repair the damage that they did to Stan. What could? But that's not a reason not to do it. Getting the governments, the churches and the organisations that allowed this to happen to pay for what they have done—to pay for what happened under their roofs—is the very least that we can do. And that's what the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and related bill do. They set up a redress scheme, a compensation scheme, for people like Stan. It is the key recommendation of the royal commission.


These bills don't do everything that the royal commission recommended, and I'm disappointed by that. The amount that you can claim is less than what the royal commission recommended. The amount of time you have to accept an offer is also less than what the royal commission recommended. It also doesn't implement the royal commission's recommendation that people like Stan have lifelong access to counselling services. The legislation is not perfect and it's not the way that we would have done it, but I'm not going to use my time in this debate picking apart what we are about to vote on. We can't amend it here without unravelling the agreements that the government has already struck with the states, and I don't want to do that. I don't think anybody wants to do that. We all want this scheme to start as soon as possible.


Instead, let me thank the people who have got us this far. I want to thank Justice McClellan and the six other royal commissioners for the time, dedication and professionalism that they took to this task. I want to thank them for the recommendations that they have given us and, most importantly, for making sure that so many people so silent for so long were finally heard—heard and believed. I want to thank Stan and the more than 75,000 other people who mustered the courage to tell their story. The royal commission would have failed without them.


I want to thank the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin. I know a lot of people in this debate have mentioned Jenny and the work that she has done. It is impossible to thank her enough. And I want to thank Julia Gillard. I feel very sure in saying that there wouldn't have been a royal commission without either of them. Without Jenny or Julia we wouldn't be here today setting up this scheme.


And I want to thank someone who hasn't been mentioned in this debate so far but really should be. Her name is Joanne McCarthy. Joanne is a journalist at the Newcastle Herald. She's no ordinary journalist. She is a Gold Walkley winner. She won that award for the more than 1,000 stories she wrote that exposed what happened in the Maitland-Newcastle diocese over so many years. She's everything that any young journalist would hope to be. She's fearless and unrelenting. She earned the trust of people like Stan, who had no reason to ever trust anyone ever again, and she inspired a Prime Minister to act. On her last night as Prime Minister, the last letter that Julia Gillard wrote was to Joanne McCarthy and it was to thank her for everything that she'd done. I was there the night that Joanne McCarthy won her gold Walkley and I remember what she said to the audience. She said: 'It just shows you don't need an army, you just need people believing that something had to be done …' Joanne McCarthy is one of those people.


Twenty-six years ago, another extraordinary woman named Joanna Penglase put an ad in 21 local papers across Sydney. She was doing a thesis at university and was reaching out to other people like her who'd grown up in homes and institutions and orphanages and asked them to ring her and tell her their story. A lot of people rang. One of the people that picked up the phone and rang Joanna was a middle-aged mum from Georges Hall in my electorate. Her name is Leonie Sheedy. Leonie called Joanna and it was a phone call that changed both their lives. Joanna still remembers the phone call. Leonie said to her 'How come nobody's talking about this? How come we never hear about it? Why isn't it known?' It's known now and that's due, in large part, to the work of Joanna and Leonie because they set up an organisation called CLAN—Care Leavers Australasia Network—an organisation dedicated to fighting for people like Stan, fighting for recognition, fighting for justice, fighting for an apology, fighting for compensation. Just to give you an idea about what these two women have achieved over that time, in 2003 they fought for and got the Senate to conduct an inquiry into children in institutional care. In 2010, they fought for and they got an apology from the Prime Minister of Australia at the time, Kevin Rudd, the then Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull and the Australian parliament.


Leonie is still fighting today. If you look carefully at the TV footage of the royal commission over the last five years or so, you'd often see Leonie out the front of the royal commission, not inside of it, with other members of CLAN emblazoned in their blue and gold outfits, making sure that everybody inside the royal commission knew that their job was to make sure that justice was done. And she's still fighting today to get South Australia and Western Australia to sign up to this scheme that we're legislating right here. She's still fighting to make sure that all the churches and all the organisations responsible for what happened sign up to this scheme as well, and to make sure that in the future this legislation is fairer and better than it is now and as good as it should be. There's only one Leonie Sheedy—anybody who knows Leonie Sheedy knows that. Like my good friend in this place, Richard Marles, we're privileged to call her our friend.


A few weeks ago, Leonie's office in Bankstown was robbed. The robbers stole eight laptop computers, some money and a bunch of other stuff. Leonie put out a tweet telling the world what had happened, that the CLAN office had just been robbed. Soon after that, she got a call from Channel 10. They wanted to know what had happened. And that night on the news, they did a big story about a robber in the middle of the night coming in and stealing all of this equipment from people who had dedicated their lives to looking after people who'd grown up and been neglected, abused and who had suffered so much in Australia's orphanages. A few days after that story appeared on the Channel 10 news, the eight laptops were back. When Leonie's team turned up at work, they found eight laptops in a gym bag near the garbage bins just out the front of the office. I like to think that the person who robbed the office saw that story on Channel 10 that night and realised who he'd robbed, an organisation that does so much good for people who've already been robbed of so much. Maybe he grew up in an orphanage as well. Maybe he's got a similar story to Stan or Leonie or Joanna or so many others—I don't know.


But I do know this: this legislation is long overdue. It won't help every person who grew up in institutions, neglected and abused. It won't heal wounds that can't heal. It's too late for too many people who died waiting for something like this to happen, but at least it's here now. To you, Leonie: I know it's not good enough, but at least we're here, and we wouldn't be here without you. All those thousands of people like Stan, so wronged as children, so haunted for so long by monsters that we told them didn't exist, are fortunate that a little girl, left alone in a cold, damp orphanage in Geelong, who suffered so much, grew up to be so strong and never forgot and never gave up.

Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:56):  Finally we are taking a fundamental step towards justice for the victims of child sexual abuse. These are abhorrent crimes committed on defenceless children like Stan, who we just heard about from the member for Blaxland. I'm saddened, though, that it has taken us this long. The time to act is long overdue. If we consider that children are our most vulnerable members of our communities, we as adults should be taking every measure to ensure that our kids grow up safe and secure, regardless of who's looking after them.


Labor has always been supportive of this national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. The sexual abuse of children is a terrible crime, and we are committed to providing survivors with the genuine opportunity to access justice for the crimes that were committed against them as defenceless little children. It has taken far too long for this government to get this far in the redress scheme, and it is sorely overdue.


I'd like to thank the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, for her leadership and her advocacy—in fact, not just on this but on many of the things that she's done in this place that have made a real difference in peoples' lives.


On 12 November 2012, the then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, announced the decision to establish the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. I, along with many on this side of the House, will be forever grateful for that decision. Whilst it will always be a blight on our nation's character to hear the stories of those children who suffered, their stories deserve to be aired, to have the daylight shone on them and grown-ups to be held to account. She stated:


The allegations that have come to light recently about child sexual abuse have been heartbreaking …


… These are insidious, evil acts to which no child should be subject. The individuals concerned deserve the most thorough of investigations into the wrongs that have been committed …


… They deserve to have their voices heard and their claims investigated.


Prime Minister Gillard believed that a royal commission was the best way to do this. It was the Gillard Labor government that created the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in 2013. This is the exact kind of thing that a royal commission ought to be used for.


The royal commission gave the victims of child sexual abuse hope that they could have a future in which they can move on from the past where they were wronged. The royal commission held 56 public hearings over 444 days across a five-year period. Well over 1,600 individuals contacted the royal commission, with evidence coming from more than 1,300 witnesses. The commissioners, six in all, held almost 8,000 private sessions to listen to the personal accounts of survivors. More than 1,000 survivors provided a written account of their experience. More than 680 people worked for the royal commission during its life, and I'd like to thank everybody involved, the commissioners and their staff, for their careful and considered work over their five-year period. Those figures, those numbers, are simply staggering.


I'd like to thank also the thousands of courageous survivors who shared their stories with the royal commission. They stood up and they told their story, which took great courage and determination. I thank them all. And I thank all those people involved, because hearing those stories would not have been easy.


Institutional child sexual abuse has been occurring for generations, across many decades, and has affected the lives of far too many people. Survivors of child sexual abuse have been waiting their whole lives for someone to take accountability for what was done. To provide redress for the horrific crimes that were perpetrated against them is only one part of the story. We know how important it is for more than 60,000 victims to access the redress scheme. We understand, though, that no amount of money can make up for the pain and the trauma they have experienced. However, redress is an important step along the road to healing.


In 2015 the royal commission made an interim recommendations that a national redress scheme be operational by July last year, with Labor being the first major party to support the national redress scheme. Sadly, the Liberals did not commit to the redress scheme until 2016. The commissioners outlined a very clear vision for what a national redress scheme should be in their final report on civil litigation and redress in 2015. The commissioners called for justice for victims. They said:


A process for redress must provide equal access and equal treatment for survivors—regardless of the location, operator, type, continued existence or assets of the institution in which they were abused—if it is to be regarded by survivors as being capable of delivering—


some kind of justice, however overdue. We understand they did not make these recommendations lightly. Labor believes that these recommendations should be implemented faithfully as much as is possible. For too long, society has turned a blind eye to the survivors' daily struggle, and this is to our collective and immense shame.


We recognise that establishing a national redress scheme is a complex task. This redress scheme will be managed by the Secretary of the Department of Social Services as the scheme operator. The elements of redress under this scheme are the monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services, and the opportunity to receive an apology from a representative of the institution responsible for the abuse. To be eligible to receive redress, applicants must have suffered sexual address as a child that is within the scope of the scheme before the scheme's start date.


We do, however, have a number of concerns with the legislation as it is drafted, and it is critical that these issues be addressed urgently. As a result of these concerns, we have referred these bills to a Senate inquiry so the community can be consulted on the points of difference in these bills and the earlier Commonwealth legislation. As the proposed state date of the scheme is 1 July, this inquiry is due to report before the Senate next sits, as the inquiry should not delay the commencement of the scheme at all.


The commissioners recommended that the appropriate level of monetary payments under a redress should be a minimum payment of $10,000, a maximum of $200,000 for the most severe cases, and an average payment of $65,000. This bill places an upper limit of $150,000 on the amount of redress that will be payable to a survivor. This cap is not what the royal commission, after five years, had recommended.


This bill gives the applicants only six months to make a decision, while the royal commission has recommended a year, after five years of work. We cannot see a policy rationale for rushing the decision of survivors and victims. We need to make sure that survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. Accepting an offer will mean signing a deed of release and waiving their civil rights against the responsible institution, and this is not a decision that we should ask people to take lightly, especially the victims and the survivors. Applicants who accept an offer of redress will also receive financial advice.


We are very concerned that the counselling provided to survivors through the redress scheme will not be adequate. The royal commission recommended that recipients of redress be able to access counselling for the rest of their lives. Imagine having an abhorrent sex crime committed against you as a child and then being told that you have a time limit in which you should get over it. The bill only provides access to counselling services for the length of the scheme or a payment to the amount of $5,000. These arrangements are inadequate and need to be addressed. We need to make sure that there are enough services to support the survivors who are considering making an application for redress and that they are accessible no matter where the survivor lives or what language the survivor speaks.


Furthermore, the bill limits eligibility for the redress scheme for people who are living outside Australia or not Australian citizens. We are very concerned that people who were abused as child migrants in immigration detention will not be able to access redress if they have returned to their country of birth. We call on the government to confirm that provision will be made for these groups of survivors to access the National Redress Scheme, because what kind of a cruel lot are they to determine that a sex crime against a child migrant be treated any differently to that of a non-migrant child? To me, that sounds like blatant discrimination. You're either admitting there was a wrong and you are committed to fixing it, or you are not; you cannot pick and choose. The children didn't have a choice and this government shouldn't either. It is critical that the National Redress Scheme provides survivors with a genuine opportunity to access justice and that it takes into account and caters for the unique needs of this group. 


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into the two bills that were before the Senate to establish the Commonwealth Redress Scheme for Survivors of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse, and their report was delivered earlier this year. Additional comments were made by Labor Party senators, including recommendations that the bill be amended to restore the maximum cap to $200,000 and to specify that survivors be given a year to decide whether to accept the offer of redress, and that survivors of institutional child sex abuse be eligible for redress, including those who do not live in Australia and those with criminal convictions, as recommended by the royal commission. 


This last recommendation points to another area of concern that we have with this bill. The government has sought to place restrictions on accessing the redress scheme for survivors who themselves have a criminal history. I believe, and Labor believes, that this is deeply unfair. This rule ignores strong evidence that shows that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. Where does this government get off? As a child, if you lived through having a trusted adult who perpetrated horrific crimes against you, would you somehow grow up into a nice, normal, well-rounded individual without any issues? We know that this is simply not the case, as the member for Barton already pointed out. The statistics that back this up are well-known and well published, but, more than that, it is common sense. 


This government's version of redress says that those victims who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more have to have special permission from the scheme operator to access the scheme. We believe that this policy should be changed. The royal commission has made clear that sexual abuse of children is not just a problem from the past; it has a hangover that goes well into generation after generation. It has devastating, life-long consequences, including interactions with the justice system. 


It is now, though, encouraging to see that Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT, the Northern Territory and Queensland have publicly announced that they will participate in the National Redress Scheme. We call on the states and territories, churches, charities and other institutions and ask them to now opt into the Redress Scheme. 


Whilst we look back and thank the victims of these crime for their courage in telling their stories, we must also look to the future, something I believe the survivors would strongly agree with. We must never allow the abuse of children to be covered up or for people to hide in places of plain sight. Changes are needed in the culture, the structure and the governance practices of many institutions. Our task is to now bring about change so that every Australian child can enjoy a safe childhood free of abuse. Survivors now, though, need justice and they need redress, and we need to ensure the safety of our children for future generations. 


It is incumbent on all in this parliament to work together on further improvement to ensure we get the best possible redress scheme for survivors whilst ensuring that we learn from the past and change practices for the future. The Commonwealth must work with the states and institutes to complete the national redress. For too long, the survivors of institutional child sexual abuse weren't believed, for too long they've waited for justice, and we must do everything we can to ensure that what has happened in the past is never allowed to happen again. I dedicate my words here today to the future generations, and during my time here I commit to doing all I can to ensure that this isn't repeated. I again thank those who bravely and courageously opened old wounds, opened boxes of buried memories, and told their stories.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (17:09):  I started reading the report into institutional child sexual abuse, and I wouldn't recommend that people read it in full; it's an incredibly harrowing read, and most of us would stop quite early in the piece. But the thing you do notice, when you live in Parramatta, is the number of times the word Parramatta appears, perhaps more than any other place name in the report. 


There is a group of women in our community who know absolutely why that is the case. And I think it's an indication of how long the whole issue of institutional child sexual abuse has been swept under the rug that most of us in Parramatta don't know that those Parramatta girls are still among us in Parramatta and that they were the victims of one of the most horrendous cases of institutional child abuse in the country. It was, of course, at what we now know as the Parramatta Girls Home that these women, as children, were incarcerated in one of the worst institutions when it came to sexual, physical and mental abuse of children. 


Those women have been fighting for over a decade to preserve the site of their childhood torture as a site of conscience—a place that documents the reality of our history, a place of commitment to our children, a public statement that it will never happen again. Through the work of those women, and Bonnie Durack in particular, an application for national heritage listing was submitted in 2011, and they saw it come to pass in 2017. They've been coming together as the Memory Project since 2012, looking for recognition of their story and the story of all the women and girls involved, in the establishment of a site of conscience around the very place where they were imprisoned as children, the Parramatta Girls Home. They launched in 2012, and the Memory Project has enabled the Parramatta girls to supplant isolation, shame and silence with shared memory, creativity and social gathering. They have a simple message for us: agency for them is crucial to the activation of this institutional precinct as a site of conscience. That means first and foremost that those who experienced injustice—its former occupants—are empowered to determine how we remember the past and how to use it to build a better present and future. In the last couple of years we have seen state government plans to sell off the very ground on which these buildings stand. These women fought so hard to stop that, and now, with the heritage listing and a change in the government's plans for the immediate precinct, they are at least on their way to having this location recognised as a national site of conscience, as I, as their representative, believe it should be. 


The Parramatta Girls Home, as it's now known, has an extraordinary history. It traces the history of the incarceration of women and girls for almost 200 years. It was originally opened in 1841 as the Roman Catholic Orphan School. Children of the female convicts who were taken from their parents almost at birth would stand on the balcony looking down into the courtyard where the women were, trying to work out who their mum was. So, right from an early time, the building has a history of incarceration. In 1887 it became the Industrial School for Girls, then in 1925 the Parramatta Girls Training School, then in 1961 the Parramatta Girls Home. It was closed in 1974 and then became the Girls Childrens Home until 1983. So it's essentially been a place for the incarceration of girls since 1841. It has an extraordinary history. There were violent riots in 1887, 1890, 1898, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1953, 1954 and 1961. 


It was a place of appalling stories. If you ever sit down and talk to some of the women and girls who are prepared to share their stories, you know that dreadful stories came from this place. There was rape, there was the turning of blind eyes and there was usually no consequences for the rapist. At best, they were suspended, but there was punishment for the child who objected. There was punishment for the person who told the truth. They weren't allowed to talk to each other for more than 10 minutes a day. There was no speaking unless spoken to with the staff. There was no privacy: they were always watched, including by male staff, including in the showers and on the toilets. They weren't allowed to turn their backs while in the showers. They were made to sleep on their side with their faces to the door; they weren't allowed to turn over in bed. They were punished with food deprivation, beatings, scrubbing of concrete floors for hours and being put in isolation cells for up to 21 days without a bed, a bucket or a chair. Sometimes in those cells they were stripped of all clothing and repeatedly raped, in many cases by two of the superintendents. In some cases they were punched in the stomach to bring on a miscarriage if found to be pregnant. They had invasive medical procedures. They were strip-searched by male staff and sexually abused by other children. 


It was known as the 'home for wayward girls' when I first moved to Parramatta about 15 or 16 years ago. It's an astonishingly beautiful building with beautiful balconies, and it was known as the 'home for wayward girls'. It's worth just dwelling on that for a minute, because the children who were put in these homes were put there because they were at risk. A neglected child was defined as one who was destitute or had no visible means of support; who was ill-treated; whose parents weren't exercising proper care or were unfit to do so; who, without lawful excuse, did not attend school regularly; or were falling into bad associations and exposed to moral danger.


The vast majority of children who went into the Parramatta Girls Home in all its iterations were in fact children who were there for welfare reasons, because they weren't cared for by the people who should have been caring for them. Many of them had already been sexually abused or physically abused by family members, and they found themselves in a place, once again, where they were essentially imprisoned until the day they turned 18. There's a giant sandstone fence around that compound. They were in that place and they didn't go outside; they stayed there until the day they turned 18, when they were dumped at a place we used to know as the People's Palace in Sydney. Essentially, they were left there with just the clothes on their back at the age of 18. They had no experience of the world, they had a history of being physically, sexually and mentally abused and they were required to fend for themselves. There was no state support.


It's worth noting too that many of the stolen generation, the Indigenous community who were taken from their parents, were put here as well. In the Bringing them home report the inquiry noted that the definition and interpretation of the key terms of the Child Welfare Act adversely affected Indigenous families. It said:


'Neglect' was defined to include destitution and poverty …


A large of the stolen generation in New South Wales ended up in the Parramatta Girls Home and experienced the same punitive conditions that I described earlier.


The impact on these children was quite severe, as you would imagine. These were children who didn't know love, they didn't know friendship, they were unable to even develop relationships within the Girls Home because of the rule that they couldn't speak to each other for more than 10 minutes a day. They suffered incredible abuse, and when they were released they received no support. Several witnesses gave evidence that they became homeless and turned to prostitution on release. They had no money; they had no clothes, only what they wore; they had no skills because they hadn't been educated. The state claimed at the time that they were too old for education, but actually they arrived at the Parramatta Girls Home as young as the age of eight. But they received no education.


One witness said she went in an innocent girl and left a dangerous and uncontrollable criminal. She had only learnt two things: how to use her sexuality to live and that if she was good to men she'd be rewarded. She was homeless and worked as prostitute in Kings Cross to support herself. With no education these children struggled to adapt to life outside the institution, and many still face psychological issues today. I'm not going to name the incredibly brave witnesses who gave evidence to the royal commission—they are in the report; I'm going to refer to them as witness 1, witness 2 et cetera. Witness 1 has ongoing psychological trauma, including problems with her sex life and her bowels. The smell of faeces affects her, and she dreads using any toilet that's not her own. She has flashbacks, she's never had counselling for fear that it would drag up worse memories and she believes the sadness will never go away. Witness 2 is still burdened by the fear of Parramatta girls. She doesn't trust men, and her experiences have severely affected her self-worth. She vomits when she thinks about the abuse and feels she's been left with a legacy that will never go away.


Witness 3 feels like she's been in prison since she left Parramatta girls. She does not trust anyone and has nightmares about Superintendent Gordon. Witness 4 has suicidal thoughts because she could not talk about her experiences. She believes that people do not want to know about what happened. She fears people and does not go out. Witness 5 has been claustrophobic since Parramatta girls and fears closed doors. She's a nervy person who watches everything and walks close to walls so that people cannot approach her from behind. The sound of keys rattling reminds her of Superintendent Gordon. Witness 6 has had ongoing problems with sex. Talking about sexual positions with her husband makes her feel ill. Locked doors trigger bad memories. She won't go to venues like clubs if she cannot see a way out. She's now in her 60s and the impact of abuse still takes over her life. Another has suffered depression throughout her life and has needed medication for it. Yet another has nightmares that are only cured by heavy medication. She's been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Another suffers from traumatic flashbacks and has depression. With no self-confidence or self-esteem, she does not trust anyone and does not take criticism well. Medical tests make her anxious and she does not like being examined by male doctors. Yet another was committed to a psychiatric hospital after attempting suicide. She has self-mutilated to relieve the pain.


I could go on, because there are many more stories of what childhood sexual abuse has left these survivors with. I know many of them in my electorate of Parramatta. I organised a bus—a big bus, actually—to drive a whole group of them down for the apology. I picked them up at the Parramatta Girls Home and dropped them off there later that night. But there were some who even then couldn't come. They wanted to come; they couldn't face it. And there will be many even now, when this redress scheme unfolds, who will need time to come to terms with what it means for them. I would ask the government to consider the time frame they've put on this—that is, that the bill gives applicants six months to make their decision. The royal commission recommended a year. I would go further than that, having known so many of these women for so long, in that the decision that these women make should take place in the survivor's time frame, not that of the government. It should take place in their time frame.


Labor has a number of concerns about the redress scheme. It's been our policy since 2015. I would say one slightly partisan thing, which is I'm really sorry that it's taken this long. We've known it should be done and we've ignored these children—now women—for far too long. We shouldn't have ignored them since 2015 but we did. But we have a number of concerns about the redress scheme as it stands. We're going to support it because it's really important that it starts, but I want to make the following points.


The first is that the decision should be made in the survivor's time frame, as I've just said. The bill places an upper limit of $150,000 on the amount of redress, when the royal commission recommended $200,000. The bill also limits eligibility to people living in Australia who are Australian citizens. We know, of course, that child migrants were in institutions as well and that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention. We're concerned that these people will not be able to access redress if they have returned to their country of birth. We're also concerned that the money for counselling provided to survivors will not be adequate—it's only $5,000. Some of these people will require counselling every week, or more than that, for the rest of their life, the damage is so great. The government's also sought to place restrictions on survivors who have a criminal history. I believe that is deeply unfair. We know from the research that childhood sexual abuse leads to criminal behaviour in many cases, so there will be people who are in prison who otherwise wouldn't have been there—the child who was neglected by their parents, who went in as an innocent 10-year-old and came out a criminal. We know that this is the case because the evidence tells us. It is deeply unfair, and we on this side believe that that should be changed.


We know this is a complex task. We're encouraged that some of the states have now come in. We're encouraged that some of the institutions have come in. Of course, there always needs to be a source of last resort, because so many of the institutions are no longer in existence. We need to make sure that people whose childhood torturers no longer exist still have appropriate redress. There are a number of things that we on this side are concerned about, but we will support this bill, the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, because we believe it's timely. The scheme needs to start, and we'll support it.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (17:24):  I am proud to stand in this place today to support the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, even though I will raise some areas of concern. I am in awe of the people who came forward and gave evidence during the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which was a legacy of the Gillard Labor government. Their courage has been nothing short of exceptional, especially when giving evidence was harrowing and very distressing as one is required to relive horrendous experiences. I also have huge respect for the commissioners who sat and listened to extremely distressing evidence from hurt and damaged people for over 444 days, and I thank them for their tireless commitment over five years so that we could see justice done.


I'm going to start my speech with the details of a woman who I have known for nearly 40 years. Sadly, she has passed on now. I will not reveal her identity out of respect for her privacy. Can you imagine growing up in a neglectful family and being taken away by children services on a number of occasions for varying periods of time and put into an institution, separated from your siblings because the boys went to boys' homes and the girls went to girls' homes? Can you imagine not being given the opportunity for an education that you so desperately craved? Can you imagine the only reason that your mother takes you from the home at age 14 is to put you to work and to take your income? Can you imagine, as you get older, being so fearful of going into an aged care facility due to what you remember from being in an institution? Can you imagine what it must be like to carry the secret of sexual abuse to your deathbed for nearly 86 years, because you could not tell a soul? Can you imagine lying on your deathbed and finally telling someone that you were sexually abused as a child in an institution, a place where you were meant to be protected? I cannot imagine living with that secret for nearly 86 years.


Maybe it was because you did not think anyone would care, because you did not think you would be believed, because you were ashamed or because of all of those reasons. I am sure that there are many people out there who have similar experiences and still have not told a soul. I say to those people: I believe you, this parliament believes you and, thanks to the royal commission, others will believe you as well. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has opened the door for people who have lived with this trauma to speak out because, at last, they will be believed. The commission held 57 public hearings, as I said, over 444 days; heard evidence from 1,300 witnesses and also held almost 8,000 private sessions where the commissioners listened to harrowing personal accounts.


It was Labor who was the first to announce support for a national redress scheme when the royal commission released its interim report in 2015. The LNP government did not commit to the redress scheme until 2016. The commissioners outlined a clear vision for a national redress scheme in the final report, Redress and civil litigation, in 2015 and the recommendations were not made lightly. It is for this reason that Labor believes that these recommendations should be implemented faithfully and as much as is humanly possible. Labor thanks the thousands of courageous survivors who shared their stories with the royal commission, as it is because of their bravery that we are discussing a national redress scheme in this place today. Survivors of child sexual abuse have been waiting their whole lives for redress for the horrific crimes that were perpetrated against them as children. For too long now, society has turned a blind eye to their daily struggle and that is nothing short of an immense shame.


However, Labor has a number of concerns with the legislation as it is currently drafted. Labor believes that it is critical that the National Redress Scheme provides survivors with a genuine opportunity to access justice and that it takes into account and caters for the unique needs of individual survivors. We have referred these bills to a Senate inquiry so that the community can be consulted on the points of difference in these bills and the earlier Commonwealth legislation. In light of the proposed start date of 1 July 2018, this inquiry is due to report before the Senate next sits so that the inquiry should not delay the commencement of the scheme. As a gesture of good faith in our ongoing discussions with the government to resolve Labor's concerns and to acknowledge our longstanding commitment to the establishment of a national redress scheme, Labor will support the bills in this House.


These bills establish a redress scheme that will be managed by the Secretary of the Department of Social Services as the scheme operator. The scheme will provide three elements of redress, with applicants able to receive all or just some of the elements. The elements of redress under the scheme are: a monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services, and the opportunity to receive an apology from a representative of the institution responsible for the abuse. Those applicants who accept an offer will be required to sign a deed of release, waiving their civil rights against the responsible institution. Applicants will be provided with access to support services and legal services throughout their interactions with the redress scheme, and they will also receive financial advice. To be eligible to receive redress, applicants must have suffered sexual abuse as a child within the scope of the scheme and before the scheme start date.


Labor is concerned about a number of elements of the proposed scheme. Labor believes that we need to make sure that there are enough support services for all survivors who are considering making an application for redress, regardless of where they live or what language they speak, and that attention must be paid to cultural competency.


It is imperative that survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. This bill gives applicants only six months to make this decision; however, the royal commission recommended a year. It is important that survivors have sufficient time to consider their decision because they are permitted only one application to the scheme and, for many, this will be an emotional and overwhelming process that should not be rushed.


This bill places an upper limit of $150,000 on the amount of redress that would be payable to any one survivor, but the royal commission recommended a maximum payment of $200,000, a minimum payment of $10,000 and an average payment of $65,000. Accepting an offer will also mean that the survivor will sign away any rights to pursue a claim for compensation through litigation, and that is why the amount of redress under the scheme is critical and it is absolutely essential that sufficient time be allowed to make a decision.


The bill also limits eligibility to the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia or who are Australian citizens. We know that horrific abuse has occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants, and we also know that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention. We are rightly concerned that these people will not be able to access redress if they have returned to their country of birth. Labor calls on the government to confirm that provision will be made for these groups of survivors to access national redress.


Labor is very concerned that counselling provided to survivors through the redress scheme will not be adequate. The royal commission recommended that recipients of redress be able to access counselling for the rest of their life, but this bill only provides access to state-provided services for the length of the scheme or a payment of up to $5,000 to be put towards counselling. These arrangements are woefully inadequate, and Labor calls on the government to give assurances that this will be addressed. Having worked in the mental health sector for 15 years, I can assure you that, when people have been traumatised to the extent of what these people have suffered, that is simply not enough money or time.


Survivors often consider that the government is responsible for their abuse, and they do not wish to use state or institution-run services. This must be taken into account.


Survivors who are granted redress late in the life of the scheme could also be disadvantaged because they will not be able to access services for the same length of time as survivors who are granted redress early in the life of the scheme. This must also be taken into account in future reviews. The $5,000 payment will not provide adequate access to psychological counselling, as I mentioned, because, at the average rate of $150 an hour for counselling, this equates to a mere 33.3 hours of counselling, and that is simply not sufficient and needs urgent attention.


The government seeks to place restrictions on survivors who themselves have a criminal history from accessing the redress scheme. This is deeply unfair. I have worked in an area where I have come across people who have been incarcerated with significant mental health issues and who had been abused as children. They have found themselves in circumstances that are completely unacceptable as they have gone into their teenage years and into adulthood and those have led them to incarceration. Why should they be punished for something that happened to them as children? It's just not fair.


The bill requires that those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for five years or more have special permission from the scheme operator to access the scheme. This rule ignores strong evidence, as I have said, showing that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. The first Senate inquiry was inundated with evidence from a variety of witnesses and submitters that this rule is cruel and is likely to increase recidivism.


Labor believes that this policy should be changed. Labor recognises that establishing a national redress scheme is a complex task, and it is very encouraging to see that Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Queensland have publicly announced that had they will participate in the scheme. We understand that other jurisdictions are working with the government, and we would want to see universal sign-up to the scheme as soon as humanly possible.


For justice to be truly done, the redress scheme must be national. Labor calls on all states and territories, churches, charities and other institutions to opt into the scheme. We must work together to right the wrongs of years gone by and ensure that these events can and will never be repeated. It is incumbent on all of us in this parliament to work together on further improvement to ensure is that we get the best possible redress scheme for survivors.


I want to make it clear today that a Shorten Labor government will seek to work with the states towards addressing the issues of concern that we have identified. Once we've got the agreement in place—once all states, churches and other institutions have signed up to an agreement—I believe that there may be an opportunity in the future for us to build on this start and do more. I would certainly hope that those people in the situation of living with the dreadful secret that the woman who I mentioned earlier in my speech lived with for 86 years, and felt she could only mention on her deathbed, never, ever happens to another person.

 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:37):  I'm very pleased today to rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, because it gives me an opportunity to speak a little about the bill itself and a little about some of its shortcomings. As the member for Herbert very clearly laid out, while Labor supports the bill and the redress scheme, we think it doesn't go quite far enough in some respects. It also gives me the opportunity of putting on the record in this place the incredible bravery of the people who have participated in the royal commission and my deep gratitude and thanks to so many of those who were involved.


Of course, that starts with our former Prime Minister, my colleague Julia Gillard, for launching the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and the work that was done by Julia when she was Prime Minister, and by Jenny Macklin, who was the minister responsible at the time, in preparing the groundwork for this royal commission.


The royal commission was conducted in an absolutely exemplary way by those who were entrusted with its running. The work rate was extraordinary: 42,041 calls handled, 25,964 emails and letters received, 8,013 private sessions held and 2,575 referrals, including referrals to the police. The workload was extraordinary, and I do just want to place on the record, once again, how grateful the nation is to the Hon. Justice Peter McClelland AM, who led the royal commission, and to his fellow commissioners: the Hon. Justice Jennifer Coate; Bob Atkinson AO APM; Robert Fitzgerald AM; Helen Milroy; and Andrew Murray, who, of course, is a former colleague of many of us here.


I also want to thank Gail Furness SC, who was the senior counsel assisting the royal commission, as well as all other counsel assisting and the extraordinary staff that worked throughout the operations of the royal commission. I have heard story after story from people who interacted with the royal commission about the compassion, the decency, the thoroughness, the sense of responsibility and the respect that the staff of the royal commission gave to all of those who came forward to tell their stories.


But it is to those people who came forward to tell their stories that my deepest gratitude goes, because I think we really need to acknowledge in this place the extraordinary bravery that goes with survivors stepping forward to give evidence. Some of these people had been lifelong campaigners for the royal commission or something like it, to see a formal response to the abuse they suffered as children. Some who stepped forward had, as the member for Herbert said, kept their stories to themselves for decades—for a whole lifetime, essentially. Both of those approaches take their toll: being a public campaigner takes its toll, and keeping a secret takes its toll. Coming forward to share experiences, for many, was reliving those experiences, and it's a very, very difficult thing to do. So we thank them as a nation, because their bravery means, I hope, that, as the member for Herbert said, no other child has to suffer in the way that these children suffered.


One of the things that were extraordinary about the revelations from the royal commission was how phenomenally widespread this child sexual abuse was and how commonly it occurred in institutions in our suburbs—not in a different place, not in a distant place and not in a distant time but in amongst us and until recently, and indeed, no doubt, still now. In my electorate, there was the Charlton Boys Home in Glebe, which was an institution in which terrible abuse took place. Carl Beauchamp wrote a book about the abuse that he and other boys suffered in the home. The book was called Come Home You Little Bastards, and I launched that book in 2016. Carl spoke about his experience and the experience of his brother and many other boys in this home.


Carl was sent to Charlton Boys Home at the age of 13, having already been sexually assaulted in Yasmar remand home. Carl tells the story of his family, and his family was so very typical of so many families in the inner city at the time when he grew up. He talks about growing up in Redfern and Waterloo and living in Erskineville with his parents—his mother in particular. These boys did nothing wrong. They had the misfortune of being born to parents who couldn't care for them or didn't care for them appropriately. Carl tells the story about the superintendent at the home who was so very violent to the boys, physically and sexually assaulting them, including violent beatings that involved all sorts of injuries—broken bones and compound fractures—freezing showers in the middle of winter, and boys standing there naked being inspected by the staff and having their genitals inspected and fondled. Carl writes about being sent on a camping trip in his Christmas 'holiday', if you could call it that, where he was raped by a man who also raped other boys on that trip.


Essentially, this Charlton Boys Home was run as a paedophile ring. These boys were lent out to paedophiles known to the directors of the home, and when they returned, if they complained, they were brutally punished for complaining. When they reported these crimes, including by demonstrating bleeding, they were not believed and they were further punished. Carl writes about being sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by a man that the home gave him to for weekends at a time. He was one of many boys staying at the home at one time, and he details the abuse that took place at this man's hands. The boys were sent to work in local businesses, often for no money. Carl was sent to work in a pie factory in Kensington where, again, he was sexually assaulted by the owner. Carl wrote in his book about 20 other boys from the home also claiming to have been sexually assaulted or raped by the owner. This wasn't an accident. It wasn't a one off; it was repeated methodical, organised paedophilia with the cover of an institution. And it happened with no recourse and no protection for these little children and a feeling of impunity or invincibility amongst those who were doing the abuse. That is the extraordinary thing about this. 


Carl writes about a little boy, Alan, who was six years of age. He was raped by a part-time officer in a tin shed at the back of the home. When little six-year-old Alan told the home superintendent about the crime, he was abused as a liar and punished for reporting it. What followed were years of sustained humiliation and abuse because of his report, as well as the continued sexual assault. You wonder why children didn't come forward earlier when they saw what happened to the kids who did come forward? It's no wonder. It's a wonder that anybody's ever been brave enough to complain. 


I want to pay tribute to Carl and to all of those who came forward through the course of the royal commission: those who made their stories public beforehand when demanding the royal commission, and those who were brave enough to come forward subsequently. I also want to say this one thing about Carl: he's gone on to have the most beautiful life and marriage. He's a father of four, grandfather—last time I checked—of 12 and great grandfather of 17, and he's still married to his first love, Beryl. To find it possible in your heart to find love and stability, to value family and to go on to have a good life after this terrible start just shows the phenomenal strength of Carl. But not everybody made it through. Part of the reason for this Redress Scheme is to acknowledge the lifelong and ongoing damage that so many have faced, and for us to admit to ourselves that not everyone made it. Too many people never made it. 


Throughout my electorate there are these landmarks of abuse, such as the former Bidura, the former children's court and remand centre on Glebe Point Road. Even more recently, in one of the music institutes in my electorate, around the corner from where my office was, abuse was taking place. This is living memory. These people who were abused are still young. This isn't ancient history. So many institutions and so many people have been affected right throughout our nation. 


Also, I want to take the time I have remaining to say that this this royal commission and the Redress Scheme would not have come about without so many years of hard work and committed lobbying by so many people in our community. Pamella Vernon is a woman who was formerly in my electorate—a former long-time constituent. She's Vice-President of the organisation Alliance for Forgotten Australians. Pamella lobbied me for many years before the royal commission was announced. She grew up in the Central Methodist Mission Dalmar Children's Home, and she has been advocating for forgotten Australians for over 45 years. She can tell you the stories of her family and the affect that what happened to them as children has had on them, and it would break your heart. The Alliance for Forgotten Australians work tirelessly supporting survivors and lobbying for a national redress scheme, and they continue to hold governments to account to demand that governments and institutions that haven't signed up do so.


Many in this chamber and in the Senate know very well of the work of CLAN, the Care Leavers Australasia Network, and the phenomenal work of Leonie Sheedy and all of those who have worked with Leonie over the years. We know of the support that CLAN has given survivors of child sexual abuse, helping them come forward, helping them tell their stories and helping them give their evidence, as well as dealing with their retraumatisation after they have given their evidence to the royal commission, despite the fine work of the royal commission. CLAN has been there through all of it. I am delighted to have been asked to be one of their parliamentary patrons. Their resolve and strength is continually inspiring. I visited their National Orphanage Museum, which provides an incredible, permanent monument to the experiences of the 'clannies'. It is a room full of the most poignant reminders through the artefacts that care leavers have given to the museum—artefacts that bear witness to their lives. It was very moving to visit that museum, and I certainly would urge other members of parliament to take the opportunity, if they can.


Finally, as pointed out by CLAN, the abuse that children suffered in institutions was not just sexual abuse; it was also physical abuse and emotional abuse. Over 25 years in Victoria, hundreds of children in orphanages and babies homes, wards of the state, were used in vaccine experiments and studies by doctors, in conjunction with CSL. It was unconscionable behaviour. There have been examinations in the past in this place that detail some of this behaviour. Another constituent of mine, Stephanie, has helped to keep this issue alive and at the forefront of our minds to make sure that the behaviour involved in these despicable acts of using young children, without any ability to consent, without the consent of any parent, continues to be remembered by this parliament and by our Australian community. I think it's vital that the work that Stephanie is doing to remind people of the use of these babies, including wards of the state, for vaccine experiments continues to be examined and that we, as a parliament, investigate the long-term effects.


I want to thank the late Anthony Foster and his wife, Christine, who did so much work in bringing these issues to light and taking on the might of the Catholic Church. 


Many of my colleagues have detailed the ways in which we differ from the government on this bill. We would like to see changes but, of course, we won't stand in the way of the bill itself, because too many survivors have been waiting too long for the redress that this scheme offers. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Buchholz
):  I thank the honourable member for Sydney for her moving and touching contribution. The constituents that you represent will take heart from the fact that their story will be recorded and so enshrined in the Hansard from this point forward.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:52):  I'm pleased to rise on what is a very sober evening to join the long line of colleagues in this place in speaking on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. I'm pleased to follow the member for Sydney after her heartfelt contribution. Like the member for Sydney, I would like to pay tribute to Julia Gillard, the former member for Lalor and our former Prime Minister; the member for Jagajaga, whose tears in this place last week spoke for all of us; and the member for Maribyrnong, whose speech I found inspiring and comforting. I also want to pay tribute to all the speakers on this side of the House. There will have been 22 Labor members speak on what is an incredibly important bill. I would also like to thank the member for Swan, the member for Gilmore, the member for Mackellar and the member for Fisher from the benches opposite, whose contributions brought many of us to tears, and also the member for Indi, who, as an Independent, stood in this place to speak of the unspeakable. 


Over the last several years, we have shone a light on the unspeakable—the organised sexual abuse of children by trusted institutions, by trusted adults. Through long campaigns this light has been shone. Through our storytellers in film and television and through the royal commission, we've had our eyes opened to the horror as they relayed the circumstances through fiction or, more sadly, through the telling by the individuals who suffered. We have found it hard to watch. We have found it hard to hear. It has been unthinkable. As is our human way, we've tried to understand the motivations, tried to make sense of what makes no sense. We are left knowing only that sexual abuse of children is unfathomable and that monsters exist. What we've learned is that it was organised and more endemic that any of us could have imagined. We're left struggling to understand the monsters among us, left feeling completely inadequate in our response to the victims.


Like many in this place I've read transcripts of the royal commission. I've had the privilege of sitting with the bravest of victims, survivors, and struggled to hear their story. In the words of former Prime Minister Gillard:


The allegations that have come to light recently about child sexual abuse have been heartbreaking. These are insidious, evil acts to which no child should be subject.


Indeed, Julia. I would add: no human response is adequate, no monetary redress is adequate, but they now know they are believed. They now know we will no longer look away. We will look clearly at their lived experiences and share the horror that adults could do these things. It is abominable that trusted institutions could hide what they knew is abominable. That survivors wait for redress, wait for justice, even after a royal commission, is abominable. I pay tribute to the courage of the survivors, to their resilience, to their determination to be heard.


When we think about redress and justice, we need to ponder our own lives. We lived beside the victims as they suffered at the hands of those whom we were taught to respect. In our classrooms sat children who were being and had been dehumanised and subjected to vile abuse. We went about our days oblivious to their pain, to their struggle and to their recovery. Because of the royal commission I have since had the privilege of conveying my admiration personally to one such victim, to sit and quietly listen, and silently be appalled. I think the member for Maribyrnong's words captured what I now know:


Only she will ever know how dark the days were, just how deep the memories run, but it is the same trauma, the same betrayal and the same violation of sacred trust that fills the pages of the royal commission's final report. Thousands of our fellow Australians had their childhoods stolen and their faith in people shattered.


They deserve now the best possible systemic redress, as they suffered systemic abuse. This has been a painful process, unique for every survivor, and they have walked it alone, because nobody can really walk it with them, just as they walked years of abuse alone. They've had to go to dark places in their memories to share their pain with us. They've done so trusting that once the abuse of trust and abuse of their child bodies was exposed, others would not have to suffer the same. The scars will cover our nation: crimes that were ignored, people whose stories were ignored and perpetrators who were sheltered. The way we legislate redress is, therefore, critical. It is another test of trust for us as a society and for us as legislators. I speak for my friend therefore when I say that there was an expectation that, once the survivors lay before us the truth of their lives, we would respect it. The royal commission recommendation should therefore be honoured to the letter.


I am disappointed, as others have been, that this bill fails in some of this regard—that, rather than the recommended sum, a reduced sum has been included; that someone's life, crippled by the brutality of experiences that may have resulted in incarceration and further punishment, could be devalued by exclusion from redress; that dollar limits be put on psychological support for survivors. We asked them to remember; we owe them support, as the royal commission recommended, throughout their life to help them cope with the crime and the memory of it. I am disappointed that justice is still pending in the courts for some of those accused. I'm disappointed that this parliament, the survivors and their families are to be held to a deadline of 1 July and asked to compromise. Wise heads on this side urge us to make that compromise, and we will, so that redress is not further delayed.


I will finish with this. We now must be ever-vigilant in our institutions, in our families and in our neighbourhoods. There are monsters and they will do unspeakable things to innocents. They will seek out opportunities, they will seek out like creatures and they will do untold damage. They will do this while holding powerful, trusted positions, if we allow them to. They will prey on the innocent because of our naivety, because of our own fear to confront, to look closely at the horror. This chapter must not close. We must remember and we must be vigilant.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Buchholz
):  I thank the honourable member for her, again, touching contribution. The question is that the bill now be read a second time. I give the call to the honourable member for the Hunter.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (18:00):  In 1976, I was still a student at Maitland Marist Brothers, as it was then known. One day that year, year 7 student Patrick Garnham was summonsed over the loudspeakers to report to the principal's office. Brother Nestor was not inviting Patrick in for a chat. It was, of course, about something more sinister than I could have ever imagined as a year 9 student. Another year 9 student that year was David O'Hearn, later Father O'Hearn, who spent some time serving my own local Cessnock Catholic parish. O'Hearn was later found guilty of 44 child sex offences. The ages of the victims ranged from nine to 13. Outrageously, rather than offering contrition, O'Hearn fought his charges all the way to the High Court. For a number of years Father Vince Ryan was my local parish priest. He was later jailed for 14 years for numerous atrocities involving young boys.


On the Anglican side of the Christian divide, Father Peter Rushton turned out to be a serial child sex abuser throughout his 40-year career in service to his church. I would often converse with Peter Rushton at official local events. He was always quite pious in his language. Of course, I was totally oblivious to his real and evil character. Rushton, we later learned, would cut the backs of his victims with a knife, drawing the blood of Christ, while anally raping them.


The now infamous St Alban's Home for Boys, where young boys were basically prostituted out by clergymen, was in my hometown from around 1964. The home was always a bit mysterious to me as a young boy. I do, though, remember feeling sympathy for the mainly Indigenous boys who called it their home. But I could not have imagined or comprehended at that age the evil that took place inside that building. The question becomes: how could we have been so blind to this institutionalised evil?


We all like to think it could never happen again, and to that I say, maybe. The answer can be found in culture and in indoctrination. We were raised not to question the church or its methods. We were told that everything that happened, happened for a reason—it was the will of God. The disintegration of this unchallenged edifice eventually came because of the courage of so many victims, some of whom I know. Today we say we believe them and that we weep with them. We thank them for their courage, because it may have saved another generation from the same fate they suffered. We also thank those who helped them, who helped the victims to tell their stories, to secure justice and, hopefully, to find some closure—journalists like the Newcastle Herald's Joanne McCarthy, who relentlessly pursued the perpetrators, no doubt under enormous pressure to back off, and those like local detective Peter Fox, who paid a heavy personal price for his energetic, determined and robust pursuit of offending clergymen and those who protected them, and there were many.


This bill will not heal the emotional or physical wounds. It's far too late for that, but we do hope it helps. The bill is not perfect—far from it. I do acknowledge how difficult it is to navigate so many challenges, such as the agreement of the states and no doubt plenty of advice from lawyers about the minefields which lie ahead. We all remember that we were told by the lawyers that the Commonwealth shouldn't apologise to the stolen generation, since it would open up all sorts of legal problems for the Commonwealth. Of course, we now know that not to be true. I'm particularly disappointed that those who have been imprisoned for more than five years have been excluded from this redress scheme. I say that because it's more than possible—in fact, very likely—that many of them were victims themselves and possibly their experiences led them to offend in the first place.


I shared my own stories about my school and my local parish for an obvious reason. It's to acknowledge that the Hunter region, very tragically, has been the epicentre of all these crimes that were committed over such a long period of time. That is something of which we are not proud of at all; but we are all very proud of the victims, the way they came forward and those who supported them in their determination to find justice not only for themselves but for many others. I vividly recall calling the then Catholic bishop of Maitland-Newcastle just the day before then Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced she'd be establishing a royal commission. I called him out of courtesy to inform him that later that day I would be issuing a statement calling upon a royal commission. I told him that the situation was now overwhelming and had to be properly and fully acted upon. To his credit, the bishop made no attempt to dissuade me.


Let us never again allow religion to be used as a shield against evil. Let the church and let faith continue to play a positive role and let it continue to do its good things—and it does do good things—but let us never allow it again to shield evil. Let us never again be so naive, ignorant or, worse, complacent. What occurred over many decades, and probably for centuries, is a reflection on all of us. We did not know, but we should have known. That's the truth of it. We should have known. Let us never make that mistake again. Let us be forever mindful that there will always be evil amongst us.


Tonight, indeed, young children will be sexually and physically abused in their own homes around our modern, wealthy nation state. That is a reality we continue to face. It is in no small part up to us here in the national parliament to stop the extent to which that continues to occur. We bear a heavy responsibility and we should exercise our power very, very wisely and very, very diligently. For me, our key tool is education. It is the great circuit-breaker. If we want equality of opportunity and if we want to stop abuse happening behind closed doors, we will not be successful without appropriate and smart investment in our education system. It's up to us. It's up to us to do everything we can to stop this evil continuing in our society, and it's up to us tonight to hope and pray that victims everywhere gain something from the bill which will no doubt pass the House in a little while.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (18:09):  While I'm not listed to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, I have just listened to a number of addresses in this House. I identify with every one of them—but particularly that of the member for Hunter, who has just spoken and suggested that Hunter was the epicentre of this issue. I put to the member for Hunter that the area is no less guilty than any part of the rest of Australia. There's no epicentre for this. The epicentre for this issue was every situation in every room in every building in every institution and every household where it was perpetrated. That was the epicentre—no particular area; not the Hunter.


We all have experiences which I'm not prepared to describe here, or public interactions which I won't go into. People were sent from one parish to another or away to another country. And too many stood by.


The only thing I would say about this today is this. Even though the royal commission has struck into the heart of the issue and exposed this for what it is, it still hasn't scratched the surface of the horribleness of this across this nation and the amount of abuse that occurred, that is not declared, that is not open, that hasn't reached its fulfilment, that hasn't been exposed. There's no road to take to get to that. I'm not suggesting there is a road to take. But I just want to identify with all of those kids out there who have suffered and who have not told their story; who have not made a commitment; who have not said anything for the whole of their lives, and won't. But they'll go on and live with the struggle, knowing that they're a little different or feeling they're a little different, and working through the days that they do in the full knowledge that they have a future and an opportunity in this great south land. And they'll walk away from their past and they'll stick it in a box and they'll forget it and they'll go on.


So I just repeat, and say to the member for Hunter: no; your area was not the epicentre. The epicentre was for all of us to consider and address in our own areas. Thanks for letting me speak.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (18:12):  The preface and executive summary of the final report of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse clearly reveal the gravity of the matters that this legislation, the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, seeks to address, and the extent of a problem that, for too long, too many people, too many government departments and too many sectors of society preferred to ignore. What was occurring was an inconvenient truth that society was not prepared to confront. As with the royal commission into banking, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse should have been initiated years earlier. The incidence of child sexual abuse, both within the home and throughout the community, was the subject of regular community conversation. Yet no authority was prepared to act—until the Gillard government did, in November 2012. The royal commission announcement at the time was met with widespread acclamation. Finally, society was responding and doing so with a royal commission. From what I've read of the report of the commission, the commission itself is to be commended—as are the 680 people who, I understand, over the years have worked with the commission—for its work, which appears to be thorough and frank.


Child abuse, regrettably, has been a historical fact of life across all continents, all cultures and all generations. Whether today's world is any better, I don't know. But I have little doubt that, as we debate this legislation, children, in Australia and overseas, continue to be exploited and abused.


I acknowledge and support the growing calls for a royal commission into abuse of people with a disability. They too have stories to tell and are pleading to be heard. The sexual abuse of innocent, vulnerable children would have to be amongst the most abhorrent acts of humanity. To violate children and to destroy their lives while they are in the care of those entrusted to protect them is beyond the comprehension of all decent people. Yet it happened, and it continues to happen all too often.


For the benefit of anyone following this debate, I want to quote excerpts of the commission's preface and executive summary, which I believe provides real context to their report. The preface says:


In 1997, Bringing them home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families outlined allegations of institutional sexual abuse of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.


The reports of two later major national inquiries, Forgotten Australians: A report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children in 2004 and Protecting vulnerable children: A national challenge in 2005, recommended the establishment of a Royal Commission into the sexual assault of children and young people in institutions after those inquiries heard further allegations of institutional child sexual abuse. These recommendations were not taken up by government at the time.


      …      …      …


Over 16,000 individuals have contacted the Royal Commission and by the time we conclude our work we expect to have heard more than 8,000 personal stories in private sessions. Over 1,000 survivors have provided a written account of their experience …


We now know that countless thousands of children have been sexually abused in many institutions in Australia. In many institutions, multiple abusers have sexually abused children. We must accept that institutional child sexual abuse has been occurring for generations.


… For many, sexual abuse is a trauma they can never escape …


      …      …      …


However, notwithstanding the problems we have identified in institutions, the number of children who are sexually abused in familial or other circumstances far exceeds those who are abused in an institution.


The executive summary goes on to say:


The sexual abuse of a child is a terrible crime. It is the greatest of personal violations … It is one of the most traumatic and potentially damaging experiences and can have lifelong adverse consequences.


Tens of thousands of children have been sexually abused in many Australian institutions. We will never know the true number. Whatever the number, it is a national tragedy, perpetrated over generations within many of our most trusted institutions.


      …      …      …


Our criminal justice system has created many barriers to the successful prosecution of alleged perpetrators. Investigation processes were inadequate and criminal procedures were inappropriate. Our civil law placed impossible barriers on survivors bringing claims against individual abusers and institutions.


It is remarkable that in so many cases the perpetrator of abuse was a member of an organisation that professed to care for children.


I pause for a moment at that point to quote one of the statements from one of the victims who gave evidence to the commission. That person says:


What really gets me is how respected the staff … were in the community and how they used us for fund raising and to promote themselves as doing good works, when all the time we were treated as slaves, beaten and abused, used for their perverted desires. These were terrible years. No love or kindness, no safety or warmth. Always hungry and always frightened.


Just as remarkable was the failure of the leaders of those institutions to respond with compassion to the survivor.


I want to again quote from the introduction of the report. It says:


At the time of writing this report, we had analysed the experiences of 6,875 survivors as told to us in private sessions up until 31 May 2017.


I want to quote these statistics:


From those survivors, where the information was available, we learned that:


the majority of survivors (64.3 per cent) were male


more than half of survivors … were aged between 10 and 14 years when they were first sexually abused


female survivors generally reported being younger when they were first sexually abused than male survivors …


14.3 per cent of survivors were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people


4.3 per cent of survivors … had disability at the time of the abuse


3.1 per cent of survivors were from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds


93.8 per cent of survivors … were abused by a male


83.8 per cent of survivors said they were abused by an adult


10.4 per cent of survivors were in prison at the time of their private session


the average duration of child sexual abuse experienced in institutions was 2.2 years


36.3 per cent of survivors said they were abused by multiple perpetrators.


…   …   …


More than one in three survivors (36.0 per cent) said they were sexually abused in pre-1990 out-of-home care—primarily in residential institutions, such as children's homes, missions or reformatories. Just under one-third … said they were abused in a school, and 14.5 per cent said they were abused while involved in religious activities, such as attending a church or seminary. More than one in five survivors … said they were sexually abused in more than one institution.


I quoted those extracts and statistics because they confirm what was widely perceived to be the case and to many people probably came as no surprise. Several issues arise from the commission's preface and introductory comments—in particular, the government's failure to act on previous inquiry recommendations. Now several royal commission recommendations are also being ignored by the government in respect to this legislation. That in itself is of concern. We have failed to respond to previous royal commission recommendations, and we now appear to be doing the same.


That, once abused, victims are scarred for life and can never free themselves of the trauma is also of real concern. I'll come back to that in a moment, as to the matter of a person who is currently in jail and the government's proposal that someone who is facing a sentence of more than five years should be treated differently. But what concerns me the most, perhaps, as to the royal commission's findings, is that most of the abuse still occurs within familial places, including in the victim's own home. My question is: what is being done about that? Again, I see very little.


It's also of concern that it's still very difficult for a victim to get justice. Indeed, the failure of civic and institutional leaders to protect their victims has been, and continues to be, of concern. For many institutional leaders, it seems that their priority was to protect the reputation of their institution. Law enforcement and judicial systems were also ill equipped to deal with allegations.


The case of St Ann's Special School in South Australia is a prime example of those failures. Brian Perkins was employed as a bus driver at St Ann's Special School between 1986 and 1991. At the time he was employed, he had a long history of sexual and other crime convictions. South Australian police received information about sexual offences against children at St Ann's school perpetrated by Perkins in 1991. It took 12 years to bring Perkins to justice and subsequently have him imprisoned.


Labor leader Bill Shorten has outlined Labor's response to this legislation, as has the member for Jagajaga—who, I might add, has been a key instigator of the process that has brought us to this point today, and I commend her for that. I therefore only comment on one particular matter relating to the government's response, and that is the matter relating to the qualified ability of victims who are serving more than five years in prison to access redress. These are people who, very likely, are imprisoned as a consequence of the abuse perpetrated upon them. To deny them redress will be a penalty additional to that applied and intended by the sentencing court at the time they were sentenced, and thereby it will add to the victimisation that they have already endured. It seems to me that it is perpetrating one injustice on top of another, and I would urge the government to reconsider that recommendation in particular.


Other members of the Labor opposition have expressed concerns with respect to a range of other recommendations where the government is deviating from the recommendations of the royal commission. I support each and every one of the comments in respect of those other recommendations and, in particular, the time frame being allowed with respect to the making of claims. To say to people who have endured the suffering that they have for most of their lives, 'We want you to act within a six-month period'—or whatever other time frame they are given—'otherwise you will lose whatever right you have,' again, is an injustice. It seems to me that it shouldn't be a matter of time frames. I thought that the member for Parramatta put it beautifully when she made the point that the time frame should rest entirely with the victims.


I close with these comments. We cannot change what has happened in the past. We cannot undo the grave offences that have been committed against so many people over so many years. And, as others have said, for so many, even this report and these recommendations are too late. However, I would hope that as a result of the royal commission's work, these findings will bring about a culture change throughout society; a culture change throughout government and non-government sectors; and a culture change in our law enforcement and judicial bodies. This is so that the commission's recommendations are not just words on paper in the 17 volumes that I understand is the total amount of the report they'll be presenting but that the commission's findings become a turning point in how society sees its responsibility for the protection of the most vulnerable amongst us. It is a change for those to come that we can do something about, and I hope that at the very least the commission's work will lead to that change so that in the future there will not be the level of abuse that we know has occurred to date.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:27):  I rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. I too commend the member for Makin for that incredibly powerful speech. The speeches on this issue have been powerful, because this does cut at the core of our morality and of our values, and also to our shame. I do commend the member. I commend the Leader of the Opposition and I commend colleagues, both those who are here currently and those who are no longer here, for the work that they've done in realising this royal commission and finally getting some redress for those who were affected over decades and decades—thousands and thousands of children right across this country. It's an absolute disgrace. It's a great blight on our nation and it is an absolute shame for our nation, and I thank my colleagues, both those who aren't with us any more and those who are with us now, for actually realising this royal commission.


I want to go over some of the areas of concern that Labor has with this bill and then discuss an issue that the Canberra community has been facing here for a number of years—for a number of decades—at Marist College in Canberra. In the areas of concern, we've actually outlined that Labor has been advocating for the recommendations of the royal commission to be implemented as written. We do have a number of concerns in terms of the residency requirement; the access to counselling and psychological care; the redress and the length of period that it's open for; the imprisonment issue—and that has been discussed at length by colleagues and also in the media; and the legal assistance that's provided in the redress scheme. Labor has a number of areas of concern and they have been prosecuted at length by my colleagues.


As I said, today I want to talk about Marist College. This is an issue that has rocked the Canberra community in recent years. The sexual abuse of students at Marist College was happening in the seventies, eighties and nineties and has affected many in the Canberra community, rocked the faith of many in the Canberra community and rocked the trust in institutions—the educational institution that is Marist and also the Catholic institution as a church. In the royal commission documents, there's a very lengthy case study, No. 13, of just what's happened with Marist College, one of many, many case studies. It is more than 100 pages long. The royal commission exposed that Marist College in Canberra was the most notorious Catholic school in Australia for child sexual abuse claims. It found that 63 claims of child sexual abuse were made against the school, but the true figure is believed to be much larger—well over 100. But who knows? The school was attended by a number of my friends. A piece was written last year in February, and I want to read this piece because it is incredibly powerful:


About 20 boys crammed into the small hotel room in Wellington and the mood was sombre.


Marist College Canberra's First XV had gathered to hold court. The 1978 rugby tour of New Zealand was going well, but they weren't there to talk about football.


The night before an incident had profoundly shaken the group.


One of the players had been called to a Marist brother's room on the pretence of treating an injury from that day's game.


The coach tried to sexually assault the boy. He fled, told his closest friend, and word had spread quickly through the touring party.


The boys, aged between 16 and 18, called a meeting. At its end they passed a resolution: the coach was to be banned from the change room, when the team returned to Canberra, the brother was to leave the school and the Marists were called on to guarantee that he would never teach again.


The shocking incident caused one 17-year-old to question a commitment. At school's end he had resolved to leave for Sydney, to train as a priest.


So he sought the counsel of another brother travelling with the group, a popular man who ran a movie club at the school.


When the boy confided his fears about the act of a man who professed to be a model of faith he got an unexpected response.


The brother's face darkened with fury: why would your vocation be affected by the actions of one man? The boy felt ashamed of his doubts.


…   …   …


Other reports emerged about sexual assaults at Marist Brothers in Canberra in the 1970s and 80s. Among the accused one name stood out …


This is a name that is very well known in Canberra: Brother Kostka.


In 1978, Brother Kostka had reacted with fury when confronted with the sins of his confrere because the questions of a child shone a light into his black conscience.


…   …   …


These shards of memory have been revived by the evidence given to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The breadth of the abuse is astounding, the damage to the standing of the Church permanent and the failure of its bishops unforgivable. 


And one thing is clear. In 1978 a group of Catholic schoolboys was confronted with evil and called to make a moral decision.


They did so in the light of the best teachings of their faith. The vote had been unanimous. They demanded justice for their friend and that the threat to other boys be removed, forever.


That piece was penned by my husband, who was part of that rugby team that toured New Zealand and was part of that group who so bravely, as young men, stood up against the system to call out wrong, to call out evil, and were ignored. How many times have we heard of this instance being called out through these discussions? How many times did we hear similar stories right throughout the country, throughout the decades, of instances where people have called out this abominable behaviour, this abuse, and they've been ignored?


My husband was part of that group and he penned that piece. I know that his friends were also victims of sexual abuse at that school. I know that his friends of friends were also victims of sexual abuse at the school. The fact that it went on for so long and it was ignored for so long is a great shame for Marist College and for the Canberra community. There are so many young lives who were victims of this sexual abuse, here in our community and here in our nation's capital.


The royal commission, in regard to this particular report on Brothers Kostka Chute and Gregory Sutton, found that systemic issues included:


recognition by school staff of grooming behaviour


recognition by school staff of behaviour that may constitute or may lead to sexual abuse of children


responding to reports of suspicions of grooming and suspicions of sexual abuse of children, including in the context of religious organisations and religious-run schools …


It's just endless in terms of the lack of record keeping and the lack of monitoring and supervision. The issues included:


the need for mechanisms for handling complaints of sexual abuse from children


As was mentioned, it wasn't just one child. We are talking about a group of young boys here who had the courage and who had the moral compass to be able to stand up against that. There were so many systemic issues that were identified in the royal commission investigation into the sexual abuse allegations from Brothers Kostka and Gregory. There are not too many people who went to Marist, particularly in the seventies, who didn't know of someone who had sexually abused or who were themselves sexually abused. I know so many of the friends of my husband were.


I want to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge the work that's been done and the courage and commitment that's been shown by Bravehearts ambassador Damian De Marco in calling this out. He was a 'favourite' of Brother Kostka's. I also thank John Ellis who took this issue—not necessarily from Marist—to court and set a legal precedent there. There are many, many others who have been incredibly brave in term of setting precedents and many others who have spoken out who have been ignored. I want to commend, acknowledge and thank them for their commitment and their courage. It must have been incredibly lonely for them for so long. They would have doubted themselves. We know that many of them just found it all too heard to bear and decided to end it. They would have doubted themselves, they would have doubted their sanity, they would have doubted their faith and they would have doubted their trust in the system. It must have been so incredibly lonely for them.


I do want to acknowledge all those hundreds, thousands of Australians who've been through this and acknowledge the fact that it would have been so lonely for you. There would have been so many nights and so many days, staring down so many demons for so many decades. I acknowledge you and I commend you for your courage and bravery and for hanging in there, particularly Damian De Marco here—who was, as I said, Brother Kostka's absolute 'favourite'—who has pursued this issue for so long. The fact that the royal commission documents showed that Marist College here in our Canberra was the most notorious Catholic school, in terms of Australia, for sexual abuse claims has really rocked the community. There are those 63 claims, as I said. There are people who suggest there are others—hundreds more, possibly, who knows? Many of them are friends of my husband and many of them are friends of friends of my husband.


I also want to take this opportunity to thank Marist College for the considerable effort they've put in, in terms of acknowledging what happened; apologising for the sexual abuse by staff in the past; acknowledging the many innocent victims, the survivors, their families and the current community of students, staff and parents; acknowledging that sexual and physical abuse occurred is a source of shame to us all and apologising that we failed in our response, both at the time and afterwards. They've had a number of liturgy services and other ceremonies to acknowledge this and try to at least come to some sort of resolution in terms of the fact that this has brought such shame on the community, on the Marist College community and the Catholic Church. 


My late mother-in-law was a very committed Catholic. She was at one stage president of the Catholic Women's League. She was a devout Catholic, a devout woman and placed great store in her Catholic faith. All I can say is thank God the gorgeous Mary Rose Uhlmann was not alive when reports like this came out. She'd heard murmurings and she was cut to the core; she just could not believe that the Catholic Church could do this, that the Catholic educational institutions could do this to their beautiful young people. The findings of the royal commission would have completely rocked her to her core. I am just so glad in many ways that she wasn't here to hear this. She was a teacher in a number of Catholic schools here in Canberra, in the primary schools. She was a much-loved teacher at St John Vianney's and other schools. I'm so glad in so many ways that the beautiful and much-missed Mary Rose Uhlmann wasn't here to see the results of this appalling royal commission and these appalling decades of abuse. 


In closing, I want to quote from Chris's article again because it is incredibly powerful and does give just one instance of young people actually being confronted with evil and making a moral decision: 


In that room, on that day, those boys showed more moral courage and were better disciples than the princes of their Church. That is a triumph, and a tragedy.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (18:42):  I'm very pleased to follow the member for Canberra and other colleagues in this place to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and a cognate bill. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was highly significant to many constituents in my electorate. These individuals have struggled for decades to overcome the terrible memories, ongoing health problems, interrupted education and shattered trust resulting from institutional childhood abuse. One of those constituents is Wendy Dyckhoff. 


I've mentioned Wendy in this place a few times before and I'm always pleased to acknowledge her again. Wendy herself was the victim of awful childhood abuse while growing up in a number of different institutions in Victoria. She's now a very hardworking advocate for the local forgotten Australians. She's a wonderful woman who always gives to us and to our community, despite her own personal grief and experiences. On behalf of those forgotten Australians in my electorate, almost all who suffered varying degrees of child sexual abuse, I acknowledge the important work that the royal commission has undertaken. I acknowledge how valuable the process has been by giving time, space and serious attention to the many horrific stories that these victims of abuse and their families have been able to tell. 


I know that a forum with the status of a royal commission, in providing survivors with the chance to give their own account and, most importantly, be properly listened to and believed, has been of great healing benefit. Wendy and others have spoken to me in detail about the importance of this healing process. However, the healing process has not been completed and cannot be without the timely finalisation of an adequate national redress scheme. Sadly, for many, the healing can never be completed, including of course for those who have passed away, many much too early in their tragic lives. For others, however, it is vital that the work of the royal commission is given its full effect by paying heed to its recommendations. As the member for Jagajaga stated last week:


The Commissioners had spent five years considering their recommendations and they must not be ignored.


Those people who have already suffered such terrible betrayal of trust by those in positions of power are relying on us, the federal parliament, to ensure that they can now trust again. We have heard them and we will honour them.


A national redress scheme must be established as a vital step along the path to healing. No amount of money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced by survivors, nor can it bring back the years of lost education, replace lost health or rebuild shattered relationships. But it can make a difference to those who face real financial difficulty as they age, largely as a result of their past experiences. Wendy Dyckhoff has explained to me the high risk that ageing, forgotten Australians face of homelessness, serious health problems and lack of support networks as a result of having lost so many family links. In light of this, financial redress cannot be dismissed as insignificant and we must be as generous as possible.


Beyond that, redress is a vital process for our nation to acknowledge the hurt, distress and trauma that has been suffered. Along with redress payments, it's important that survivors have the opportunity to receive a direct personal response from the relevant institution and, of course, we need to ensure that survivors are able to receive appropriate and adequate support services, as well, including ongoing counselling.


I'm deeply concerned that the provisions of this bill will not be adequate in this regard. I'm also concerned about the limits that will be placed on those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more. We know that the links between childhood abuse, severe childhood disadvantage generally and the likelihood of incarceration are well documented. In fact, the whole cycle of poverty, disadvantage and often a self-perpetuating relationship with the justice system are matters that warrant some serious attention, but that debate is for another time, and I acknowledge that.


I want to thank Wendy Dyckhoff and her fellow local activists for their passionate advocacy for the right to tell their stories. Wendy herself went back to school, at Kangan TAFE, to learn how to write well, specifically so that she could tell her story and encourage others to do the same. She offered enormous support and encouragement to all those she knew in making submissions to the royal commission and appearing before it. It is on Wendy's behalf, along with all the other forgotten Australians of Calwell who have put their faith in the royal commission and their hopes in a national redress scheme, that I urge the government to address Labor's concerns about this bill. So many people have invested their hopes in this outcome. It is important that we do not let them down. It is important that we get the redress scheme right.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2018-05-29,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (18:47):  I thank all members for their contributions on this bill. As I have said, this bill will establish a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. It will create a simple and supportive redress scheme. The establishment of the scheme is an acknowledgement by the Australian government and participating governments that sexual abuse suffered by children in institutional settings was wrong. It was a betrayal of trust that should never have happened. The scheme recognises the suffering survivors have experienced and accepts that these events occurred and that institutions must take responsibility for this abuse. I commend the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and South Australia for signing up to the scheme and I acknowledge the consultative way that the Western Australian government has cooperated, and I look forward to their joining the scheme.


As I have told the House, the scheme will provide survivors with three elements of redress, comprising a monetary payment of up to $150,000, access to counselling or psychological services, and a direct personal response from the institutions responsible. The scheme will adopt a survivor-focused approach. Access to redress will be simple and support will be available throughout the application and acceptance process. The scheme is not intended to replace criminal law or common law avenues to seek justice; it is intended to provide a survivor with the means to access a sense of justice through monetary redress and through restorative supports. It is intended to be faster, simpler and less distressing for survivors and provide governments and institutions with the means to deliver justice to their survivors.


We consulted with a broad range of stakeholders in developing the scheme and this bill. The bill aligns with the views of the independent advisory council on redress, which included many survivor groups, as well as the views of other jurisdictions and nongovernment institutions. I've listened to members' speeches and want to make clear some elements of the scheme that they have raised. First, a maximum redress payment of $150,000 will be available under the National Redress Scheme, a position which is supported by states, territories and nongovernment institutions. This amount balances the need to provide a payment that provides a tangible means of recognising the wrongs suffered by survivors, while encouraging institutions to opt into the scheme. In addition, the average payment under the national scheme is expected to be around $11,000 higher than under that proposed by the royal commission.


Second, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse recommended that the scheme should adjust relevant prior payments for inflation. Relevant prior payments are payments made by a responsible institution in recognition of the harm caused by abuse for which the institution is responsible or in recognition of such abuse itself. The scheme will not deduct payments that were made to cover expenses of medical or dental treatment, or payments to cover any other expenses. The purpose of adjusting relevant prior payments for inflation is to recognise that some institutions have made efforts to do the right thing in the past, and to account for changes in the value of money over time. This is different to attempting to take into account any growth in the amount of the prior payment due to interest or investment. The scheme will calculate how much a prior payment would be worth in today's dollars if it were paid today, not how much the payment would be worth if it had been put into a bank account from when it was paid until today.


Third, the current legislation enables applications from child migrants who are now Australian citizens or permanent residents, or who will be at the time of application. With regard to the eligibility of survivors who do not live in Australia, only people who are Australian citizens or permanent residents will be able to apply for redress. This is in line with other government entitlements. Noncitizens and non-permanent residents will be ineligible in order to ensure the integrity of the scheme.


Fourth, through the development of the national bill with other jurisdictions, it became apparent that it would be difficult to ensure appropriate redress support services for all survivors in prison. As a result, the national bill states that people who are in jail will not be able to apply to the scheme while they remain in custody; however, they will be able to apply to the scheme when they are released. A person who has been released on parole or licence is not in jail. The national bill also allows the scheme operator discretion to accept an application from a person in jail if there are exceptional circumstances warranting the application. Such circumstances might include when a survivor is unlikely to be released from prison before the end of the scheme.


Finally, the scheme will provide access to counselling and psychological care to eligible survivors as one of the three components of redress. This will be in addition to Medicare funded services, which continue to be available to survivors, and the significant counselling and family support services funded by the government. Survivors will access counselling and psychological care in one of two ways: where a jurisdiction has elected to provide a lump sum payment, the survivor will receive a tiered lump sum payment of up to $5,000 based on the severity of the sexual abuse they have experienced; where a jurisdiction has elected to provide state based counselling services, survivors will be referred through a state or territory government to appropriate counselling services. Survivors will be able to access counselling in one of these two ways based on the jurisdiction they reside in at the time of submitting an application for redress. If an eligible survivor resides overseas, they will receive a lump sum payment.


The scheme paves the way for all governments and institutions to take responsibility and provide long-awaited redress to survivors who suffered sexual abuse as children while in their care. It is time to acknowledge the wrongs of the past and provide survivors the recognition they deserve. Survivors of abuse have had a long wait for this. It is time we in parliament delivered for them. We can do this by providing them redress by 1 July this year.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (16:13):  In noting my concerns about the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse redress scheme legislation, I point out that I have concerns about the support services being provided and the time limits, but I also have significant concern about the monetary limits. The National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 limits the redress available to survivors to a maximum of $150,000 to any one survivor. The royal commission recommended that the maximum amount payable to survivors should be $200,000 and the minimum should be $10,000, with the average payment being $65,000.


By accepting an offer for redress, a survivor will be signing away their right to pursue a claim for compensation against the institution. It is important that survivors are adequately remunerated through the redress scheme. Obviously, no amount of money will ever, ever repair the emotional damage done to survivors or go any way to regaining their stolen childhood or recovering the life opportunities that they have missed, but nevertheless money can help rebuild lives. This will be the one and only chance for these survivors to seek redress. I want to make sure it is adequate to rebuild their lives.


We're all aware of the horrific abuse that occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants, and we're also aware that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention, but this bill limits the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia or are Australian citizens. It is unfair that survivors of child sexual abuse that occurred in Australia are not able to access the same redress scheme if they have returned to their country of birth and are no longer residing in Australia. So I call on the government to ensure that this group of survivors is also able to access the redress scheme.


The royal commission recommended that survivors who accept an offer under the redress scheme be able to access counselling for the rest of their lives, but the government bill only provides survivors with access to state-provided services for the length of the scheme or with a payment of up to $5,000 to put towards counselling. For survivors whose lives have been utterly shattered, who have had to face their tormenters to retell their stories and who will never truly get over the trauma that has been inflicted on them, the paltry provision of counselling in this bill is woeful. All of the elements of redress are important, but counselling needs to be ongoing to be of any utility at all. It is critical that the provision of counselling be addressed and revised urgently.


Survivors who have been led into criminality should not be denied access to redress. There is clear evidence that people with a history of childhood sexual abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. Denying this group of survivors access to redress not only will deny them the ability to rebuild their lives but is likely to foster recidivism. Attorney-General Porter, I would suggest to you that this exclusion is cruel, short-sighted and unfair.


Although I have concerns about this bill, as I've outlined, a national redress scheme is crucial to the more than 60,000 survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. No amount of money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced by survivors, but redress is an important step along the road to healing for survivors of child sexual abuse. When the royal commission released their interim report in 2015, Labor was the first to announce support for a national redress scheme. It took the Turnbull government until 2016 to commit to a redress scheme.  It is very encouraging that Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have all publicly announced that they will participate in the National Redress Scheme. I encourage the three other jurisdictions to also sign up to the scheme. For survivors to obtain justice, the scheme must be a national scheme. I urge churches, charities, and other institutions to stand up and be counted and to opt into the redress scheme now. I urge the parishioners and supporters, people connected with these institutions, to tell them to sign up for the scheme now. Whatever has happened is in the past, but it must be remedied in the future, and the future must include a national redress scheme. Working together, Australia can move forward. We must not forget the past, obviously, but we must make sure it is never, ever repeated again, and that is a task for all of us.


Labor will work with the government to address these concerns, because a national redress scheme is so important, and it's important right now. The bills have been referred to a Senate inquiry. This inquiry will allow the community to be consulted on points of difference in these bills and the earlier Commonwealth legislation. The inquiry is due to report to the Senate before the Senate next sits. With the proposed start date of the bills being 1 July 2018, barely a month away, the Senate inquiry will not delay the start of the scheme. Labor fully understands the importance of a national redress scheme, so we will support this bill in the House and, as always, we will continue discussions with the government to resolve the concerns that we hold about these bills. A national redress scheme is too important to delay any further, and it is too important, equally, to get wrong.


So, to all of the survivors who had the courage to tell their stories and to sit in those rooms, both public and private, with the commissioners I say thank you. I will do all I can make to make sure the National Redress Scheme is the best that it can possibly be. To the commissioners and all their staff, I again say thank you. I would like to finish with the words of a survivor in a note sent to the royal commission so that the words of these courageous people who spoke up are the final words in my speech, because it is because of their courage that we have this legislation in front of the House right now:


Thank you for the opportunity to tell my story—you cannot know what it meant to be listened to with such respect and made to feel what happened to me really mattered. I hope my experience will help to promote the change needed to prevent this ever happening to another child.

Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (16:20):  The implementation of a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse has been a long time coming for this country, as the member for Moreton outlined in his powerful address to the House today. Survivors of child sexual abuse have been waiting their whole lives for redress for the horrific crimes that were perpetrated against them as children. For decades they have suffered in silence, tormented by the truly awful acts committed against them over many, many years. We've heard it's a long road to recovery for these victims, but hopefully the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse will begin to heal the wounds that they have suffered.


I'm honoured to be a member of the joint select committee on the oversight of the implementation of redress-related recommendations of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, alongside my Labor colleagues the member for Newcastle and Queensland senator Claire Moore and alongside other senators and members in this place. The national redress scheme is as a result of the royal commission into institutional responses, which the previous Labor government, as we heard, created in 2013. Over the subsequent five years, 16,953 people who were within the terms of reference contacted the royal commission. The commission heard from 7,981 survivors of child sexual abuse, in 8,013 private sessions. They received 1,344 written accounts and referred 2,562 matters to police. Every single one of those statistics matters because every single one of those people matters. These striking numbers only begin to scratch the surface, clearly, of just how big this issue is for thousands of Australians.


I want to sincerely thank each and every single survivor who shared their story. I can only imagine that this took an enormous amount of courage and composure. Words are simply not enough to describe the harrowing nature and the horror of the stories that came forward. The average age of victims when first abused was just 10 years old, with 85 per cent of survivors saying they'd experienced multiple episodes of abuse. But actions speak louder than words, and we now have an opportunity to address the many wrongs of the past.


The royal commissioners outlined a clear vision for what a national redress scheme would be in their final report on civil litigation and redress in 2015. Like many of the colleagues who have spoken in this debate already, I want to add my thanks to the commissioners and all of their staff—in particular their staff—for their careful and considered work over five years. I simply cannot imagine what it was like to be a staff member dealing with this important issue. We understand that they did not make these recommendations lightly.


I believe that the recommendations should be implemented faithfully and as much as possible. But, like my colleagues on this side of the House and as the Leader of the Opposition outlined last week, I do have a number of concerns with the legislation before the House—the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2018—as it's drafted. It is critical that any scheme provides survivors with the genuine opportunity to access justice and that it takes into account and caters for the unique needs of this group.


As we've heard, the bills have been referred to a Senate inquiry so that the community can be consulted on the points of difference in these bills and the earlier Commonwealth legislation. In the light of the proposed start date of 1 July 2018, this inquiry is due to report before the Senate next sits so that the inquiry does not delay the commencement of the scheme. As a gesture of good faith in our ongoing discussions with the government to resolve Labor's concerns and an acknowledgement of our longstanding commitment to the establishment of a redress scheme, Labor will support the bills in the House today. But, as we have heard, there is more work to be done, and it starts by working together. We know that the Victorian and New South Wales governments have already signed up to the redress scheme, with Tasmania also announcing their intention to join this week. I was particularly pleased to hear recently of my home state of Queensland also signing up to the scheme. That decision opens the door for Queensland based non-government institutions to join the redress scheme. In announcing that the Queensland government will pay its share to survivors of sexual abuse in government-run institutions, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said that it was an important milestone, acknowledging the suffering of those abused in care. As the Premier said, although no amount of money can return a lost childhood, it is important that we acknowledge what these victims have been through. Ten thousand Queenslanders are expected to be eligible: 5,000 abused in government institutions and another 5,000 in non-government institutions. It's certainly a step in the right direction, but, as I mentioned earlier and as other members of the opposition have indicated, we still have concerns with the bill as it stands. 


As the redress scheme begins operation from 1 July this year, we must ensure there are enough support services for all survivors who are considering making an application for redress and that the services are accessible, no matter where the survivor lives or what language the survivor speaks. We simply can't be left in a situation where we have an unfunded and under-resourced scheme which has been such a long time coming. There can be no excuses that we did not know. We need to make sure that survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. As we know, the bill gives applicants six months to make this decision, while the royal commission recommended a year. It's important that survivors have sufficient time to consider this decision, as only one application to the scheme is permitted. I think it's safe to say that for many this will be an emotional and overwhelming process and it will take time. 


There's no policy rationale for rushing this process. Simply choosing to apply will mean many survivors will have to relive their horrific past as they recall the acts committed against them. This will no doubt have a heavy emotional burden and will result in some survivors needing extended time to make a decision. The bill places an upper limit, as we know, of $150,000 on the amount of redress that would be payable to any one survivor. The royal commission, as we have heard, recommended the maximum payment be $200,000, that the minimum payment be $10,000 and the average payment be around $65,000. Accepting an offer will also mean signing away any rights survivors may have to pursue their claim for compensation through litigation. There are heavy pressures we will be placing on already very vulnerable people. 


The bill also limits eligibility to the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia or are Australian citizens. We know that horrific abuse occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants and that the abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention. I am concerned these people will not have access to redress if they have returned to their country of birth, and today I call on the government to confirm that provision will be made for these groups of survivors to access the National Redress Scheme.


I am also concerned that the counselling provided to survivors through the scheme will not be adequate. The royal commission recommended that people accessing the scheme be allowed counselling for the rest of their life. The bill only provides access to state provided services for a length of the scheme or a payment of only up to $5,000 towards counselling. These arrangements are woefully inadequate and I call on the government to give assurances that this will be addressed. Survivors often consider the government is responsible for the abuse and do not wish to use state or institution-run services. I really do think this needs to be taken into account by states when delivering services. Survivors who are granted redress late in the life of the scheme could also be disadvantaged because they will not be able to access services for the same length of time as survivors who are granted redress early in the life of the scheme. It's important that this is taken into account in any future reviews. For survivors that receive the $5,000 payment, this amount of money will not provide adequate access to support. 


The government has sought to place restrictions on survivors who themselves have a criminal history from accessing the redress scheme. We believe this is deeply unfair. This would require those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more to request special permission from the scheme operator to access the scheme. The rule ignores strong evidence that shows that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. The facts on this matter cannot and should not be ignored. For many, the root of their problems will be an horrific experience they suffered as a child and which clearly led them to a life of crime. To punish them unfairly now would be only to further deepen their already traumatic wounds.


In closing, there is no excuse for any state government, church, institution or non-government organisation not to join the redress scheme. With only a matter of weeks until the proposed 1 July start date, Labor urges all states and institutions to sign up to the scheme as soon as possible. Survivors of institutional child sex abuse have been waiting for redress for decades. They shouldn't have to wait any longer.


Redress means so much more to the 60,000 survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. I understand that no money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced by survivors. However, redress is a vital step along the path to healing for survivors of child sexual abuse. I believe it's incumbent upon all of us in this parliament to work together on further improvements to ensure we get the best possible redress scheme for survivors. I want to make it clear today that I will continue to work with the states and my colleagues towards making sure we address the issues of concern that I've identified today.


Once we've got the agreement in place and once all the states, churches and other institutions have signed up to an agreement, I believe only then may we have an opportunity in the future for us to build on this and for us to do much more as part of the healing process.

"Burney, Linda, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms BURNEY
 (Barton) (16:31):  I rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sex Abuse Bill 2018. On 12 November 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced the appointment of a royal commission into institutional child sex abuse in Australia. She said at that time:


Any instance of child abuse is a vile and evil thing.


She continued:


… too many children have suffered child abuse.


We knew Prime Minister Gillard was correct. She continued:




They have also seen other adults let them down.



They’ve not only had their trust betrayed by the abuser, but other adults that  could have acted to assist them have failed to do so.


Prime Minister Gillard and the Labor caucus understood the importance of finally giving these people a voice:


There have been revelations of child abusers being moved from place to place rather than the nature of their abuse and their crimes being dealt with.


There have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil.


The commission received 41,770 calls, 25,770 letters and emails, held more than 8,000 private sessions and 57 public hearings, and made nearly 2,600 referrals to police and other authorities. Thousands of brave and courageous individuals shared thousands of brave and courageous conversations, many of them for the first time.


The sharing of these conversations, experiences and stories saved lives. The commission heard of experiences from over many decades from people with disabilities; from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; from people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds; and from those who were in prison at the time of their abuse.


The inquiry lasted five years and was recorded in the 17 volumes of the final report. Many people, as I said, were speaking for the first time. The report produced a range of recommendations, including providing victims and survivors with access to the appropriate support and treatment; reducing the stigma of child sex abuse; encouraging victims to speak out and seek support and treatment; and promoting best practice in providing treatment and support services.


No amount of money can ever repair the pain and hurt inflicted. I know everyone has said that in this debate. But it is also clear that these crimes cannot go unacknowledged and uncompensated. Redress is a vital step in the journey towards healing, and everyone—every single member of this chamber and this House—understands that.


It was clear that many victims and survivors were in need of a great deal of support and treatment. However, it is also clear that victims and survivors were simply not accessing compensation. They were either reluctant or otherwise unlikely to pursue compensation through the courts system. Survivors were less inclined to want to relive their experiences and traumas in the public hearings. Furthermore, the prospects of a successful claim for compensation were also not guaranteed. In many instances and especially with the passage of time, there would be great difficulty in collecting evidence or making contact with witnesses, let alone perpetrators. It was a very, very brave thing for people to give evidence. The capacity for perpetrators to provide for compensation was uncertain, and the liability of institutional entities for perpetrators was also unclear. Without redress schemes, many victims would simply not have the opportunity to access monetary compensation in relation to their injuries, whether physical, emotional of, of course, psychological.


Today I rise to acknowledge the injustices and hurts committed on the watch of various state, territory and federal governments and many church and other institutions. I rise today to acknowledge the victims and survivors who participated in this inquiry. I rise to support them, and I rise to support this bill.


The scheme provides three elements of redress, in the form of a redress payment, counselling and psychological services, and a direct personal response from the institutions. Survivors will be provided with access to legal advice services. The scheme will cover sexual abuse and any related non-sexual abuse that occurred when the person was a child and where an institution is primarily or equally responsible for that abuse. The intention of this payment is to recognise the wrong that person suffered, to acknowledge that trauma and to listen to the truth. Access to counselling or psychological services is intended to enable survivors to access trauma-informed and culturally appropriate counselling or psychological services. Survivors will also have the opportunity, if they wish, to receive a direct personal response from the participating institution responsible for that abuse. The survivor will have the chance to have their abuse acknowledged and tell their personal story of the abuse they suffered and the impact on them. This, to me, is the most important aspect of this scheme.


I want to take a moment to briefly discuss the significance of the scheme for First Nations people. The disproportionate impact of abuse on First Nations peoples was explored by the inquiry in its final report. The inquiry found:


… Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are significantly overrepresented in out-of-home care and youth detention, exposing them to environments with greater risk. Racism and lack of cultural safety can also increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's vulnerability and prevent them from speaking out.


It also said First Nations people were placed at significantly greater risk of abuse because of disproportionately greater prevalence of removal from family. It is clear that the consequences of abuse were compounded by, as the inquiry states, the impacts of colonisation, past social policies and the legacy of the stolen generations. First Nations people were placed at greater risk of abuse by reason of racism, denigration of identity and culture, and the destruction of language and intergenerational trauma. The stigma of sexual abuse further perpetuated the disconnection from family, community, cultural traditions and country. The inquiry found that widespread institutionalisation of children fractured whole communities, disrupting relationships and traditional ways of healing. The report also discussed the cultural base barriers inhibiting disclosure and seeking support. Survivors often said they tried to disclose during childhood but were ignored, dismissed or punished. These experiences meant that many First Nations survivors simply could not trust police, government and people in leadership positions. Many institutions simply did not respect, recognise or acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures.


But the report also made a finding about the importance of culture and identity in the healing process. The royal commission found that being strong in culture is protective for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's wellbeing because it can support strong identity, high self-esteem and strong attachments. Strong cultural identity, positive community connections and connections to culture are strong sources of resilience and healing. It is difficult to ignore how the issues of institutionalised child abuse and the removal of First Nations children are inextricably linked.


Before closing I, as have other members of this side of the House, will briefly reiterate our areas of concern, which have previously been outlined primarily by the member for Jagajaga but by other people making a contribution as well. Firstly, we want to make sure there are enough support services for all survivors of child sexual abuse and that they are accessible, no matter where the survivor lives. The bill also limits eligibility to the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia or Australian citizens. We know that horrific abuse occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants, and that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention.


Secondly, we want to make sure the survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. Accepting an offer will also mean signing away any rights that survivors may have to pursue their claim for compensation through litigation. This is a very major decision. We are also concerned that the counselling provided is not adequate. The royal commission recommended, as other members have said, lifelong access to counselling, but this bill provides only $5,000 worth of counselling. We believe the government's placement of restrictions on the ability of survivors with a criminal history, primarily people in jail, to access the redress scheme is absolutely wrong. This ignores the evidence showing that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. This part of the bill must be changed.


In conclusion, I take a few moments to recall my personal involvement with people who have been brave enough to give their story. Almost a decade ago in the Royal Botanic Garden in Sydney as the then Minister for Community Services I led the state government's apology to the forgotten Australians. I also, along with many other people, was here in 2008 when Kevin Rudd gave his apology to the stolen generations. I was also here in the federal parliament when the apology was given to the forgotten Australians. You were in the presence of people that you knew had such a generosity, such a desire to heal and such a spirit that had been damaged as children, and you could see it in the faces of the people that participated in those apologies. You could also see resilience, pride and an absolute understanding that their stories, their experiences and their reality—their lives—were finally being acknowledged by all people in this country. They are extraordinarily powerful moments and things to do.


I thank the survivors for sharing their stories. I thank the tremendous staff of the royal commission, who assisted and supported survivors in what must have been an incredibly difficult process that I know many people thought long and hard about. I thank former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, former Attorney-General Nicola Roxon and the member for Jagajaga, as well as members of the government, for their tireless work in making redress a reality. All members from both sides of the House spoke with heart on this bill. The bill is the final product of many and will mean so much to many. We will continue to have discussions of the concerns we have outlined about this bill, but for now I commend this bill to the House, particularly on behalf of the many thousands of people who made submissions and gave testimony both in private and in public. It is their strength, their honesty and, above all, their bravery to share their stories that has lifted a lid on an incredibly ugly part of the Australian narrative. To them I dedicate the words that I say today.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland) (16:44):  We tell our kids that monsters don't exist, but that's a lie—they do exist. We have always known it. We have just chosen to ignore it or pretended that they're not there hiding in the darkness and in places that most people never see. But we can't do that anymore because the royal commission has dragged some of these vampires out into the sunlight. 


Stan was 12 when one of these monsters arrived at the Christian Brothers orphanage in 1953. His name was Brother Benton. A couple of weeks after he arrived he started raping Stan. Sometimes he raped him three times a week. That lasted for two years. Just try to imagine that. Just try for a minute to imagine the trauma that that little boy suffered for all that time and that as a man he still suffers to this day. 


It took Stan 59 years to tell anyone what had happened to him. A few years ago he told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. He never told the other boys at the orphanage what was happening to him. He never knew what was happening to them as well, but now he does. The same thing was happening to them. Two of them have since committed suicide.


There are thousands and thousands of stories like this—children raped and tortured by monsters in shepherd's clothing. No amount of money can compensate you for that. It can't repair the damage that they did to Stan. What could? But that's not a reason not to do it. Getting the governments, the churches and the organisations that allowed this to happen to pay for what they have done—to pay for what happened under their roofs—is the very least that we can do. And that's what the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and related bill do. They set up a redress scheme, a compensation scheme, for people like Stan. It is the key recommendation of the royal commission.


These bills don't do everything that the royal commission recommended, and I'm disappointed by that. The amount that you can claim is less than what the royal commission recommended. The amount of time you have to accept an offer is also less than what the royal commission recommended. It also doesn't implement the royal commission's recommendation that people like Stan have lifelong access to counselling services. The legislation is not perfect and it's not the way that we would have done it, but I'm not going to use my time in this debate picking apart what we are about to vote on. We can't amend it here without unravelling the agreements that the government has already struck with the states, and I don't want to do that. I don't think anybody wants to do that. We all want this scheme to start as soon as possible.


Instead, let me thank the people who have got us this far. I want to thank Justice McClellan and the six other royal commissioners for the time, dedication and professionalism that they took to this task. I want to thank them for the recommendations that they have given us and, most importantly, for making sure that so many people so silent for so long were finally heard—heard and believed. I want to thank Stan and the more than 75,000 other people who mustered the courage to tell their story. The royal commission would have failed without them.


I want to thank the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin. I know a lot of people in this debate have mentioned Jenny and the work that she has done. It is impossible to thank her enough. And I want to thank Julia Gillard. I feel very sure in saying that there wouldn't have been a royal commission without either of them. Without Jenny or Julia we wouldn't be here today setting up this scheme.


And I want to thank someone who hasn't been mentioned in this debate so far but really should be. Her name is Joanne McCarthy. Joanne is a journalist at the Newcastle Herald. She's no ordinary journalist. She is a Gold Walkley winner. She won that award for the more than 1,000 stories she wrote that exposed what happened in the Maitland-Newcastle diocese over so many years. She's everything that any young journalist would hope to be. She's fearless and unrelenting. She earned the trust of people like Stan, who had no reason to ever trust anyone ever again, and she inspired a Prime Minister to act. On her last night as Prime Minister, the last letter that Julia Gillard wrote was to Joanne McCarthy and it was to thank her for everything that she'd done. I was there the night that Joanne McCarthy won her gold Walkley and I remember what she said to the audience. She said: 'It just shows you don't need an army, you just need people believing that something had to be done …' Joanne McCarthy is one of those people.


Twenty-six years ago, another extraordinary woman named Joanna Penglase put an ad in 21 local papers across Sydney. She was doing a thesis at university and was reaching out to other people like her who'd grown up in homes and institutions and orphanages and asked them to ring her and tell her their story. A lot of people rang. One of the people that picked up the phone and rang Joanna was a middle-aged mum from Georges Hall in my electorate. Her name is Leonie Sheedy. Leonie called Joanna and it was a phone call that changed both their lives. Joanna still remembers the phone call. Leonie said to her 'How come nobody's talking about this? How come we never hear about it? Why isn't it known?' It's known now and that's due, in large part, to the work of Joanna and Leonie because they set up an organisation called CLAN—Care Leavers Australasia Network—an organisation dedicated to fighting for people like Stan, fighting for recognition, fighting for justice, fighting for an apology, fighting for compensation. Just to give you an idea about what these two women have achieved over that time, in 2003 they fought for and got the Senate to conduct an inquiry into children in institutional care. In 2010, they fought for and they got an apology from the Prime Minister of Australia at the time, Kevin Rudd, the then Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull and the Australian parliament.


Leonie is still fighting today. If you look carefully at the TV footage of the royal commission over the last five years or so, you'd often see Leonie out the front of the royal commission, not inside of it, with other members of CLAN emblazoned in their blue and gold outfits, making sure that everybody inside the royal commission knew that their job was to make sure that justice was done. And she's still fighting today to get South Australia and Western Australia to sign up to this scheme that we're legislating right here. She's still fighting to make sure that all the churches and all the organisations responsible for what happened sign up to this scheme as well, and to make sure that in the future this legislation is fairer and better than it is now and as good as it should be. There's only one Leonie Sheedy—anybody who knows Leonie Sheedy knows that. Like my good friend in this place, Richard Marles, we're privileged to call her our friend.


A few weeks ago, Leonie's office in Bankstown was robbed. The robbers stole eight laptop computers, some money and a bunch of other stuff. Leonie put out a tweet telling the world what had happened, that the CLAN office had just been robbed. Soon after that, she got a call from Channel 10. They wanted to know what had happened. And that night on the news, they did a big story about a robber in the middle of the night coming in and stealing all of this equipment from people who had dedicated their lives to looking after people who'd grown up and been neglected, abused and who had suffered so much in Australia's orphanages. A few days after that story appeared on the Channel 10 news, the eight laptops were back. When Leonie's team turned up at work, they found eight laptops in a gym bag near the garbage bins just out the front of the office. I like to think that the person who robbed the office saw that story on Channel 10 that night and realised who he'd robbed, an organisation that does so much good for people who've already been robbed of so much. Maybe he grew up in an orphanage as well. Maybe he's got a similar story to Stan or Leonie or Joanna or so many others—I don't know.


But I do know this: this legislation is long overdue. It won't help every person who grew up in institutions, neglected and abused. It won't heal wounds that can't heal. It's too late for too many people who died waiting for something like this to happen, but at least it's here now. To you, Leonie: I know it's not good enough, but at least we're here, and we wouldn't be here without you. All those thousands of people like Stan, so wronged as children, so haunted for so long by monsters that we told them didn't exist, are fortunate that a little girl, left alone in a cold, damp orphanage in Geelong, who suffered so much, grew up to be so strong and never forgot and never gave up.

"Husar, Emma, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms HUSAR
 (Lindsay) (16:56):  Finally we are taking a fundamental step towards justice for the victims of child sexual abuse. These are abhorrent crimes committed on defenceless children like Stan, who we just heard about from the member for Blaxland. I'm saddened, though, that it has taken us this long. The time to act is long overdue. If we consider that children are our most vulnerable members of our communities, we as adults should be taking every measure to ensure that our kids grow up safe and secure, regardless of who's looking after them.


Labor has always been supportive of this national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. The sexual abuse of children is a terrible crime, and we are committed to providing survivors with the genuine opportunity to access justice for the crimes that were committed against them as defenceless little children. It has taken far too long for this government to get this far in the redress scheme, and it is sorely overdue.


I'd like to thank the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, for her leadership and her advocacy—in fact, not just on this but on many of the things that she's done in this place that have made a real difference in peoples' lives.


On 12 November 2012, the then Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, announced the decision to establish the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. I, along with many on this side of the House, will be forever grateful for that decision. Whilst it will always be a blight on our nation's character to hear the stories of those children who suffered, their stories deserve to be aired, to have the daylight shone on them and grown-ups to be held to account. She stated:


The allegations that have come to light recently about child sexual abuse have been heartbreaking …


… These are insidious, evil acts to which no child should be subject. The individuals concerned deserve the most thorough of investigations into the wrongs that have been committed …


… They deserve to have their voices heard and their claims investigated.


Prime Minister Gillard believed that a royal commission was the best way to do this. It was the Gillard Labor government that created the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in 2013. This is the exact kind of thing that a royal commission ought to be used for.


The royal commission gave the victims of child sexual abuse hope that they could have a future in which they can move on from the past where they were wronged. The royal commission held 56 public hearings over 444 days across a five-year period. Well over 1,600 individuals contacted the royal commission, with evidence coming from more than 1,300 witnesses. The commissioners, six in all, held almost 8,000 private sessions to listen to the personal accounts of survivors. More than 1,000 survivors provided a written account of their experience. More than 680 people worked for the royal commission during its life, and I'd like to thank everybody involved, the commissioners and their staff, for their careful and considered work over their five-year period. Those figures, those numbers, are simply staggering.


I'd like to thank also the thousands of courageous survivors who shared their stories with the royal commission. They stood up and they told their story, which took great courage and determination. I thank them all. And I thank all those people involved, because hearing those stories would not have been easy.


Institutional child sexual abuse has been occurring for generations, across many decades, and has affected the lives of far too many people. Survivors of child sexual abuse have been waiting their whole lives for someone to take accountability for what was done. To provide redress for the horrific crimes that were perpetrated against them is only one part of the story. We know how important it is for more than 60,000 victims to access the redress scheme. We understand, though, that no amount of money can make up for the pain and the trauma they have experienced. However, redress is an important step along the road to healing.


In 2015 the royal commission made an interim recommendations that a national redress scheme be operational by July last year, with Labor being the first major party to support the national redress scheme. Sadly, the Liberals did not commit to the redress scheme until 2016. The commissioners outlined a very clear vision for what a national redress scheme should be in their final report on civil litigation and redress in 2015. The commissioners called for justice for victims. They said:


A process for redress must provide equal access and equal treatment for survivors—regardless of the location, operator, type, continued existence or assets of the institution in which they were abused—if it is to be regarded by survivors as being capable of delivering—


some kind of justice, however overdue. We understand they did not make these recommendations lightly. Labor believes that these recommendations should be implemented faithfully as much as is possible. For too long, society has turned a blind eye to the survivors' daily struggle, and this is to our collective and immense shame.


We recognise that establishing a national redress scheme is a complex task. This redress scheme will be managed by the Secretary of the Department of Social Services as the scheme operator. The elements of redress under this scheme are the monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services, and the opportunity to receive an apology from a representative of the institution responsible for the abuse. To be eligible to receive redress, applicants must have suffered sexual address as a child that is within the scope of the scheme before the scheme's start date.


We do, however, have a number of concerns with the legislation as it is drafted, and it is critical that these issues be addressed urgently. As a result of these concerns, we have referred these bills to a Senate inquiry so the community can be consulted on the points of difference in these bills and the earlier Commonwealth legislation. As the proposed state date of the scheme is 1 July, this inquiry is due to report before the Senate next sits, as the inquiry should not delay the commencement of the scheme at all.


The commissioners recommended that the appropriate level of monetary payments under a redress should be a minimum payment of $10,000, a maximum of $200,000 for the most severe cases, and an average payment of $65,000. This bill places an upper limit of $150,000 on the amount of redress that will be payable to a survivor. This cap is not what the royal commission, after five years, had recommended.


This bill gives the applicants only six months to make a decision, while the royal commission has recommended a year, after five years of work. We cannot see a policy rationale for rushing the decision of survivors and victims. We need to make sure that survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. Accepting an offer will mean signing a deed of release and waiving their civil rights against the responsible institution, and this is not a decision that we should ask people to take lightly, especially the victims and the survivors. Applicants who accept an offer of redress will also receive financial advice.


We are very concerned that the counselling provided to survivors through the redress scheme will not be adequate. The royal commission recommended that recipients of redress be able to access counselling for the rest of their lives. Imagine having an abhorrent sex crime committed against you as a child and then being told that you have a time limit in which you should get over it. The bill only provides access to counselling services for the length of the scheme or a payment to the amount of $5,000. These arrangements are inadequate and need to be addressed. We need to make sure that there are enough services to support the survivors who are considering making an application for redress and that they are accessible no matter where the survivor lives or what language the survivor speaks.


Furthermore, the bill limits eligibility for the redress scheme for people who are living outside Australia or not Australian citizens. We are very concerned that people who were abused as child migrants in immigration detention will not be able to access redress if they have returned to their country of birth. We call on the government to confirm that provision will be made for these groups of survivors to access the National Redress Scheme, because what kind of a cruel lot are they to determine that a sex crime against a child migrant be treated any differently to that of a non-migrant child? To me, that sounds like blatant discrimination. You're either admitting there was a wrong and you are committed to fixing it, or you are not; you cannot pick and choose. The children didn't have a choice and this government shouldn't either. It is critical that the National Redress Scheme provides survivors with a genuine opportunity to access justice and that it takes into account and caters for the unique needs of this group. 


The Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee conducted an inquiry into the two bills that were before the Senate to establish the Commonwealth Redress Scheme for Survivors of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse, and their report was delivered earlier this year. Additional comments were made by Labor Party senators, including recommendations that the bill be amended to restore the maximum cap to $200,000 and to specify that survivors be given a year to decide whether to accept the offer of redress, and that survivors of institutional child sex abuse be eligible for redress, including those who do not live in Australia and those with criminal convictions, as recommended by the royal commission. 


This last recommendation points to another area of concern that we have with this bill. The government has sought to place restrictions on accessing the redress scheme for survivors who themselves have a criminal history. I believe, and Labor believes, that this is deeply unfair. This rule ignores strong evidence that shows that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. Where does this government get off? As a child, if you lived through having a trusted adult who perpetrated horrific crimes against you, would you somehow grow up into a nice, normal, well-rounded individual without any issues? We know that this is simply not the case, as the member for Barton already pointed out. The statistics that back this up are well-known and well published, but, more than that, it is common sense. 


This government's version of redress says that those victims who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more have to have special permission from the scheme operator to access the scheme. We believe that this policy should be changed. The royal commission has made clear that sexual abuse of children is not just a problem from the past; it has a hangover that goes well into generation after generation. It has devastating, life-long consequences, including interactions with the justice system. 


It is now, though, encouraging to see that Victoria, New South Wales, the ACT, the Northern Territory and Queensland have publicly announced that they will participate in the National Redress Scheme. We call on the states and territories, churches, charities and other institutions and ask them to now opt into the Redress Scheme. 


Whilst we look back and thank the victims of these crime for their courage in telling their stories, we must also look to the future, something I believe the survivors would strongly agree with. We must never allow the abuse of children to be covered up or for people to hide in places of plain sight. Changes are needed in the culture, the structure and the governance practices of many institutions. Our task is to now bring about change so that every Australian child can enjoy a safe childhood free of abuse. Survivors now, though, need justice and they need redress, and we need to ensure the safety of our children for future generations. 


It is incumbent on all in this parliament to work together on further improvement to ensure we get the best possible redress scheme for survivors whilst ensuring that we learn from the past and change practices for the future. The Commonwealth must work with the states and institutes to complete the national redress. For too long, the survivors of institutional child sexual abuse weren't believed, for too long they've waited for justice, and we must do everything we can to ensure that what has happened in the past is never allowed to happen again. I dedicate my words here today to the future generations, and during my time here I commit to doing all I can to ensure that this isn't repeated. I again thank those who bravely and courageously opened old wounds, opened boxes of buried memories, and told their stories.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (17:09):  I started reading the report into institutional child sexual abuse, and I wouldn't recommend that people read it in full; it's an incredibly harrowing read, and most of us would stop quite early in the piece. But the thing you do notice, when you live in Parramatta, is the number of times the word Parramatta appears, perhaps more than any other place name in the report. 


There is a group of women in our community who know absolutely why that is the case. And I think it's an indication of how long the whole issue of institutional child sexual abuse has been swept under the rug that most of us in Parramatta don't know that those Parramatta girls are still among us in Parramatta and that they were the victims of one of the most horrendous cases of institutional child abuse in the country. It was, of course, at what we now know as the Parramatta Girls Home that these women, as children, were incarcerated in one of the worst institutions when it came to sexual, physical and mental abuse of children. 


Those women have been fighting for over a decade to preserve the site of their childhood torture as a site of conscience—a place that documents the reality of our history, a place of commitment to our children, a public statement that it will never happen again. Through the work of those women, and Bonnie Durack in particular, an application for national heritage listing was submitted in 2011, and they saw it come to pass in 2017. They've been coming together as the Memory Project since 2012, looking for recognition of their story and the story of all the women and girls involved, in the establishment of a site of conscience around the very place where they were imprisoned as children, the Parramatta Girls Home. They launched in 2012, and the Memory Project has enabled the Parramatta girls to supplant isolation, shame and silence with shared memory, creativity and social gathering. They have a simple message for us: agency for them is crucial to the activation of this institutional precinct as a site of conscience. That means first and foremost that those who experienced injustice—its former occupants—are empowered to determine how we remember the past and how to use it to build a better present and future. In the last couple of years we have seen state government plans to sell off the very ground on which these buildings stand. These women fought so hard to stop that, and now, with the heritage listing and a change in the government's plans for the immediate precinct, they are at least on their way to having this location recognised as a national site of conscience, as I, as their representative, believe it should be. 


The Parramatta Girls Home, as it's now known, has an extraordinary history. It traces the history of the incarceration of women and girls for almost 200 years. It was originally opened in 1841 as the Roman Catholic Orphan School. Children of the female convicts who were taken from their parents almost at birth would stand on the balcony looking down into the courtyard where the women were, trying to work out who their mum was. So, right from an early time, the building has a history of incarceration. In 1887 it became the Industrial School for Girls, then in 1925 the Parramatta Girls Training School, then in 1961 the Parramatta Girls Home. It was closed in 1974 and then became the Girls Childrens Home until 1983. So it's essentially been a place for the incarceration of girls since 1841. It has an extraordinary history. There were violent riots in 1887, 1890, 1898, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1946, 1953, 1954 and 1961. 


It was a place of appalling stories. If you ever sit down and talk to some of the women and girls who are prepared to share their stories, you know that dreadful stories came from this place. There was rape, there was the turning of blind eyes and there was usually no consequences for the rapist. At best, they were suspended, but there was punishment for the child who objected. There was punishment for the person who told the truth. They weren't allowed to talk to each other for more than 10 minutes a day. There was no speaking unless spoken to with the staff. There was no privacy: they were always watched, including by male staff, including in the showers and on the toilets. They weren't allowed to turn their backs while in the showers. They were made to sleep on their side with their faces to the door; they weren't allowed to turn over in bed. They were punished with food deprivation, beatings, scrubbing of concrete floors for hours and being put in isolation cells for up to 21 days without a bed, a bucket or a chair. Sometimes in those cells they were stripped of all clothing and repeatedly raped, in many cases by two of the superintendents. In some cases they were punched in the stomach to bring on a miscarriage if found to be pregnant. They had invasive medical procedures. They were strip-searched by male staff and sexually abused by other children. 


It was known as the 'home for wayward girls' when I first moved to Parramatta about 15 or 16 years ago. It's an astonishingly beautiful building with beautiful balconies, and it was known as the 'home for wayward girls'. It's worth just dwelling on that for a minute, because the children who were put in these homes were put there because they were at risk. A neglected child was defined as one who was destitute or had no visible means of support; who was ill-treated; whose parents weren't exercising proper care or were unfit to do so; who, without lawful excuse, did not attend school regularly; or were falling into bad associations and exposed to moral danger.


The vast majority of children who went into the Parramatta Girls Home in all its iterations were in fact children who were there for welfare reasons, because they weren't cared for by the people who should have been caring for them. Many of them had already been sexually abused or physically abused by family members, and they found themselves in a place, once again, where they were essentially imprisoned until the day they turned 18. There's a giant sandstone fence around that compound. They were in that place and they didn't go outside; they stayed there until the day they turned 18, when they were dumped at a place we used to know as the People's Palace in Sydney. Essentially, they were left there with just the clothes on their back at the age of 18. They had no experience of the world, they had a history of being physically, sexually and mentally abused and they were required to fend for themselves. There was no state support.


It's worth noting too that many of the stolen generation, the Indigenous community who were taken from their parents, were put here as well. In the Bringing them home report the inquiry noted that the definition and interpretation of the key terms of the Child Welfare Act adversely affected Indigenous families. It said:


'Neglect' was defined to include destitution and poverty …


A large of the stolen generation in New South Wales ended up in the Parramatta Girls Home and experienced the same punitive conditions that I described earlier.


The impact on these children was quite severe, as you would imagine. These were children who didn't know love, they didn't know friendship, they were unable to even develop relationships within the Girls Home because of the rule that they couldn't speak to each other for more than 10 minutes a day. They suffered incredible abuse, and when they were released they received no support. Several witnesses gave evidence that they became homeless and turned to prostitution on release. They had no money; they had no clothes, only what they wore; they had no skills because they hadn't been educated. The state claimed at the time that they were too old for education, but actually they arrived at the Parramatta Girls Home as young as the age of eight. But they received no education.


One witness said she went in an innocent girl and left a dangerous and uncontrollable criminal. She had only learnt two things: how to use her sexuality to live and that if she was good to men she'd be rewarded. She was homeless and worked as prostitute in Kings Cross to support herself. With no education these children struggled to adapt to life outside the institution, and many still face psychological issues today. I'm not going to name the incredibly brave witnesses who gave evidence to the royal commission—they are in the report; I'm going to refer to them as witness 1, witness 2 et cetera. Witness 1 has ongoing psychological trauma, including problems with her sex life and her bowels. The smell of faeces affects her, and she dreads using any toilet that's not her own. She has flashbacks, she's never had counselling for fear that it would drag up worse memories and she believes the sadness will never go away. Witness 2 is still burdened by the fear of Parramatta girls. She doesn't trust men, and her experiences have severely affected her self-worth. She vomits when she thinks about the abuse and feels she's been left with a legacy that will never go away.


Witness 3 feels like she's been in prison since she left Parramatta girls. She does not trust anyone and has nightmares about Superintendent Gordon. Witness 4 has suicidal thoughts because she could not talk about her experiences. She believes that people do not want to know about what happened. She fears people and does not go out. Witness 5 has been claustrophobic since Parramatta girls and fears closed doors. She's a nervy person who watches everything and walks close to walls so that people cannot approach her from behind. The sound of keys rattling reminds her of Superintendent Gordon. Witness 6 has had ongoing problems with sex. Talking about sexual positions with her husband makes her feel ill. Locked doors trigger bad memories. She won't go to venues like clubs if she cannot see a way out. She's now in her 60s and the impact of abuse still takes over her life. Another has suffered depression throughout her life and has needed medication for it. Yet another has nightmares that are only cured by heavy medication. She's been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Another suffers from traumatic flashbacks and has depression. With no self-confidence or self-esteem, she does not trust anyone and does not take criticism well. Medical tests make her anxious and she does not like being examined by male doctors. Yet another was committed to a psychiatric hospital after attempting suicide. She has self-mutilated to relieve the pain.


I could go on, because there are many more stories of what childhood sexual abuse has left these survivors with. I know many of them in my electorate of Parramatta. I organised a bus—a big bus, actually—to drive a whole group of them down for the apology. I picked them up at the Parramatta Girls Home and dropped them off there later that night. But there were some who even then couldn't come. They wanted to come; they couldn't face it. And there will be many even now, when this redress scheme unfolds, who will need time to come to terms with what it means for them. I would ask the government to consider the time frame they've put on this—that is, that the bill gives applicants six months to make their decision. The royal commission recommended a year. I would go further than that, having known so many of these women for so long, in that the decision that these women make should take place in the survivor's time frame, not that of the government. It should take place in their time frame.


Labor has a number of concerns about the redress scheme. It's been our policy since 2015. I would say one slightly partisan thing, which is I'm really sorry that it's taken this long. We've known it should be done and we've ignored these children—now women—for far too long. We shouldn't have ignored them since 2015 but we did. But we have a number of concerns about the redress scheme as it stands. We're going to support it because it's really important that it starts, but I want to make the following points.


The first is that the decision should be made in the survivor's time frame, as I've just said. The bill places an upper limit of $150,000 on the amount of redress, when the royal commission recommended $200,000. The bill also limits eligibility to people living in Australia who are Australian citizens. We know, of course, that child migrants were in institutions as well and that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention. We're concerned that these people will not be able to access redress if they have returned to their country of birth. We're also concerned that the money for counselling provided to survivors will not be adequate—it's only $5,000. Some of these people will require counselling every week, or more than that, for the rest of their life, the damage is so great. The government's also sought to place restrictions on survivors who have a criminal history. I believe that is deeply unfair. We know from the research that childhood sexual abuse leads to criminal behaviour in many cases, so there will be people who are in prison who otherwise wouldn't have been there—the child who was neglected by their parents, who went in as an innocent 10-year-old and came out a criminal. We know that this is the case because the evidence tells us. It is deeply unfair, and we on this side believe that that should be changed.


We know this is a complex task. We're encouraged that some of the states have now come in. We're encouraged that some of the institutions have come in. Of course, there always needs to be a source of last resort, because so many of the institutions are no longer in existence. We need to make sure that people whose childhood torturers no longer exist still have appropriate redress. There are a number of things that we on this side are concerned about, but we will support this bill, the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, because we believe it's timely. The scheme needs to start, and we'll support it.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (17:24):  I am proud to stand in this place today to support the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, even though I will raise some areas of concern. I am in awe of the people who came forward and gave evidence during the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, which was a legacy of the Gillard Labor government. Their courage has been nothing short of exceptional, especially when giving evidence was harrowing and very distressing as one is required to relive horrendous experiences. I also have huge respect for the commissioners who sat and listened to extremely distressing evidence from hurt and damaged people for over 444 days, and I thank them for their tireless commitment over five years so that we could see justice done.


I'm going to start my speech with the details of a woman who I have known for nearly 40 years. Sadly, she has passed on now. I will not reveal her identity out of respect for her privacy. Can you imagine growing up in a neglectful family and being taken away by children services on a number of occasions for varying periods of time and put into an institution, separated from your siblings because the boys went to boys' homes and the girls went to girls' homes? Can you imagine not being given the opportunity for an education that you so desperately craved? Can you imagine the only reason that your mother takes you from the home at age 14 is to put you to work and to take your income? Can you imagine, as you get older, being so fearful of going into an aged care facility due to what you remember from being in an institution? Can you imagine what it must be like to carry the secret of sexual abuse to your deathbed for nearly 86 years, because you could not tell a soul? Can you imagine lying on your deathbed and finally telling someone that you were sexually abused as a child in an institution, a place where you were meant to be protected? I cannot imagine living with that secret for nearly 86 years.


Maybe it was because you did not think anyone would care, because you did not think you would be believed, because you were ashamed or because of all of those reasons. I am sure that there are many people out there who have similar experiences and still have not told a soul. I say to those people: I believe you, this parliament believes you and, thanks to the royal commission, others will believe you as well. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has opened the door for people who have lived with this trauma to speak out because, at last, they will be believed. The commission held 57 public hearings, as I said, over 444 days; heard evidence from 1,300 witnesses and also held almost 8,000 private sessions where the commissioners listened to harrowing personal accounts.


It was Labor who was the first to announce support for a national redress scheme when the royal commission released its interim report in 2015. The LNP government did not commit to the redress scheme until 2016. The commissioners outlined a clear vision for a national redress scheme in the final report, Redress and civil litigation, in 2015 and the recommendations were not made lightly. It is for this reason that Labor believes that these recommendations should be implemented faithfully and as much as is humanly possible. Labor thanks the thousands of courageous survivors who shared their stories with the royal commission, as it is because of their bravery that we are discussing a national redress scheme in this place today. Survivors of child sexual abuse have been waiting their whole lives for redress for the horrific crimes that were perpetrated against them as children. For too long now, society has turned a blind eye to their daily struggle and that is nothing short of an immense shame.


However, Labor has a number of concerns with the legislation as it is currently drafted. Labor believes that it is critical that the National Redress Scheme provides survivors with a genuine opportunity to access justice and that it takes into account and caters for the unique needs of individual survivors. We have referred these bills to a Senate inquiry so that the community can be consulted on the points of difference in these bills and the earlier Commonwealth legislation. In light of the proposed start date of 1 July 2018, this inquiry is due to report before the Senate next sits so that the inquiry should not delay the commencement of the scheme. As a gesture of good faith in our ongoing discussions with the government to resolve Labor's concerns and to acknowledge our longstanding commitment to the establishment of a national redress scheme, Labor will support the bills in this House.


These bills establish a redress scheme that will be managed by the Secretary of the Department of Social Services as the scheme operator. The scheme will provide three elements of redress, with applicants able to receive all or just some of the elements. The elements of redress under the scheme are: a monetary payment, access to counselling and psychological services, and the opportunity to receive an apology from a representative of the institution responsible for the abuse. Those applicants who accept an offer will be required to sign a deed of release, waiving their civil rights against the responsible institution. Applicants will be provided with access to support services and legal services throughout their interactions with the redress scheme, and they will also receive financial advice. To be eligible to receive redress, applicants must have suffered sexual abuse as a child within the scope of the scheme and before the scheme start date.


Labor is concerned about a number of elements of the proposed scheme. Labor believes that we need to make sure that there are enough support services for all survivors who are considering making an application for redress, regardless of where they live or what language they speak, and that attention must be paid to cultural competency.


It is imperative that survivors have sufficient time to decide whether or not to accept an offer of redress. This bill gives applicants only six months to make this decision; however, the royal commission recommended a year. It is important that survivors have sufficient time to consider their decision because they are permitted only one application to the scheme and, for many, this will be an emotional and overwhelming process that should not be rushed.


This bill places an upper limit of $150,000 on the amount of redress that would be payable to any one survivor, but the royal commission recommended a maximum payment of $200,000, a minimum payment of $10,000 and an average payment of $65,000. Accepting an offer will also mean that the survivor will sign away any rights to pursue a claim for compensation through litigation, and that is why the amount of redress under the scheme is critical and it is absolutely essential that sufficient time be allowed to make a decision.


The bill also limits eligibility to the redress scheme to people who are living in Australia or who are Australian citizens. We know that horrific abuse has occurred in institutions that cared for child migrants, and we also know that abuse of children has occurred in immigration detention. We are rightly concerned that these people will not be able to access redress if they have returned to their country of birth. Labor calls on the government to confirm that provision will be made for these groups of survivors to access national redress.


Labor is very concerned that counselling provided to survivors through the redress scheme will not be adequate. The royal commission recommended that recipients of redress be able to access counselling for the rest of their life, but this bill only provides access to state-provided services for the length of the scheme or a payment of up to $5,000 to be put towards counselling. These arrangements are woefully inadequate, and Labor calls on the government to give assurances that this will be addressed. Having worked in the mental health sector for 15 years, I can assure you that, when people have been traumatised to the extent of what these people have suffered, that is simply not enough money or time.


Survivors often consider that the government is responsible for their abuse, and they do not wish to use state or institution-run services. This must be taken into account.


Survivors who are granted redress late in the life of the scheme could also be disadvantaged because they will not be able to access services for the same length of time as survivors who are granted redress early in the life of the scheme. This must also be taken into account in future reviews. The $5,000 payment will not provide adequate access to psychological counselling, as I mentioned, because, at the average rate of $150 an hour for counselling, this equates to a mere 33.3 hours of counselling, and that is simply not sufficient and needs urgent attention.


The government seeks to place restrictions on survivors who themselves have a criminal history from accessing the redress scheme. This is deeply unfair. I have worked in an area where I have come across people who have been incarcerated with significant mental health issues and who had been abused as children. They have found themselves in circumstances that are completely unacceptable as they have gone into their teenage years and into adulthood and those have led them to incarceration. Why should they be punished for something that happened to them as children? It's just not fair.


The bill requires that those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for five years or more have special permission from the scheme operator to access the scheme. This rule ignores strong evidence, as I have said, showing that people with a history of childhood abuse and trauma are more likely to be incarcerated later in life. The first Senate inquiry was inundated with evidence from a variety of witnesses and submitters that this rule is cruel and is likely to increase recidivism.


Labor believes that this policy should be changed. Labor recognises that establishing a national redress scheme is a complex task, and it is very encouraging to see that Victoria, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and Queensland have publicly announced that had they will participate in the scheme. We understand that other jurisdictions are working with the government, and we would want to see universal sign-up to the scheme as soon as humanly possible.


For justice to be truly done, the redress scheme must be national. Labor calls on all states and territories, churches, charities and other institutions to opt into the scheme. We must work together to right the wrongs of years gone by and ensure that these events can and will never be repeated. It is incumbent on all of us in this parliament to work together on further improvement to ensure is that we get the best possible redress scheme for survivors.


I want to make it clear today that a Shorten Labor government will seek to work with the states towards addressing the issues of concern that we have identified. Once we've got the agreement in place—once all states, churches and other institutions have signed up to an agreement—I believe that there may be an opportunity in the future for us to build on this start and do more. I would certainly hope that those people in the situation of living with the dreadful secret that the woman who I mentioned earlier in my speech lived with for 86 years, and felt she could only mention on her deathbed, never, ever happens to another person.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:37):  I'm very pleased today to rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, because it gives me an opportunity to speak a little about the bill itself and a little about some of its shortcomings. As the member for Herbert very clearly laid out, while Labor supports the bill and the redress scheme, we think it doesn't go quite far enough in some respects. It also gives me the opportunity of putting on the record in this place the incredible bravery of the people who have participated in the royal commission and my deep gratitude and thanks to so many of those who were involved.


Of course, that starts with our former Prime Minister, my colleague Julia Gillard, for launching the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, and the work that was done by Julia when she was Prime Minister, and by Jenny Macklin, who was the minister responsible at the time, in preparing the groundwork for this royal commission.


The royal commission was conducted in an absolutely exemplary way by those who were entrusted with its running. The work rate was extraordinary: 42,041 calls handled, 25,964 emails and letters received, 8,013 private sessions held and 2,575 referrals, including referrals to the police. The workload was extraordinary, and I do just want to place on the record, once again, how grateful the nation is to the Hon. Justice Peter McClelland AM, who led the royal commission, and to his fellow commissioners: the Hon. Justice Jennifer Coate; Bob Atkinson AO APM; Robert Fitzgerald AM; Helen Milroy; and Andrew Murray, who, of course, is a former colleague of many of us here.


I also want to thank Gail Furness SC, who was the senior counsel assisting the royal commission, as well as all other counsel assisting and the extraordinary staff that worked throughout the operations of the royal commission. I have heard story after story from people who interacted with the royal commission about the compassion, the decency, the thoroughness, the sense of responsibility and the respect that the staff of the royal commission gave to all of those who came forward to tell their stories.


But it is to those people who came forward to tell their stories that my deepest gratitude goes, because I think we really need to acknowledge in this place the extraordinary bravery that goes with survivors stepping forward to give evidence. Some of these people had been lifelong campaigners for the royal commission or something like it, to see a formal response to the abuse they suffered as children. Some who stepped forward had, as the member for Herbert said, kept their stories to themselves for decades—for a whole lifetime, essentially. Both of those approaches take their toll: being a public campaigner takes its toll, and keeping a secret takes its toll. Coming forward to share experiences, for many, was reliving those experiences, and it's a very, very difficult thing to do. So we thank them as a nation, because their bravery means, I hope, that, as the member for Herbert said, no other child has to suffer in the way that these children suffered.


One of the things that were extraordinary about the revelations from the royal commission was how phenomenally widespread this child sexual abuse was and how commonly it occurred in institutions in our suburbs—not in a different place, not in a distant place and not in a distant time but in amongst us and until recently, and indeed, no doubt, still now. In my electorate, there was the Charlton Boys Home in Glebe, which was an institution in which terrible abuse took place. Carl Beauchamp wrote a book about the abuse that he and other boys suffered in the home. The book was called Come Home You Little Bastards, and I launched that book in 2016. Carl spoke about his experience and the experience of his brother and many other boys in this home.


Carl was sent to Charlton Boys Home at the age of 13, having already been sexually assaulted in Yasmar remand home. Carl tells the story of his family, and his family was so very typical of so many families in the inner city at the time when he grew up. He talks about growing up in Redfern and Waterloo and living in Erskineville with his parents—his mother in particular. These boys did nothing wrong. They had the misfortune of being born to parents who couldn't care for them or didn't care for them appropriately. Carl tells the story about the superintendent at the home who was so very violent to the boys, physically and sexually assaulting them, including violent beatings that involved all sorts of injuries—broken bones and compound fractures—freezing showers in the middle of winter, and boys standing there naked being inspected by the staff and having their genitals inspected and fondled. Carl writes about being sent on a camping trip in his Christmas 'holiday', if you could call it that, where he was raped by a man who also raped other boys on that trip.


Essentially, this Charlton Boys Home was run as a paedophile ring. These boys were lent out to paedophiles known to the directors of the home, and when they returned, if they complained, they were brutally punished for complaining. When they reported these crimes, including by demonstrating bleeding, they were not believed and they were further punished. Carl writes about being sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by a man that the home gave him to for weekends at a time. He was one of many boys staying at the home at one time, and he details the abuse that took place at this man's hands. The boys were sent to work in local businesses, often for no money. Carl was sent to work in a pie factory in Kensington where, again, he was sexually assaulted by the owner. Carl wrote in his book about 20 other boys from the home also claiming to have been sexually assaulted or raped by the owner. This wasn't an accident. It wasn't a one off; it was repeated methodical, organised paedophilia with the cover of an institution. And it happened with no recourse and no protection for these little children and a feeling of impunity or invincibility amongst those who were doing the abuse. That is the extraordinary thing about this. 


Carl writes about a little boy, Alan, who was six years of age. He was raped by a part-time officer in a tin shed at the back of the home. When little six-year-old Alan told the home superintendent about the crime, he was abused as a liar and punished for reporting it. What followed were years of sustained humiliation and abuse because of his report, as well as the continued sexual assault. You wonder why children didn't come forward earlier when they saw what happened to the kids who did come forward? It's no wonder. It's a wonder that anybody's ever been brave enough to complain. 


I want to pay tribute to Carl and to all of those who came forward through the course of the royal commission: those who made their stories public beforehand when demanding the royal commission, and those who were brave enough to come forward subsequently. I also want to say this one thing about Carl: he's gone on to have the most beautiful life and marriage. He's a father of four, grandfather—last time I checked—of 12 and great grandfather of 17, and he's still married to his first love, Beryl. To find it possible in your heart to find love and stability, to value family and to go on to have a good life after this terrible start just shows the phenomenal strength of Carl. But not everybody made it through. Part of the reason for this Redress Scheme is to acknowledge the lifelong and ongoing damage that so many have faced, and for us to admit to ourselves that not everyone made it. Too many people never made it. 


Throughout my electorate there are these landmarks of abuse, such as the former Bidura, the former children's court and remand centre on Glebe Point Road. Even more recently, in one of the music institutes in my electorate, around the corner from where my office was, abuse was taking place. This is living memory. These people who were abused are still young. This isn't ancient history. So many institutions and so many people have been affected right throughout our nation. 


Also, I want to take the time I have remaining to say that this this royal commission and the Redress Scheme would not have come about without so many years of hard work and committed lobbying by so many people in our community. Pamella Vernon is a woman who was formerly in my electorate—a former long-time constituent. She's Vice-President of the organisation Alliance for Forgotten Australians. Pamella lobbied me for many years before the royal commission was announced. She grew up in the Central Methodist Mission Dalmar Children's Home, and she has been advocating for forgotten Australians for over 45 years. She can tell you the stories of her family and the affect that what happened to them as children has had on them, and it would break your heart. The Alliance for Forgotten Australians work tirelessly supporting survivors and lobbying for a national redress scheme, and they continue to hold governments to account to demand that governments and institutions that haven't signed up do so.


Many in this chamber and in the Senate know very well of the work of CLAN, the Care Leavers Australasia Network, and the phenomenal work of Leonie Sheedy and all of those who have worked with Leonie over the years. We know of the support that CLAN has given survivors of child sexual abuse, helping them come forward, helping them tell their stories and helping them give their evidence, as well as dealing with their retraumatisation after they have given their evidence to the royal commission, despite the fine work of the royal commission. CLAN has been there through all of it. I am delighted to have been asked to be one of their parliamentary patrons. Their resolve and strength is continually inspiring. I visited their National Orphanage Museum, which provides an incredible, permanent monument to the experiences of the 'clannies'. It is a room full of the most poignant reminders through the artefacts that care leavers have given to the museum—artefacts that bear witness to their lives. It was very moving to visit that museum, and I certainly would urge other members of parliament to take the opportunity, if they can.


Finally, as pointed out by CLAN, the abuse that children suffered in institutions was not just sexual abuse; it was also physical abuse and emotional abuse. Over 25 years in Victoria, hundreds of children in orphanages and babies homes, wards of the state, were used in vaccine experiments and studies by doctors, in conjunction with CSL. It was unconscionable behaviour. There have been examinations in the past in this place that detail some of this behaviour. Another constituent of mine, Stephanie, has helped to keep this issue alive and at the forefront of our minds to make sure that the behaviour involved in these despicable acts of using young children, without any ability to consent, without the consent of any parent, continues to be remembered by this parliament and by our Australian community. I think it's vital that the work that Stephanie is doing to remind people of the use of these babies, including wards of the state, for vaccine experiments continues to be examined and that we, as a parliament, investigate the long-term effects.


I want to thank the late Anthony Foster and his wife, Christine, who did so much work in bringing these issues to light and taking on the might of the Catholic Church. 


Many of my colleagues have detailed the ways in which we differ from the government on this bill. We would like to see changes but, of course, we won't stand in the way of the bill itself, because too many survivors have been waiting too long for the redress that this scheme offers.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (17:52):  I'm pleased to rise on what is a very sober evening to join the long line of colleagues in this place in speaking on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. I'm pleased to follow the member for Sydney after her heartfelt contribution. Like the member for Sydney, I would like to pay tribute to Julia Gillard, the former member for Lalor and our former Prime Minister; the member for Jagajaga, whose tears in this place last week spoke for all of us; and the member for Maribyrnong, whose speech I found inspiring and comforting. I also want to pay tribute to all the speakers on this side of the House. There will have been 22 Labor members speak on what is an incredibly important bill. I would also like to thank the member for Swan, the member for Gilmore, the member for Mackellar and the member for Fisher from the benches opposite, whose contributions brought many of us to tears, and also the member for Indi, who, as an Independent, stood in this place to speak of the unspeakable. 


Over the last several years, we have shone a light on the unspeakable—the organised sexual abuse of children by trusted institutions, by trusted adults. Through long campaigns this light has been shone. Through our storytellers in film and television and through the royal commission, we've had our eyes opened to the horror as they relayed the circumstances through fiction or, more sadly, through the telling by the individuals who suffered. We have found it hard to watch. We have found it hard to hear. It has been unthinkable. As is our human way, we've tried to understand the motivations, tried to make sense of what makes no sense. We are left knowing only that sexual abuse of children is unfathomable and that monsters exist. What we've learned is that it was organised and more endemic that any of us could have imagined. We're left struggling to understand the monsters among us, left feeling completely inadequate in our response to the victims.


Like many in this place I've read transcripts of the royal commission. I've had the privilege of sitting with the bravest of victims, survivors, and struggled to hear their story. In the words of former Prime Minister Gillard:


The allegations that have come to light recently about child sexual abuse have been heartbreaking. These are insidious, evil acts to which no child should be subject.


Indeed, Julia. I would add: no human response is adequate, no monetary redress is adequate, but they now know they are believed. They now know we will no longer look away. We will look clearly at their lived experiences and share the horror that adults could do these things. It is abominable that trusted institutions could hide what they knew is abominable. That survivors wait for redress, wait for justice, even after a royal commission, is abominable. I pay tribute to the courage of the survivors, to their resilience, to their determination to be heard.


When we think about redress and justice, we need to ponder our own lives. We lived beside the victims as they suffered at the hands of those whom we were taught to respect. In our classrooms sat children who were being and had been dehumanised and subjected to vile abuse. We went about our days oblivious to their pain, to their struggle and to their recovery. Because of the royal commission I have since had the privilege of conveying my admiration personally to one such victim, to sit and quietly listen, and silently be appalled. I think the member for Maribyrnong's words captured what I now know:


Only she will ever know how dark the days were, just how deep the memories run, but it is the same trauma, the same betrayal and the same violation of sacred trust that fills the pages of the royal commission's final report. Thousands of our fellow Australians had their childhoods stolen and their faith in people shattered.


They deserve now the best possible systemic redress, as they suffered systemic abuse. This has been a painful process, unique for every survivor, and they have walked it alone, because nobody can really walk it with them, just as they walked years of abuse alone. They've had to go to dark places in their memories to share their pain with us. They've done so trusting that once the abuse of trust and abuse of their child bodies was exposed, others would not have to suffer the same. The scars will cover our nation: crimes that were ignored, people whose stories were ignored and perpetrators who were sheltered. The way we legislate redress is, therefore, critical. It is another test of trust for us as a society and for us as legislators. I speak for my friend therefore when I say that there was an expectation that, once the survivors lay before us the truth of their lives, we would respect it. The royal commission recommendation should therefore be honoured to the letter.


I am disappointed, as others have been, that this bill fails in some of this regard—that, rather than the recommended sum, a reduced sum has been included; that someone's life, crippled by the brutality of experiences that may have resulted in incarceration and further punishment, could be devalued by exclusion from redress; that dollar limits be put on psychological support for survivors. We asked them to remember; we owe them support, as the royal commission recommended, throughout their life to help them cope with the crime and the memory of it. I am disappointed that justice is still pending in the courts for some of those accused. I'm disappointed that this parliament, the survivors and their families are to be held to a deadline of 1 July and asked to compromise. Wise heads on this side urge us to make that compromise, and we will, so that redress is not further delayed.


I will finish with this. We now must be ever-vigilant in our institutions, in our families and in our neighbourhoods. There are monsters and they will do unspeakable things to innocents. They will seek out opportunities, they will seek out like creatures and they will do untold damage. They will do this while holding powerful, trusted positions, if we allow them to. They will prey on the innocent because of our naivety, because of our own fear to confront, to look closely at the horror. This chapter must not close. We must remember and we must be vigilant.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Buchholz

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter) (18:00):  In 1976, I was still a student at Maitland Marist Brothers, as it was then known. One day that year, year 7 student Patrick Garnham was summonsed over the loudspeakers to report to the principal's office. Brother Nestor was not inviting Patrick in for a chat. It was, of course, about something more sinister than I could have ever imagined as a year 9 student. Another year 9 student that year was David O'Hearn, later Father O'Hearn, who spent some time serving my own local Cessnock Catholic parish. O'Hearn was later found guilty of 44 child sex offences. The ages of the victims ranged from nine to 13. Outrageously, rather than offering contrition, O'Hearn fought his charges all the way to the High Court. For a number of years Father Vince Ryan was my local parish priest. He was later jailed for 14 years for numerous atrocities involving young boys.


On the Anglican side of the Christian divide, Father Peter Rushton turned out to be a serial child sex abuser throughout his 40-year career in service to his church. I would often converse with Peter Rushton at official local events. He was always quite pious in his language. Of course, I was totally oblivious to his real and evil character. Rushton, we later learned, would cut the backs of his victims with a knife, drawing the blood of Christ, while anally raping them.


The now infamous St Alban's Home for Boys, where young boys were basically prostituted out by clergymen, was in my hometown from around 1964. The home was always a bit mysterious to me as a young boy. I do, though, remember feeling sympathy for the mainly Indigenous boys who called it their home. But I could not have imagined or comprehended at that age the evil that took place inside that building. The question becomes: how could we have been so blind to this institutionalised evil?


We all like to think it could never happen again, and to that I say, maybe. The answer can be found in culture and in indoctrination. We were raised not to question the church or its methods. We were told that everything that happened, happened for a reason—it was the will of God. The disintegration of this unchallenged edifice eventually came because of the courage of so many victims, some of whom I know. Today we say we believe them and that we weep with them. We thank them for their courage, because it may have saved another generation from the same fate they suffered. We also thank those who helped them, who helped the victims to tell their stories, to secure justice and, hopefully, to find some closure—journalists like the Newcastle Herald's Joanne McCarthy, who relentlessly pursued the perpetrators, no doubt under enormous pressure to back off, and those like local detective Peter Fox, who paid a heavy personal price for his energetic, determined and robust pursuit of offending clergymen and those who protected them, and there were many.


This bill will not heal the emotional or physical wounds. It's far too late for that, but we do hope it helps. The bill is not perfect—far from it. I do acknowledge how difficult it is to navigate so many challenges, such as the agreement of the states and no doubt plenty of advice from lawyers about the minefields which lie ahead. We all remember that we were told by the lawyers that the Commonwealth shouldn't apologise to the stolen generation, since it would open up all sorts of legal problems for the Commonwealth. Of course, we now know that not to be true. I'm particularly disappointed that those who have been imprisoned for more than five years have been excluded from this redress scheme. I say that because it's more than possible—in fact, very likely—that many of them were victims themselves and possibly their experiences led them to offend in the first place.


I shared my own stories about my school and my local parish for an obvious reason. It's to acknowledge that the Hunter region, very tragically, has been the epicentre of all these crimes that were committed over such a long period of time. That is something of which we are not proud of at all; but we are all very proud of the victims, the way they came forward and those who supported them in their determination to find justice not only for themselves but for many others. I vividly recall calling the then Catholic bishop of Maitland-Newcastle just the day before then Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced she'd be establishing a royal commission. I called him out of courtesy to inform him that later that day I would be issuing a statement calling upon a royal commission. I told him that the situation was now overwhelming and had to be properly and fully acted upon. To his credit, the bishop made no attempt to dissuade me.


Let us never again allow religion to be used as a shield against evil. Let the church and let faith continue to play a positive role and let it continue to do its good things—and it does do good things—but let us never allow it again to shield evil. Let us never again be so naive, ignorant or, worse, complacent. What occurred over many decades, and probably for centuries, is a reflection on all of us. We did not know, but we should have known. That's the truth of it. We should have known. Let us never make that mistake again. Let us be forever mindful that there will always be evil amongst us.


Tonight, indeed, young children will be sexually and physically abused in their own homes around our modern, wealthy nation state. That is a reality we continue to face. It is in no small part up to us here in the national parliament to stop the extent to which that continues to occur. We bear a heavy responsibility and we should exercise our power very, very wisely and very, very diligently. For me, our key tool is education. It is the great circuit-breaker. If we want equality of opportunity and if we want to stop abuse happening behind closed doors, we will not be successful without appropriate and smart investment in our education system. It's up to us. It's up to us to do everything we can to stop this evil continuing in our society, and it's up to us tonight to hope and pray that victims everywhere gain something from the bill which will no doubt pass the House in a little while.

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (18:09):  While I'm not listed to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, I have just listened to a number of addresses in this House. I identify with every one of them—but particularly that of the member for Hunter, who has just spoken and suggested that Hunter was the epicentre of this issue. I put to the member for Hunter that the area is no less guilty than any part of the rest of Australia. There's no epicentre for this. The epicentre for this issue was every situation in every room in every building in every institution and every household where it was perpetrated. That was the epicentre—no particular area; not the Hunter.


We all have experiences which I'm not prepared to describe here, or public interactions which I won't go into. People were sent from one parish to another or away to another country. And too many stood by.


The only thing I would say about this today is this. Even though the royal commission has struck into the heart of the issue and exposed this for what it is, it still hasn't scratched the surface of the horribleness of this across this nation and the amount of abuse that occurred, that is not declared, that is not open, that hasn't reached its fulfilment, that hasn't been exposed. There's no road to take to get to that. I'm not suggesting there is a road to take. But I just want to identify with all of those kids out there who have suffered and who have not told their story; who have not made a commitment; who have not said anything for the whole of their lives, and won't. But they'll go on and live with the struggle, knowing that they're a little different or feeling they're a little different, and working through the days that they do in the full knowledge that they have a future and an opportunity in this great south land. And they'll walk away from their past and they'll stick it in a box and they'll forget it and they'll go on.


So I just repeat, and say to the member for Hunter: no; your area was not the epicentre. The epicentre was for all of us to consider and address in our own areas. Thanks for letting me speak.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (18:12):  The preface and executive summary of the final report of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse clearly reveal the gravity of the matters that this legislation, the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018, seeks to address, and the extent of a problem that, for too long, too many people, too many government departments and too many sectors of society preferred to ignore. What was occurring was an inconvenient truth that society was not prepared to confront. As with the royal commission into banking, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse should have been initiated years earlier. The incidence of child sexual abuse, both within the home and throughout the community, was the subject of regular community conversation. Yet no authority was prepared to act—until the Gillard government did, in November 2012. The royal commission announcement at the time was met with widespread acclamation. Finally, society was responding and doing so with a royal commission. From what I've read of the report of the commission, the commission itself is to be commended—as are the 680 people who, I understand, over the years have worked with the commission—for its work, which appears to be thorough and frank.


Child abuse, regrettably, has been a historical fact of life across all continents, all cultures and all generations. Whether today's world is any better, I don't know. But I have little doubt that, as we debate this legislation, children, in Australia and overseas, continue to be exploited and abused.


I acknowledge and support the growing calls for a royal commission into abuse of people with a disability. They too have stories to tell and are pleading to be heard. The sexual abuse of innocent, vulnerable children would have to be amongst the most abhorrent acts of humanity. To violate children and to destroy their lives while they are in the care of those entrusted to protect them is beyond the comprehension of all decent people. Yet it happened, and it continues to happen all too often.


For the benefit of anyone following this debate, I want to quote excerpts of the commission's preface and executive summary, which I believe provides real context to their report. The preface says:


In 1997, Bringing them home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from Their Families outlined allegations of institutional sexual abuse of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.


The reports of two later major national inquiries, Forgotten Australians: A report on Australians who experienced institutional or out-of-home care as children in 2004 and Protecting vulnerable children: A national challenge in 2005, recommended the establishment of a Royal Commission into the sexual assault of children and young people in institutions after those inquiries heard further allegations of institutional child sexual abuse. These recommendations were not taken up by government at the time.


      …      …      …


Over 16,000 individuals have contacted the Royal Commission and by the time we conclude our work we expect to have heard more than 8,000 personal stories in private sessions. Over 1,000 survivors have provided a written account of their experience …


We now know that countless thousands of children have been sexually abused in many institutions in Australia. In many institutions, multiple abusers have sexually abused children. We must accept that institutional child sexual abuse has been occurring for generations.


… For many, sexual abuse is a trauma they can never escape …


      …      …      …


However, notwithstanding the problems we have identified in institutions, the number of children who are sexually abused in familial or other circumstances far exceeds those who are abused in an institution.


The executive summary goes on to say:


The sexual abuse of a child is a terrible crime. It is the greatest of personal violations … It is one of the most traumatic and potentially damaging experiences and can have lifelong adverse consequences.


Tens of thousands of children have been sexually abused in many Australian institutions. We will never know the true number. Whatever the number, it is a national tragedy, perpetrated over generations within many of our most trusted institutions.


      …      …      …


Our criminal justice system has created many barriers to the successful prosecution of alleged perpetrators. Investigation processes were inadequate and criminal procedures were inappropriate. Our civil law placed impossible barriers on survivors bringing claims against individual abusers and institutions.


It is remarkable that in so many cases the perpetrator of abuse was a member of an organisation that professed to care for children.


I pause for a moment at that point to quote one of the statements from one of the victims who gave evidence to the commission. That person says:


What really gets me is how respected the staff … were in the community and how they used us for fund raising and to promote themselves as doing good works, when all the time we were treated as slaves, beaten and abused, used for their perverted desires. These were terrible years. No love or kindness, no safety or warmth. Always hungry and always frightened.


Just as remarkable was the failure of the leaders of those institutions to respond with compassion to the survivor.


I want to again quote from the introduction of the report. It says:


At the time of writing this report, we had analysed the experiences of 6,875 survivors as told to us in private sessions up until 31 May 2017.


I want to quote these statistics:


From those survivors, where the information was available, we learned that:


the majority of survivors (64.3 per cent) were male


more than half of survivors … were aged between 10 and 14 years when they were first sexually abused


female survivors generally reported being younger when they were first sexually abused than male survivors …


14.3 per cent of survivors were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people


4.3 per cent of survivors … had disability at the time of the abuse


3.1 per cent of survivors were from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds


93.8 per cent of survivors … were abused by a male


83.8 per cent of survivors said they were abused by an adult


10.4 per cent of survivors were in prison at the time of their private session


the average duration of child sexual abuse experienced in institutions was 2.2 years


36.3 per cent of survivors said they were abused by multiple perpetrators.


…   …   …


More than one in three survivors (36.0 per cent) said they were sexually abused in pre-1990 out-of-home care—primarily in residential institutions, such as children's homes, missions or reformatories. Just under one-third … said they were abused in a school, and 14.5 per cent said they were abused while involved in religious activities, such as attending a church or seminary. More than one in five survivors … said they were sexually abused in more than one institution.


I quoted those extracts and statistics because they confirm what was widely perceived to be the case and to many people probably came as no surprise. Several issues arise from the commission's preface and introductory comments—in particular, the government's failure to act on previous inquiry recommendations. Now several royal commission recommendations are also being ignored by the government in respect to this legislation. That in itself is of concern. We have failed to respond to previous royal commission recommendations, and we now appear to be doing the same.


That, once abused, victims are scarred for life and can never free themselves of the trauma is also of real concern. I'll come back to that in a moment, as to the matter of a person who is currently in jail and the government's proposal that someone who is facing a sentence of more than five years should be treated differently. But what concerns me the most, perhaps, as to the royal commission's findings, is that most of the abuse still occurs within familial places, including in the victim's own home. My question is: what is being done about that? Again, I see very little.


It's also of concern that it's still very difficult for a victim to get justice. Indeed, the failure of civic and institutional leaders to protect their victims has been, and continues to be, of concern. For many institutional leaders, it seems that their priority was to protect the reputation of their institution. Law enforcement and judicial systems were also ill equipped to deal with allegations.


The case of St Ann's Special School in South Australia is a prime example of those failures. Brian Perkins was employed as a bus driver at St Ann's Special School between 1986 and 1991. At the time he was employed, he had a long history of sexual and other crime convictions. South Australian police received information about sexual offences against children at St Ann's school perpetrated by Perkins in 1991. It took 12 years to bring Perkins to justice and subsequently have him imprisoned.


Labor leader Bill Shorten has outlined Labor's response to this legislation, as has the member for Jagajaga—who, I might add, has been a key instigator of the process that has brought us to this point today, and I commend her for that. I therefore only comment on one particular matter relating to the government's response, and that is the matter relating to the qualified ability of victims who are serving more than five years in prison to access redress. These are people who, very likely, are imprisoned as a consequence of the abuse perpetrated upon them. To deny them redress will be a penalty additional to that applied and intended by the sentencing court at the time they were sentenced, and thereby it will add to the victimisation that they have already endured. It seems to me that it is perpetrating one injustice on top of another, and I would urge the government to reconsider that recommendation in particular.


Other members of the Labor opposition have expressed concerns with respect to a range of other recommendations where the government is deviating from the recommendations of the royal commission. I support each and every one of the comments in respect of those other recommendations and, in particular, the time frame being allowed with respect to the making of claims. To say to people who have endured the suffering that they have for most of their lives, 'We want you to act within a six-month period'—or whatever other time frame they are given—'otherwise you will lose whatever right you have,' again, is an injustice. It seems to me that it shouldn't be a matter of time frames. I thought that the member for Parramatta put it beautifully when she made the point that the time frame should rest entirely with the victims.


I close with these comments. We cannot change what has happened in the past. We cannot undo the grave offences that have been committed against so many people over so many years. And, as others have said, for so many, even this report and these recommendations are too late. However, I would hope that as a result of the royal commission's work, these findings will bring about a culture change throughout society; a culture change throughout government and non-government sectors; and a culture change in our law enforcement and judicial bodies. This is so that the commission's recommendations are not just words on paper in the 17 volumes that I understand is the total amount of the report they'll be presenting but that the commission's findings become a turning point in how society sees its responsibility for the protection of the most vulnerable amongst us. It is a change for those to come that we can do something about, and I hope that at the very least the commission's work will lead to that change so that in the future there will not be the level of abuse that we know has occurred to date.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:27):  I rise to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018. I too commend the member for Makin for that incredibly powerful speech. The speeches on this issue have been powerful, because this does cut at the core of our morality and of our values, and also to our shame. I do commend the member. I commend the Leader of the Opposition and I commend colleagues, both those who are here currently and those who are no longer here, for the work that they've done in realising this royal commission and finally getting some redress for those who were affected over decades and decades—thousands and thousands of children right across this country. It's an absolute disgrace. It's a great blight on our nation and it is an absolute shame for our nation, and I thank my colleagues, both those who aren't with us any more and those who are with us now, for actually realising this royal commission.


I want to go over some of the areas of concern that Labor has with this bill and then discuss an issue that the Canberra community has been facing here for a number of years—for a number of decades—at Marist College in Canberra. In the areas of concern, we've actually outlined that Labor has been advocating for the recommendations of the royal commission to be implemented as written. We do have a number of concerns in terms of the residency requirement; the access to counselling and psychological care; the redress and the length of period that it's open for; the imprisonment issue—and that has been discussed at length by colleagues and also in the media; and the legal assistance that's provided in the redress scheme. Labor has a number of areas of concern and they have been prosecuted at length by my colleagues.


As I said, today I want to talk about Marist College. This is an issue that has rocked the Canberra community in recent years. The sexual abuse of students at Marist College was happening in the seventies, eighties and nineties and has affected many in the Canberra community, rocked the faith of many in the Canberra community and rocked the trust in institutions—the educational institution that is Marist and also the Catholic institution as a church. In the royal commission documents, there's a very lengthy case study, No. 13, of just what's happened with Marist College, one of many, many case studies. It is more than 100 pages long. The royal commission exposed that Marist College in Canberra was the most notorious Catholic school in Australia for child sexual abuse claims. It found that 63 claims of child sexual abuse were made against the school, but the true figure is believed to be much larger—well over 100. But who knows? The school was attended by a number of my friends. A piece was written last year in February, and I want to read this piece because it is incredibly powerful:


About 20 boys crammed into the small hotel room in Wellington and the mood was sombre.


Marist College Canberra's First XV had gathered to hold court. The 1978 rugby tour of New Zealand was going well, but they weren't there to talk about football.


The night before an incident had profoundly shaken the group.


One of the players had been called to a Marist brother's room on the pretence of treating an injury from that day's game.


The coach tried to sexually assault the boy. He fled, told his closest friend, and word had spread quickly through the touring party.


The boys, aged between 16 and 18, called a meeting. At its end they passed a resolution: the coach was to be banned from the change room, when the team returned to Canberra, the brother was to leave the school and the Marists were called on to guarantee that he would never teach again.


The shocking incident caused one 17-year-old to question a commitment. At school's end he had resolved to leave for Sydney, to train as a priest.


So he sought the counsel of another brother travelling with the group, a popular man who ran a movie club at the school.


When the boy confided his fears about the act of a man who professed to be a model of faith he got an unexpected response.


The brother's face darkened with fury: why would your vocation be affected by the actions of one man? The boy felt ashamed of his doubts.


…   …   …


Other reports emerged about sexual assaults at Marist Brothers in Canberra in the 1970s and 80s. Among the accused one name stood out …


This is a name that is very well known in Canberra: Brother Kostka.


In 1978, Brother Kostka had reacted with fury when confronted with the sins of his confrere because the questions of a child shone a light into his black conscience.


…   …   …


These shards of memory have been revived by the evidence given to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. The breadth of the abuse is astounding, the damage to the standing of the Church permanent and the failure of its bishops unforgivable. 


And one thing is clear. In 1978 a group of Catholic schoolboys was confronted with evil and called to make a moral decision.


They did so in the light of the best teachings of their faith. The vote had been unanimous. They demanded justice for their friend and that the threat to other boys be removed, forever.


That piece was penned by my husband, who was part of that rugby team that toured New Zealand and was part of that group who so bravely, as young men, stood up against the system to call out wrong, to call out evil, and were ignored. How many times have we heard of this instance being called out through these discussions? How many times did we hear similar stories right throughout the country, throughout the decades, of instances where people have called out this abominable behaviour, this abuse, and they've been ignored?


My husband was part of that group and he penned that piece. I know that his friends were also victims of sexual abuse at that school. I know that his friends of friends were also victims of sexual abuse at the school. The fact that it went on for so long and it was ignored for so long is a great shame for Marist College and for the Canberra community. There are so many young lives who were victims of this sexual abuse, here in our community and here in our nation's capital.


The royal commission, in regard to this particular report on Brothers Kostka Chute and Gregory Sutton, found that systemic issues included:


recognition by school staff of grooming behaviour


recognition by school staff of behaviour that may constitute or may lead to sexual abuse of children


responding to reports of suspicions of grooming and suspicions of sexual abuse of children, including in the context of religious organisations and religious-run schools …


It's just endless in terms of the lack of record keeping and the lack of monitoring and supervision. The issues included:


the need for mechanisms for handling complaints of sexual abuse from children


As was mentioned, it wasn't just one child. We are talking about a group of young boys here who had the courage and who had the moral compass to be able to stand up against that. There were so many systemic issues that were identified in the royal commission investigation into the sexual abuse allegations from Brothers Kostka and Gregory. There are not too many people who went to Marist, particularly in the seventies, who didn't know of someone who had sexually abused or who were themselves sexually abused. I know so many of the friends of my husband were.


I want to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge the work that's been done and the courage and commitment that's been shown by Bravehearts ambassador Damian De Marco in calling this out. He was a 'favourite' of Brother Kostka's. I also thank John Ellis who took this issue—not necessarily from Marist—to court and set a legal precedent there. There are many, many others who have been incredibly brave in term of setting precedents and many others who have spoken out who have been ignored. I want to commend, acknowledge and thank them for their commitment and their courage. It must have been incredibly lonely for them for so long. They would have doubted themselves. We know that many of them just found it all too heard to bear and decided to end it. They would have doubted themselves, they would have doubted their sanity, they would have doubted their faith and they would have doubted their trust in the system. It must have been so incredibly lonely for them.


I do want to acknowledge all those hundreds, thousands of Australians who've been through this and acknowledge the fact that it would have been so lonely for you. There would have been so many nights and so many days, staring down so many demons for so many decades. I acknowledge you and I commend you for your courage and bravery and for hanging in there, particularly Damian De Marco here—who was, as I said, Brother Kostka's absolute 'favourite'—who has pursued this issue for so long. The fact that the royal commission documents showed that Marist College here in our Canberra was the most notorious Catholic school, in terms of Australia, for sexual abuse claims has really rocked the community. There are those 63 claims, as I said. There are people who suggest there are others—hundreds more, possibly, who knows? Many of them are friends of my husband and many of them are friends of friends of my husband.


I also want to take this opportunity to thank Marist College for the considerable effort they've put in, in terms of acknowledging what happened; apologising for the sexual abuse by staff in the past; acknowledging the many innocent victims, the survivors, their families and the current community of students, staff and parents; acknowledging that sexual and physical abuse occurred is a source of shame to us all and apologising that we failed in our response, both at the time and afterwards. They've had a number of liturgy services and other ceremonies to acknowledge this and try to at least come to some sort of resolution in terms of the fact that this has brought such shame on the community, on the Marist College community and the Catholic Church. 


My late mother-in-law was a very committed Catholic. She was at one stage president of the Catholic Women's League. She was a devout Catholic, a devout woman and placed great store in her Catholic faith. All I can say is thank God the gorgeous Mary Rose Uhlmann was not alive when reports like this came out. She'd heard murmurings and she was cut to the core; she just could not believe that the Catholic Church could do this, that the Catholic educational institutions could do this to their beautiful young people. The findings of the royal commission would have completely rocked her to her core. I am just so glad in many ways that she wasn't here to hear this. She was a teacher in a number of Catholic schools here in Canberra, in the primary schools. She was a much-loved teacher at St John Vianney's and other schools. I'm so glad in so many ways that the beautiful and much-missed Mary Rose Uhlmann wasn't here to see the results of this appalling royal commission and these appalling decades of abuse. 


In closing, I want to quote from Chris's article again because it is incredibly powerful and does give just one instance of young people actually being confronted with evil and making a moral decision: 


In that room, on that day, those boys showed more moral courage and were better disciples than the princes of their Church. That is a triumph, and a tragedy.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (18:42):  I'm very pleased to follow the member for Canberra and other colleagues in this place to speak on the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018 and a cognate bill. The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was highly significant to many constituents in my electorate. These individuals have struggled for decades to overcome the terrible memories, ongoing health problems, interrupted education and shattered trust resulting from institutional childhood abuse. One of those constituents is Wendy Dyckhoff. 


I've mentioned Wendy in this place a few times before and I'm always pleased to acknowledge her again. Wendy herself was the victim of awful childhood abuse while growing up in a number of different institutions in Victoria. She's now a very hardworking advocate for the local forgotten Australians. She's a wonderful woman who always gives to us and to our community, despite her own personal grief and experiences. On behalf of those forgotten Australians in my electorate, almost all who suffered varying degrees of child sexual abuse, I acknowledge the important work that the royal commission has undertaken. I acknowledge how valuable the process has been by giving time, space and serious attention to the many horrific stories that these victims of abuse and their families have been able to tell. 


I know that a forum with the status of a royal commission, in providing survivors with the chance to give their own account and, most importantly, be properly listened to and believed, has been of great healing benefit. Wendy and others have spoken to me in detail about the importance of this healing process. However, the healing process has not been completed and cannot be without the timely finalisation of an adequate national redress scheme. Sadly, for many, the healing can never be completed, including of course for those who have passed away, many much too early in their tragic lives. For others, however, it is vital that the work of the royal commission is given its full effect by paying heed to its recommendations. As the member for Jagajaga stated last week:


The Commissioners had spent five years considering their recommendations and they must not be ignored.


Those people who have already suffered such terrible betrayal of trust by those in positions of power are relying on us, the federal parliament, to ensure that they can now trust again. We have heard them and we will honour them.


A national redress scheme must be established as a vital step along the path to healing. No amount of money can make up for the pain and trauma experienced by survivors, nor can it bring back the years of lost education, replace lost health or rebuild shattered relationships. But it can make a difference to those who face real financial difficulty as they age, largely as a result of their past experiences. Wendy Dyckhoff has explained to me the high risk that ageing, forgotten Australians face of homelessness, serious health problems and lack of support networks as a result of having lost so many family links. In light of this, financial redress cannot be dismissed as insignificant and we must be as generous as possible.


Beyond that, redress is a vital process for our nation to acknowledge the hurt, distress and trauma that has been suffered. Along with redress payments, it's important that survivors have the opportunity to receive a direct personal response from the relevant institution and, of course, we need to ensure that survivors are able to receive appropriate and adequate support services, as well, including ongoing counselling.


I'm deeply concerned that the provisions of this bill will not be adequate in this regard. I'm also concerned about the limits that will be placed on those who have been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years or more. We know that the links between childhood abuse, severe childhood disadvantage generally and the likelihood of incarceration are well documented. In fact, the whole cycle of poverty, disadvantage and often a self-perpetuating relationship with the justice system are matters that warrant some serious attention, but that debate is for another time, and I acknowledge that.


I want to thank Wendy Dyckhoff and her fellow local activists for their passionate advocacy for the right to tell their stories. Wendy herself went back to school, at Kangan TAFE, to learn how to write well, specifically so that she could tell her story and encourage others to do the same. She offered enormous support and encouragement to all those she knew in making submissions to the royal commission and appearing before it. It is on Wendy's behalf, along with all the other forgotten Australians of Calwell who have put their faith in the royal commission and their hopes in a national redress scheme, that I urge the government to address Labor's concerns about this bill. So many people have invested their hopes in this outcome. It is important that we do not let them down. It is important that we get the redress scheme right.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2018-05-29,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon—Minister for Social Services) (18:47):  I thank all members for their contributions on this bill. As I have said, this bill will establish a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. It will create a simple and supportive redress scheme. The establishment of the scheme is an acknowledgement by the Australian government and participating governments that sexual abuse suffered by children in institutional settings was wrong. It was a betrayal of trust that should never have happened. The scheme recognises the suffering survivors have experienced and accepts that these events occurred and that institutions must take responsibility for this abuse. I commend the governments of New South Wales, Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and South Australia for signing up to the scheme and I acknowledge the consultative way that the Western Australian government has cooperated, and I look forward to their joining the scheme.


As I have told the House, the scheme will provide survivors with three elements of redress, comprising a monetary payment of up to $150,000, access to counselling or psychological services, and a direct personal response from the institutions responsible. The scheme will adopt a survivor-focused approach. Access to redress will be simple and support will be available throughout the application and acceptance process. The scheme is not intended to replace criminal law or common law avenues to seek justice; it is intended to provide a survivor with the means to access a sense of justice through monetary redress and through restorative supports. It is intended to be faster, simpler and less distressing for survivors and provide governments and institutions with the means to deliver justice to their survivors.


We consulted with a broad range of stakeholders in developing the scheme and this bill. The bill aligns with the views of the independent advisory council on redress, which included many survivor groups, as well as the views of other jurisdictions and nongovernment institutions. I've listened to members' speeches and want to make clear some elements of the scheme that they have raised. First, a maximum redress payment of $150,000 will be available under the National Redress Scheme, a position which is supported by states, territories and nongovernment institutions. This amount balances the need to provide a payment that provides a tangible means of recognising the wrongs suffered by survivors, while encouraging institutions to opt into the scheme. In addition, the average payment under the national scheme is expected to be around $11,000 higher than under that proposed by the royal commission.


Second, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse recommended that the scheme should adjust relevant prior payments for inflation. Relevant prior payments are payments made by a responsible institution in recognition of the harm caused by abuse for which the institution is responsible or in recognition of such abuse itself. The scheme will not deduct payments that were made to cover expenses of medical or dental treatment, or payments to cover any other expenses. The purpose of adjusting relevant prior payments for inflation is to recognise that some institutions have made efforts to do the right thing in the past, and to account for changes in the value of money over time. This is different to attempting to take into account any growth in the amount of the prior payment due to interest or investment. The scheme will calculate how much a prior payment would be worth in today's dollars if it were paid today, not how much the payment would be worth if it had been put into a bank account from when it was paid until today.


Third, the current legislation enables applications from child migrants who are now Australian citizens or permanent residents, or who will be at the time of application. With regard to the eligibility of survivors who do not live in Australia, only people who are Australian citizens or permanent residents will be able to apply for redress. This is in line with other government entitlements. Noncitizens and non-permanent residents will be ineligible in order to ensure the integrity of the scheme.


Fourth, through the development of the national bill with other jurisdictions, it became apparent that it would be difficult to ensure appropriate redress support services for all survivors in prison. As a result, the national bill states that people who are in jail will not be able to apply to the scheme while they remain in custody; however, they will be able to apply to the scheme when they are released. A person who has been released on parole or licence is not in jail. The national bill also allows the scheme operator discretion to accept an application from a person in jail if there are exceptional circumstances warranting the application. Such circumstances might include when a survivor is unlikely to be released from prison before the end of the scheme.


Finally, the scheme will provide access to counselling and psychological care to eligible survivors as one of the three components of redress. This will be in addition to Medicare funded services, which continue to be available to survivors, and the significant counselling and family support services funded by the government. Survivors will access counselling and psychological care in one of two ways: where a jurisdiction has elected to provide a lump sum payment, the survivor will receive a tiered lump sum payment of up to $5,000 based on the severity of the sexual abuse they have experienced; where a jurisdiction has elected to provide state based counselling services, survivors will be referred through a state or territory government to appropriate counselling services. Survivors will be able to access counselling in one of these two ways based on the jurisdiction they reside in at the time of submitting an application for redress. If an eligible survivor resides overseas, they will receive a lump sum payment.


The scheme paves the way for all governments and institutions to take responsibility and provide long-awaited redress to survivors who suffered sexual abuse as children while in their care. It is time to acknowledge the wrongs of the past and provide survivors the recognition they deserve. Survivors of abuse have had a long wait for this. It is time we in parliament delivered for them. We can do this by providing them redress by 1 July this year.


Question agreed to.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (19:29):  On Anzac Day this year, I was very pleased to attend again the Coloured Diggers march in Redfern to honour Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander war veterans, service men and women. It was the 12th year that we had had the Coloured Diggers march in Redfern, and I congratulate all of those who were involved in organising this very important and significant local event. A bit more than 12 years ago now, the event started very humbly in St Saviour's Church with the Rev. John McIntyre working with people in the local community to acknowledge the often-overlooked contribution of Indigenous service personnel. Each year we've seen this ceremony grow, and this year we saw a fantastic celebration, with the Governor there and other very substantial contributions from dignitaries from around New South Wales and around the country.


One of those I was particularly pleased to see acknowledged was the Redfern local area commander of the New South Wales Police Force. At this year's march, it was very obvious to me that Superintendent Luke Freudenstein has the deep trust, respect and affection of our local Redfern and Waterloo Aboriginal communities. It's so sad to say then, tonight, that Superintendent Freudenstein is retiring after 37 years in the New South Wales Police Force, including 10 years as the commander at Redfern. His last day will be Friday, 8 June. He'll be marched out of Redfern Police Station—I believe that's not what happens to you at the end of the night in the bar; I believe it is an official thing that they do in the New South Wales police!—to the sound of bagpipes. I'm delighted that I'll be going out to the marching-out ceremony and to the dinner afterwards.


Superintendent Freudenstein's community policing work has brought the Redfern police area command into a new era, and it's brought our community to a turning point in relations between the police and the local community. It's very clear, from Superintendent Freudenstein's involvement with Babana men's group, the Redfern All Blacks football club, the junior Rugby League football association and programs with the Tribal Warrior Association, amongst others, that his dedication and the difference that he's making, not just during his working hours but in his own time, have really been second to none.


His approach to the Redfern area is unique. He has worked so closely with programs like Clean Slate Without Prejudice and the bush boot camp program, co-founded with Redfern PAC and the Tribal Warrior Association. It's actually making a difference on the ground. We're seeing lower crime rates and lower rates of recidivism. The proof really is there. In particular, the Clean Slate Without Prejudice program is so simple. It focuses on discipline and routine in the lives of young people through boxing training, keeping young people out of prison and giving them positive role models.


The second phase of the program, Never Going Back, involves working with inmates to give them hope, again through boxing training, making sure that they never go back to prison. Part of the program also assists people in attaining their commercial boating licence. The bush boot camp assists young local Indigenous kids with potential who aren't involved in other local programs. It gives them support to retain their commitment to their schoolwork and sports and so on. It gives them great mentors, making sure that they get on the right track for success.


It took Superintendent Freudenstein a decade to foster the level of trust and cooperation we see in our local community, but it has really paid off in the relationships that we see locally. At the Coloured Diggers march this year, the elders in Babana men's group and the local Indigenous community honoured Luke Freudenstein for his incredible commitment to the area, and I'm pleased to be able to join with them to acknowledge his fantastic work.


I've written to both the New South Wales Police Commissioner, Mick Fuller, and to the police minister, Troy Grant, to ask them if they could convince Superintendent Freudenstein to stay. They tell me that almost 40 years in the police force is probably enough for anyone! But we will miss him very, very sorely. It's no wonder that the Police Force recognised Luke Freudenstein's work by awarding him the prestigious Australian Police Medal announced on Australia Day in the honours list in 2013. While I'm so sad to see Superintendent Freudenstein go, I'm very hopeful that the New South Wales Police Force will find a suitable replacement for all his good work.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2018-05-29,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (12:15):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the related appropriation bills. It's always a pleasure to stand in this chamber and talk about another great budget that this government has delivered for the benefit of the Australian people. I'm very proud to see that our focus as a government with this budget is on assisting the Australian economy to build a stronger economy, because it's through a stronger economy, Deputy Speaker Gee, that we see the ability for people to get a job, to hold a job and to build wealth and prosperity for their families. But not only that; through doing that, we also receive as a government, through the hard work of Australians, individuals and business owners, the income tax revenue necessary to provide the services that we know that all Australians need and require. That is what is so important about this budget. It is built off the back of five years of hard work by coalition governments, which has seen over that time more than a million jobs created in our economy. Those jobs are only created in the economy because of confidence—confidence in the business sector to employ people and confidence in the community, to go out and take a risk where somebody might decide they no longer want to be an employee but that they want to go and start their own business and become self-employed—but it is only possible through a strong economy, and that is what's so important about what this government has been focusing on through successive budgets.


In 2017, we saw some 415,000 new jobs created across our economy. Importantly, in a period where we have seen growth in the number of part-time and casual jobs, three-quarters of those jobs created in 2017 were full-time jobs. That's 16 consecutive months of net job creation to January 2018—the longest positive run since records began. With this record jobs growth, the proportion of working-age Australians now dependent on welfare has fallen to the lowest level in over 25 years—as many have said in this place numerous times, the best form of welfare is a job. The reason for that is that it gives people self-confidence, worth and value. That flows through to their families and it also allows them to begin the process of accumulating wealth and prosperity for their families—though we hopefully see out that, when they're not on welfare, they have the opportunity for their children to see the importance, value and dignity of work. That teaches a future generation of those core, fundamental, underlying concepts that underpin our great society.


How is this strong economy achieved? It is achieved through a government that is focused on bringing the budget back into balance yet, at the same time, returning to hard-working Australians, both individuals and business-owners, taxes that we have received from them. It's because of this focus on the budget bottom line that we see the budget, which was handed down a couple of weeks ago, with the strongest budget bottom line since 2007. The budget will be brought back to balance in 2019-20 and net debt will fall by some $30 billion over the next four years. But, interestingly, the last time that a Labor government delivered a surplus was back in 1989.


The strong economy that we have seen created over the past five or six years ensures that we can guarantee services like the NDIS and Medicare and it has allowed the government to invest in nation-building infrastructure projects across this country—none more important from my perspective, to be somewhat parochial, than the M1 motorway in Logan and also on the Gold Coast. These investments create more job opportunities for all Australians and ensure that commuters in the communities of Logan, even southern Brisbane and also the northern Gold Coast, have the opportunity to get home safer and sooner. Not only that: it also creates the opportunity for the small to medium business owners in our community, whether they are tradesmen or have other service businesses, to be more productive in the day-to-day conduct of their business because they're not sitting in traffic jams on the M1.


Our strong economy is no stroke of luck. It is the result of years of hard work by the coalition government, backed by our commitment to lowering business taxes, regulations, fees and charges. I'd like to share that, in that period, since we got into government in 2013, the government's regulatory reform agenda has cut compliance costs for individual businesses and community organisations by almost $6 billion. The reduction in the regulatory burden on business is key to ensuring that business can focus on what it does best, and that is getting on with the business of business. Part of that getting on with the business of business is taking advantage of our international trade agreements. It's about employing people to provide the services that the customers of that business require. Part of this process has been through lowering our tax rates and making the system fairer and simpler, and in this budget we've seen that the tax relief plan is about encouraging and rewarding working Australians by making income tax lower, fairer and simpler. While those opposite have called it a cash handout, most people, including many in my electorate of Forde, have looked beyond that political spin to see it for what it is. It's a measure to ensure working Australians keep more of their hard earned income, because, at the end of the day, the revenue that we, as governments, receive comes from working Australians.


No-one should be punished for taking on extra shifts, earning overtime or being promoted which would result in them being pushed into a higher tax bracket, and that's where the measures outlined in the budget are so important. They will put an end to bracket creep for so many working Australians and they will allow them to keep the money in their pocket to pay the bills, save for their future or spend locally. In my electorate of Forde, the region of South-East Queensland has a wide range of diverse small businesses, service industries and hardworking families. Nearly 74,000 taxpayers there will stand to benefit from the low- and middle-income tax relief in the upcoming 2018-19 financial year.


The government's tax plan, like everything we've done over the last five or six years, is affordable, thought-out, and considered. We'll provide tax relief now for lower- and middle-income earners and, over time, provide a simpler and fairer tax system for all taxpayers because we need a system that keeps taxes under control so we can remain internationally competitive. We don't want a system that puts a greater burden on hardworking Australians. Having a lower, fairer tax system creates the incentive for people to build and grow wealth. The more the tax burden hurts individuals and businesses, the more it hurts our economy and the opportunity to create jobs. The coalition's tax relief measures will be implemented over seven years in three steps. I was pleased to see that that bill passed the House last week.


Importantly, I'd like to also touch on our energy policies. As we talk to people in our electorates on a day-to-day basis, we know that the cost of electricity is of enormous concern to many, many Australians. This is where the National Energy Guarantee and other measures we've put in place are seeking to put downward pressure on electricity prices in an effort to reduce that cost-of-living burden on families. As we stand here and discuss these appropriation bills, we can contrast our position on energy policy and seeking to still meet our Paris commitments while ensuring that at the same time energy is an affordable necessity of life for Australian families and, importantly, for Australian business. If Australian business costs continue to grow at a rate that is unmanageable, particularly in the energy sector, there will be a flow-on cost and risk to continued jobs growth. But those opposite have a very clear, stated policy of substantially increasing electricity prices because of their renewable energy policies. We know that that will add some $300 a year to household electricity bills than our policies would.


Another area where we're supporting Australian families is our childcare reforms, looking to make child care more affordable. Equally, our school funding reforms will provide record funding for schools across the country.


Importantly, one of the government's main priorities in this budget is to ensure that we keep Australians safe. It is a measure that should never be overlooked, and that is why we're investing another $294 million to make our airports safer and our borders stronger. In contrast, those opposite provide a risk to weakening our border protection measures. If we look back to what they did last time they were in government, we had more than 50,000 people arrive on more than 800 boats, costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars.


It is through the programs and processes of this government, as outlined in this budget, that we see the opportunity for Australians to continue to grow and prosper. We are delivering through this budget tax relief to encourage and reward hardworking Australians. We're backing business to invest and create more jobs through the extension of the instant asset write-off, which we already did through the previous budget, lowering business tax rates. Those opposite are going to put them back up as part of their $200 million-plus tax grab. That is a fundamental difference between us on this side of the House and those on the other side. We are looking to reduce taxes, reduce the regulatory burden and create the opportunity for Australians to be the best that they can be. The only solution that those opposite have is to increase taxes that increase the cost of living.


We saw that even last week in the passage of the tax bills. Those opposite voted against part of the process, which would have resulted in Australians paying an extra $70 billion income tax over the next 10 years. I say to the Australian people: look not at what those opposite so; look at what they actually do. It is the same for us as a government. The things that we have done successively over the past five years through a series of budgets are now reflected in the current budget that we can work towards lowering taxes, reducing regulation and giving Australians the opportunity to grow and prosper for the future. I commend this bill  will to the House.

 (Bruce) (12:30):  I was just saying to my colleague the member for Macquarie that I might take that speech, pop it on my iPad and file it under fiction, and should ever I need a sleeping tablet I'll try that speech first. At the last election, Labor called out the government for its plan to privatise Medicare. Facts were revealed. The intent was clear. The secret task force had started its work. This was an attempt not just to privatise the core functions but to introduce co-payments and shift more costs to the private consumer. Australians were shocked. Labor members were not, because we remember the history of Medicare. The Whitlam government started to introduce it and the Fraser Liberal government got rid of it. The Hawke Labor government tried to introduce it and the Liberals fought it every step of the way, at election after election. Prime Minister Abbott came in and started to try and dismantle the notion of a universal, fully available public healthcare system, but we campaigned hard and we scared them off. The privatisation of public services is in the Liberal Party's DNA. It's part of why it exists. Nothing has really changed, and this con of a budget accelerates the P-word—privatisation. I'll focus first on Centrelink and touch later on the growing mess that is the visa-and-citizenship processing function in the Department of Home Affairs, or whatever they call it this week.


It's no understatement to say that millions and millions of Australians are fed up to the back teeth with the ever-worsening mess and service from Centrelink. The very name causes people to groan now, to shudder: 'Please, no, mum! Don't make me sit on the phone to Centrelink! I may die waiting.' Hours and hours and hours of people's lives are wasted on the phone trying to get basic things done. Last year we heard—this is last year; we'll wait for the new figures out of Senate estimates—there were 55 million unanswered phone calls at Centrelink. The Abbott-Turnbull-Joyce-McCormack Liberal government just cut a further 1,280 jobs in this budget. That's on top of 5,000 jobs that have been cut from the Department of Human Services and Centrelink since they were elected five long years ago. This budget, sadly, continues the privatisation agenda.


To give them credit they're at least being upfront with this one, unlike with Medicare, and are not trying to hide it anymore. At least they put it in the budget papers and have stopped telling lies. But the people don't know the actual costs, of course. Last year, the first sign of this emerged. In the budget papers, buried on a page way up the back, was a mention of a trial of 250 jobs being outsourced to a call centre. It was a trial. The cost was listed as NFP—not for publication—it was a secret. I said at that time in my speech in the budget debate: 'What a load of BS. Privatisation has started.' I was screamed at by those in the chamber: 'You lie! You're exaggerate! It's not the case.' It turned out I was a prophet. This year they're ramping it up. Another thousand jobs have just been privatised to Serco. Let's google Serco. I did this morning, just to refresh my memory. It's astounding to see what comes up. Serco is a British based company, well known for snatching up any chunk of any public sector around the world that it can get its hands on for a tidy profit. It's become a byword in many countries for privatisation: immigration detention centres, prisons, the NDIA call centre, defence assets, Centrelink. Whatever, it will do it. In my view, companies like this expand like an organism, a parasite that feeds off the taxpayer. I quote from a gardening website:


Parasitic plants have the ultimate plant lifestyle. They get their food or water from another plant instead of making food or obtaining water on their own. The host does the heavy lifting and the parasite benefits.


In this case, the taxpayer, via the public, is the host, companies like Serco the parasite, offering cut-price services on the cheap, at least at first. But, of course, as we've seen this record, this movie, play over and over again worldwide, the truth is that, like most parasites, the ultimate aim is to suck the life out of the host and kill its capacity, because, over time, once the loss of capability in the public sector is complete, it's a seller's market and prices go up. At the core, this is driven by a mistaken ideological belief that the private sector is inherently more efficient—always more efficient, always better. It is also driven by the desire to transfer operational and political risk to the private sector and away from ministers. This is based on a prayer that these benefits then somehow will outweigh the profit margins.


The last five years in Britain are very instructive, and I encourage members interested in these matters to have a look at what's happening there. The warning signs for Australia and the path that the Liberal government is on with the increased privatisation of core public services are clear. The notion of 'too big to fail', which we've heard about in the banking sector, is now part of the common lexicon in Great Britain regarding these big service delivery companies that have hollowed out government departments and trashed their capability to deliver public services. It's openly talked about in the media, by government audit officers and by members of parliament across the spectrum. The recent collapse of Carillion in the UK meant that the government had no choice but to step in earlier this year with government-backed loans to contractors and suppliers because they simply couldn't do without this private company that had gone bust through bad management.


It's not just costs, though; it's issues like accountability. We've seen deaths in detention centres, loss of ministerial control, plausible deniability—'It's not me, it's the contractor; I'm not responsible for anything'—lack of transparency, not being subject to FOI, no public reporting and no transparency on multibillion-dollar contracts and the profit margins that are being made on them. The tax affairs are mysterious—opaque—to say the least. I've been raising the issue of why we can't require these contractors to disclose their domicile for tax purposes so that, if you're going to get a big government contract, a fat, juicy government contract, you've at least got to be up-front about where you pay tax and the taxpayer will be able to see that you actually pay some tax. Apparently that's too hard. Integrity is a big issue. There are no public sector values, no obligations and no code of conduct like those that have always applied to public services. We see the scandals, and the employment practices, as we're seeing with Serco and the call centres, are simply about cutting people's wages.


People are fed up with these as outcomes and sceptical about more privatisation. Survey after survey show it. We've seen criminal investigations in Great Britain into Serco and G4S, and five years ago the British National Audit Office raised concerns about major contractors. They explicitly queried whether this growth was in the public interest. I know the public interest for many is an old-fashioned concept. It's one I believe in. It is society and community deciding to do things collectively in the interests of the many not the few. Of course, there is a role for genuine niche contractors and consultants where we need that expertise and capability, but this odious ideology which underlies the large-scale privatisation of core public services is increasingly discredited, and the place it leads to is not somewhere we should go.


In Australia, this is driven in part by the abject nonsense under this government of arbitrary staffing caps for all government departments. What they did was they came in, they got elected and they said, 'I know; we're going to return to the glory days of the Howard era. We're going to impose random staff numbers, completely divorced from any assessment of capability or what a government agency may need to do for society. We're going to just put a staffing cap on, despite growth in population, demands and so on.' It's a blunt instrument, as the secretary of the Prime Minister's own department has described it, and it's a completely irrational method of resource allocation. So you're told you can't employ a public servant to do a job but you can employ a more expensive private contractor.


The ABS has finally told the truth to the Public Accounts and Audit Committee in the last couple of months. They admitted, in evidence, that the cost of a labour-hire ICT contractor—IT workers do computers, which is why the ABS needs them—is 200 per cent more than just employing that person as a public servant. The only reason they can't employ that person as a public servant, the only reason they're wasting taxpayers' money is that the government won't budge on the staffing cap. They said that this is going to be an increasing problem over the next few years. They're going to need to do more and they're going to need to waste more money on labour-hire contractors to privatise services because of this stupid ideology.


I think it's about time we pushed back hard not just against further privatisation. It's time for a debate on insourcing—having a look where things have gone too far, saying that, after three or four decades of this stuff, perhaps there are areas where we've gone too far and it makes economic and fiscal sense to rebuild public sector capability in the interests of not only costs but service quality, integrity and so on.


There are two obvious examples I would raise, which have been well debated and ventilated time and time again—IT services and also engineering, particularly in the case of the states and territories. I've mentioned the ABS example, which puts numbers around it, but in ICT we've seen decades of outsourcing, no internal capability left, a litany of stuff-ups by government departments, time and time again, every time they try and do a big IT project—because, as someone in the private sector said to me, 'The problem with government departments now is that they're not an informed purchaser; they actually have no-one left who understands this stuff and knows whether they're buying $200 million of crap or not.' That's a direct quote, and it's fair. In my view, great societies have great public services. To do that, you need highly skilled, highly capable public servants—who knew?—people who can actually scope, administer, evaluate and deliver services. The government should stop this ideological tack and effort to privatise critical public services. It makes no meaningful contribution to improving service delivery in our society.


This budget ramps up the Liberal government's avoidance of scrutiny and its complete lack of integrity. I'll give a couple of examples. Surprisingly, shockingly, over the next four years this budget bakes in $26 million of cuts to ASIC's core operational funding. This is not the special projects stuff; this is the everyday core funding that the regulator of the financial and banking sector needs to do its job. You might think that's a 1 April joke coming in the context of the scandals emerging from the banking royal commission—the royal commission which the Prime Minister, the former investment banker himself, had to be dragged kicking and screaming to actually have. There is shocking evidence emerging of mismanagement, cultural problems and a failure of the regulator to act. There is scrutiny now on handshake deals. You commit a crime, you get found out and you get popped in a room where the regulator says: 'You've been a bit naughty there; let's negotiate a penalty.' And you say: 'I don't want to pay that much.' And they say: 'All right, what about a bit less?' You say: 'I don't want to pay that much.' They say: 'What about a bit less?' You say: 'All right, we'll cut a deal on that.' The regulator has been shown to have a lack of resources, yet the government is cutting funding to the banking and financial services regulator. You'd think even the boneheads in the government who put the budget together would realise this is not the time to cut the funding to ASIC.


But while they are on a roll, from the end of this year the budget also ends funding for the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce—just as the banking royal commission winds up! It's going to be magic: 'We'll have an election by then; we can go back to normal programming.' This is a task force consisting of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police, ASIC and others investigating the most serious crimes in the financial sector. They've admitted they have 22 ongoing matters. They won't be wrapped up by the end of the year. Who knows what will happen? The government should send a leadership signal and a cultural signal to this sector right now that this stuff will not be tolerated and there is going to be  a strong cop on the beat rather than cutting funding to ASIC and winding up the task force that is actually trying to do something about it.


It comes amidst $205 million of cuts to the Australian Federal Police. Apparently the Prime Minister says that's not the case, yet you've got the Federal Police saying it is. I don't know who is lying now. We'll let the public work that out. There have been 4,000 staff cut from the ATO since this government was elected five long years ago, many of which, we have proven, have been replaced with short-term labour-hire contractors that actually cost more. This is not a cost-saving measure; it's an ideological attack because of those staff caps. And there has been no support for a national integrity commission.


Labor has committed to introduce a national integrity commission ensuring that the public sector, MPs and the Governor-General—everyone in the public sector—are subject to proper scrutiny. The Attorney-General finally fessed up last week in a letter he wrote back—an outbreak of honesty moment. He said, 'The government believes there is no persuasive evidence that we need this.' He used to say that he wasn't close minded. Now he says 'no persuasive evidence', so we presume he's now closed his mind. It's suggested by that letter that the government will therefore fall well short of any anticorruption body with broad-ranging powers. It's important to note that anticorruption bodies are very different from fighting crime: they're proactive, they're investigative, they have compulsion and they provide a much stronger effect on the system of deterrence, as we've seen in the states and territories. Admittedly, there are flaws in some of the state and territory bodies, but I don't think anyone in the real world, in the general public, would say that they have not served an important purpose overall in flushing out corruption in the public sector and setting a better culture in deterrence. I think the case has been established on its merits and made quite thoughtfully by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General. I also think it's a step—it's not sufficient but perhaps a necessary step—to starting to rebuild some of the public trust which has been lost in a very damaging way between citizens, those elected to serve them and the public sector more broadly.


This is an issue for which I'd encourage the Liberal backbench to focus for once on something useful. I don't mean the member for Bennelong; I think his comments on cities, affordable housing and so on are laudable. But, instead of advocating for the watering down of legislation so the priority would be to let people say more racist stuff by weakening the Racial Discrimination Act or for burning coal—the Monash Forum shamefully appropriating the name of Sir General John Monash for purposes against the wishes of his family: burn coal, burn coal—perhaps this is something the Liberal backbench can focus on. Otherwise, Australians can rightfully ask, 'What have you got to hide?'

Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (12:45):  As I said in my maiden speech and as I've said in many contributions since then, I'm in parliament to support those hardworking Australians that want to apply their effort and succeed. That's because I want to help build an Australia that empowers people, an Australia that rewards individual and community effort. I'm proud to be part of this government making sure that it manages taxpayers' money in a very disciplined way. This government has kept a tight rein on spending, which is forecast to grow by only 1.9 per cent, the lowest level of spending growth of any government in the last 50 years and half of the four per cent we inherited from Labor. The underlying catch balance is the best position we've seen since the Howard government's final budget. The deficit has halved in the past two years. The budget returns to balance in 2019-20, and since the 2016 election this government has legislated over $41 billion of budget repair measures.


With the financial leadership of the Prime Minister, Treasurer and Minister for Finance, the Australian economy continues to strengthen. Jobs are being created and investment is rising. Responsible economic management also has retained Australia's AAA credit rating. For the first time in a decade, the government is not borrowing to pay for essential services. The essentials Australians rely on, like Medicare, PBS medicines, the NDIS, school funding and hospital funding are all being funded sustainably. The government is funding priority nation-building infrastructure that busts congestion and makes our roads and communities safer. I'll have some more to say in relation to those important projects that affect my own electorate of Tangney.


But a balanced budget enables a government to provide responsible tax relief that backs businesses to invest and create jobs. The government has already legislated tax relief for Australian businesses with a turnover of under $50 million, taking their rates from 30 per cent to 27.5 per cent and eventually to 25 per cent. That's relief for around 3.3 million small and medium businesses, employing about 6.8 million Australians. We, the government, remain absolutely committed to extending tax relief to all businesses.


Small businesses in my electorate and around the nation have also benefited from the extension of the $20,000 instant asset write-off. Simpler BAS reporting is saving around 2.7 million small businesses an average of $590 a year. This government is backing businesses to invest and to create jobs.


But a balanced budget also enables the government to provide responsible tax relief to encourage hardworking Australians. There can be no doubt that this government believes in lower taxes: lower taxes for businesses and lower taxes for individuals who work hard do provide for themselves and their families. Taxpayers always know how to in spend their own money better than the big government. Australians need to feel confident that they can take on additional work, work extra hours and seek promotion knowing that their extra work will be rewarded in extra income and doesn't just go to the government in higher taxes.


The affordable plan of income tax relief passed by the House just a few days ago is proof that this government is backing those hardworking Australians. This is a plan that makes sure we give people immediate tax relief, that addresses bracket creep so people don't move into higher tax brackets and that makes our tax system fairer and simpler by removing altogether the 37 per cent marginal rate of tax. Importantly, this government's personal income tax plan will mean that 94 per cent of Australians will never pay more than 32.5 per cent as a marginal tax rate. Australians will know they can take on those extra hours, accept a promotion or start a business and do better for themselves, and be rewarded for that effort. This plan for income tax relief will fairly leave more of Australians' hard-earned income in their own pockets.


The alternative under Labor is always higher taxes. Labor describe lower taxes as a 'handout' or a 'giveaway' and quite shamelessly committed to $220 billion of higher taxes, not to mention Labor's $5 billion-a-year assault on the savings of self-funded retirees and older Australians. Labor are refusing to agree to all three stages and the full tax relief of $143.95 billion that is set out in this government's income tax plan. Labor's message to Australia is they want more of your hard-earned money to bank bracket creep and higher taxes because they can spend it better than you. Liberal governments will always look for ways to reduce the burden of tax on workers, families and businesses. Labor will always do the opposite. 


Some of the best news around the budget is the creation of full-time jobs. One million jobs have been created since the coalition government was elected in 2013. One of the positive things about record jobs growth is the number of people who are getting off welfare and starting to earn a wage. Strengthening the economy along with the government's action to ensure welfare is well targeted have resulted in welfare dependency for working-age Australians falling to its lowest level in 25 years. In the three years to June 2017, the numbers of working-age Australians on income support fell by 140,000 people to 2.4 million. This represents a reduction of around $23 billion in future lifetime costs to the welfare system and the taxpayers that fund it.


However, welfare is still the largest component of government spending, with $176 billion estimated to be spent in the 2018-19 year. I'm the first to say that it's important that we have a strong safety net to support all Australians. The system must support our most vulnerable and those who are genuine in their need. But working-age welfare should not be taken for granted. As chair of the government's social services policy committee, I was pleased to work with Minister Porter and Minister Tudge, the former social services and human services ministers, and now Minister Tehan and Minister Keenan in these ministerial roles. They are dynamic ministers who are willing to trying new initiatives to get more Australians off welfare and into work, like the Cashless Debit Card. I remind members that this card doesn't change the amount of Centrelink a person receives but restricts their ability to purchase alcohol, drugs or use that money for gambling. This card makes lives better, and we are finding that in the trial communities. I personally visited Kununurra and Wyndham to see the results for myself and to talk with the individuals in those communities. The Goldfields in WA, Ceduna in South Australia and, hopefully, soon Bundaberg and Hervey Bay will benefit from this card.


Another initiative, the two-year trial of drug testing for recipients of Newstart and youth allowance, is compassionate and will make sure that people who have drug problems and need support get the treatment they need to beat their drug addiction, because there will be additional support services funded with these trials. The new jobseeker payment will replace seven existing payments making our complex welfare system simpler. It will make clear what this payment is for, and assistance will always be there to help people into work. I always look for the best ways to support people on welfare, particularly where welfare dependency exists alongside harm relating to drug and alcohol abuse. This budget strengthens the government's commitment to jobseekers and people supported by the safety net as well as the taxpayers who make sure Australia is able to provide our generous welfare system.


While supporting taxpayers and jobseekers, the budget also delivers important local infrastructure and sport programs in my community. I was very pleased to see greater investment in sporting club infrastructure because participation in sport is vital for health and wellbeing and something that I'm very passionate about. Eighty-one per cent of Australian children are not meeting the recommended level of activity to stay healthy. One-quarter of children are overweight or obese. Encouraging young Australians to get more active is critical. This budget delivers $29.7 million for the sports infrastructure grants program. Local sporting clubs will share in grants of up to $500,000 for small- to medium-scale building projects or for improvements to existing and ageing facilities. This funding is the opportunity for clubs to kickstart their new builds or renovations and consider projects that they might not otherwise have been able to afford.


Our young athletes train so hard. Mums and dads volunteer a lot of their time managing teams, coaching, refereeing, doing rosters and running the canteen. But they need help with the big construction costs of courts, clubrooms, changerooms, new toilets and associated infrastructure. Smaller, Stronger Communities infrastructure grants are already having a huge impact in my community. With a team effort between federal grants, contributions from the clubs and local fundraising, we have upgraded clubrooms, renovated toilets and change rooms, purchased equipment for junior sporting clubs, and installed lighting, scoreboards, fences, new goals and even starting blocks for a pool. I'm glad to see the Stronger Communities program continue in this budget, because Stronger Communities and local sports infrastructure grants will kickstart many more builds and renovations in the electorate of Tangney and will help our clubs get more kids out there on the ovals and on the courts playing weekly team sport, as we hope they should.




Mr ALEXANDER:
  And tennis.




Mr MORTON:
  And tennis—from the member for Bennelong. The Willetton basketball stadium is very important to me. I'm sure many members are aware of the updates I've given to this House in relation to funding. There were plenty of nay-sayers along the journey, but there it is: $5.5 million of federal funding for the expansion of the Willetton basketball stadium, and that represents 50 per cent of the stadium expansion project. It was a special day when we made that announcement. There was a lot of excitement. This will mean four new indoor courts, new change rooms, meeting rooms, halls, offices and space for supporting health and allied health facilities. Those kids who are on the waiting list—150 or more of them—will now have an opportunity to play team sport that wasn't there because the infrastructure wasn't sufficient. I'm so pleased that we've been able to assist the Willetton basketball stadium. This is an association with over 300 teams and over 3,500 players, and it is supported by about 1,100 volunteers. 


The federal funding is not the only funding. $2.2 million has been provided by the City of Canning and $1.5 million has been provided by the state government. Construction will get underway in the second half of this calendar year. The Local Sporting Champions grants are important, and I'm very pleased that there is an expansion of these grants in the budget. This is something that I've been campaigning for as a Western Australian member of parliament. There is a 56 per cent increase to this important program. That represents, on the existing funding models, 3,000 additional young athletes across Australia who will be able to receive federal government grants to support their attendance at their international or national competitions. 


In Tangney, it's very popular. One of the recent rounds saw 53 applications for 22 grants. My job is to work with the minister to ensure that we can redirect some of that funding to make sure that it recognises the effort and energy that families go to to access these grants. When there is a sporting event in Sydney, for example, it costs somebody more to travel to that event if they're travelling from Perth or Cairns than if they were travelling from Canberra. This grants program should recognise those additional costs, and I'm sure many of the regional members of parliament in this House will support me in having that grant program readjusted to recognise those differences. 


But what is really important for my electorate, the showcase, the show-stopper in the budget, is the funding there for Roe 8 and Roe 9. There is funding for infrastructure in this budget. There is actually $2.8 billion in new infrastructure funding for WA. As part of this budget, the government is working to reduce congestion to keep our roads safe and to help freight and people move from point A to point B. But what's important for my electorate is the $1.2 billion that is there in black and white, waiting on the state government to access those funds. Isn't it amazing? You have a situation where the federal government has allocated $1.2 billion worth of funding to a very important road project, yet the state government is refusing to access those funds. That would take 70,000-odd cars a day off Leach Highway in my electorate and over 7,000 trucks a day trying to access Fremantle port. This is also very important to the people of Fremantle, who are facing a by-election. They go into the by-election uncertain of whether or not federal Labor will keep that money there available for a future state government to construct the Roe 8 and Roe 9 projects.


This budget, in whole, continues this government's plan for a stronger economy. The government is funding priority nation-building infrastructure and guaranteeing essential services in a sustainable way. The funding's there to support our local community. I'm pleased to be part of a coalition government that's not only making important investments in our country but also managing taxpayers' money in a very disciplined way.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-05-29,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (13:00):  Colleagues, I rise today to speak about the 2018-19 budget, and in doing so will report on the findings of the Indi budget survey and the budget breakfasts, the impact of the budget on my community, and a call to action to do better in engaging and listening to regional community. I'd also like to welcome into the parliament colleagues and constituents from my electorate. Thank you very much for coming and giving us your time.


Over the past three weeks, 998 people answered my call to tell me what they thought of the budget—'What does it mean to you?'—through online surveys, postcards, listening posts, social media, Facebook, Twitter, emails, letters, supermarket conversations and focus groups. In Mansfield, Wangaratta, Wodonga and Benalla, 134 young people met with me, before they headed to school, university, TAFE and work, to give me their opinions. Thank you, Susila, Kirstin, Amanda, Laura, Jenny, Sal, Lana and Sheridan, for bringing together young people from your communities and your schools. And a special call-out to the schools: FCJ College Benalla, Benalla P-12 College, Mansfield Steiner School, Mansfield Secondary College, Galen Catholic College, Beechworth Secondary College, Mount Beauty Secondary College, Cathedral College Wangaratta, Wangaratta High School, Wodonga TAFE, Catholic College Wodonga, Wodonga Senior Secondary College, Wodonga Middle Years College, Victory Lutheran College and Tallangatta Secondary College.


Across my electorate, every local government was represented and responses were received from over 60 townships. Almost half of the respondents, 49.9 per cent, indicated they were female, 48.7 per cent were male, and 1.34 per cent chose not to identify. Most encouragingly, 19 per cent of the surveys were completed by those aged under 25. To these young people, I say thank you. Thank you for turning up, for having a voice and for making a very clear statement that young people are engaged in politics—they do care, they have a voice and they know that they're part of the solution.


So, to the findings of this mammoth exercise. There were five main concerns. In priority order, they were taxation, education and training, health and aged care, renewable energy and climate change, and social security services. On taxation: overwhelmingly, people were concerned that the tax measures were unfair and would lead to increased inequality. Tax reform, corporate tax or concerns with tax breaks for banks were listed by 23.6 per cent of people as their most important issue, and another 3.3 per cent listed increasing inequality stemming from tax changes as their biggest concern. Research shows that these concerns reflect the income and company turnover rates in Indi. 71.3 per cent of residents in my electorate earn below $52,000, and only six companies—two per cent—have a turnover of more than $50 million. What did my constituents tell me about taxes? One constituent wrote:


There should be no tax concessions for big business. This money can be better spent on education and hospitals/medicine and infrastructure. Low to middle income earners need relief not people earning over 100K. Small business needs the relief; it is hard enough to employ people as it is, so help is needed here - you cannot guarantee that big business such as the banks won't just pass it onto shareholders and they will be the only ones to benefit.


Another constituent, from Mount Beauty, said:


Flattening out our progressive tax rate so that minimum wage earners pay the same rate of tax as high-income earners up to $200,000 is patently unfair. This proposed change will lock in further inequality in the system for decades to come and this is at a time when income inequality is more pronounced than at any other time in living memory.


The second priority is education and training. A lack of funding in the budget for education and training closely followed taxation as a key concern. Young people in particular spoke of a lack of access for people wanting to pursue further training or tertiary education in regional Australia. And for those who want to travel for university or TAFE, there are financial barriers. Nearly one-quarter—23.7 per cent of respondents—listed education and training as the second-most-important issue. Eighty-one per cent of respondents ranked education and training as very important, and this was more than any other issue.


These survey results, as you would know from rural and regional Australia, Deputy Speaker Gee, are no surprise. Regional students remain under-represented in higher education institutions. Only 12.7 per cent are from inner regional areas and 12.5 per cent are from outer regional areas. The impact of this is that only six per cent of Indi residents have a tertiary degree, almost three times lower than the state average of 17.8 per cent, so we're starting way behind the eight ball. To quote from the survey:


Country students are at a distinct disadvantage compared to city students who can stay living at home. Not all courses are available in the country. Much higher living costs, stresses, need to work longer hours and therefore, less time to study. Some 'flow on' effects from this can be seen in less Medical specialists in the country areas.


I have another quote from Wodonga:


The quality of education I receive is important as it shapes my future and opportunities and as such, the government should ensure that every student should receive a world-class standard of education to maximise opportunities and help give students a future they are proud of.


One-fifth, or 20.24 per cent, of respondents listed health and aged care as their highest concern or second-most-important issue. Concerns centred on a lack of access and funding, specifically for aged and mental health care. A constituent from Wodonga says on mental health:


Such a common thing that occurs all the time, all around the world, to almost everyone and there needs to be awareness to the unavoidable issues in today's society that everyone faces at some point in his or her lives.


Sadly, the high rate of suicide in rural and regional Australia supports these words. As the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health reported in April 2017:


In every state in Australia, the rate of suicide among those who live outside the greater capital cities is higher than that for residents that live within them, and the rate has risen much higher in rural areas over the period 2011-2015.


Caring for older people in our community with dignity and compassion is a significant issue for the 39 aged-care facilities in Indi. We know this, and again I quote:


Due to the cutbacks the government have implemented, many, particularly smaller facilities are operating at a loss or have very little financial buffer.


A constituent from Wodonga, who replied to the online survey, said:


We need to allow for equitable living for people with disabilities. This means affordable medication, access to services and well-funded mental health services. My clients need a paediatric appointment and assessment to access support funding and NDIS. But they can't afford a paediatrician appointment and are stuck.


While the pension and increase in the Newstart allowance and access to youth allowance for students moving to the city were core concerns, the overarching concern that the budget will lead to increased inequality and higher reliance on social security services is driven, in part, by personal circumstance. Low levels of personal and household income, as well as high rates of underemployment, all contribute to inequality.


In Indi, 92 per cent of residents earn below $91,000, and the average household income is $1,126. That's approximately 22 per cent lower than the national average. The rate of part-time workers is 33.6 per cent, which is higher than the national average of 32.4 per cent. So this speaks to a level of poverty. Dare I say, in my community, lack of money is certainly an inhibiter to advancement, but we are wealthy in so many other ways. The point I'm trying to make about these statistics is that my community actually understands how important taxation is—how important it is to actually understand that in rural and regional Australia, one size does not fit all. I'm not actually saying that poverty or low incomes lead to greater lack of community; it just expresses the inequality that my community recognises.


A constituent from Chiltern raised the decision not to increase the Newstart allowance as her single most important issue. She says:


It is impossible for those on it to live a satisfactory life—creates a class of people in perpetual poverty—makes one sad to be an Australian—that we treat people this way.


Another constituent, from Beechworth, said:


I am expected to live on approximately $700 a fortnight and actively job search. I work as a casual cleaner, but the government lets me have the first $100 then takes 50c in the $ off me! Some people can't even find menial work, I was lucky, so I have no idea how they manage to pay their rent. This is why homelessness is such an issue.


I understand these issues are not specific to only my community or only rural and regional Australia. But, for me, the impact of the government's health, taxation and education policies very often have a disproportional impact on regional Australia.


If I could reflect on the words of the Treasurer on budget night, he told us that the budget was about: 'A stronger economy. More jobs. Guaranteeing essential services. The Government living within its means.' He also told us Australians wanted to answer these three questions: '""What have you'—being the government—'achieved? What are you going to do now? What does it mean for me?""' Let me say that again: 'What does it mean for me?' It struck me that these questions are part of the problem. The answer to having a common wealth and strong, resilient communities in Australia doesn't only lie with government; it also lies with the community. Strong and resilient communities don't exist because of government programs only, but also because of community leadership, collaboration and a real and genuine commitment to make things better.


Every year that I've been in parliament, I've returned to my community post-budget for feedback, for advice and for solutions. This is how I investigate, how I measure and how I report back to parliament. But this process of engagement, community ownership and responsibility doesn't end with my actions. The next step I do is public the Indi budget report that will report back to my community, to the Prime Minister and to the leaders in this place on what I've heard. I also encourage communities to stand up and fight for their solutions. We call this type of engagement and responsibility the Indi way.


Clearly, it's not the only way. There are mechanisms and frameworks in place to help the government better understand the impact of decisions on rural and regional Australia and to work across portfolios to develop solutions that meet the needs of our communities. One such mechanism is the Regional Ministerial Taskforce. It was established by the government in 2017. We were told that a cross-portfolio task force was the best way to implement good regional policy. It was made up of cabinet ministers, and it would focus on closing the gap between the bush and the city in terms of health, education and infrastructure. But 14 months after it was established, we've yet to see a single report. I suspect its omission from Ministers McCormack and McVeigh's 2018 ministerial budget statement is a sign that we never will. How disappointing. There is nothing in this report, Regional Australia—a stronger economy delivering stronger regions, that tells us that the government has a plan or strategy for regional Australia. There is nothing in this that tells me that the government actually understands the statistics that I have brought to this parliament today.


Another technique that's available to the government is regional impact statements. They first appeared in 1988 as part of the cabinet process, and were designed to mitigate against negative impact to rural Australians. My concern is that this process of regional impact statement linked to cabinet papers is now falling short of the desired outcome. Consequently, I've called on the Australian National Audit Office to investigate.


In closing, Deputy Speaker, colleagues and members of my community, I say to those in my community: there is an absence of government solutions, an absence of recognition that one size does not fit all. But I say to my community: keep going, keep turning up, have your say, use your voice, form a group, create your own solutions and use your members of parliament to represent your concerns in parliament. And I say in closing to the government that the unit of measurement should not be: will someone be worse off? The unit of measurement should be: where is the benefit; where is the opportunity; and how can we support our communities to reach their potential?

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:15):  Melbourne's population is growing by more than 2,400 people a week. Over the past year, more than 125,000 new people have called Melbourne home. That's more than saw the Western Bulldogs win the flag at the MCG in 2016. This made Melbourne the fastest-growing city in Australia, at 2.7 per cent, ahead of both Brisbane and Sydney, on two per cent each. And the fastest-growing area in the fastest-growing city in the country is the place that I represent, Melbourne's west. Three hundred and fifty-six thousand more people lived in Melbourne's west in 2016 than did in 1996. That's more than 17,000 new people each year, nearly 1,500 a month, every year, for 20 years. This growth is set to continue.


Our city is currently experiencing growing pains as a result, and it will only get worse without appropriate infrastructure investments in response. If you're an average driver in Melbourne's west, you have a 30 per cent chance of getting stuck in heavy traffic today. Infrastructure Australia estimates that traffic jams rob Melbourne of $3 billion each year. Without proper infrastructure investments, by 2031, Melbourne is set to be $9 billion a year poorer, every year.


To cope with this growth, we need to do things differently, to get smarter about the way that we do infrastructure investment. I've spoken a lot in this place about the need for better public transport infrastructure to cope with this demand in urban areas, but we also need to make investments in active transport infrastructure to reduce pressure on our roads and public transport networks during peak periods.


Good active transport infrastructure is about making it easier for anyone to choose to safely cycle or walk to work, school, TAFE, uni or whatever. It won't be the right option for every person for every trip, but more than one in two vehicle trips in Melbourne today are less than six kilometres in distance. With the right infrastructure, a trip like this would take just over 20 minutes on a bike. Many of these trips could be made on bikes, and every trip that is made on a bike frees up capacity on our roads and our public transport networks. That's why this is a serious, mainstream infrastructure issue that affects everyone in Melbourne and in Melbourne's west in particular.


It's not only about congestion either. Numerous studies show that cycling and increasing walkability decrease the risk of heart disease, cancer and general causes of death in our community, meaning that people live healthier and longer lives. Active transport also reduces pollution and increases an area's livability.


Despite these benefits, Melbourne's west has a relatively low active transport utilisation rate. This is because we don't have the same infrastructure as the rest of Melbourne. Our cyclists and our pedestrians are forced to compete with thousands of truck movements a day on our residential streets. In Brunswick, nearly one in five people cycle to work. In Footscray, it's just one in 20. Why do people cycle at nearly four times the rate in Brunswick, despite our suburbs being the same distance from the city? Why do people cycle at nearly three times the rate in Thornbury as in Newport, two suburbs of similar distance from the CBD? The answer is in infrastructure. People don't feel safe cycling without the right bike paths and barriers. Melbourne's west is still mourning the death of Arzu Baglar, who was tragically struck and killed by a truck whilst cycling to a friend's house in my electorate.


We need investment that increases bike safety and encourages more people to cycle. Just last month, Infrastructure Victoria's report showed that, in Sunshine alone in my electorate, there were around 20,000 daily trips that could happen through cycling or walking. We need federal government leadership to turn these potential active transport journeys into actual active transport journeys. However, this Abbott-Turnbull government doesn't believe in public transport and doesn't believe in active transport. We know this from its budget priorities. In this budget there is not a single dollar for active transport infrastructure—zip, nada, zero. A Shorten Labor government will make investment in cycling a mainstream infrastructure priority and find room in the budget for this infrastructure for Melbourne's west.


I thank everyone in my community who has contacted me about the latest scandalous cruelty against sheep on live export ships, revealed on 60 Minutes. The shocking footage broadcast on 60 Minutes is just the latest in a long line of similar incidents. Labor has been looking seriously at this problem for some time now. As the Leader of the Opposition said two weeks ago, the industry has had plenty of chances to clean up its act, and it's failed. The government has had plenty of chances to properly regulate, and it's failed—indeed, it's actively made things worse. This cruelty is the legacy of the member for New England's period as agriculture minister and the Prime Minister's failure to hold his Deputy Prime Minister accountable for his own portfolio. The Abbott-Turnbull government abolished Labor's Inspector General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. It abolished the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee. It defunded the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy. And it abolished the Office of Animal Welfare in the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. The Abbott-Turnbull government slashed and burned regulatory oversight in this industry, which allowed the scandalous cruelties that we have seen to occur. That's why Labor announced that we will work with all those involved in the industry to plan for a future that doesn't rely on live sheep exports. The Turnbull government should be doing this right now.


Labor has been clear from the start that we don't think the inquiry that was initiated by the Minister for Agriculture into the live sheep trade during the northern summer would ever find that the trade would be sustainable in the long-term. The industry itself has conceded that it's not possible to guarantee that there will be no future events like those we saw on 60 Minutes. This is why Labor is committed to working with industry to plan for a future that doesn't rely on live sheep exports. The government should be doing the same. A transition plan would take a number of years but should take nothing like a decade. Labor will work with farmers, unions and business to develop a sustainable red-meat industry plan to assist sheep farmers during this transition. Labor's plan will lift farmer profits and add more value here in Australia to create more jobs in Australia—in fact, to create more jobs right along the supply chain. I thank everyone in my community who has contacted me on this issue for their advocacy and for the role that they have played in driving change for the better in our democracy.


One area of the government's budget that hasn't got much media coverage but deserves more is the budget's savage cuts to Australia's foreign aid budget. This budget cut another $140 million in aid from the Australian aid budget. The Abbott-Turnbull government has now slashed well over $11 billion from the Australian aid budget. The Lowy Institute calculates that since the member for Warringah became Prime Minister Australia's aid budget has been cut by a third. By some estimates, Australia is down to giving just 19 cents in every $100 of its national income in foreign aid. Australians think of ourselves as good global citizens with a good reputation overseas, but with these aid cuts we damage our credibility and our national reputation.


But it's the world's poor who are really hurt by these cuts. After the second round of aid cuts in 2015, Foreign Minister Bishop promised that there would be no more cuts to aid. We now know that she misled the poorest people in the world. In the budget papers, the Treasurer and the foreign minister heaped further fictions onto this deception. Page 103 of Budget Paper No. 2, under the title 'Maintaining the level of official development assistance', shows cuts of more than $140 million. Apparently, cutting Australian aid by $10 million, by $10 million, by $10 million and by $110 million in each of the next few years is maintaining the level of foreign aid. The real loser here, however, is not the government's credibility but, instead, some of the poorest people in the world. Foreign aid is one of the few areas where the decisions made in this place directly save people's lives. I've visited a women's refuge in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea and seen for myself the transformative impact of Australian aid. Seven in 10 women in Papua New Guinea suffer violence at the hands of men. Australian aid is making a difference to these people's lives. We support women's refuges, we support gender education and we support programs to change women's prospects in that society. These are the people who will suffer from these budget cuts. In his first speech to parliament, the Treasurer said that foreign aid was 'the Australian thing to do'. We don't get more un-Australian than these cuts. A Shorten Labor government will rebuild and grow the Australian aid program.


I want to talk in this debate a little bit about the shameful way that politics in Australia has been criminalised under the Abbott-Turnbull government and the way that institutions of our democracy are used to pursue criminal ends against participants in our political system. This trend started with the political stunt of the trade union royal commission. For 189 days, that royal commission wasted more than $40 million of taxpayers' money pursuing the government's political opponents, including the Leader of the Opposition. We know that it was a stunt because of the way that the long list of referrals from the commission have either collapsed or amounted to nothing. Apart from $46 million wasted, political opponents put in the dock and innocent families terrorised, what have we got from this exercise? There's been only one conviction resulting in a suspended sentence.


Recently, charges brought against Mr Setka and Mr Reardon from the CFMEU were sensationally dropped by the Director of Public Prosecutions. What made this even more spectacular was that they were dropped before the DPP had even finished calling evidence at a committal hearing. The result, after three years of legal battles, showed the anti-union royal commission was simply a figleaf for a political witch-hunt. The saga featured royal commissioners and Boral executives cosying up in court, and workplace bargaining being treated as a criminal matter. We saw a staged arrest of senior union officials in front of their distressed families and children. We've heard former Prime Minister Abbott and the former employment minister, Senator Abetz, were involved in the orchestration of these charges, conspiring with Boral accusers to smear political enemies. The co-opting of the Australian Federal Police by the Turnbull government's Registered Organisations Commission, stinks of hijacking the criminal justice system to attack political opponents. We all know the wrong person resigned in Minister Cash's office over the disgraceful leaks on the AFP's raid. The Abbott-Turnbull government cannot hide its attempts to criminalise politics behind a big whiteboard forever. Our democracy suffers when the institutions that the public relies on, institutions that are crucial for public faith in our democracy are weaponised and trashed in the name of short-term political tactics.


The contrast in this regard could not be sharper with the way that the Abbott-Turnbull government has dealt with the scandals in the Australian banking sector. For 600 days, Prime Minister Turnbull refused calls from across Australian society, including from the opposition, to establish a royal commission into activities in the Australian financial services sector, 600 days in which evidence heard by the royal commission showed that people were being fed dodgy financial advice, 600 days in which dead people were being charged fees for services that they never received, and 600 days in which one person, at least, lost a quarter of their super, and small businesses were crushed. At every point, Prime Minister Turnbull and the Treasurer ran a protection racket for the big banks on this issue. Today, they refuse to even say sorry to the thousands of Australians ripped off during the time that they rubbished the royal commission, calling it a 'populist whinge', a 'talk-fest', a 'thought bubble' and, when they were finally forced to admit the inevitable and establish a royal commission, 'regrettable'. Even today, the only recognition they can give to their delays in initiating the royal commission is to call it a 'political mistake'. They won't take accountability for the Australian consumers that suffered from this delay; all they would admit to is the political price that they themselves have paid.


After the evidence that we have heard before the banking royal commission, what is the government's response? It wants to reward the big banks of Australia for their behaviour with a $17 billion tax cut. This government is so out of touch; it's from another planet. Let's also compare the pair when it comes to the Abbott-Turnbull government's treatment of political opponents and the big end of town. After the trade union royal commission, union officials were arrested on criminal charges in front of their families—criminal charges, we have found, that were not sustainable in a court of law. Instead of being arrested, for those in a range of other sectors in the big end of town, accountability has not been delivered. We see this in the endemic wage theft in Australian workplaces. In workplaces across the country, temporary migrant workers are being exploited in the most reprehensible terms. We see frequent evidence of employers doctoring pay slips, of forging documents to disguise the theft of wages from everyday Australians. Yet, in these instances, we don't see police raids; we don't see executives arrested in front of their family. Indeed, when Fair Work took action against Caltex for the systemic wage theft occurring in their franchises, the time for the raids against Caltex was negotiated in advance with the Fair Work Commission.


This is a government that's hard on workers' advocates and soft on companies that steal the wages of Australians. Instead of fixating on its political opponents, the government has been asleep at the wheel on wage theft. The compensation bill for wage theft at the 7-Eleven franchising network has ticked over $110 million. Already wage theft claims have hit some of the biggest companies—Pizza Hut, Woolworths, Myer, Dominos, Coles, Caltex, Spotless and other cafe and farming businesses. This is a government that will trample the criminal justice system to get to its political enemies while turning a blind eye to people who are stealing from Australian workers.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (16:01):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-19 and outline Labor's concerns in relation to the central plank of the government's plan to provide $80 billion by way of tax cuts to large corporations in the main. If you look at the breakdown of the $80 billion, well in excess of $75 billion will go to the very large corporations, many of which are multinational companies, and the big banks. Having calculated the proportion of money that would be provided by way of tax cuts, we know that that would ensure the big banks would receive $17 billion in tax cuts. It just so happens that that $17 billion shortfall, which we'd like to see go to schools, instead will be provided to those four banks.


For that reason, we absolutely reject the priorities and the values of the Prime Minister and this government in terms of their focus on favouring those corporations in lieu of providing decent health and decent education in this nation—cuts to hospitals, cuts to schools and largesse to mates of the Prime Minister. He's always felt most comfortable in the boardrooms of Australia, not the workplaces. Being a former merchant banker, the Prime Minister would be on intimate terms with many of the chief executives of these banks and businesses. Clearly he needs to deliver to them, as he would see it. He argues that this is in keeping with trickle down economic theory—that is, provide the biggest tax cuts to big business by cutting funding to social services and it will trickle down, like some form of osmosis, to middle- and working-class families.


This economic theory has been discredited by every eminent economist across the world. It was rejected when it was introduced by the Reagan administration. It led to massive government debt because they did not fund the tax cuts. It impoverished services in health and education. We've seen that country, a great nation, now clearly not looking after its middle class. The middle class has been hollowed out. Real wages have fallen in very significant terms in the United States of America. And the rot started with the introduction of trickle down economic theory—propounded then by someone who was held to know something about economics, Milton Friedman. Well, his theory now has been discredited.


Indeed, it is that theory that the current President of the United States and the now Prime Minister of Australia want to do, which is to provide unfunded corporate tax cuts to big business, to multinational companies. Imagine this: we already know, given the amount of money that will be provided to multinational companies, that it immediately leaves our shores. That much is clear. Why should it be the case that the banks in this country receives such largesse given their conduct over the last number of years?


The royal commission has just started its examination of that industry, and the revelations, quite frankly, are astonishing. The victims of decisions by banks number into the thousands, if not tens and hundreds of thousands of people. Whether it be just a complete disregard for services, whether it's undermining insurance and not treating customers of insurance properly or whether it's robbing them by increasing fees without notice, there's a litany of sins by the banks, and yet this government, led by this former merchant banker, the Prime Minister, has sought to remove or transfer what should be going to hospitals and schools, to banks. That is quite shameful, and that's why we cannot abide that view. 


At the same time all of this is happening, we're having a debate around providing largesse to the banks. We have, on 1 July this year, the second tranche of penalty-rate cuts taking effect. We saw the cuts to 700,000 workers' wages on 1 July last year. Retail and hospitality workers—some of the hardest-working, lowest-paid workers in this nation, who suffered real losses as a result—will now see on1 July this year, in just over a month, a further cut to their wages. As a result, the acute pressure on them to deal with cost-of-living pressures will be getting greater and greater and yet, of course, the Prime Minister turns his back on those workers. He has no empathy for those workers, no empathy for any working people in this country.


You see, the Prime Minister really hasn't ever financially struggled. You'd think the leader of this nation would have regard for its people. You'd think the leader of this nation—whatever his background—would actually take a keen interest in the needs and aspirations of working people. But not this Prime Minister. This Prime Minister's values are written in the budget papers. This Prime Minister's values are: look after the big end of town and turn your back on hardworking Australians. This Prime Minister has no empathy or concern or regard for the hardworking Australians that are in workplaces throughout this land and that's why he supports cuts to penalty rates, supports $80 billion worth of cuts to big business and, at the same time, cuts to health and education at a time when wage growth is at its lowest in more than 20 years. We're supposed to cop this. 


Labor will not stand for this approach. Labor do not support and will never support such a remarkable largesse to big business. We look after middle-class and working-class families in this country. The backbone of our economy is working people—yes, working in businesses—and businesses too. But it doesn't mean you turn your back on working people, which has occurred here, and it's written in the budget for all to see.


As I was saying, on 1 July this year, there will be cuts to those 700,000 workers' wages at a time of low wage growth. There are now more applications being put forward to the Fair Work Commission. So along with retail and hospitality workers, hairdressers and beauticians' awards are being put forward for consideration for further cuts. All of us have visited hairdressers and barbers. They're not highly paid. In fact, for the amount of training they have to do, they're quite low-paid workers. And yet they're going to get—if the application is successful—a cut in their wages because there'll be a reduced penalty. We say: where are the priorities of this government when it can provide so much to those who need so little and, at the same time, cut real wages from people that are struggling to pay the energy bill or health costs or pay for school uniforms or school fees just to make ends meet, to put food on the table, to look after their family, to pay the mortgage, to pay the rent, to put petrol in the car?


Those basic essentials are under pressure, and the government's answer is to make it harder, not make it easier. I say people can outgrow their background and a true leader is empathetic to the needs of others and doesn't have to have a lived experience, but it would appear clear to me now that the Prime Minister has no empathy. He does not understand the challenges of millions of Australian workers that are dealing with these day-to-day pressures. If he was comfortable in the boardrooms, he feels awkward in the depots, offices and other workplaces where 12 million Australians work. And for that reason he should be censured and so too should be the government for its priorities.


Labor's plan is, of course, to be fiscally responsible, not provide an unfunded tax cut to the big end of town and actually provide greater tax relief for the majority of workers. It's true to say that, when wage growth is this flat and the government has no answers, at least providing a decent tax cut is some form of relief. But we'll need to do more if we're elected, and we will do more in government about rebalancing arrangements in the workplace. There are too many people marginalised in workplaces, not willing to speak up, whether it be on getting a pay rise or, even more importantly, health and safety issues in often dangerous workplaces. It worries Labor when people are injured or die at work, particularly if they've understood the risk and haven't felt comfortable enough or supported enough to raise concerns with their employer or others.


And so we say to the government: this budget is a budget that is, at its core, unfair and looks after the top one per cent. The Prime Minister would understand that because he is the top one per cent. The Prime Minister is at the top 0.1 per cent! Clearly, when he thinks about trickle-down economics and it working, he may well be right, because there are some winners with trickle-down economics. It's the top 1 per cent. They'll benefit. We know that without question. They'll benefit because we're going to raid the Treasury, we're going to raid taxpayers' piggy bank and we're going to give it over to big banks and multinational companies and then not have a whit of understanding as to how we're going to properly fund a first-class education system, fix up the complete debacle that is the NBN, and look after the health needs of Australians, look after people in aged care—the real pressing needs that exist, that families are struggling with: looking after older parents, looking after kids in child care, trying to find places and all of the difficulties that each family confronts.


And yet everywhere you look, it doesn't matter where, there just doesn't seem to be a role for this government just to lend a helping hand. Nobody wants a hand out; they want a helping hand. They expect their government to provide that form of support. We call ourselves the country of the fair go. We like to think of ourselves as having an egalitarian spirit. Well, it has to be manifest in the policies of the nation. It has to be clear within the budget that we care about working-class and middle-class people, not just those people who are associates of the Prime Minister, who work with the Prime Minister or socialise with the Prime Minister. It's clear to me that, if anything, this budget is honest to that extent, because it reflects the values and priorities of a Prime Minister who is, effectively, an elitist and, indeed, socially unable to empathise with the concerns of the overwhelming number of Australians who are struggling.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  I think the member for Gorton is reflecting on the Prime Minister, and I think it's out of order, really.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  I don't think it is out of order, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, but I respect your ruling. I will say this, though: the budget will not pass in its form. If the government wants to do anything about providing tax relief, they should stop insisting on this most fanciful of notions that they're going to have some tax relief for the top end of wage earners in seven years. If they want to actually deal with tax relief for the bulk of Australian workers today, they need to negotiate with Labor and the crossbench and, in fact, they should listen to Labor and increase the tax relief for the bulk of Australian workers, which is what we're suggesting—that's what should happen here—instead of pretending that they've got some sort of plan that's so far off into the distance it's just some mythical nonsense that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are inventing to try to save their scalps.


The fact is that they should listen to us when it comes to tax relief. They should listen to Labor when it comes to properly funding health in this country, looking after kids in this country so they have a first-class education and, indeed, looking after working people. They could start by actually introducing the bill in the House that would stop the penalty rates decision dead in its tracks so we would not see further cuts in real wages to retail and hospitality workers.

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley) (16:16):  In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, I wish to make a few remarks about the budget and, in particular, I want to talk about tax. At the heart of this budget is what I'd call the Turnbull trickle-down trifecta—that is, massive tax cuts for the wealthy, very large tax cuts for large corporates and, of course, wage suppression for everybody else. At a time when global growth is closing in on four per cent—at least according to the latest OECD figures—in Australia, GDP growth is struggling to reach 2½ per cent. We've got the best global conditions in more than a decade, and this government is out there celebrating its enduring mediocrity. Over the last five years of Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull, real wages have flatlined.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order, member for Lilley. That's twice now you've said 'the Turnbull trickle-down trifecta' and—




Mr SWAN:
  I said 'Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull'.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You've been here since '93.




Mr SWAN:
  I said 'Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull'; is that correct?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You've got to refer to members by their correct title. Those are not their correct titles.



An honourable member interjecting—  




Mr SWAN:
  You can waste a bit more time if you like. Over the last five years, our two prime ministers have seen real wages flatlining. The cost of living has risen steeply, driven chiefly by health insurance, housing and energy prices, and Australians are suffering from precarious and insecure forms of work. We've got record high labour underutilisation and record levels of wage theft in our workforce. All of these things should be within the government's power to change, but not this government.


The Prime Minister gives the least to those who need it the most and the most to those who need it the least. The budget holds low- and middle-income Australians hostage to tax cuts for the top end of town while delivering $80 billion to big business, including a $17 billion gift to big banks, whose rank malpractice has been on disgusting display at the royal commission. Having been involved in a few budgets myself, I can attest that preparing budget documents means that you need to keep both eyes open: one eye on the global conditions and one on the great majority of Australians that you represent. But, looking over this year's budget, it's plain to see that the Prime Minister has kept one eye on the top end of town—high-income individuals and big companies—and the other eye entirely closed, meanwhile winking at the wealthy, who are the Liberal Party's natural constituency.


The personal income tax cuts in this budget are set to drive a steamroller right through Australia's progressive tax system. If the Turnbull government gets its way and if it's re-elected twice more, the tax cuts proposed in this budget will see someone on $41,000 a year and someone on $200,000 a year paying exactly the same marginal tax rate. Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister, and Mr Morrison, the Treasurer, have a plan to impose regressive income tax cuts. Of course, it follows the same script that we've seen with the company tax cuts farce: throw a few crumbs to the many whilst hosting a feast for the few. This government is pitching personal income tax cuts in three stages but is refusing to split the bill. It's true that Labor supports the first stage of the personal income tax cuts because it delivers tax relief for true low- and middle-income earners. Australians on low and modest incomes are struggling. Labor will always deliver whatever tax relief it can to working Australians. The only group that doesn't seem to think that low- and middle-income earners need a hand are the Australian Greens.


Relative to the rest of the Turnbull government tax heist, Labor's bigger, better and fairer tax cut would deliver faster and deeper relief to 10 million Australians because our plan doesn't hold low- and middle-income earners hostage to the top end of town. We take a much harsher view of the second and third stages of the Turnbull government's income tax cuts, which are undiluted, vintage Turnbull trickle-down economics, as I said before. The Australian National University has concluded that these measures are targeted at lower and middle-income individuals, but, by the middle of the next decade, the measures are weighted towards higher income individuals. The government are still refusing to provide year-on-year costs of their tax plan. We know that the first two stages cost $102 billion and the third stage costs $40 billion, but all of the talk and analysis about their 10-year package only serves to obscure the fact that it's the second and third stages where the big year-on-year costs come into play.


In the later stages, the income tax steamroller really clicks into gear. The 37 per cent tax bracket—currently a pillar of our progressive tax system—applying to those on $80,000 through to $180,000 is bulldozed while the 32.5 per cent threshold is lifted to $200,000, helping an earner on this salary pay the same marginal rate of tax on $200,000 while earning five times what a low-income earner would receive. According to analysis by the Australia Institute, the top 20 per cent of income earners will get 80 per cent of the benefit of this income tax demolition job and the top 10 per cent will get half of the benefit. Meanwhile, 60 per cent of taxpayers—Australians on low and modest incomes—will see no change to their situation whatsoever, apart from reading ever more blatant misreporting from the government and its Murdoch allies that people on up to $200,000 are somehow middle-income earners. This is deeply, deeply misleading.


The average full-time worker in Australia is on $84,600. An ever-increasing number of Australians aren't even getting this much, nor are they in full-time work. A report from the Centre for Future Work released today reveals that, for the first time in recorded history, fewer than half of Australian workers are in permanent, full-time paid jobs with leave entitlements. While the Turnbull government might want to pretend that the average Australian household consists of a couple earning $120,000 per year per person, the stark reality for most Australian households is that most are struggling to accumulate $120,000 between them. On top of this, we've got gross misrepresentation of wage growth. The budget forecasts wage growth of 3½ per cent a year returning immediately and continuing for 10 years. It's bizarre! It goes without saying that the government has no plan to increase workers' wages or to improve conditions to vindicate such an optimistic forecast. Future wage rises are just supposed to appear out of nowhere while the government is out there actively working to suppress wages and conditions for workers across the country. The government is saying that wages are going to grow by 14 per cent over the next four years. Given that record, I can only see it getting up to argue against itself in the Fair Work Commission.


So let's be clear: wage growth is plummeting to record depths under this government. A worker starting a job today in the Prime Minister's Australia will, if they're lucky, be on exactly the same real wage as a worker who started a job on the same day that Mr Abbott became Prime Minister. During Labor's period of government, in which we created close to one million jobs—despite the worst global recession in 80 years—wages grew faster than inflation by a considerable margin. Someone who got a job on the first day of our government would, by the time Labor left office, be enjoying a wage that outstripped inflation by 3½ per cent. For the last five years of the Abbott and Turnbull governments, real wages have been just 0.15 per cent higher than inflation. Wage growth has been 23 times slower under the Abbott-Turnbull governments than under Labor. That is a terrible record.


Of course, that's before you get to what the government are doing with their company tax cuts. What started out as a $50 billion gift to some of the largest multinationals in the world is now costed at an estimated $80 billion. Now, $80 billion is a very big big-business tax cut, one-third of which goes to just 15 companies, $17 billion of which goes to the big banks. That is what I mean when I talk about the trickle-down trifecta: tax cuts for high-income earners; tax cuts for some of the very biggest companies in the world; wage suppression for everybody else. That's the Turnbull trifecta in this budget, at the very core of this budget.


Today in the House, in the context of tax, we had some discussion about tax avoidance and tax evasion. And it is true that, courtesy of legislation put forward by Labor, we now know the extent to which many large companies are avoiding their tax responsibilities. Indeed, a third pay no tax in any one year. We also know that big, respectable companies such as BHP and Rio have been aggressively avoiding and evading their tax responsibilities in our country.


Last week in the House, I said that BHP has hit new lows of corporate behaviour. In the Queensland Supreme Court, it has sought to suppress further evidence of tax evasion on royalties payable to the Queensland government. Last week, it was revealed that BHP received an updated $320 million assessment from the Queensland government for royalties evaded. BHP's evasion of state royalty payments through its transfer-pricing activities has robbed the governments of both Queensland and Western Australia. This matter has now been settled in the Queensland Supreme Court, and there is a confidential legal agreement as to the nature of the settlement.


Fortunately, this confidential agreement can't cover up the essential facts. Firstly, the Queensland government has included a provision in its budget for a successful outcome in this case to the tune of several hundreds of millions of dollars. Secondly, the confidential agreement signed yesterday between BHP and the Queensland government leaves the Queensland budget no worse off. So we can conclude that BHP has now conceded that its transfer-pricing activity is illegal. Today's settlement has significant implications, as BHP has been for some time in dispute with the Australian tax office for more than $1 billion for the use of its Singapore marketing hub to facilitate transfer pricing.


So, along with Rio, BHP is one of Australia's biggest tax dodgers, and there are now significant questions that must be answered by the BHP board. Firstly, who is going to accept responsibility for this unethical behaviour? Secondly, what action does the board intend to take to reassure the public that this behaviour will not be repeated? Thirdly, when is BHP going to come clean and say how much it owes the Western Australian government? Fourthly, when will it settle with the Australian tax office for its outstanding billion-dollar tax bill? Directors of big Australian companies are the first to put up their hands for Australia Day honours, but, if the directors of BHP continue to hide their behaviour behind a veil of legal secrecy, the public will be entitled to conclude that our 'Big Australian' is the dishonest Australian and that they should be the last in line for public recognition.


Ensuring that tax evasion and aggressive tax minimisation are eliminated is absolutely essential to making sure that our budget and our economy are healthy, because, when people evade their tax, what they do is force up tax rates for other people—for small business, for working people—and money is ripped away from hospitals and schools. The opportunity cost of tax evasion is significant in the community. When some of Australia's most reputable and respected companies aggressively engage in the use of transfer pricing through, effectively, tax havens, they are dudding the country that has nourished them and nurtured them through their growth. This should not be tolerated any longer. It is time that corporate Australia put their hands up. When they have been responsible for such actions of profit-shifting and debt-dumping and successfully litigated and dealt with through the tax office and the courts, they should have the decency to say to the Australian people that this will not happen again. They should have the decency to put up their hand and say they got it wrong, and they should move on so that we can all work together to make our country bigger and better.

"Gosling, Luke, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (16:30):  In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, I take this opportunity to speak about something that I am very proud of: our side's plan for skills and training. Regretfully, I need to draw attention to the Turnbull government's shameful neglect of TAFE and the skills sector of our education system. In my electorate of Solomon, and in Darwin and Palmerston, the capital of Northern Australia, the cuts to Charles Darwin University are hurting this sector, I'm sad to say. But there is a light on the hill: the Labor Party and Labor leader Bill Shorten's announcement that a Labor government will scrap up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students.


Of course, this is welcome news for my electorate of Solomon. We've got major projects in the Top End. However, some of those are winding down. As some of our skilled workers leave, we need to train our own people—our young Territorians—to meet a growing skills shortage. That will happen when Labor gets on those Treasury benches and starts developing northern Australia. We're going to need skilled workers. Labor's policy will open up access to TAFE and will make it easier for young Australians and young Territorians to gain valuable skills and education. Waiving up-front TAFE fees for 100,000 students will mean that many students will be able to attend TAFE without incurring any fees.


As part of a comprehensive plan to support TAFEs, vocational education and apprenticeships across our country, we will guarantee two-thirds of government vocational education and training funding goes to TAFE to ensure that quality learning and improved job opportunities are there for Australians. As I said, for my electorate that means that organisations and education facilities like Charles Darwin University will be invested in to train young Territorians. Labor will also invest $100 million in a building TAFE for the future fund to revitalise TAFE campuses and facilities in regional and outer metropolitan areas.


It gives me no satisfaction whatsoever to say that those opposite, the Liberal-National coalition, have cut $3 billion from skills, TAFE and apprenticeships funding since they came to office in 2013, with a further $270 million cut in the last budget. They've defunded and neglected TAFE and our apprenticeships system—a system that has for many, many years provided young Australians the training that they need to have the jobs that make our country run and that have built our country. Again, $3 billion has been cut from TAFE since 2013. In this year's budget, as I said, another $270 million was cut from apprenticeship funding over the next four years. Australia now has 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees than it did when the Abbott and Turnbull governments were elected.


For TAFE and vocational education funding, the number of supported students is lower than it was a decade ago at the very time when we need more young Territorians, more young Australians, trained up for those jobs of the future. Between 2013 and 2016, the government funded hours of training delivered through TAFE collapsed by 30 per cent. In too many towns and regional centres across Australia, TAFE campuses have closed, courses have been scaled back and fees have increased.


My electorate of Solomon has seen a collapse in apprentice and trainee numbers since those opposite came to government. The number of apprentices and trainees in my electorate has declined by 30 per cent—that's three in ten fewer trainees and apprentices. It's now standing at just over 600 trainees and apprentices currently in training in my electorate. Right now, about 400 of those are at CDU and, as I mentioned, CDU has had its funding cut by a further $15 million and it's not helpful; in fact, it's shameful. It's betraying our young people, many of whom are leaving the Territory to seek opportunities elsewhere. In our electorate, the northern capital of Australia, we want them to stay. We need them to stay in Darwin and Palmerston to build our economy, to build the Territory's future and to build their own lives and families. 


I met with some of these young men and women recently. I just want to mention a couple and the great work that's being done by people like Lee Darra at Charles Darwin University. As Lee rightfully says, 'We need to get more young kids off the couch, get the computer game controllers out of their hands, and get them on the tools, get them learning how the computers in modern-day motors work, not only so that they can find new jobs in the growing STEM sector, but also for the more advanced jobs in automotive engineering that there are these days.' And there are plenty of opportunities. I want to acknowledge a couple of those young lads that I met recently. They're doing their certificate III in automotive training with CDU. Lachie Durrington is doing his apprenticeship with Kmart Auto in Palmerston—well done, Kmart Auto, Palmerston. Joel Bernon is doing his apprenticeship with Bridge Toyota in Darwin—well done, Bridge Toyota. I go there because they're investing in these young men, giving them the training that they need and are partnered with Charles Darwin University. Those lads are nearly finished their cert III.


There's also a couple of trainees that are going through the VET in Schools program at Haileybury College. I also want to acknowledge the Nightcliff, Casuarina and Taminmin colleges that are offering the certificate I, or the 'taster' programs, to give them a taste what of it's like to start some certificate training in the hope they will go on and do their cert III and get out into the industry.


Today I co-hosted a lunch with Impex. Impex has had 500 or so trainees and apprentices go through that project site to date. This is one of the most advanced LNG facilities, a $40 billion project in Darwin. And what a great experience for those young Territorians to have those traineeships and apprenticeships out on site. I encourage Impex to continue to provide those opportunities for young Territorians to get a trade in order to get the jobs of the future in that massive industry.


I also want to give a big thumbs up and a shout-out to Engines Engineering, a great Territory company out at East Arm that are doing a fantastic job taking on young Territorians. So well done, Engines Engineering. 


I also want to shout out to YouthWorX NT for their assistance and dedication to finding suitable pathways for young people in Darwin and Palmerston, particularly for young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Great work, YouthWorX NT. Likewise, when it comes to remote work, the not-for-profit Ironbark is doing fantastic outreach work with Charles Darwin University, particularly in civil construction. It is doing certificates in civil construction, which is really practical and is a fantastic qualification for people out in the remote areas of the Northern Territory to get, because they can maintain their own roads, their community roads. That is a fantastic assistance to those communities, because it allows them to get in and out, and that is going to allow more and more industries to start operating in those more remote areas of the Territory, which will lead to jobs for young Territorians. I also hear good things about McArthur River Mine and some of the things they're doing with their apprentices. I look forward to finding out a bit more and to talking to some apprentices at McArthur River Mine when I visit there soon.


The Territory and the Top End have a great future. There are great opportunities, but we need skilled workers. Neglecting training and defunding TAFE is short-sighted, and I very much hope that those opposite review those policies. They're not likely to get another budget, but if they were to, winding back those cuts to TAFE would be a good start. I don't want to belabour the point, but across the country there are 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees, so there has been a significant decline, of 35 per cent.


I've touched on some of the things that Labor intends to do. We have a plan, and the reason we have a plan is that we value this sector. We think the VET sector—the TAFE institutions and institutions like CDU—is an important part of our education system. We'll work with the school systems to ensure that kids, as they go through school, don't think that the whole reason they're at school is just to get into university. We understand that STEM, jobs of the future and a whole number of trades need people who have university qualifications. We understand that. But we also respect and value the VET and TAFE trainers who are skilling up working Australians every day for similar jobs, jobs that we need, jobs that might be in aged care, in automotive or in civil construction—jobs that we're going to need into the future. When you value something you invest in it, and that's what we'll do. We'll guarantee that two out of three public vocational education dollars go to providers like CDU in my electorate and TAFEs around the country. We'll waive the up-front fees for 100,000 students to attend TAFE. We'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. We'll ensure that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices. We'll provide 10,000 pre-apprenticeship programs for young people who want to learn a trade. We'll provide 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who want to or need to retrain. We'll also establish a national commission of review into post-secondary education within the first 100 days of government. That's a plan. We value TAFE, trade training, those who provide the training and our young people and people in transition who need that training.


Labor's plan has a budget impact of $473 million over the forward estimates, and $708 million over the medium term. But we will prioritise those budget measures. We will, because we value it. We value this training. We value it more than giving $17 billion to the banks. I personally believe we've got enough bankers and there will always be enough people to find their way into that area of work. But it doesn't grow a country. It doesn't grow a nation. The young men and women of Australia who don't choose to or want to get a hands-on trade need to be supported. We'll do that in government by doing those things that I mentioned before. We'll have an inquiry into post-secondary education, and we'll make sure that young Territorians and young Australians that want to go and get a trade aren't left behind.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (16:46):  I rise to speak and make a contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-19. In doing so, I want to voice the concern my constituents have about the government's budget and budgets of the past. This budget, in the view of my community, fails the fairness test and it fails the fiscal responsibility test. It effectively fails middle Australia. It also fails the most vulnerable in my community. 


I'll go to one issue that I spoke about in quite a bit of detail last year, and that is that the government is still pursuing measures that will force people to work until 70 years of age. In my electorate, I have people who are engaged in a number of blue-collar jobs—tradies and hospitality staff. I also have nurses and teachers. I have aged-care workers. If you know anything about care aged-care work, you know that the work that they do is very important and very difficult work. These are jobs that are physically and also emotionally very demanding. 


I spoke against these measures last year, and I'll speak against them this year as well. The budget is also maintaining and pursuing measures to axe the energy supplement of $14 a fortnight for single pensioners. I have 16,128 pensioners in my electorate, and that's more than 15,000 elderly and vulnerable Australians that will be impacted adversely as a result of these measures, especially as we approach the coming winter. It's always an issue, in particular, during the winter. This budget still has a freeze on Medicare for specialist visits. In my electorate, those sorts of freezes adversely affect the health and wellbeing of my community. 


My communities have already suffered at the hands of many previous budget measures. They are trying to balance the rising cost of living. Many of them, a large number of them, are employed in insecure work, and a large number of them are unable to afford housing. So they do wonder why the Prime Minister has chosen to prioritise big business and the banks by giving those institutions a $80 billion tax handout, when their own middle Australia—my constituents—need all the assistance that they can get. A Shorten Labor government won't do this. We won't, because we understand what the Australian community needs, and what it needs in order to help advance itself. Labor's approach to the budget offers a fairer and more responsible alternative, fairer to middle Australia and to our most vulnerable, and more responsible when it comes to budget repair. 


We have a plan, a real plan, to see working Australia genuinely get ahead. Our plan will see those who earn up to $125,000 a year paying less tax than they would under the government's proposed tax cuts. That's going to make a huge difference to my constituents who will be among the four million Australians who will get a tax cut of $928 a year—money that they desperately need and money that reflects the Labor Party's priorities. We are prioritising the welfare of middle Australians.


The governments' narrative around the $70 billion tax cut goes along the lines that company tax cuts will by definition enable investment, create more jobs, produce more productivity and lead to wage increases. Well, the people in my electorate don't subscribe to trickle-down economics. They don't subscribe to it because we have a history of big companies abandoning our area—big companies such as Pacific Brands, Yakka and Dunlop. These big employers who took their business offshore in pursuit of greater profit, complaining the Australian labour market was too expensive for them, left thousands of people in my electorate in the lurch, without employment prospects. Also in this mix is the car industry. Ford, a big employer in my electorate, was ditched by this government. So you'll have to forgive my community if they don't believe subscribe to the so-called goodwill of companies to trickle prosperity down to them.


In my electorate, I have a huge number of refugees who have come here in recent years from Syria and Iraq. These people cannot find employment. It is not because they don't want to; it is because they happen to be in a very unusual place. Many of them are highly qualified but their skills are not recognised here. I have spoken about this many times before. They want to make a contribution but they have to suffer the indignity of having Job Network providers who are totally useless in responding to their needs. So their prospects for employment are not enhanced under this government's watch.


Manufacturing and innovation are key to not only Australia's future but also the future of the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where my electorate of Calwell is. Yesterday, Dulux officially opened a paint plant at the Merrifield Business Park in Mickleham, very strongly supported by the Victorian Labor government. In opening this plant in my electorate, Dulux has created 60 local jobs, which for us is a significant number of prospective jobs.


The government, in attempting to amend the research and development tax incentive in an effort to better target it, has turned the offsets into a disincentive. Research and development are fundamental to innovation, advancing manufacturing and creating jobs. Currently companies can claim 8.5 percentage points above the company tax rate for their R&D expenditure up to $100 million. The new amendments will introduce progressive rates for the incentive, affecting companies with an aggregated annual turnover of more than $20 million. These rates will be tied to the amount the company spends on R&D as a proportion of total expenditure. These changes will do the opposite of incentivising companies to invest in Australia. Most established Australian companies spend less than two per cent of their expenditure on R&D. This is because they committed to investing in local jobs, local resources and other local businesses. The rate of their incentive will go from 8.5 per cent to four per cent. Under these changes, Dulux, which has just opened up a plant in my electorate, could lose around $100,000 each year. So, to keep other aspects of their business here, companies will likely decrease their R&D, spend more and more, and either pay someone else to do it or move R&D offshore, therefore depleting Australia of its intellectual capital as well.


Our country was built by strong, established businesses providing stable and decent jobs. Our future depends on workers finding the same security in Australian businesses as our industries advance. Small to medium enterprises in my electorate are leading in innovation and manufacturing, particularly food manufacturing. They are desperately trying to create jobs for our local community and I'm wondering why they're not given enough assistance from this government. Of course, one of their biggest problems, as everyone in this chamber would know, is the high cost of energy. I have some users facing high energy costs in my electorate. They are actually suffering and struggling to stay afloat.


Recently I spoke about car manufacturing, but I also want to speak on behalf of my constituents who own local car repair businesses in my electorate. They are absolutely thrilled that Labor is supporting legislation that will force car manufacturers to share their data with small businesses and loosen the stranglehold they have on the car service and repair market. In February, I visited the family business of Damien and Debbie Theuma of Active Motor Repairs in Craigieburn. They and other business owners detailed the difficulties they were facing with the advent of car dealerships monopolising the repair and warranty market. The lack of data sharing, in particular, has affected their businesses and highlighted the importance of legislating a mandatory code for data sharing. Business owners like Damien and Debbie feel that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry's report into the car retailing industry, which was released in December 2017, should be adopted in its entirety. In short, the report concluded that vehicle manufacturers who sell into the Australian market limit access to service and repair information for independent repairers. The report also found that this created an artificial monopoly and allowed manufacturers to inflate the mark-ups on servicing and repairs. Laws in the USA and the EU prevent this abuse of market power.


The ACCC's report concluded that independent repairers were experiencing issues gaining access to technical information needed to repair and service new cars. Access to technical information held by car manufacturers was becoming increasingly important as repairing and servicing new cars relies on access to electronic information and data produced by car manufacturers. Car manufacturers had previously committed to providing independent repairers with the same access to technical information as the manufacturers' authorised dealers on commercially fair and reasonable terms. However, the ACCC discovered problems with the detail and time lines of the technical information given. The ACCC considered that independent repairers having access to this technical information was important to ensure competition and, ultimately, to benefit consumers. The ACCC proposed a mandatory scheme for car manufacturers to share technical information. The mandatory code recommendation is supported by Labor and all the independent repairer associations; the consumer bodies; the auto associations, including the NRMA and the RACQ; the insurance industry the new car dealers association; and all the major auto repair chains—for example, Kmart Tyre and Auto Service, Repco Authorised Car Service and Bridgestone.


I wrote to the Treasurer on behalf of my constituents, detailing my support for the independent car repairers. In April, the Treasurer wrote back saying that the market study would 'inform the government's further consideration of these important issues'. While the government and the Treasurer are considering what to do, Labor has acted and come out in support of small businesses and their need to access data to ensure their survival. Under a Labor government, car manufacturers would be required to share information about their vehicles with every Australian mechanic. Australia-wide, this means a boost of 23,000 independent mechanics and will allow car owners more choice when it comes to servicing and repairing their vehicles. We will stick up for small business, for Aussie trades, and keeping the costs of living down for families, as Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has said.


Independent mechanics have been going to the wall while the Turnbull government sits on its hands. There is no reason that this reform shouldn't be implemented immediately, in particular in the car repair sector, which traditionally attracts lots of young people, particularly young men, with apprenticeships and pathways for job opportunities into the future. It is an absolute disgrace that this government can sit on its hands while local car repairers face the prospect of being put out of business by car manufacturers who are behaving in a way that my constituents are right about.


Corporate culture does not take into consideration the needs of people and does not put the needs of people ahead of its profit-making culture. That is why my constituents do not subscribe to the trickle-down theory, that is why they oppose the corporate tax cuts, and that is why this government's priority is all wrong. It's all wrong in relation to the people that I represent who need assistance from the government in order to be able to meet the cost of living, find jobs and get on with living their lives and supporting their families, their children and their neighbourhoods.

Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (17:01):  I stand here today in this place to take the fight for my community straight to the Turnbull government. There is not one thing in the budget for Townsville—no funding for Townsville's long-term water security and no funding for our energy infrastructure. This is a slap in the face for the people in my electorate of Herbert, especially given that our electricity bills have been skyrocketing under the Turnbull government.


There's no funding for the Townsville Port Expansion Project. This is essential infrastructure, especially given that, in the very near future, our fuel will be shipped in dual hull ships that cannot access our port. Our fuel will sail straight past Townsville to the south and then be loaded onto trucks and sent back to Townsville along the Bruce Highway. This will result in more maintenance for the Bruce Highway and a higher cost of fuel, which is already expensive in my community.


In fact, there is not one single extra new dollar for infrastructure in this budget for Townsville—not one cent. Townsville has received a nothing budget announcement. This is a budget that has simply been repackaged, keeping the cuts from the previous budgets reworded and presented with a very nice bow on top. The Turnbull government is a government of cuts. The only thing that this budget delivers is cut after cut after cut. There was $9 million cut to Townsville Health and Hospital Service; $40.7 million cut from veterans' allied and dental health services; $36 million cut from James Cook University; $38 million from Central Queensland University; and $14.8 million cut from Townsville schools.


Then, of course, there is the biggest cut of all, which happens to be an $80 billion tax cut to big business and the banks. After the devastation and poor practice that has been revealed in the royal commission into banking, the Turnbull government actually has the gall to give big banks more than $17 billion in tax cuts. That seems typical of LNP priorities. This government would rather give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the same big banks that have behaved badly, as we have witnessed in the royal commission. The same banks tried to evict a blind pensioner from her home; falsely filled out their customers' forms over 350 times, including on life insurance policies, charged people they knew to be deceased for financial advice, sometimes up to 10 years after they passed away; manipulated kids' bank accounts to gain millions in bonuses; advised an elderly widow to put her life savings in to a complicated investment account when she initially came in for a term deposit; and changed nearly 16,000 customer fees for no service for years and then lied to the regulator more than 20 times regarding this, in what can only be described as attempts to cover their tracks. We know there is still more to be uncovered. Yet, given all of this, the Turnbull government still wants to give big banks $17 billion in tax cuts. This is nothing short of rewarding appalling behaviour. Turnbull backs the banks not people. He puts profits before people. He puts top hats before hard hats. More importantly, he puts his job before Townsville jobs.


Townsville knows that these cuts means more job losses. Jobs, workers, families, pensioners and veterans have all suffered under consecutive LNP governments. When Labor left federal government in 2013, Townsville's unemployment rate was lower than both the state and national averages. Now Townsville's unemployment rate is higher than the state average and almost double that of the national average. Townsville's unemployment has almost doubled under the Abbott-Turnbull governments. Under the previous Labor government, manufacturing in Townsville soared. When Labor left federal government in 2013, more than 8,400 people were employed in the manufacturing industry, but under the Abbott-Turnbull governments manufacturing has nosedived, with job losses of more than 3,000. The manufacturing industry made up eight per cent of our local employment. Under the decimation of the coalition governments, manufacturing, jobs and industry have spiralled down to 4.9 per cent. These were good-quality jobs, and now they are gone under the Abbott-Turnbull governments.


There has been the complete and utter decimation of our construction industry. The Townsville Workforce Report January 2018, commissioned by recruitment firm TP Human Capital, showed that Townsville had 442 fewer construction industry business registrations last year compared with 2012. That's a drop of 15.7 per cent. That's more jobs gone from Townsville under the Abbott-Turnbull governments. Then there is the retail industry. The retail industry is often a very good yardstick that one can use to measure how the local economy is thriving. That same Townsville workforce reportindicates that Townsville is not thriving. There was also a loss of 153 retail business registrations in the same period between 2012 and 2017. That's a fall of 17 per cent. That's more jobs gone. And let's not forget the coalition government job cuts to the public sector. One hundred and ten ATO jobs have gone. Fifty defence jobs have gone. Forty aviation jobs at No. 38 Squadron have gone. Nineteen CSIRO jobs have gone. The coalition is a government of job cuts.


Then there's the LNP's track record for our veterans. Townsville is the largest garrison city in Australia, and I am proud to represent a strong and vibrant defence community. I am passionate about supporting our veterans because they have fought for the freedoms that we enjoy in this great country today. But they also deserve the support that they need when they return home. However, sadly, this is not the case under the Abbott-Turnbull governments. First, there were the cuts to the pay of our defence personnel. This was completely inexplicable, especially when the LNP government was sending our service men and women into harm's way whilst at the same time forcing the ADF to take a real pay cut. However, Labor stood by our defence personnel and fought against those wage cuts. Then there is the $40.7 million cut to veterans' allied and dental health services and the freeze to the repatriation medical fees scheme, which is creating a reduction in access to critical medical services for our veterans. They are not even delivering on their own commitments. In 2006, the Turnbull government said that they would establish a DVA mefloquine support team to assist our serving and ex-serving ADF community with mefloquine related claims, and in 2018 our defence community and their families are still waiting. When asked at Senate estimates about the minister's dedicated team, DVA confirmed that there was no dedicated team and that, rather, this was spread across a handful of DVA staff who deal with a range of issues at any one time. This is shameful, disgraceful and frustrating for our veterans.


Another issue of major concern for veterans in my electorate of Herbert is that of transitional employment. Transitional employment issues can impact severely on a veteran's mental health if they are unable to secure employment. Given the significance of this issue, I was very disappointed to find that the Turnbull government has only committed $8.3 million over four years for veterans' employment, which pales in comparison to Labor's $121 million program. If the Turnbull government had matched Labor's commitment, I would have extended my sincere congratulations, but this difference in funding can only indicate a difference in priorities. Labor will put our veterans first. Labor have our priorities right. We are putting people first. We are prioritising health, education, pensioners, workers, families, aged-care facilities, and veterans before an $80 billion tax cut for big business and the banks. 


More importantly, Labor is prioritising Townsville. Labor will fund $100 million towards Townsville's long-term water security. Labor will fund $200 million towards energy infrastructure in the form of hydropower on the Burdekin Falls Dam. Labor will fund $75 million towards Townsville's port expansion project. This investment alone will return more than $580 million to our local economy. Labor will fund the Townsville Health and Hospital Service. Labor will fund our schools with proper, needs based funding. Labor will fund our regional universities, James Cook University and Central Queensland University. Labor will deliver a fairer taxation reform. 


We believe in supporting workers and families, not big businesses and the banks. The median weekly personal income in Herbert is $672. Under Labor, a person receiving $672 in Herbert will be $350 better off, and that is $150 more than the Turnbull government's plan. Families will also be much better off. The median weekly family income in Herbert is $1,640. Under Labor, families in Herbert will be $928 better off. That is more than $398 better than the Turnbull government's plan. 


It is very clear that a federal Labor budget is the only winner for the people in my electorate of Herbert. These are all Labor priorities, because these priorities put people first. Labor has always been committed to a fair go for all citizens, and we will continue to be committed to a fair go for all citizens. That's exactly what a Labor budget will do for Australia, and particularly for the people in my electorate of Herbert.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:12):  I'm very pleased to stand up and speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, and I'm pleased to stand up and point out some of the very significant flaws that we see in this bill. These appropriation bills continue to lock in some of the worst features of previous budgets from this Turnbull-Abbott government. 


These appropriations bills—this budget—still continues to rely on cuts to the pension, to increasing the pension age to 70, one of the oldest in the world. There's a continued commitment to taking $14 a fortnight away from pensioners. We know that energy costs are through the roof but, of course, this government wants to take away the energy supplement from pensioners. The $715 million of cuts to hospitals are still there. The $40 million cut from allied health services for veterans is just an extraordinary little nugget of cruelty in this budget. $40 million is not a great deal in the size of the federal budget, but to take that money away from veterans who rely on this service to have their teeth seen to just shows the cheapness and the meanness, and how out of touch this government is. 


Of course, there's the $83 million cut from the ABC. This is a government that will take any opportunity it can to shut down dissent, criticism or even scrutiny of its own agenda or claims. The ABC are copping it once again. And Medicare is still frozen for specialists. We will see, of course, more and more stories about continuing increases in out-of-pocket expenses for patients struggling to afford to see a specialist. 


Yes, there are some tax cuts in this budget. We are very pleased to support the early years—the immediate tax cuts offered from 1 July this year—but we are very troubled by a long-term trajectory that takes tax cuts out beyond—it's assuming that Malcolm Turnbull's got a longevity that I'm not even sure that the Deputy Speaker would imagine he has. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Andrews
):  The member should refer to other members by their correct titles. 




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  When it comes to tax cuts promised into the never-never, we are very concerned that a nurse on $41,000 will be paying the same rate of tax as a doctor on $200,000 a year. It just hardly seems fair to be doing that. And of course there is the $80 billion of big business tax cuts that continue to haunt us.


There's no action on debt, and that is really one of the most extraordinary things about this budget for a government that claimed in opposition to be riding in with the fire engine to put out the fire and that drove the debt truck around the country. It is pretty extraordinary that net debt this year is double what it was when the Liberals came to office. Gross debt has crashed through half a trillion dollars. It's pretty handy that the government was able to do a deal with the Greens political party to get rid of the debt cap; otherwise, they'd have to return to the parliament again and again to explain why net debt's doubled and why gross debt's crashed through half a trillion dollars and will remain over half a trillion dollars for every year over the next decade.


Of course, Labor will achieve a budget surplus in the same year as the government. Because we are not giving away $80 billion in big-business tax cuts, because we're not giving tax cuts to people on more than $180,000 a year and because we've made very tough decisions around negative gearing, capital gains tax, family trusts, high-end superannuation concessions and multinational tax, we are able to see bigger surpluses than the government over coming years. So we're able to have a bigger tax cut for low- and middle-income earners. In fact, we're almost doubling the tax cut for low- and middle-income earners—about 10 million working Australians. We're able to protect the services that Australians rely on: a great education system for their kids, strong health care, aged care, child care and making sure that we're continuing to build the productivity-enhancing infrastructure that makes our cities and regions more liveable. We're able to do all of that, give bigger tax cuts and have stronger surpluses because we're not spraying around tax concessions to the big end of town as this government insists on doing.


To turn specifically to the education areas in this budget: of course we continue to see a $17 billion cut to schools baked into this budget. I think it does tell you all you need to know about the priorities of this government that the $17 billion cut from schools is the same amount that the big banks will get in tax cuts because of the big-business tax cuts. So you can spend $17 billion giving our kids a better future, investing in our nation to make sure that we develop the intellectual skills in our people, to make sure that we are a prosperous and successful nation in the future—you could do that one on the one hand if you had $17 billion to spend—or you could just give it to the big banks and spray it around as executive bonuses and dividends to overseas shareholders. We know which side of that choice we are on. We know which side the government's on too.


We also see locked in the inequitable funding formula that gives a maximum of 20 per cent of the schooling resource standard—the cost of educating a child—to kids in public schools. It is 20 per cent of the schooling resource standard if you're educating a child in a public school and 80 per cent if you're educating a child in a non-government school. Why you would think for a moment that this is a sector-blind approach, as the Prime Minister keeps saying, is just absolutely impossible to understand. This approach could not be more sectors-specific than it is. One school system gets 20 per cent of the cost of educating a child, and another school system gets 80 per cent of the cost of educating a child. That's not sector-blind. That is absolutely as sector-specific as it possibly could be.


We also see in this budget the continued cuts to public schools, which educate 74 per cent of students with disabilities, 82 per cent of kids from the bottom quarter of socioeconomic advantage and 84 per cent of Indigenous children. But it's not just the public schools that have suffered. The Catholic sector are particularly incensed about the billions of dollars of cuts that they are facing because of these changes.


We see the government talking about the Gonski report mark 2, which is supposed to look at how money should be spent within the schooling system. I thought it was very instructive that we heard from Mark Scott today, the Director-General of the New South Wales Department of Education. He said: 'Yes, great idea; let's do more of this one-on-one individual programming for individual kids. But it will cost more. It will be expensive.' We're very happy to see a number of these recommendations. In fact, they reflect Labor policy with the national agreements that we had when we were last in government—agreements that were dispensed with by the previous Minister for Education, the member for Sturt, who said they were simply red tape. Well, they've been resurrected in this Gonski report—and Mark Scott has agreed that many of them are a good idea, but they'll need extra funding.


This government has cut $17 billion—and even agreeing with things like the evidence institute, which would do more education research and promulgate that research into our schools to make sure we were using the best and newest available information to teach our kids well. They've agreed that that's a good idea. Labor's got $280 million on the table for an evidence institute for schools. Guess how much the government's got on the table for an evidence institute for schools? A big fat zero. It's all very good to say the ideas are great, but if you're cutting funding to our schools at the same time, it's very difficult to see how these ideas might be implemented. There's no extra money in this budget for the ideas that are raised in the second Gonski report. In fact, the only thing in the budget are the baked-in cuts—$17 billion cut from schools.


Turning to TAFE and universities, since the election of this government we've seen more than $3 billion cut from TAFE skills and apprenticeships. The National Partnership Agreement on Training Places for Single Parents has been cut. There has been a cut to workplace English language and literacy programs. We have seen the Apprenticeship to Business Owner program cut. Productive Ageing through Community Education has been cut. The Australian Apprenticeships Access program has been cut. I think it tells you all you need to know about the education minister that he said TAFE education was about 'basket weaving and essential oils'. These are the sorts of programs that they're cutting—workplace English language and literacy programs and the Apprenticeship to Business Owner program, which I would have thought would be right up the government's alley.


This budget cuts a further $270 million from TAFE. On top of all the cuts we've already seen, on top of the fact that we've got 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees than when the Liberals came into office, we're now seeing an extra $270 million cut from TAFE over the next four years. The Skilling Australians Fund, from last year's budget, was set to be $1.47 billion over four years. In this budget it is $1.42 billion. We've also seen TAFEs closing right around Australia—in regional centres like Dapto, in New South Wales; Ithaca, in Queensland; Newport, in Victoria; and in Petersham West and Crows Nest, in New South Wales. Courses have been scaled back, fees have increased and we continue to see skills shortages. We see professions on the skills shortage list that have been there for five years—the whole time this government's been in power. People could have been trained if we had a properly resourced TAFE and vocational education sector.


Labor, in contrast, has promised to scrap up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students who choose to learn the skills that Australia needs. We've said that two out of every three Commonwealth dollars will go to TAFE. We've promised to provide 10,000 pre-apprentice places for young people who want to learn a trade and 20,000 adult apprenticeships for older workers who want to retrain. And we've said we'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country.


We also see in this budget the locking in of cuts to universities. Of course, some of these cuts were made just before Christmas, in the mid-year economic and fiscal update, in a way that prevented the cuts coming before the parliament. They were able to sneak $2.2 billion of cuts in through the back door, which shows that the Liberals absolutely don't care that hundreds of thousands of Australians who have the desire and the competency to go to university will actually miss out. We think that that is wrong. It's wrong for those individuals, and it's absolutely wrong for our nation. As the world becomes more complex and as work becomes more complex, we want more of our young people to have a TAFE or a university education after school. We want more of our people who've been in the workforce for many years to retrain. Because the world of work is changing so quickly, people will have to upgrade their skills throughout their working lives.


Modelling by the Mitchell Institute shows that our commitment to uncap university places will mean that almost 200,000 more Australians will benefit from our plan over 12 years. When we previously uncapped university places, it meant that, by 2016—as this government's effectively reintroduced caps—the number of students from poorer backgrounds was up by 55 per cent, Indigenous student numbers had jumped by 89 per cent, enrolments by students with a disability had more than doubled and enrolments by students from country areas had grown by 48 per cent.


In a nutshell, I'd say that this is a budget that fails Australia when it comes to education. When it comes to school education, TAFE education and university education, there is nothing in this budget but baked-in old cuts and further new cuts. It's short-sighted because it robs our people of a chance at an education, and it's short-sighted because it robs our nation of our future prosperity.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson) (17:27):  I warn the chamber that this speech will not be nearly as coherent as what you've just heard. I plan to take full advantage of the fact that the relevance rule is completely disregarded during appropriations debates. I have four different speeches that I've been wanting to deliver, and I'm just going to do one after the other with absolutely no segue. To anyone who tries to string it together in a coherent way in the years to come, I wish you well.


I will start with a message that I would have delivered next week were parliament sitting—but it won't be, so I will offer the message now and distribute it later. Of course, while parliament's not sitting will be the end of the period of Ramadan and the celebration of Eid al-Fitr. On behalf of federal Labor, I would like to extend my best wishes to all Muslim communities in Australia and around the world that are celebrating the end of a month of fasting and the beginning of Eid al-Fitr. The announcement of Eid al-Fitr is made at the sighting of the crescent moon, an Islamic tradition which was used to identify the new month in the Islamic calendar. It marks the end of a month which many thousands of Australians have dedicated to fasting, praying and performing acts of charity. While technically, I suppose, there are some parallels with my own tradition of Lent, I think it's fair to say that my tradition has no understanding of fasting when compared to the fasting that takes place during the blessed month of Ramadan.


Preparations for Eid al-Fitr begin well before the sighting of the moon, with decorations going up in homes, on shopfronts and at local mosques. The sweet aroma of the traditional shortbreads, ma'amoul, fills homes and streets the nights before as families and friends unite for a final iftar, a final breaking of the fast, and gather to share the last Ramadan prayers and blessings. Celebrations begin at dawn, with traditional prayers at the local mosque, and are followed by the visiting of families, friends and communities, sharing the stories of the month that passed and the blessings of the year to come. Whenever I go down to celebrate with so many friends at the end of Ramadan, I always park many, many blocks away. There's this wonderful period before dawn of people walking and the group gradually getting larger and larger as you get closer. That journey towards the gathering is a beautiful part for me every time we get to Eid al-Fitr.


One of the nicest things about the celebration is the sense of unity and happiness shared amongst Muslims from various cultural backgrounds. Colourful displays of new garments are paraded, and the exuberant faces of the children fill the space as they collect money and gifts. The celebration of Eid al-Fitr, like the celebrations we mark from around the world throughout the year, is a great example of how strong and successful modern multicultural Australia is, and how our Australian story is built on the experiences of communities from around the world. To everyone celebrating, Eid Mubarak.


I want to let the House know about a wonderful victory for a school only a few blocks from where I live, Punchbowl Boys High. There is a band competition running in New South Wales for high school bands, known as YouthRock, and this year Punchbowl Boys' High won. I'm tremendously proud of them. The band members are Lucas Tekii, Yoosuf Mohamed, Eliata Ulutui, Wilkinson Papalii-Afoa, Theodore Crysma Tavete, and Micah Papalii-Tulanai. They're a great band. They're a band that has been kind enough to allow me to jam with them. I've turned up at the school with a guitar, and they've been kind enough to allow me to jam with them. They are known as the 320—that's the name of their band. There's a thing where on the one hand you have three fingers, and on the other you have two, and you're photographed. For those wondering about the mystery of how a band becomes 320, 320 it's the room number of the music room at Punchbowl Boys High. They have been writing originals for some time. One of their songs which was actually played on ABC Radio today is 'My Way', which, for members who might be concerned, is not the Frank Sinatra version but an original by themselves. To their music teacher, Michael White, I extend congratulations. They are a group of young men of great talent. We wish them well, and I hope that they're well on the way to adding their music to what forms the soundtrack of our nation.


Shortly before the change of government back in 2013, the Live Music Office was established. There was a reason we established the Live Music Office: for a long time in the arts there was a view that popular music didn't really need government support because it is so commercial and has been able to very much look after itself. However, there are some challenges that have been emerging over the years. The business model that Australian popular music has largely been built on has been changing fundamentally. The shift from purchasing of albums—I'll admit, I still purchase vinyl, but many people don't—to the purchasing of downloads and streaming has meant a significant difference in how bands earn their money.


At the same time, there's been a rapid decline in the number of venues available for them. The bands that many of the members of this place grew up with worked a pub circuit. In evidence that was given in New South Wales only yesterday, Isabella Manfredi from The Preatures—spelt the way you spell 'creatures', not with any other meaning—listed off a series of venues that were important to her band in Sydney when they were getting started. Having gone through the list of the venues—she went through Drummoyne RSL, Spectrum, Q Bar, Deans, Candy's Apartment, Bar Me, Flinders Bar, World Bar, The Gaelic, The Hopetoun, The Sandringham, The Lizard Lounge, The Standard, The Hi-Fi, Oxford Art Factory, The Lansdowne and Club 77—only two of them still exist as live music venues. This is a challenge that's happening around the country. There's a series of issues that have caused this. Ultimately our music industry has challenges now that are different to what it used to have. Some of those are caused by government policy and some of those need to be facilitated and improved through government policy.


I want to make sure that Australian music always forms the soundtrack to our lives. I want the next generation to grow up with Australian music. I want all of us to grow old with Australian music. That means we need to make sure that the entire ecosystem around our music industry survives. A whole lot of the forms of revenue that used to be there for bands are not there at the moment, and we can't just say, 'Okay, we need to have the big venues where someone's playing for 10,000.' That would be like saying, 'The only athletes we need to look after are the Australian Olympic team.' Cultural activity like popular music is the same as any area of excellence. You need your community level that people come through—where they grow, where they practise, where they play again and again—and 200 gigs later they're playing to very large venues. That is what needs to be possible.


The Live Music Office, since it was established, has been making sure there is a body to deliver on that. The guaranteed funding that we had put in place continued for the contracted period that we had left, but after the initial three-year funding, which was provided until 2016, the Live Music Office subsequently received project funding from the Australia Council, which has now run out. With APRA AMCOS, it then delivered further financial support. The Live Music Office matters. It might not matter if you didn't mind what came on on the radio—if you didn't mind that all the songs people are hearing have American accents and if you didn't mind that the places being sung about are on the other side of the planet—but, if we want Australian stories and Australian imagination and Australian voices to be what we get to hear as the soundtrack to our lives, then backing the Live Music Office is something that needs to happen. The government has still baulked at providing continued funding for them, and I would simply urge the government in the strongest terms. This doesn't need to be political. In fact, it would be bizarre for anyone to say only one side of politics supports popular music. When Rock The House is on, I see members of parliament from both sides all going up to enjoy the popular music. Those artists don't come here simply to entertain us; they come to make sure that we hear them—that we hear them about copyright, that we hear them about venues, that we hear them about making sure the entire ecology that makes for a viable, strong, resilient music industry is always there—and the Live Music Office is a critical part of that.


There is a final thing I want to say a few words about. I want to advise the House why it is that on so many occasions I stand up and make speeches about the different celebrations that are being enjoyed around Australia. Sometimes they're faith based; sometimes they're culturally based. Sometimes they're about my faith; sometimes they're about the faiths of others. Whenever I put one of those speeches up on social media, if it's a message about, for example, Ramadan, Holi or a series of different celebrations, it's interesting that I'll straightaway get the comments: 'I didn't hear you mention Christmas in that speech. Why don't you ever say anything about Christmas and Easter?' Then, at Christmas and Easter time, when I put up messages about those celebrations—and with Easter I often have to put up two because of the different Orthodox dates—the message that comes back is: 'How dare you try to impose your faith on me?' I think we all need to understand that Australia is a nation of 24 million stories and they're all as Australian as each other. They come in two broad forms: either stories that have always, ever since the first sunrise, had their heritage on this land or stories that, at some point, have come here through immigration. But they're all Australian.


I'll always resist being told, 'Instead of saying ""Happy Christmas!"" you should say ""Happy holidays!""' If what someone is celebrating is a holiday, then I'm really happy for them to wish me a happy holiday, if that's what matters to them. If what matters to them is that they're celebrating Hanukkah and they want to wish me a 'Happy Hanukkah!' I think that's great and I'll wish them a 'Happy Christmas!' And when we have carols in my local area at Wiley Park, the place will be full of people. And from the way that they are dressed when they come to those carols, it's pretty obvious they're from a range of different faiths.


Last Saturday night, for the first time, we closed Howden Street in Lakemba during Ramadan, and the street was packed. There were plenty of people there who were there to eat the different food from different cultures and plenty of those people had not been fasting all day—me included—but they'd come because that sense of invitation we offer to each other is itself part of being Australian. Since I issued the invitation for people to come down to Lakemba any time of night during Ramadan, I have seen one other member there—I won't give him up—from the other side of politics. He was there on a private basis, but he came. The invitation was real.


What I'd encourage everybody to think about is we either end up with all the different cultures and become a nation where we tell some people they don't belong or we go down even the American path of assimilation, where you often don't wish anybody a happy anything other than 'Happy Holidays!' because you don't want to offend. There is no offence in generosity. There is no offence in embracing each other's celebrations. Those of us who don't have a First Nations background here on this land still appreciate the welcome to country. All of us can take the goodwill of a Christmas message, of an Eid message, of a Hanukkah message, of a Dipawali message and, with that, build that sense, not of a soup—where everything is pureed and where all the ingredients come out tasting the same—but of a salad, where every ingredient keeps its identity. Together we form a flavour that's distinctively, uniquely and proudly Australian.

Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (17:42):  I rise tonight to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, which provides appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the annual services of the government for 2017-18 and for the remainder of 2018-19. I want to talk about how the budget affects my local electorate in Holt and some other issues. The local residents in Holt, in my experience and that of my staff, need financial relief given the very low wage growth that we've had over a number of years, the continued rise in the cost-of-living expenses and cuts to penalty rates. And they also are in urgent need of new infrastructure to keep pace with the rapidly growing population in the outer south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.


The City of Casey, as of the end of 2017, had a population of 327,380 people. I'm sure it's well into the 330,000s now. In another 20 years, its size will be past Canberra's, basically. It's one of the fastest-growing areas of Australia. It's an area that, regardless of how it's portrayed in the press, offers, I think, a lot of hope for the future of our country. I'll be talking a bit further about how we can assist those many young families who have shifted into the area to make a life not only for themselves and their families but for their family's families, and talk about how they are portrayed and about how the real contribution that hardworking families in the outer suburbs make to our country's future should be appropriately recognised. I think the member for Werriwa has an outer suburban constituency as well, so she would well know what I'm talking about. Before I amplify that particular discussion point, we on this side certainly believe that more funding should have been committed to the City of Casey region. Some ideas include the duplication of Thomsons Road between Cranbourne and Clyde, and also an idea that I had that we had secured opposition support for prior to the last election, which was an overpass on the intersection of Thomsons Road and Western Port Highway. The budget delivered by the government does not invest in much needed infrastructure projects like that and other projects in the outer suburbs of Melbourne and in my area. The government certainly hasn't delivered in areas like protecting pensioners. It's cut the energy supplement, costing pensioners $14 a fortnight. It also has failed to deliver in areas such as education in schools and cuts to TAFE.


One contrast I would make is what the Andrews Labor government has achieved in Victoria, particularly in the infrastructure area, in the past 3½ years. Since being elected in November 2014, the Andrews Labor government has invested more than $48 billion to build the schools, the hospitals, the roads and the public transport system our state needs. Construction work completed in Victoria is up 6.5 per cent in the March quarter, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, compared with the national average of just 0.2 per cent. As a result, more than 320,000 jobs have been created since the Andrews Victorian Labor government came to office. Business owners said to me for a long time before the election of the Andrews state Labor government that they wanted a government that invested in infrastructure, roads, construction and rail. With that investment, as testified by the figure of $48 billion, there are a lot of cranes, Deputy Speaker Kevin Andrews, as you would know, in the sky in Victoria. That's always a good sign. There is a lot of road and rail work being done and a lot of hospitals are being built. The Casey Hospital, for example, is very close to where I live. It's adjacent to my constituency, as it currently stands, with perhaps some alterations to occur in the future. The Andrews Labor government has made a very substantial investment there.


When people drive on the roads that are being widened, such as the Monash Freeway, or they travel on sky rail, particularly around the Cranbourne area, or they see the extension of the Narre-Cranbourne Road, TAFEs being built and expanded like the Chisholm Institute of TAFE, and the Casey Hospital—and that is a very, very large building that is offering excellent service to a growing community, one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia—they know that the state government is investing in essential infrastructure: road infrastructure, rail infrastructure and what I call medical infrastructure.


The other thing I want to compliment the Andrews government on is the number of new schools that have been opened in our area. It is amazing to see the number of almost high-tech schools that are catering to the growing community that we have in our region. I believe that the Andrews government has made a commitment for another three schools just in that growth corridor, approximate to where I represent. That is a government that really is reacting to the needs of the community. The sense that I get when speaking to people about the Andrews government—in contrast to what, I regret to say, the Turnbull government has been doing in the south-east in terms of investment in infrastructure—is that Daniel Andrews is getting things done. Certainly, when you look at the hospitals, the roads and the new schools, you can see a lot of work being done. People believe that this government is investing in them and their future. I'd like to commend the government. I hope that the Andrews Labor government is re-elected, particularly on the basis of all the fine work that it's done for the outer suburbs. I respectfully draw your attention, as a comparison, to the investment that we've seen by the Turnbull government. As an example, there has been very little investment in contrast to the splendid new series of wards that have been built at the Casey Hospital.


We have been meeting. Ever since I shifted into the region in 1996, there has been a discussion about a second airport in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, as you would know. A consortium has been working with the Andrews Labor government to finally, after many, many years, potentially invest in an airport after the appropriate environmental impact statements have been made so that the growth corridor would not be adversely affected by the creation of a second airport. But I think we are very close. My understanding is that that consortium has been supported by the Andrews government, and that is something. I do support this second airport with the proviso that those appropriate environmental impact statements are taken into account and the flight paths of what would be Melbourne's second major airport do not adversely affect pockets in some of the growth belt suburbs. I do completely support that. There would be a thousand jobs.


The potential here is this: we will have a second major airport and potentially an airport that could rival Tullamarine down the track—and we're talking about the next 40 or 50 years. This will transform the south-eastern region of Melbourne. And the investment, as I understand it, having spoken to the consortium concerned, is somewhere in the order of about $7 billion. But my point is that I'm not aware of the engagement with the federal government with respect to that, and that's a disappointment. These matters need to be negotiated with both the state government of Premier Andrews, which has been supportive, and the federal government, and, from my understanding, that sort of engagement has not happened. I think that's a bad thing when this federal government's touting a lot of the work and a lot of the investment it has made. It could have made, for example, the overpass investment on the corner of Thompsons Road and Western Port Highway. It did not.


We took, as I said, to the last election a $65 million commitment, as I understand it, to actually help the state government construct that overpass. The state government is widening Thompsons Road. It's put Skyrail over Thompsons Road. It's an important east-west feeder and connector and it's of critical significance in feeding traffic into, particularly, EastLink as well, taking traffic from Frankston almost all the way up to Berwick. It needs that sort of investment and that commitment, and that affects marginal seats like Dunkley and places like that, so you would think that a government that did have some measure of concern about its seats would do that.


We certainly did not have that bipartisan support that I would have expected at the last federal election, but we will obviously be speaking to our relevant shadow ministers to talk about, prior to the next election, how they can assist as they have in the past. I can recall, as an example, that prior to the 2007 election the federal government was not investing in part of one of the rural and regional development funding programs for a water-harvesting facility at Casey ARC. I understand that, finally, just prior to the election the then Howard government was prepared to invest, I think, a million dollars. We had our shadow minister, who was Anthony Albanese, that came down. We made a $5 million investment. We have invested. I'd like to point out also what we have done as well.


We invested, particularly during the global financial crisis during the Rudd-Gillard prime ministerships, over $10 million in the City of Casey in emergency funding to ensure that jobs were generating. There is a very fine state-standard athletics track that was funded to the tune of, I think, about $9 million post around the 2009-10 period due to the rural regional infrastructure funding.


Why do I raise this? Because, even with the $10 million that was given by the Abbott government for Bunjil Place, which is a significant, region-leading, $125 million investment by the state government, we cannot access funding anymore through that program line. It's changed from the National Stronger Regions Fund to the Building Better Regions Fund. That's great. We can say to people, 'We invested $10 million,' but, when we have significant other projects that are desperately needed, there is no funding opportunity for us to pursue that.


Cranbourne East is the fastest-growing area in Australia. To say to them that it's okay to fund the regions, but you don't have a discrete outer region funding mechanism, as was used by the previous Abbott government to get the City of Casey the $10 million, is completely unsatisfactory. Tell that to the people who wait in a kilometre-long queue on Clyde Road every morning, when they're coming to work and trying to connect to the Monash Freeway. That is completely unacceptable.


I note that the member for Jagajaga is in the chamber. One of the signature achievements of the Keating prime ministership in particular was the Building Better Cities program. I think it was administered by Brian Howe. It was an inspired program. It was a program that was meant for the outer suburbs, to make our cities more livable and more equitable. They were the two terms used. Time after time you would come across projects across the city—these community-building projects. You would see these great projects—project after project—across the country. Myuna Farm in the suburb of Doveton was one and I think there was another project funded in the city of Elizabeth in South Australia. The feedback that we got was that they were projects that were needed by the community. That $816 million between 1991 and 1996 is a heck of a lot more money now. I represent the fastest-growing suburb, Cranbourne East and I contrast that funding with the level of funding that has been put in with the federal government investment in Cranbourne East now, which is about 0.0 dollars. That doesn't make people happy when they're waiting for half an hour to get onto the Monash Freeway, but it's also about more schools. It's about community based facilities. It's an amazing community, badly portrayed, I might say, by articles in The Age. The fact is when people go out there to make a life for themselves with their families, they shouldn't be written about pejoratively, as they were in The Age saying this area has become a large slum because it doesn't have the social infrastructure. The social infrastructure's not being there is the responsibility of governments that allowed that work to happen. It is our responsibility to provide the social infrastructure for these people in areas such as mental health and a whole range of other areas.


In concluding—I could go on and on, but I won't for the wellbeing of this chamber—the Andrews government has made significant investments in the outer suburbs. The Turnbull government needs to do this and it needs to do it soon.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (17:57):  This is the fifth Abbott-Turnbull budget. In every single budget from this conservative government there have been cuts to the age pension, cuts to Newstart, cuts to hospitals and schools, an increase in the pension age to 70 and now in this budget the latest proposal: a flattening of the income tax system that will see inequality get worse in this country. It's very clear that with this budget the Prime Minister wants people to forget its five-year catalogue of cuts, cuts that define this government and have defined this government since the horror budget of 2014.


The Prime Minister would of course like to go to the next election having whitewashed the terrible cuts of the last five years. I say to him and to all of the Liberal and National party members that over the last month or so I've done a number of very large pension forums, particularly in Perth—I did five very well attended pension forums there—and more recently in Tasmania and down in Frankston, in Victoria. Pensioners have not forgotten what this government wants to do to them. They understand the implications of the government's desire to increase the age-pension age to 70. I should say to anybody who's listening that this isn't some policy change that's off on the never-never. People who turn 60 from this July will have to work longer because of Mr Turnbull's plan to increase the pension age to 70. It's not something that's just going to affect people who are in their 40s or their 50s; it's actually going to start affecting people who turn 60 very, very soon.


Australians also haven't forgotten what this government wants to do to the energy supplement. For the information of those opposite, who I'm sure would like to forget that this is what they have already voted for twice and that the government has it in this budget again, they want to axe the energy supplement. This is worth $14 a fortnight for single pensioners and $8.80 a fortnight for people on Newstart. Very vulnerable people who find themselves out of work and need to rely on Newstart will face a cut to Newstart as a result of this government's budget. This is a cut in this budget. Of course, it has been a cut in previous budgets. The government has so far been unable to get this through the parliament, but it is in this budget. This government is determined to see a cut to the pension, with the abolition of the energy supplement, and a cut to Newstart. Labor will continue to strongly oppose this very significant cut.


We hear the government boast every day about the number of jobs that have been created. But what they don't tell us, what isn't said every day but Australians understand, is that there are about one million people in our country who are underemployed. That is on top of the people who are unemployed. According to the Australian Council of Social Service, 730,000 children are living in poverty. And another fact that never crosses the lips of those opposite is that nearly half the number of people on Newstart, nearly half the number of people on unemployment benefits, are unemployed for more than a year. Long-term unemployment in this country is getting worse and this government is doing absolutely nothing about it.


Inequality in this country is at a 75-year high. This isn't the 'jobs and growth' story that you hear from the Prime Minister every day, but these are the facts. It is a fact of life for millions of Australians who are really doing it very tough under this government. It is not what our country should be like. It certainly is time that we gave these people and families a much better shot at a decent life. One of the important ways in which Labor wants to address this fundamental inequity in our country is to make sure those people who are struggling can get the skills that they need to get the jobs that they want. We want to improve their capacity to get a TAFE qualification. Labor, in government, would scrap up-front fees for around 100,000 TAFE students and also spend $100 million upgrading our TAFEs around the country.


It is also why Labor is determined to seriously invest in our schools. This government made huge cuts to school funding back in the 2014 budget. Labor has promised to put into our schools over the next 10 years the $17 billion that is needed and, in particular, make sure that those areas in our country that are very disadvantaged are able to deliver great educational opportunities for our children. That includes areas like Doveton, in Victoria, which is not far from the member for Bruce's electorate. It has a fantastic primary and secondary school delivering 'Our Place', a model of education and support for families that is really turning those families around. But it costs money. You actually need to spend the extra money to make sure that those schools can deliver to those families, children and young people. Labor, of course, is determined to improve access to universities, with 200,000 extra places at our universities, and provide additional funding for hospitals to completely reverse the coalition's cuts. All of these initiatives that Labor would put in place are about investing in our people and also making sure that we protect people when they fall on hard times. By contrast, what we see in this budget is a plan by the Liberals that favours the well off and will worsen inequality.


I want to talk about tax, because that is the starkest demonstration in this budget of how this government will, in fact, increase inequality in our country. How we raise the money that we need for our schools and hospitals and to have a decent safety net determines whether or not we have a fair society. There's been some excellent analysis done at ANU, NATSEM and the Grattan Institute, and all have pointed out that this government's tax cuts are deliberately designed to deliver the biggest gains to those people who need them least in our community. These are the facts: about 60 per cent of the benefit of the government's tax changes would go to the wealthiest 20 per cent in this country. Just today, in Senate estimates, the secretary of Treasury said that a worker on $80,000 a year would receive a tax cut worth $540 a year by the end of the government's seven-year plan, whereas someone earning $200,000 a year would get a tax cut of $7,225 dollars a year. If you want a demonstration of how this government's going to increase inequality, that is it in a nutshell.


By contrast, Labor will deliver much fairer tax cuts for 10 million working Australians and for those people who really need it most. Of course, we can afford to deliver these fairer and larger tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners because we are prepared to make some very, very significant and progressive changes to the tax system, with reforms to negative gearing, capital gains tax, discounts, family trusts, and dividend imputation. Of course, all are opposed by the conservatives because they want to keep the benefits of those tax-avoidance mechanisms going to the top end of town.


Of course, it's not just about tax. We understand that, in addition to tax cuts, we need to make sure that we protect people's penalty rates. Those opposite, of course, have sat by while people's penalty rates have been lost. One of the most significant changes in this budget is this government's decision to flatten our tax system, meaning that somebody earning $40,000 a year and somebody earning $200,000 a year will be in the same tax bracket. Now, how on earth could that be fair? As we have said time and time again, we certainly do not want to see an $80 billion handout to big business, especially when $17 billion of it is going to the big banks.


I want to finish by talking about something that's very dear to my heart, and that is, of course, the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I'm very glad to see that the government has finally come to acknowledge that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is, and always has been, fully funded, even though this lot opposite have spent years undermining the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The government has tried to say that people have to put up with cuts to family tax benefits, cuts to the energy supplement, cuts to Newstart, cuts to pensions and cuts to paid parental leave—all of these cuts were used as excuses; they were apparently needed to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Of course, last year, the Treasurer said with great fanfare that we needed a tax rise on the lowest-income people in the country to fund the NDIS. All of this was false. People with disability were used as a political football. It was a complete and utter disgrace on the part of both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Playing politics with people with disability, holding people with disability to ransom in this way, must never happen again. It is now time for all of us to focus on making sure that the NDIS actually fulfils the promise that I would hope we all have see in it, which is to improve the lives of people with disability.


We are all getting hundreds and hundreds of calls from people who feel let down and frustrated with the rollout of the NDIS. People want this government and this minister to step up and actually fix the problems with the NDIS. They don't want them blaming people with disability; they actually want the problems fixed. Let's get it back on track. Fix the ICT system. Don't treat it like a big bureaucracy which is driving people to enormous frustration. We all want a people-centred organisation. It has to actually be about helping people with disability and their families to lead the lives that they want for themselves—a life of independence, if possible, so people are able to work, have fun, live in the community and have a decent home. That's the promise of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It's a promise that Labor is absolutely determined to see delivered, and this government should do likewise.

"Stanley, Anne, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms STANLEY
 (Werriwa) (18:11):  I rise to make my contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the related bills and to add the voice of my community, which would have liked to have seen a fairer budget which addressed the needs of people all over our electorate—people who tell me every day they're struggling with higher costs, electricity bills, lack of parking, traffic jams, high childcare costs and cuts to school, TAFE and university. Yet, instead of addressing the concerns of the people in my electorate, this budget continues with a handout to big business and the big banks. The residents in my electorate of Werriwa have suffered thanks to the government's ideological war against Medicare and public health care. The Liberals have cut from Medicare and hospitals every year since the 2014 budget. The assault has continued in this budget, which cuts $2.8 billion from hospitals between the next election and 2025. Under this government, the national average waiting time for elective surgery is the longest on record, the number of people presenting at emergency departments is the highest on record, and the number of hospital beds available for elderly Australians is the lowest on record.


This crisis was felt on a local level with the debacle around the closure and reopening of two after-hours GP clinics in my electorate. In mid-December, with zero public consultation, it was announced that after-hours GP clinics at Liverpool and Campbelltown hospitals would be closing on New Year's Eve and in early January. Following an outcry from the community and pressure from me and the member for Macarthur, they announced in March that they would reopen the after-hours clinics. Both are now well away from the hospitals they had been connected to. The connection of the two clinics to their respective hospitals had helped ease the pressure on the emergency departments located there. Worse still, the new Liverpool clinic had moved out of the Liverpool CBD and across the Georges River to the suburb of Moorebank, into an area not easily accessible by public transport for the people of my electorate.


The importance of easing the pressure on emergency departments can't be overstated. There were 7.8 million emergency department presentations in 2016-17—one million more than five years ago. This level of growth is putting our hospitals and their staff under immense pressure. They need more funding to keep up. People living in south-west Sydney have been hit particularly hard by this. Hospitals like Liverpool are dealing with this increase and the increases that come with ageing populations, as well as with the huge growth in population from Sydney's south-west suburban fringes. Hospitals like Liverpool will benefit from Labor's alternative budget through a $2.8 billion better hospitals fund. As a result of this, hospitals like Liverpool will have more doctors, nurses, health staff and beds in the emergency departments. This is important. This is needed. And this will make a real difference in the lives of ordinary Australians. Unfortunately, this government is giving an $80 billion handout to big business and the banks instead of funding health. We don't need a tax giveaway to the banks. We need to get people off long waiting lists for hip operations, knee replacements and cataract removal. 


With the 2018 budget, the Turnbull government has locked in huge education cuts, using them to pay for the tax handouts to big business, cutting $17 billion for schools and giving $17 billion to big banks, and we've seen from the royal commission they don't need it. In the strange world that this government inhabits, banking executives have been hauled before a royal commission and seem to be more deserving of a handout than the kids in my electorate, who have all the talent and potential in the world but not enough resources at their local school to realise that potential. 


I believe Australian families would prefer their taxes going to schools, universities and TAFE, and not big business. But, sadly, TAFE is also having its funding slashed as a result of this budget and the New South Wales state Liberal government. With an extra $270 million cut from TAFE and training, this allows for more than $3 billion in cuts since the government came to power in 2013. Australia now has 140,000 fewer apprentices than we did when the Liberals were first elected.


South-west Sydney is a rapidly growing area. With the construction of Badgery's Creek Airport, there are great opportunities for work for local people. I want the young and the unemployed of Werriwa to benefit from this growth. Unfortunately, this government's war on vocational education means that tomorrow's carpenters, plumbers and bricklayers who build the infrastructure in growth areas won't come locally, but may have to come from foreign worker visa holders. This skills shortage is wholly manufactured by this government, which does not see the purpose of a strong TAFE system, and which has set out to dismantle it at every opportunity. The community thinks otherwise, and so do we on our side of the House. 


A Shorten Labor government will scrap up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students who choose to learn the skills that Australia needs. Despite high unemployment in some areas, workers can't learn the skills that industries are crying out for, and that we have shortages—like carpenters, bricklayers, bakers or pastry chefs. The TAFE system has proved itself over and over again to be the best place for young Australians to develop these skills, and it's Labor's policy to scrap the up-front fees, making it easier for Australians to get the skills they need for a trade, a traineeship, and then a quality job. 


But we won't just stop there. Labor will invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. We'll guarantee at least two out of three Commonwealth training dollars goes to TAFE. We'll ensure one in every 10 jobs in the Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices. We'll provide 10,000 pre-apprentice programs from young people who want to learn a trade, and 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who need to retrain. Labor will abolish the Prime Minister's unfair cap on university student places, meaning the number of Australians getting an education at university will soar to around 200,000, undoing the government's $2.2 billion cut from universities last December. 


Ninety per cent of the jobs created in the coming years will need a university or TAFE qualification. We recognise this. We will invest in education. For all the government's bluster in the lead-up to the budget, you would be forgiven for thinking that, despite this budget's many failings, there would at least be some much-needed infrastructure proposals, and some much-needed proposals that would help build our nation. Unfortunately, the budget included no new money for infrastructure. Every project announced in the budget was funded from previous allocations. There are no plans to lift investment over years and years of cuts. It is another hoax.


Government infrastructure grants to the states, in fact, will fall over each of the next four years—from the promised $8 billion in 2017-18 to $4.5 billion in 2021-22. Commonwealth infrastructure investment over the next decade will fall from 0.4 per cent of GDP to 0.2 per cent. This is a worry for all Australians, but particularly for people living in the outer suburbs of rapidly expanding cities like Melbourne and my home town of Sydney. While the Prime Minister has been making promises over the last six months, the budget wrongly does not seem to be doing anything to actually bring these promises to fruition.


In March, there was much fanfare as the Western Sydney City Deal was announced, and there was an announcement by the Prime Minister that there would be a rail line to Badgerys Creek airport. But the budget includes no money to build this railway line, just $50 million to prepare a business case. With the airport set to open in 2026, we really need to start building the airport line soon. This isn't good enough, but it is what we've come to expect. In this government's first four budgets, investment was $4.7 billion less than was promised.


In Werriwa, residents are all too familiar with this under-investment. Commuter car parks are full by 7:00 am. If you're lucky enough to find a park, the trains are overcrowded. If you drive, the roads are congested. People are being pushed further and further away from the major employment and transport hubs because of the cost of housing. Only 30 per cent of the people who live in the Liverpool local government area also work in it. Seventy per cent of working people who live in my electorate drive to work and only 12 per cent use public transport. Sixty-nine per cent of the journeys on the M5 experience delays, and trains from Liverpool to Central take close to double the time in peak hour than they did in 1975—the journey took 37 minutes in 1975 but now, if you're lucky, it's 63 minutes. Aside from Leppington and Edmondson Park stations, which opened in 2015, and Holsworthy, which opened in 1987, every other train station in my region was opened in the 19th century. South-west Sydney demands real infrastructure spending for real projects. The government has failed us, just like it has on many other things. Labor has shown itself to be the party that will address Australia's infrastructure needs and make meeting the needs of my growing community a major priority.


If you need any further evidence that this is an unfair budget full of hoaxes, look no further than aged care. The government trumpeted 14,000 new in-home aged-care packages over the next four years—3,500 a year. While any increase is welcome, 14,000 is far from adequate; it's merely a drop in the ocean. As of December last year, waiting lists sat at 105,000, and grew by 20,000 in the last six months of 2017 alone. Almost 82,000 of those people waiting have high needs, many with dementia. The government refuses to give us more up-to-date figures. Given our ageing population, the waiting lists will then no doubt continue to grow, and the crisis in aged care will become more acute year after year. Although welcome, 3,500 additional aged-care packages a year are simply not enough. How will the government fund these additional packages? It seems by taking it out of residential care. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are performing a deception, moving money from A to B. And while older Australians are still waiting in care, the government is unable to find any additional funding to address the waiting lists of over 100,000. But it has managed to find the $80 billion tax cut for big business and $17 billion for the big banks.


Budgets are always about choices. What is concerning for me is this budget does not choose the people of my electorate or of Australia. It continues with tax cuts for corporate Australia when it should be supporting students at school, TAFE or university. It should support health care and our older Australians. It should provide infrastructure to make people's lives more bearable. The choices should be fairer and take into account all of us, particularly those in my electorate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It being approximately 6:30 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 192(b). The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde—Government Whip) (12:15):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the related appropriation bills. It's always a pleasure to stand in this chamber and talk about another great budget that this government has delivered for the benefit of the Australian people. I'm very proud to see that our focus as a government with this budget is on assisting the Australian economy to build a stronger economy, because it's through a stronger economy, Deputy Speaker Gee, that we see the ability for people to get a job, to hold a job and to build wealth and prosperity for their families. But not only that; through doing that, we also receive as a government, through the hard work of Australians, individuals and business owners, the income tax revenue necessary to provide the services that we know that all Australians need and require. That is what is so important about this budget. It is built off the back of five years of hard work by coalition governments, which has seen over that time more than a million jobs created in our economy. Those jobs are only created in the economy because of confidence—confidence in the business sector to employ people and confidence in the community, to go out and take a risk where somebody might decide they no longer want to be an employee but that they want to go and start their own business and become self-employed—but it is only possible through a strong economy, and that is what's so important about what this government has been focusing on through successive budgets.


In 2017, we saw some 415,000 new jobs created across our economy. Importantly, in a period where we have seen growth in the number of part-time and casual jobs, three-quarters of those jobs created in 2017 were full-time jobs. That's 16 consecutive months of net job creation to January 2018—the longest positive run since records began. With this record jobs growth, the proportion of working-age Australians now dependent on welfare has fallen to the lowest level in over 25 years—as many have said in this place numerous times, the best form of welfare is a job. The reason for that is that it gives people self-confidence, worth and value. That flows through to their families and it also allows them to begin the process of accumulating wealth and prosperity for their families—though we hopefully see out that, when they're not on welfare, they have the opportunity for their children to see the importance, value and dignity of work. That teaches a future generation of those core, fundamental, underlying concepts that underpin our great society.


How is this strong economy achieved? It is achieved through a government that is focused on bringing the budget back into balance yet, at the same time, returning to hard-working Australians, both individuals and business-owners, taxes that we have received from them. It's because of this focus on the budget bottom line that we see the budget, which was handed down a couple of weeks ago, with the strongest budget bottom line since 2007. The budget will be brought back to balance in 2019-20 and net debt will fall by some $30 billion over the next four years. But, interestingly, the last time that a Labor government delivered a surplus was back in 1989.


The strong economy that we have seen created over the past five or six years ensures that we can guarantee services like the NDIS and Medicare and it has allowed the government to invest in nation-building infrastructure projects across this country—none more important from my perspective, to be somewhat parochial, than the M1 motorway in Logan and also on the Gold Coast. These investments create more job opportunities for all Australians and ensure that commuters in the communities of Logan, even southern Brisbane and also the northern Gold Coast, have the opportunity to get home safer and sooner. Not only that: it also creates the opportunity for the small to medium business owners in our community, whether they are tradesmen or have other service businesses, to be more productive in the day-to-day conduct of their business because they're not sitting in traffic jams on the M1.


Our strong economy is no stroke of luck. It is the result of years of hard work by the coalition government, backed by our commitment to lowering business taxes, regulations, fees and charges. I'd like to share that, in that period, since we got into government in 2013, the government's regulatory reform agenda has cut compliance costs for individual businesses and community organisations by almost $6 billion. The reduction in the regulatory burden on business is key to ensuring that business can focus on what it does best, and that is getting on with the business of business. Part of that getting on with the business of business is taking advantage of our international trade agreements. It's about employing people to provide the services that the customers of that business require. Part of this process has been through lowering our tax rates and making the system fairer and simpler, and in this budget we've seen that the tax relief plan is about encouraging and rewarding working Australians by making income tax lower, fairer and simpler. While those opposite have called it a cash handout, most people, including many in my electorate of Forde, have looked beyond that political spin to see it for what it is. It's a measure to ensure working Australians keep more of their hard earned income, because, at the end of the day, the revenue that we, as governments, receive comes from working Australians.


No-one should be punished for taking on extra shifts, earning overtime or being promoted which would result in them being pushed into a higher tax bracket, and that's where the measures outlined in the budget are so important. They will put an end to bracket creep for so many working Australians and they will allow them to keep the money in their pocket to pay the bills, save for their future or spend locally. In my electorate of Forde, the region of South-East Queensland has a wide range of diverse small businesses, service industries and hardworking families. Nearly 74,000 taxpayers there will stand to benefit from the low- and middle-income tax relief in the upcoming 2018-19 financial year.


The government's tax plan, like everything we've done over the last five or six years, is affordable, thought-out, and considered. We'll provide tax relief now for lower- and middle-income earners and, over time, provide a simpler and fairer tax system for all taxpayers because we need a system that keeps taxes under control so we can remain internationally competitive. We don't want a system that puts a greater burden on hardworking Australians. Having a lower, fairer tax system creates the incentive for people to build and grow wealth. The more the tax burden hurts individuals and businesses, the more it hurts our economy and the opportunity to create jobs. The coalition's tax relief measures will be implemented over seven years in three steps. I was pleased to see that that bill passed the House last week.


Importantly, I'd like to also touch on our energy policies. As we talk to people in our electorates on a day-to-day basis, we know that the cost of electricity is of enormous concern to many, many Australians. This is where the National Energy Guarantee and other measures we've put in place are seeking to put downward pressure on electricity prices in an effort to reduce that cost-of-living burden on families. As we stand here and discuss these appropriation bills, we can contrast our position on energy policy and seeking to still meet our Paris commitments while ensuring that at the same time energy is an affordable necessity of life for Australian families and, importantly, for Australian business. If Australian business costs continue to grow at a rate that is unmanageable, particularly in the energy sector, there will be a flow-on cost and risk to continued jobs growth. But those opposite have a very clear, stated policy of substantially increasing electricity prices because of their renewable energy policies. We know that that will add some $300 a year to household electricity bills than our policies would.


Another area where we're supporting Australian families is our childcare reforms, looking to make child care more affordable. Equally, our school funding reforms will provide record funding for schools across the country.


Importantly, one of the government's main priorities in this budget is to ensure that we keep Australians safe. It is a measure that should never be overlooked, and that is why we're investing another $294 million to make our airports safer and our borders stronger. In contrast, those opposite provide a risk to weakening our border protection measures. If we look back to what they did last time they were in government, we had more than 50,000 people arrive on more than 800 boats, costing taxpayers billions and billions of dollars.


It is through the programs and processes of this government, as outlined in this budget, that we see the opportunity for Australians to continue to grow and prosper. We are delivering through this budget tax relief to encourage and reward hardworking Australians. We're backing business to invest and create more jobs through the extension of the instant asset write-off, which we already did through the previous budget, lowering business tax rates. Those opposite are going to put them back up as part of their $200 million-plus tax grab. That is a fundamental difference between us on this side of the House and those on the other side. We are looking to reduce taxes, reduce the regulatory burden and create the opportunity for Australians to be the best that they can be. The only solution that those opposite have is to increase taxes that increase the cost of living.


We saw that even last week in the passage of the tax bills. Those opposite voted against part of the process, which would have resulted in Australians paying an extra $70 billion income tax over the next 10 years. I say to the Australian people: look not at what those opposite so; look at what they actually do. It is the same for us as a government. The things that we have done successively over the past five years through a series of budgets are now reflected in the current budget that we can work towards lowering taxes, reducing regulation and giving Australians the opportunity to grow and prosper for the future. I commend this bill  will to the House.

"Hill, Julian, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr HILL
 (Bruce) (12:30):  I was just saying to my colleague the member for Macquarie that I might take that speech, pop it on my iPad and file it under fiction, and should ever I need a sleeping tablet I'll try that speech first. At the last election, Labor called out the government for its plan to privatise Medicare. Facts were revealed. The intent was clear. The secret task force had started its work. This was an attempt not just to privatise the core functions but to introduce co-payments and shift more costs to the private consumer. Australians were shocked. Labor members were not, because we remember the history of Medicare. The Whitlam government started to introduce it and the Fraser Liberal government got rid of it. The Hawke Labor government tried to introduce it and the Liberals fought it every step of the way, at election after election. Prime Minister Abbott came in and started to try and dismantle the notion of a universal, fully available public healthcare system, but we campaigned hard and we scared them off. The privatisation of public services is in the Liberal Party's DNA. It's part of why it exists. Nothing has really changed, and this con of a budget accelerates the P-word—privatisation. I'll focus first on Centrelink and touch later on the growing mess that is the visa-and-citizenship processing function in the Department of Home Affairs, or whatever they call it this week.


It's no understatement to say that millions and millions of Australians are fed up to the back teeth with the ever-worsening mess and service from Centrelink. The very name causes people to groan now, to shudder: 'Please, no, mum! Don't make me sit on the phone to Centrelink! I may die waiting.' Hours and hours and hours of people's lives are wasted on the phone trying to get basic things done. Last year we heard—this is last year; we'll wait for the new figures out of Senate estimates—there were 55 million unanswered phone calls at Centrelink. The Abbott-Turnbull-Joyce-McCormack Liberal government just cut a further 1,280 jobs in this budget. That's on top of 5,000 jobs that have been cut from the Department of Human Services and Centrelink since they were elected five long years ago. This budget, sadly, continues the privatisation agenda.


To give them credit they're at least being upfront with this one, unlike with Medicare, and are not trying to hide it anymore. At least they put it in the budget papers and have stopped telling lies. But the people don't know the actual costs, of course. Last year, the first sign of this emerged. In the budget papers, buried on a page way up the back, was a mention of a trial of 250 jobs being outsourced to a call centre. It was a trial. The cost was listed as NFP—not for publication—it was a secret. I said at that time in my speech in the budget debate: 'What a load of BS. Privatisation has started.' I was screamed at by those in the chamber: 'You lie! You're exaggerate! It's not the case.' It turned out I was a prophet. This year they're ramping it up. Another thousand jobs have just been privatised to Serco. Let's google Serco. I did this morning, just to refresh my memory. It's astounding to see what comes up. Serco is a British based company, well known for snatching up any chunk of any public sector around the world that it can get its hands on for a tidy profit. It's become a byword in many countries for privatisation: immigration detention centres, prisons, the NDIA call centre, defence assets, Centrelink. Whatever, it will do it. In my view, companies like this expand like an organism, a parasite that feeds off the taxpayer. I quote from a gardening website:


Parasitic plants have the ultimate plant lifestyle. They get their food or water from another plant instead of making food or obtaining water on their own. The host does the heavy lifting and the parasite benefits.


In this case, the taxpayer, via the public, is the host, companies like Serco the parasite, offering cut-price services on the cheap, at least at first. But, of course, as we've seen this record, this movie, play over and over again worldwide, the truth is that, like most parasites, the ultimate aim is to suck the life out of the host and kill its capacity, because, over time, once the loss of capability in the public sector is complete, it's a seller's market and prices go up. At the core, this is driven by a mistaken ideological belief that the private sector is inherently more efficient—always more efficient, always better. It is also driven by the desire to transfer operational and political risk to the private sector and away from ministers. This is based on a prayer that these benefits then somehow will outweigh the profit margins.


The last five years in Britain are very instructive, and I encourage members interested in these matters to have a look at what's happening there. The warning signs for Australia and the path that the Liberal government is on with the increased privatisation of core public services are clear. The notion of 'too big to fail', which we've heard about in the banking sector, is now part of the common lexicon in Great Britain regarding these big service delivery companies that have hollowed out government departments and trashed their capability to deliver public services. It's openly talked about in the media, by government audit officers and by members of parliament across the spectrum. The recent collapse of Carillion in the UK meant that the government had no choice but to step in earlier this year with government-backed loans to contractors and suppliers because they simply couldn't do without this private company that had gone bust through bad management.


It's not just costs, though; it's issues like accountability. We've seen deaths in detention centres, loss of ministerial control, plausible deniability—'It's not me, it's the contractor; I'm not responsible for anything'—lack of transparency, not being subject to FOI, no public reporting and no transparency on multibillion-dollar contracts and the profit margins that are being made on them. The tax affairs are mysterious—opaque—to say the least. I've been raising the issue of why we can't require these contractors to disclose their domicile for tax purposes so that, if you're going to get a big government contract, a fat, juicy government contract, you've at least got to be up-front about where you pay tax and the taxpayer will be able to see that you actually pay some tax. Apparently that's too hard. Integrity is a big issue. There are no public sector values, no obligations and no code of conduct like those that have always applied to public services. We see the scandals, and the employment practices, as we're seeing with Serco and the call centres, are simply about cutting people's wages.


People are fed up with these as outcomes and sceptical about more privatisation. Survey after survey show it. We've seen criminal investigations in Great Britain into Serco and G4S, and five years ago the British National Audit Office raised concerns about major contractors. They explicitly queried whether this growth was in the public interest. I know the public interest for many is an old-fashioned concept. It's one I believe in. It is society and community deciding to do things collectively in the interests of the many not the few. Of course, there is a role for genuine niche contractors and consultants where we need that expertise and capability, but this odious ideology which underlies the large-scale privatisation of core public services is increasingly discredited, and the place it leads to is not somewhere we should go.


In Australia, this is driven in part by the abject nonsense under this government of arbitrary staffing caps for all government departments. What they did was they came in, they got elected and they said, 'I know; we're going to return to the glory days of the Howard era. We're going to impose random staff numbers, completely divorced from any assessment of capability or what a government agency may need to do for society. We're going to just put a staffing cap on, despite growth in population, demands and so on.' It's a blunt instrument, as the secretary of the Prime Minister's own department has described it, and it's a completely irrational method of resource allocation. So you're told you can't employ a public servant to do a job but you can employ a more expensive private contractor.


The ABS has finally told the truth to the Public Accounts and Audit Committee in the last couple of months. They admitted, in evidence, that the cost of a labour-hire ICT contractor—IT workers do computers, which is why the ABS needs them—is 200 per cent more than just employing that person as a public servant. The only reason they can't employ that person as a public servant, the only reason they're wasting taxpayers' money is that the government won't budge on the staffing cap. They said that this is going to be an increasing problem over the next few years. They're going to need to do more and they're going to need to waste more money on labour-hire contractors to privatise services because of this stupid ideology.


I think it's about time we pushed back hard not just against further privatisation. It's time for a debate on insourcing—having a look where things have gone too far, saying that, after three or four decades of this stuff, perhaps there are areas where we've gone too far and it makes economic and fiscal sense to rebuild public sector capability in the interests of not only costs but service quality, integrity and so on.


There are two obvious examples I would raise, which have been well debated and ventilated time and time again—IT services and also engineering, particularly in the case of the states and territories. I've mentioned the ABS example, which puts numbers around it, but in ICT we've seen decades of outsourcing, no internal capability left, a litany of stuff-ups by government departments, time and time again, every time they try and do a big IT project—because, as someone in the private sector said to me, 'The problem with government departments now is that they're not an informed purchaser; they actually have no-one left who understands this stuff and knows whether they're buying $200 million of crap or not.' That's a direct quote, and it's fair. In my view, great societies have great public services. To do that, you need highly skilled, highly capable public servants—who knew?—people who can actually scope, administer, evaluate and deliver services. The government should stop this ideological tack and effort to privatise critical public services. It makes no meaningful contribution to improving service delivery in our society.


This budget ramps up the Liberal government's avoidance of scrutiny and its complete lack of integrity. I'll give a couple of examples. Surprisingly, shockingly, over the next four years this budget bakes in $26 million of cuts to ASIC's core operational funding. This is not the special projects stuff; this is the everyday core funding that the regulator of the financial and banking sector needs to do its job. You might think that's a 1 April joke coming in the context of the scandals emerging from the banking royal commission—the royal commission which the Prime Minister, the former investment banker himself, had to be dragged kicking and screaming to actually have. There is shocking evidence emerging of mismanagement, cultural problems and a failure of the regulator to act. There is scrutiny now on handshake deals. You commit a crime, you get found out and you get popped in a room where the regulator says: 'You've been a bit naughty there; let's negotiate a penalty.' And you say: 'I don't want to pay that much.' And they say: 'All right, what about a bit less?' You say: 'I don't want to pay that much.' They say: 'What about a bit less?' You say: 'All right, we'll cut a deal on that.' The regulator has been shown to have a lack of resources, yet the government is cutting funding to the banking and financial services regulator. You'd think even the boneheads in the government who put the budget together would realise this is not the time to cut the funding to ASIC.


But while they are on a roll, from the end of this year the budget also ends funding for the Serious Financial Crime Taskforce—just as the banking royal commission winds up! It's going to be magic: 'We'll have an election by then; we can go back to normal programming.' This is a task force consisting of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police, ASIC and others investigating the most serious crimes in the financial sector. They've admitted they have 22 ongoing matters. They won't be wrapped up by the end of the year. Who knows what will happen? The government should send a leadership signal and a cultural signal to this sector right now that this stuff will not be tolerated and there is going to be  a strong cop on the beat rather than cutting funding to ASIC and winding up the task force that is actually trying to do something about it.


It comes amidst $205 million of cuts to the Australian Federal Police. Apparently the Prime Minister says that's not the case, yet you've got the Federal Police saying it is. I don't know who is lying now. We'll let the public work that out. There have been 4,000 staff cut from the ATO since this government was elected five long years ago, many of which, we have proven, have been replaced with short-term labour-hire contractors that actually cost more. This is not a cost-saving measure; it's an ideological attack because of those staff caps. And there has been no support for a national integrity commission.


Labor has committed to introduce a national integrity commission ensuring that the public sector, MPs and the Governor-General—everyone in the public sector—are subject to proper scrutiny. The Attorney-General finally fessed up last week in a letter he wrote back—an outbreak of honesty moment. He said, 'The government believes there is no persuasive evidence that we need this.' He used to say that he wasn't close minded. Now he says 'no persuasive evidence', so we presume he's now closed his mind. It's suggested by that letter that the government will therefore fall well short of any anticorruption body with broad-ranging powers. It's important to note that anticorruption bodies are very different from fighting crime: they're proactive, they're investigative, they have compulsion and they provide a much stronger effect on the system of deterrence, as we've seen in the states and territories. Admittedly, there are flaws in some of the state and territory bodies, but I don't think anyone in the real world, in the general public, would say that they have not served an important purpose overall in flushing out corruption in the public sector and setting a better culture in deterrence. I think the case has been established on its merits and made quite thoughtfully by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General. I also think it's a step—it's not sufficient but perhaps a necessary step—to starting to rebuild some of the public trust which has been lost in a very damaging way between citizens, those elected to serve them and the public sector more broadly.


This is an issue for which I'd encourage the Liberal backbench to focus for once on something useful. I don't mean the member for Bennelong; I think his comments on cities, affordable housing and so on are laudable. But, instead of advocating for the watering down of legislation so the priority would be to let people say more racist stuff by weakening the Racial Discrimination Act or for burning coal—the Monash Forum shamefully appropriating the name of Sir General John Monash for purposes against the wishes of his family: burn coal, burn coal—perhaps this is something the Liberal backbench can focus on. Otherwise, Australians can rightfully ask, 'What have you got to hide?'

"Morton, Ben, MP",LP,2018-05-29,"



Mr MORTON
 (Tangney) (12:45):  As I said in my maiden speech and as I've said in many contributions since then, I'm in parliament to support those hardworking Australians that want to apply their effort and succeed. That's because I want to help build an Australia that empowers people, an Australia that rewards individual and community effort. I'm proud to be part of this government making sure that it manages taxpayers' money in a very disciplined way. This government has kept a tight rein on spending, which is forecast to grow by only 1.9 per cent, the lowest level of spending growth of any government in the last 50 years and half of the four per cent we inherited from Labor. The underlying catch balance is the best position we've seen since the Howard government's final budget. The deficit has halved in the past two years. The budget returns to balance in 2019-20, and since the 2016 election this government has legislated over $41 billion of budget repair measures.


With the financial leadership of the Prime Minister, Treasurer and Minister for Finance, the Australian economy continues to strengthen. Jobs are being created and investment is rising. Responsible economic management also has retained Australia's AAA credit rating. For the first time in a decade, the government is not borrowing to pay for essential services. The essentials Australians rely on, like Medicare, PBS medicines, the NDIS, school funding and hospital funding are all being funded sustainably. The government is funding priority nation-building infrastructure that busts congestion and makes our roads and communities safer. I'll have some more to say in relation to those important projects that affect my own electorate of Tangney.


But a balanced budget enables a government to provide responsible tax relief that backs businesses to invest and create jobs. The government has already legislated tax relief for Australian businesses with a turnover of under $50 million, taking their rates from 30 per cent to 27.5 per cent and eventually to 25 per cent. That's relief for around 3.3 million small and medium businesses, employing about 6.8 million Australians. We, the government, remain absolutely committed to extending tax relief to all businesses.


Small businesses in my electorate and around the nation have also benefited from the extension of the $20,000 instant asset write-off. Simpler BAS reporting is saving around 2.7 million small businesses an average of $590 a year. This government is backing businesses to invest and to create jobs.


But a balanced budget also enables the government to provide responsible tax relief to encourage hardworking Australians. There can be no doubt that this government believes in lower taxes: lower taxes for businesses and lower taxes for individuals who work hard do provide for themselves and their families. Taxpayers always know how to in spend their own money better than the big government. Australians need to feel confident that they can take on additional work, work extra hours and seek promotion knowing that their extra work will be rewarded in extra income and doesn't just go to the government in higher taxes.


The affordable plan of income tax relief passed by the House just a few days ago is proof that this government is backing those hardworking Australians. This is a plan that makes sure we give people immediate tax relief, that addresses bracket creep so people don't move into higher tax brackets and that makes our tax system fairer and simpler by removing altogether the 37 per cent marginal rate of tax. Importantly, this government's personal income tax plan will mean that 94 per cent of Australians will never pay more than 32.5 per cent as a marginal tax rate. Australians will know they can take on those extra hours, accept a promotion or start a business and do better for themselves, and be rewarded for that effort. This plan for income tax relief will fairly leave more of Australians' hard-earned income in their own pockets.


The alternative under Labor is always higher taxes. Labor describe lower taxes as a 'handout' or a 'giveaway' and quite shamelessly committed to $220 billion of higher taxes, not to mention Labor's $5 billion-a-year assault on the savings of self-funded retirees and older Australians. Labor are refusing to agree to all three stages and the full tax relief of $143.95 billion that is set out in this government's income tax plan. Labor's message to Australia is they want more of your hard-earned money to bank bracket creep and higher taxes because they can spend it better than you. Liberal governments will always look for ways to reduce the burden of tax on workers, families and businesses. Labor will always do the opposite. 


Some of the best news around the budget is the creation of full-time jobs. One million jobs have been created since the coalition government was elected in 2013. One of the positive things about record jobs growth is the number of people who are getting off welfare and starting to earn a wage. Strengthening the economy along with the government's action to ensure welfare is well targeted have resulted in welfare dependency for working-age Australians falling to its lowest level in 25 years. In the three years to June 2017, the numbers of working-age Australians on income support fell by 140,000 people to 2.4 million. This represents a reduction of around $23 billion in future lifetime costs to the welfare system and the taxpayers that fund it.


However, welfare is still the largest component of government spending, with $176 billion estimated to be spent in the 2018-19 year. I'm the first to say that it's important that we have a strong safety net to support all Australians. The system must support our most vulnerable and those who are genuine in their need. But working-age welfare should not be taken for granted. As chair of the government's social services policy committee, I was pleased to work with Minister Porter and Minister Tudge, the former social services and human services ministers, and now Minister Tehan and Minister Keenan in these ministerial roles. They are dynamic ministers who are willing to trying new initiatives to get more Australians off welfare and into work, like the Cashless Debit Card. I remind members that this card doesn't change the amount of Centrelink a person receives but restricts their ability to purchase alcohol, drugs or use that money for gambling. This card makes lives better, and we are finding that in the trial communities. I personally visited Kununurra and Wyndham to see the results for myself and to talk with the individuals in those communities. The Goldfields in WA, Ceduna in South Australia and, hopefully, soon Bundaberg and Hervey Bay will benefit from this card.


Another initiative, the two-year trial of drug testing for recipients of Newstart and youth allowance, is compassionate and will make sure that people who have drug problems and need support get the treatment they need to beat their drug addiction, because there will be additional support services funded with these trials. The new jobseeker payment will replace seven existing payments making our complex welfare system simpler. It will make clear what this payment is for, and assistance will always be there to help people into work. I always look for the best ways to support people on welfare, particularly where welfare dependency exists alongside harm relating to drug and alcohol abuse. This budget strengthens the government's commitment to jobseekers and people supported by the safety net as well as the taxpayers who make sure Australia is able to provide our generous welfare system.


While supporting taxpayers and jobseekers, the budget also delivers important local infrastructure and sport programs in my community. I was very pleased to see greater investment in sporting club infrastructure because participation in sport is vital for health and wellbeing and something that I'm very passionate about. Eighty-one per cent of Australian children are not meeting the recommended level of activity to stay healthy. One-quarter of children are overweight or obese. Encouraging young Australians to get more active is critical. This budget delivers $29.7 million for the sports infrastructure grants program. Local sporting clubs will share in grants of up to $500,000 for small- to medium-scale building projects or for improvements to existing and ageing facilities. This funding is the opportunity for clubs to kickstart their new builds or renovations and consider projects that they might not otherwise have been able to afford.


Our young athletes train so hard. Mums and dads volunteer a lot of their time managing teams, coaching, refereeing, doing rosters and running the canteen. But they need help with the big construction costs of courts, clubrooms, changerooms, new toilets and associated infrastructure. Smaller, Stronger Communities infrastructure grants are already having a huge impact in my community. With a team effort between federal grants, contributions from the clubs and local fundraising, we have upgraded clubrooms, renovated toilets and change rooms, purchased equipment for junior sporting clubs, and installed lighting, scoreboards, fences, new goals and even starting blocks for a pool. I'm glad to see the Stronger Communities program continue in this budget, because Stronger Communities and local sports infrastructure grants will kickstart many more builds and renovations in the electorate of Tangney and will help our clubs get more kids out there on the ovals and on the courts playing weekly team sport, as we hope they should.




Mr ALEXANDER:
  And tennis.




Mr MORTON:
  And tennis—from the member for Bennelong. The Willetton basketball stadium is very important to me. I'm sure many members are aware of the updates I've given to this House in relation to funding. There were plenty of nay-sayers along the journey, but there it is: $5.5 million of federal funding for the expansion of the Willetton basketball stadium, and that represents 50 per cent of the stadium expansion project. It was a special day when we made that announcement. There was a lot of excitement. This will mean four new indoor courts, new change rooms, meeting rooms, halls, offices and space for supporting health and allied health facilities. Those kids who are on the waiting list—150 or more of them—will now have an opportunity to play team sport that wasn't there because the infrastructure wasn't sufficient. I'm so pleased that we've been able to assist the Willetton basketball stadium. This is an association with over 300 teams and over 3,500 players, and it is supported by about 1,100 volunteers. 


The federal funding is not the only funding. $2.2 million has been provided by the City of Canning and $1.5 million has been provided by the state government. Construction will get underway in the second half of this calendar year. The Local Sporting Champions grants are important, and I'm very pleased that there is an expansion of these grants in the budget. This is something that I've been campaigning for as a Western Australian member of parliament. There is a 56 per cent increase to this important program. That represents, on the existing funding models, 3,000 additional young athletes across Australia who will be able to receive federal government grants to support their attendance at their international or national competitions. 


In Tangney, it's very popular. One of the recent rounds saw 53 applications for 22 grants. My job is to work with the minister to ensure that we can redirect some of that funding to make sure that it recognises the effort and energy that families go to to access these grants. When there is a sporting event in Sydney, for example, it costs somebody more to travel to that event if they're travelling from Perth or Cairns than if they were travelling from Canberra. This grants program should recognise those additional costs, and I'm sure many of the regional members of parliament in this House will support me in having that grant program readjusted to recognise those differences. 


But what is really important for my electorate, the showcase, the show-stopper in the budget, is the funding there for Roe 8 and Roe 9. There is funding for infrastructure in this budget. There is actually $2.8 billion in new infrastructure funding for WA. As part of this budget, the government is working to reduce congestion to keep our roads safe and to help freight and people move from point A to point B. But what's important for my electorate is the $1.2 billion that is there in black and white, waiting on the state government to access those funds. Isn't it amazing? You have a situation where the federal government has allocated $1.2 billion worth of funding to a very important road project, yet the state government is refusing to access those funds. That would take 70,000-odd cars a day off Leach Highway in my electorate and over 7,000 trucks a day trying to access Fremantle port. This is also very important to the people of Fremantle, who are facing a by-election. They go into the by-election uncertain of whether or not federal Labor will keep that money there available for a future state government to construct the Roe 8 and Roe 9 projects.


This budget, in whole, continues this government's plan for a stronger economy. The government is funding priority nation-building infrastructure and guaranteeing essential services in a sustainable way. The funding's there to support our local community. I'm pleased to be part of a coalition government that's not only making important investments in our country but also managing taxpayers' money in a very disciplined way.

"McGowan, Cathy, MP",IND,2018-05-29,"



Ms McGOWAN
 (Indi) (13:00):  Colleagues, I rise today to speak about the 2018-19 budget, and in doing so will report on the findings of the Indi budget survey and the budget breakfasts, the impact of the budget on my community, and a call to action to do better in engaging and listening to regional community. I'd also like to welcome into the parliament colleagues and constituents from my electorate. Thank you very much for coming and giving us your time.


Over the past three weeks, 998 people answered my call to tell me what they thought of the budget—'What does it mean to you?'—through online surveys, postcards, listening posts, social media, Facebook, Twitter, emails, letters, supermarket conversations and focus groups. In Mansfield, Wangaratta, Wodonga and Benalla, 134 young people met with me, before they headed to school, university, TAFE and work, to give me their opinions. Thank you, Susila, Kirstin, Amanda, Laura, Jenny, Sal, Lana and Sheridan, for bringing together young people from your communities and your schools. And a special call-out to the schools: FCJ College Benalla, Benalla P-12 College, Mansfield Steiner School, Mansfield Secondary College, Galen Catholic College, Beechworth Secondary College, Mount Beauty Secondary College, Cathedral College Wangaratta, Wangaratta High School, Wodonga TAFE, Catholic College Wodonga, Wodonga Senior Secondary College, Wodonga Middle Years College, Victory Lutheran College and Tallangatta Secondary College.


Across my electorate, every local government was represented and responses were received from over 60 townships. Almost half of the respondents, 49.9 per cent, indicated they were female, 48.7 per cent were male, and 1.34 per cent chose not to identify. Most encouragingly, 19 per cent of the surveys were completed by those aged under 25. To these young people, I say thank you. Thank you for turning up, for having a voice and for making a very clear statement that young people are engaged in politics—they do care, they have a voice and they know that they're part of the solution.


So, to the findings of this mammoth exercise. There were five main concerns. In priority order, they were taxation, education and training, health and aged care, renewable energy and climate change, and social security services. On taxation: overwhelmingly, people were concerned that the tax measures were unfair and would lead to increased inequality. Tax reform, corporate tax or concerns with tax breaks for banks were listed by 23.6 per cent of people as their most important issue, and another 3.3 per cent listed increasing inequality stemming from tax changes as their biggest concern. Research shows that these concerns reflect the income and company turnover rates in Indi. 71.3 per cent of residents in my electorate earn below $52,000, and only six companies—two per cent—have a turnover of more than $50 million. What did my constituents tell me about taxes? One constituent wrote:


There should be no tax concessions for big business. This money can be better spent on education and hospitals/medicine and infrastructure. Low to middle income earners need relief not people earning over 100K. Small business needs the relief; it is hard enough to employ people as it is, so help is needed here - you cannot guarantee that big business such as the banks won't just pass it onto shareholders and they will be the only ones to benefit.


Another constituent, from Mount Beauty, said:


Flattening out our progressive tax rate so that minimum wage earners pay the same rate of tax as high-income earners up to $200,000 is patently unfair. This proposed change will lock in further inequality in the system for decades to come and this is at a time when income inequality is more pronounced than at any other time in living memory.


The second priority is education and training. A lack of funding in the budget for education and training closely followed taxation as a key concern. Young people in particular spoke of a lack of access for people wanting to pursue further training or tertiary education in regional Australia. And for those who want to travel for university or TAFE, there are financial barriers. Nearly one-quarter—23.7 per cent of respondents—listed education and training as the second-most-important issue. Eighty-one per cent of respondents ranked education and training as very important, and this was more than any other issue.


These survey results, as you would know from rural and regional Australia, Deputy Speaker Gee, are no surprise. Regional students remain under-represented in higher education institutions. Only 12.7 per cent are from inner regional areas and 12.5 per cent are from outer regional areas. The impact of this is that only six per cent of Indi residents have a tertiary degree, almost three times lower than the state average of 17.8 per cent, so we're starting way behind the eight ball. To quote from the survey:


Country students are at a distinct disadvantage compared to city students who can stay living at home. Not all courses are available in the country. Much higher living costs, stresses, need to work longer hours and therefore, less time to study. Some 'flow on' effects from this can be seen in less Medical specialists in the country areas.


I have another quote from Wodonga:


The quality of education I receive is important as it shapes my future and opportunities and as such, the government should ensure that every student should receive a world-class standard of education to maximise opportunities and help give students a future they are proud of.


One-fifth, or 20.24 per cent, of respondents listed health and aged care as their highest concern or second-most-important issue. Concerns centred on a lack of access and funding, specifically for aged and mental health care. A constituent from Wodonga says on mental health:


Such a common thing that occurs all the time, all around the world, to almost everyone and there needs to be awareness to the unavoidable issues in today's society that everyone faces at some point in his or her lives.


Sadly, the high rate of suicide in rural and regional Australia supports these words. As the Centre for Rural and Remote Mental Health reported in April 2017:


In every state in Australia, the rate of suicide among those who live outside the greater capital cities is higher than that for residents that live within them, and the rate has risen much higher in rural areas over the period 2011-2015.


Caring for older people in our community with dignity and compassion is a significant issue for the 39 aged-care facilities in Indi. We know this, and again I quote:


Due to the cutbacks the government have implemented, many, particularly smaller facilities are operating at a loss or have very little financial buffer.


A constituent from Wodonga, who replied to the online survey, said:


We need to allow for equitable living for people with disabilities. This means affordable medication, access to services and well-funded mental health services. My clients need a paediatric appointment and assessment to access support funding and NDIS. But they can't afford a paediatrician appointment and are stuck.


While the pension and increase in the Newstart allowance and access to youth allowance for students moving to the city were core concerns, the overarching concern that the budget will lead to increased inequality and higher reliance on social security services is driven, in part, by personal circumstance. Low levels of personal and household income, as well as high rates of underemployment, all contribute to inequality.


In Indi, 92 per cent of residents earn below $91,000, and the average household income is $1,126. That's approximately 22 per cent lower than the national average. The rate of part-time workers is 33.6 per cent, which is higher than the national average of 32.4 per cent. So this speaks to a level of poverty. Dare I say, in my community, lack of money is certainly an inhibiter to advancement, but we are wealthy in so many other ways. The point I'm trying to make about these statistics is that my community actually understands how important taxation is—how important it is to actually understand that in rural and regional Australia, one size does not fit all. I'm not actually saying that poverty or low incomes lead to greater lack of community; it just expresses the inequality that my community recognises.


A constituent from Chiltern raised the decision not to increase the Newstart allowance as her single most important issue. She says:


It is impossible for those on it to live a satisfactory life—creates a class of people in perpetual poverty—makes one sad to be an Australian—that we treat people this way.


Another constituent, from Beechworth, said:


I am expected to live on approximately $700 a fortnight and actively job search. I work as a casual cleaner, but the government lets me have the first $100 then takes 50c in the $ off me! Some people can't even find menial work, I was lucky, so I have no idea how they manage to pay their rent. This is why homelessness is such an issue.


I understand these issues are not specific to only my community or only rural and regional Australia. But, for me, the impact of the government's health, taxation and education policies very often have a disproportional impact on regional Australia.


If I could reflect on the words of the Treasurer on budget night, he told us that the budget was about: 'A stronger economy. More jobs. Guaranteeing essential services. The Government living within its means.' He also told us Australians wanted to answer these three questions: '""What have you'—being the government—'achieved? What are you going to do now? What does it mean for me?""' Let me say that again: 'What does it mean for me?' It struck me that these questions are part of the problem. The answer to having a common wealth and strong, resilient communities in Australia doesn't only lie with government; it also lies with the community. Strong and resilient communities don't exist because of government programs only, but also because of community leadership, collaboration and a real and genuine commitment to make things better.


Every year that I've been in parliament, I've returned to my community post-budget for feedback, for advice and for solutions. This is how I investigate, how I measure and how I report back to parliament. But this process of engagement, community ownership and responsibility doesn't end with my actions. The next step I do is public the Indi budget report that will report back to my community, to the Prime Minister and to the leaders in this place on what I've heard. I also encourage communities to stand up and fight for their solutions. We call this type of engagement and responsibility the Indi way.


Clearly, it's not the only way. There are mechanisms and frameworks in place to help the government better understand the impact of decisions on rural and regional Australia and to work across portfolios to develop solutions that meet the needs of our communities. One such mechanism is the Regional Ministerial Taskforce. It was established by the government in 2017. We were told that a cross-portfolio task force was the best way to implement good regional policy. It was made up of cabinet ministers, and it would focus on closing the gap between the bush and the city in terms of health, education and infrastructure. But 14 months after it was established, we've yet to see a single report. I suspect its omission from Ministers McCormack and McVeigh's 2018 ministerial budget statement is a sign that we never will. How disappointing. There is nothing in this report, Regional Australia—a stronger economy delivering stronger regions, that tells us that the government has a plan or strategy for regional Australia. There is nothing in this that tells me that the government actually understands the statistics that I have brought to this parliament today.


Another technique that's available to the government is regional impact statements. They first appeared in 1988 as part of the cabinet process, and were designed to mitigate against negative impact to rural Australians. My concern is that this process of regional impact statement linked to cabinet papers is now falling short of the desired outcome. Consequently, I've called on the Australian National Audit Office to investigate.


In closing, Deputy Speaker, colleagues and members of my community, I say to those in my community: there is an absence of government solutions, an absence of recognition that one size does not fit all. But I say to my community: keep going, keep turning up, have your say, use your voice, form a group, create your own solutions and use your members of parliament to represent your concerns in parliament. And I say in closing to the government that the unit of measurement should not be: will someone be worse off? The unit of measurement should be: where is the benefit; where is the opportunity; and how can we support our communities to reach their potential?

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (13:15):  Melbourne's population is growing by more than 2,400 people a week. Over the past year, more than 125,000 new people have called Melbourne home. That's more than saw the Western Bulldogs win the flag at the MCG in 2016. This made Melbourne the fastest-growing city in Australia, at 2.7 per cent, ahead of both Brisbane and Sydney, on two per cent each. And the fastest-growing area in the fastest-growing city in the country is the place that I represent, Melbourne's west. Three hundred and fifty-six thousand more people lived in Melbourne's west in 2016 than did in 1996. That's more than 17,000 new people each year, nearly 1,500 a month, every year, for 20 years. This growth is set to continue.


Our city is currently experiencing growing pains as a result, and it will only get worse without appropriate infrastructure investments in response. If you're an average driver in Melbourne's west, you have a 30 per cent chance of getting stuck in heavy traffic today. Infrastructure Australia estimates that traffic jams rob Melbourne of $3 billion each year. Without proper infrastructure investments, by 2031, Melbourne is set to be $9 billion a year poorer, every year.


To cope with this growth, we need to do things differently, to get smarter about the way that we do infrastructure investment. I've spoken a lot in this place about the need for better public transport infrastructure to cope with this demand in urban areas, but we also need to make investments in active transport infrastructure to reduce pressure on our roads and public transport networks during peak periods.


Good active transport infrastructure is about making it easier for anyone to choose to safely cycle or walk to work, school, TAFE, uni or whatever. It won't be the right option for every person for every trip, but more than one in two vehicle trips in Melbourne today are less than six kilometres in distance. With the right infrastructure, a trip like this would take just over 20 minutes on a bike. Many of these trips could be made on bikes, and every trip that is made on a bike frees up capacity on our roads and our public transport networks. That's why this is a serious, mainstream infrastructure issue that affects everyone in Melbourne and in Melbourne's west in particular.


It's not only about congestion either. Numerous studies show that cycling and increasing walkability decrease the risk of heart disease, cancer and general causes of death in our community, meaning that people live healthier and longer lives. Active transport also reduces pollution and increases an area's livability.


Despite these benefits, Melbourne's west has a relatively low active transport utilisation rate. This is because we don't have the same infrastructure as the rest of Melbourne. Our cyclists and our pedestrians are forced to compete with thousands of truck movements a day on our residential streets. In Brunswick, nearly one in five people cycle to work. In Footscray, it's just one in 20. Why do people cycle at nearly four times the rate in Brunswick, despite our suburbs being the same distance from the city? Why do people cycle at nearly three times the rate in Thornbury as in Newport, two suburbs of similar distance from the CBD? The answer is in infrastructure. People don't feel safe cycling without the right bike paths and barriers. Melbourne's west is still mourning the death of Arzu Baglar, who was tragically struck and killed by a truck whilst cycling to a friend's house in my electorate.


We need investment that increases bike safety and encourages more people to cycle. Just last month, Infrastructure Victoria's report showed that, in Sunshine alone in my electorate, there were around 20,000 daily trips that could happen through cycling or walking. We need federal government leadership to turn these potential active transport journeys into actual active transport journeys. However, this Abbott-Turnbull government doesn't believe in public transport and doesn't believe in active transport. We know this from its budget priorities. In this budget there is not a single dollar for active transport infrastructure—zip, nada, zero. A Shorten Labor government will make investment in cycling a mainstream infrastructure priority and find room in the budget for this infrastructure for Melbourne's west.


I thank everyone in my community who has contacted me about the latest scandalous cruelty against sheep on live export ships, revealed on 60 Minutes. The shocking footage broadcast on 60 Minutes is just the latest in a long line of similar incidents. Labor has been looking seriously at this problem for some time now. As the Leader of the Opposition said two weeks ago, the industry has had plenty of chances to clean up its act, and it's failed. The government has had plenty of chances to properly regulate, and it's failed—indeed, it's actively made things worse. This cruelty is the legacy of the member for New England's period as agriculture minister and the Prime Minister's failure to hold his Deputy Prime Minister accountable for his own portfolio. The Abbott-Turnbull government abolished Labor's Inspector General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. It abolished the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee. It defunded the Australian Animal Welfare Strategy. And it abolished the Office of Animal Welfare in the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. The Abbott-Turnbull government slashed and burned regulatory oversight in this industry, which allowed the scandalous cruelties that we have seen to occur. That's why Labor announced that we will work with all those involved in the industry to plan for a future that doesn't rely on live sheep exports. The Turnbull government should be doing this right now.


Labor has been clear from the start that we don't think the inquiry that was initiated by the Minister for Agriculture into the live sheep trade during the northern summer would ever find that the trade would be sustainable in the long-term. The industry itself has conceded that it's not possible to guarantee that there will be no future events like those we saw on 60 Minutes. This is why Labor is committed to working with industry to plan for a future that doesn't rely on live sheep exports. The government should be doing the same. A transition plan would take a number of years but should take nothing like a decade. Labor will work with farmers, unions and business to develop a sustainable red-meat industry plan to assist sheep farmers during this transition. Labor's plan will lift farmer profits and add more value here in Australia to create more jobs in Australia—in fact, to create more jobs right along the supply chain. I thank everyone in my community who has contacted me on this issue for their advocacy and for the role that they have played in driving change for the better in our democracy.


One area of the government's budget that hasn't got much media coverage but deserves more is the budget's savage cuts to Australia's foreign aid budget. This budget cut another $140 million in aid from the Australian aid budget. The Abbott-Turnbull government has now slashed well over $11 billion from the Australian aid budget. The Lowy Institute calculates that since the member for Warringah became Prime Minister Australia's aid budget has been cut by a third. By some estimates, Australia is down to giving just 19 cents in every $100 of its national income in foreign aid. Australians think of ourselves as good global citizens with a good reputation overseas, but with these aid cuts we damage our credibility and our national reputation.


But it's the world's poor who are really hurt by these cuts. After the second round of aid cuts in 2015, Foreign Minister Bishop promised that there would be no more cuts to aid. We now know that she misled the poorest people in the world. In the budget papers, the Treasurer and the foreign minister heaped further fictions onto this deception. Page 103 of Budget Paper No. 2, under the title 'Maintaining the level of official development assistance', shows cuts of more than $140 million. Apparently, cutting Australian aid by $10 million, by $10 million, by $10 million and by $110 million in each of the next few years is maintaining the level of foreign aid. The real loser here, however, is not the government's credibility but, instead, some of the poorest people in the world. Foreign aid is one of the few areas where the decisions made in this place directly save people's lives. I've visited a women's refuge in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea and seen for myself the transformative impact of Australian aid. Seven in 10 women in Papua New Guinea suffer violence at the hands of men. Australian aid is making a difference to these people's lives. We support women's refuges, we support gender education and we support programs to change women's prospects in that society. These are the people who will suffer from these budget cuts. In his first speech to parliament, the Treasurer said that foreign aid was 'the Australian thing to do'. We don't get more un-Australian than these cuts. A Shorten Labor government will rebuild and grow the Australian aid program.


I want to talk in this debate a little bit about the shameful way that politics in Australia has been criminalised under the Abbott-Turnbull government and the way that institutions of our democracy are used to pursue criminal ends against participants in our political system. This trend started with the political stunt of the trade union royal commission. For 189 days, that royal commission wasted more than $40 million of taxpayers' money pursuing the government's political opponents, including the Leader of the Opposition. We know that it was a stunt because of the way that the long list of referrals from the commission have either collapsed or amounted to nothing. Apart from $46 million wasted, political opponents put in the dock and innocent families terrorised, what have we got from this exercise? There's been only one conviction resulting in a suspended sentence.


Recently, charges brought against Mr Setka and Mr Reardon from the CFMEU were sensationally dropped by the Director of Public Prosecutions. What made this even more spectacular was that they were dropped before the DPP had even finished calling evidence at a committal hearing. The result, after three years of legal battles, showed the anti-union royal commission was simply a figleaf for a political witch-hunt. The saga featured royal commissioners and Boral executives cosying up in court, and workplace bargaining being treated as a criminal matter. We saw a staged arrest of senior union officials in front of their distressed families and children. We've heard former Prime Minister Abbott and the former employment minister, Senator Abetz, were involved in the orchestration of these charges, conspiring with Boral accusers to smear political enemies. The co-opting of the Australian Federal Police by the Turnbull government's Registered Organisations Commission, stinks of hijacking the criminal justice system to attack political opponents. We all know the wrong person resigned in Minister Cash's office over the disgraceful leaks on the AFP's raid. The Abbott-Turnbull government cannot hide its attempts to criminalise politics behind a big whiteboard forever. Our democracy suffers when the institutions that the public relies on, institutions that are crucial for public faith in our democracy are weaponised and trashed in the name of short-term political tactics.


The contrast in this regard could not be sharper with the way that the Abbott-Turnbull government has dealt with the scandals in the Australian banking sector. For 600 days, Prime Minister Turnbull refused calls from across Australian society, including from the opposition, to establish a royal commission into activities in the Australian financial services sector, 600 days in which evidence heard by the royal commission showed that people were being fed dodgy financial advice, 600 days in which dead people were being charged fees for services that they never received, and 600 days in which one person, at least, lost a quarter of their super, and small businesses were crushed. At every point, Prime Minister Turnbull and the Treasurer ran a protection racket for the big banks on this issue. Today, they refuse to even say sorry to the thousands of Australians ripped off during the time that they rubbished the royal commission, calling it a 'populist whinge', a 'talk-fest', a 'thought bubble' and, when they were finally forced to admit the inevitable and establish a royal commission, 'regrettable'. Even today, the only recognition they can give to their delays in initiating the royal commission is to call it a 'political mistake'. They won't take accountability for the Australian consumers that suffered from this delay; all they would admit to is the political price that they themselves have paid.


After the evidence that we have heard before the banking royal commission, what is the government's response? It wants to reward the big banks of Australia for their behaviour with a $17 billion tax cut. This government is so out of touch; it's from another planet. Let's also compare the pair when it comes to the Abbott-Turnbull government's treatment of political opponents and the big end of town. After the trade union royal commission, union officials were arrested on criminal charges in front of their families—criminal charges, we have found, that were not sustainable in a court of law. Instead of being arrested, for those in a range of other sectors in the big end of town, accountability has not been delivered. We see this in the endemic wage theft in Australian workplaces. In workplaces across the country, temporary migrant workers are being exploited in the most reprehensible terms. We see frequent evidence of employers doctoring pay slips, of forging documents to disguise the theft of wages from everyday Australians. Yet, in these instances, we don't see police raids; we don't see executives arrested in front of their family. Indeed, when Fair Work took action against Caltex for the systemic wage theft occurring in their franchises, the time for the raids against Caltex was negotiated in advance with the Fair Work Commission.


This is a government that's hard on workers' advocates and soft on companies that steal the wages of Australians. Instead of fixating on its political opponents, the government has been asleep at the wheel on wage theft. The compensation bill for wage theft at the 7-Eleven franchising network has ticked over $110 million. Already wage theft claims have hit some of the biggest companies—Pizza Hut, Woolworths, Myer, Dominos, Coles, Caltex, Spotless and other cafe and farming businesses. This is a government that will trample the criminal justice system to get to its political enemies while turning a blind eye to people who are stealing from Australian workers.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton) (16:01):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-19 and outline Labor's concerns in relation to the central plank of the government's plan to provide $80 billion by way of tax cuts to large corporations in the main. If you look at the breakdown of the $80 billion, well in excess of $75 billion will go to the very large corporations, many of which are multinational companies, and the big banks. Having calculated the proportion of money that would be provided by way of tax cuts, we know that that would ensure the big banks would receive $17 billion in tax cuts. It just so happens that that $17 billion shortfall, which we'd like to see go to schools, instead will be provided to those four banks.


For that reason, we absolutely reject the priorities and the values of the Prime Minister and this government in terms of their focus on favouring those corporations in lieu of providing decent health and decent education in this nation—cuts to hospitals, cuts to schools and largesse to mates of the Prime Minister. He's always felt most comfortable in the boardrooms of Australia, not the workplaces. Being a former merchant banker, the Prime Minister would be on intimate terms with many of the chief executives of these banks and businesses. Clearly he needs to deliver to them, as he would see it. He argues that this is in keeping with trickle down economic theory—that is, provide the biggest tax cuts to big business by cutting funding to social services and it will trickle down, like some form of osmosis, to middle- and working-class families.


This economic theory has been discredited by every eminent economist across the world. It was rejected when it was introduced by the Reagan administration. It led to massive government debt because they did not fund the tax cuts. It impoverished services in health and education. We've seen that country, a great nation, now clearly not looking after its middle class. The middle class has been hollowed out. Real wages have fallen in very significant terms in the United States of America. And the rot started with the introduction of trickle down economic theory—propounded then by someone who was held to know something about economics, Milton Friedman. Well, his theory now has been discredited.


Indeed, it is that theory that the current President of the United States and the now Prime Minister of Australia want to do, which is to provide unfunded corporate tax cuts to big business, to multinational companies. Imagine this: we already know, given the amount of money that will be provided to multinational companies, that it immediately leaves our shores. That much is clear. Why should it be the case that the banks in this country receives such largesse given their conduct over the last number of years?


The royal commission has just started its examination of that industry, and the revelations, quite frankly, are astonishing. The victims of decisions by banks number into the thousands, if not tens and hundreds of thousands of people. Whether it be just a complete disregard for services, whether it's undermining insurance and not treating customers of insurance properly or whether it's robbing them by increasing fees without notice, there's a litany of sins by the banks, and yet this government, led by this former merchant banker, the Prime Minister, has sought to remove or transfer what should be going to hospitals and schools, to banks. That is quite shameful, and that's why we cannot abide that view. 


At the same time all of this is happening, we're having a debate around providing largesse to the banks. We have, on 1 July this year, the second tranche of penalty-rate cuts taking effect. We saw the cuts to 700,000 workers' wages on 1 July last year. Retail and hospitality workers—some of the hardest-working, lowest-paid workers in this nation, who suffered real losses as a result—will now see on1 July this year, in just over a month, a further cut to their wages. As a result, the acute pressure on them to deal with cost-of-living pressures will be getting greater and greater and yet, of course, the Prime Minister turns his back on those workers. He has no empathy for those workers, no empathy for any working people in this country.


You see, the Prime Minister really hasn't ever financially struggled. You'd think the leader of this nation would have regard for its people. You'd think the leader of this nation—whatever his background—would actually take a keen interest in the needs and aspirations of working people. But not this Prime Minister. This Prime Minister's values are written in the budget papers. This Prime Minister's values are: look after the big end of town and turn your back on hardworking Australians. This Prime Minister has no empathy or concern or regard for the hardworking Australians that are in workplaces throughout this land and that's why he supports cuts to penalty rates, supports $80 billion worth of cuts to big business and, at the same time, cuts to health and education at a time when wage growth is at its lowest in more than 20 years. We're supposed to cop this. 


Labor will not stand for this approach. Labor do not support and will never support such a remarkable largesse to big business. We look after middle-class and working-class families in this country. The backbone of our economy is working people—yes, working in businesses—and businesses too. But it doesn't mean you turn your back on working people, which has occurred here, and it's written in the budget for all to see.


As I was saying, on 1 July this year, there will be cuts to those 700,000 workers' wages at a time of low wage growth. There are now more applications being put forward to the Fair Work Commission. So along with retail and hospitality workers, hairdressers and beauticians' awards are being put forward for consideration for further cuts. All of us have visited hairdressers and barbers. They're not highly paid. In fact, for the amount of training they have to do, they're quite low-paid workers. And yet they're going to get—if the application is successful—a cut in their wages because there'll be a reduced penalty. We say: where are the priorities of this government when it can provide so much to those who need so little and, at the same time, cut real wages from people that are struggling to pay the energy bill or health costs or pay for school uniforms or school fees just to make ends meet, to put food on the table, to look after their family, to pay the mortgage, to pay the rent, to put petrol in the car?


Those basic essentials are under pressure, and the government's answer is to make it harder, not make it easier. I say people can outgrow their background and a true leader is empathetic to the needs of others and doesn't have to have a lived experience, but it would appear clear to me now that the Prime Minister has no empathy. He does not understand the challenges of millions of Australian workers that are dealing with these day-to-day pressures. If he was comfortable in the boardrooms, he feels awkward in the depots, offices and other workplaces where 12 million Australians work. And for that reason he should be censured and so too should be the government for its priorities.


Labor's plan is, of course, to be fiscally responsible, not provide an unfunded tax cut to the big end of town and actually provide greater tax relief for the majority of workers. It's true to say that, when wage growth is this flat and the government has no answers, at least providing a decent tax cut is some form of relief. But we'll need to do more if we're elected, and we will do more in government about rebalancing arrangements in the workplace. There are too many people marginalised in workplaces, not willing to speak up, whether it be on getting a pay rise or, even more importantly, health and safety issues in often dangerous workplaces. It worries Labor when people are injured or die at work, particularly if they've understood the risk and haven't felt comfortable enough or supported enough to raise concerns with their employer or others.


And so we say to the government: this budget is a budget that is, at its core, unfair and looks after the top one per cent. The Prime Minister would understand that because he is the top one per cent. The Prime Minister is at the top 0.1 per cent! Clearly, when he thinks about trickle-down economics and it working, he may well be right, because there are some winners with trickle-down economics. It's the top 1 per cent. They'll benefit. We know that without question. They'll benefit because we're going to raid the Treasury, we're going to raid taxpayers' piggy bank and we're going to give it over to big banks and multinational companies and then not have a whit of understanding as to how we're going to properly fund a first-class education system, fix up the complete debacle that is the NBN, and look after the health needs of Australians, look after people in aged care—the real pressing needs that exist, that families are struggling with: looking after older parents, looking after kids in child care, trying to find places and all of the difficulties that each family confronts.


And yet everywhere you look, it doesn't matter where, there just doesn't seem to be a role for this government just to lend a helping hand. Nobody wants a hand out; they want a helping hand. They expect their government to provide that form of support. We call ourselves the country of the fair go. We like to think of ourselves as having an egalitarian spirit. Well, it has to be manifest in the policies of the nation. It has to be clear within the budget that we care about working-class and middle-class people, not just those people who are associates of the Prime Minister, who work with the Prime Minister or socialise with the Prime Minister. It's clear to me that, if anything, this budget is honest to that extent, because it reflects the values and priorities of a Prime Minister who is, effectively, an elitist and, indeed, socially unable to empathise with the concerns of the overwhelming number of Australians who are struggling.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  I think the member for Gorton is reflecting on the Prime Minister, and I think it's out of order, really.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  I don't think it is out of order, Mr Deputy Speaker Howarth, but I respect your ruling. I will say this, though: the budget will not pass in its form. If the government wants to do anything about providing tax relief, they should stop insisting on this most fanciful of notions that they're going to have some tax relief for the top end of wage earners in seven years. If they want to actually deal with tax relief for the bulk of Australian workers today, they need to negotiate with Labor and the crossbench and, in fact, they should listen to Labor and increase the tax relief for the bulk of Australian workers, which is what we're suggesting—that's what should happen here—instead of pretending that they've got some sort of plan that's so far off into the distance it's just some mythical nonsense that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are inventing to try to save their scalps.


The fact is that they should listen to us when it comes to tax relief. They should listen to Labor when it comes to properly funding health in this country, looking after kids in this country so they have a first-class education and, indeed, looking after working people. They could start by actually introducing the bill in the House that would stop the penalty rates decision dead in its tracks so we would not see further cuts in real wages to retail and hospitality workers.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr SWAN
 (Lilley) (16:16):  In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, I wish to make a few remarks about the budget and, in particular, I want to talk about tax. At the heart of this budget is what I'd call the Turnbull trickle-down trifecta—that is, massive tax cuts for the wealthy, very large tax cuts for large corporates and, of course, wage suppression for everybody else. At a time when global growth is closing in on four per cent—at least according to the latest OECD figures—in Australia, GDP growth is struggling to reach 2½ per cent. We've got the best global conditions in more than a decade, and this government is out there celebrating its enduring mediocrity. Over the last five years of Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull, real wages have flatlined.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Howarth
):  Order, member for Lilley. That's twice now you've said 'the Turnbull trickle-down trifecta' and—




Mr SWAN:
  I said 'Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull'.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You've been here since '93.




Mr SWAN:
  I said 'Mr Abbott and Mr Turnbull'; is that correct?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  You've got to refer to members by their correct title. Those are not their correct titles.



An honourable member interjecting—  




Mr SWAN:
  You can waste a bit more time if you like. Over the last five years, our two prime ministers have seen real wages flatlining. The cost of living has risen steeply, driven chiefly by health insurance, housing and energy prices, and Australians are suffering from precarious and insecure forms of work. We've got record high labour underutilisation and record levels of wage theft in our workforce. All of these things should be within the government's power to change, but not this government.


The Prime Minister gives the least to those who need it the most and the most to those who need it the least. The budget holds low- and middle-income Australians hostage to tax cuts for the top end of town while delivering $80 billion to big business, including a $17 billion gift to big banks, whose rank malpractice has been on disgusting display at the royal commission. Having been involved in a few budgets myself, I can attest that preparing budget documents means that you need to keep both eyes open: one eye on the global conditions and one on the great majority of Australians that you represent. But, looking over this year's budget, it's plain to see that the Prime Minister has kept one eye on the top end of town—high-income individuals and big companies—and the other eye entirely closed, meanwhile winking at the wealthy, who are the Liberal Party's natural constituency.


The personal income tax cuts in this budget are set to drive a steamroller right through Australia's progressive tax system. If the Turnbull government gets its way and if it's re-elected twice more, the tax cuts proposed in this budget will see someone on $41,000 a year and someone on $200,000 a year paying exactly the same marginal tax rate. Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister, and Mr Morrison, the Treasurer, have a plan to impose regressive income tax cuts. Of course, it follows the same script that we've seen with the company tax cuts farce: throw a few crumbs to the many whilst hosting a feast for the few. This government is pitching personal income tax cuts in three stages but is refusing to split the bill. It's true that Labor supports the first stage of the personal income tax cuts because it delivers tax relief for true low- and middle-income earners. Australians on low and modest incomes are struggling. Labor will always deliver whatever tax relief it can to working Australians. The only group that doesn't seem to think that low- and middle-income earners need a hand are the Australian Greens.


Relative to the rest of the Turnbull government tax heist, Labor's bigger, better and fairer tax cut would deliver faster and deeper relief to 10 million Australians because our plan doesn't hold low- and middle-income earners hostage to the top end of town. We take a much harsher view of the second and third stages of the Turnbull government's income tax cuts, which are undiluted, vintage Turnbull trickle-down economics, as I said before. The Australian National University has concluded that these measures are targeted at lower and middle-income individuals, but, by the middle of the next decade, the measures are weighted towards higher income individuals. The government are still refusing to provide year-on-year costs of their tax plan. We know that the first two stages cost $102 billion and the third stage costs $40 billion, but all of the talk and analysis about their 10-year package only serves to obscure the fact that it's the second and third stages where the big year-on-year costs come into play.


In the later stages, the income tax steamroller really clicks into gear. The 37 per cent tax bracket—currently a pillar of our progressive tax system—applying to those on $80,000 through to $180,000 is bulldozed while the 32.5 per cent threshold is lifted to $200,000, helping an earner on this salary pay the same marginal rate of tax on $200,000 while earning five times what a low-income earner would receive. According to analysis by the Australia Institute, the top 20 per cent of income earners will get 80 per cent of the benefit of this income tax demolition job and the top 10 per cent will get half of the benefit. Meanwhile, 60 per cent of taxpayers—Australians on low and modest incomes—will see no change to their situation whatsoever, apart from reading ever more blatant misreporting from the government and its Murdoch allies that people on up to $200,000 are somehow middle-income earners. This is deeply, deeply misleading.


The average full-time worker in Australia is on $84,600. An ever-increasing number of Australians aren't even getting this much, nor are they in full-time work. A report from the Centre for Future Work released today reveals that, for the first time in recorded history, fewer than half of Australian workers are in permanent, full-time paid jobs with leave entitlements. While the Turnbull government might want to pretend that the average Australian household consists of a couple earning $120,000 per year per person, the stark reality for most Australian households is that most are struggling to accumulate $120,000 between them. On top of this, we've got gross misrepresentation of wage growth. The budget forecasts wage growth of 3½ per cent a year returning immediately and continuing for 10 years. It's bizarre! It goes without saying that the government has no plan to increase workers' wages or to improve conditions to vindicate such an optimistic forecast. Future wage rises are just supposed to appear out of nowhere while the government is out there actively working to suppress wages and conditions for workers across the country. The government is saying that wages are going to grow by 14 per cent over the next four years. Given that record, I can only see it getting up to argue against itself in the Fair Work Commission.


So let's be clear: wage growth is plummeting to record depths under this government. A worker starting a job today in the Prime Minister's Australia will, if they're lucky, be on exactly the same real wage as a worker who started a job on the same day that Mr Abbott became Prime Minister. During Labor's period of government, in which we created close to one million jobs—despite the worst global recession in 80 years—wages grew faster than inflation by a considerable margin. Someone who got a job on the first day of our government would, by the time Labor left office, be enjoying a wage that outstripped inflation by 3½ per cent. For the last five years of the Abbott and Turnbull governments, real wages have been just 0.15 per cent higher than inflation. Wage growth has been 23 times slower under the Abbott-Turnbull governments than under Labor. That is a terrible record.


Of course, that's before you get to what the government are doing with their company tax cuts. What started out as a $50 billion gift to some of the largest multinationals in the world is now costed at an estimated $80 billion. Now, $80 billion is a very big big-business tax cut, one-third of which goes to just 15 companies, $17 billion of which goes to the big banks. That is what I mean when I talk about the trickle-down trifecta: tax cuts for high-income earners; tax cuts for some of the very biggest companies in the world; wage suppression for everybody else. That's the Turnbull trifecta in this budget, at the very core of this budget.


Today in the House, in the context of tax, we had some discussion about tax avoidance and tax evasion. And it is true that, courtesy of legislation put forward by Labor, we now know the extent to which many large companies are avoiding their tax responsibilities. Indeed, a third pay no tax in any one year. We also know that big, respectable companies such as BHP and Rio have been aggressively avoiding and evading their tax responsibilities in our country.


Last week in the House, I said that BHP has hit new lows of corporate behaviour. In the Queensland Supreme Court, it has sought to suppress further evidence of tax evasion on royalties payable to the Queensland government. Last week, it was revealed that BHP received an updated $320 million assessment from the Queensland government for royalties evaded. BHP's evasion of state royalty payments through its transfer-pricing activities has robbed the governments of both Queensland and Western Australia. This matter has now been settled in the Queensland Supreme Court, and there is a confidential legal agreement as to the nature of the settlement.


Fortunately, this confidential agreement can't cover up the essential facts. Firstly, the Queensland government has included a provision in its budget for a successful outcome in this case to the tune of several hundreds of millions of dollars. Secondly, the confidential agreement signed yesterday between BHP and the Queensland government leaves the Queensland budget no worse off. So we can conclude that BHP has now conceded that its transfer-pricing activity is illegal. Today's settlement has significant implications, as BHP has been for some time in dispute with the Australian tax office for more than $1 billion for the use of its Singapore marketing hub to facilitate transfer pricing.


So, along with Rio, BHP is one of Australia's biggest tax dodgers, and there are now significant questions that must be answered by the BHP board. Firstly, who is going to accept responsibility for this unethical behaviour? Secondly, what action does the board intend to take to reassure the public that this behaviour will not be repeated? Thirdly, when is BHP going to come clean and say how much it owes the Western Australian government? Fourthly, when will it settle with the Australian tax office for its outstanding billion-dollar tax bill? Directors of big Australian companies are the first to put up their hands for Australia Day honours, but, if the directors of BHP continue to hide their behaviour behind a veil of legal secrecy, the public will be entitled to conclude that our 'Big Australian' is the dishonest Australian and that they should be the last in line for public recognition.


Ensuring that tax evasion and aggressive tax minimisation are eliminated is absolutely essential to making sure that our budget and our economy are healthy, because, when people evade their tax, what they do is force up tax rates for other people—for small business, for working people—and money is ripped away from hospitals and schools. The opportunity cost of tax evasion is significant in the community. When some of Australia's most reputable and respected companies aggressively engage in the use of transfer pricing through, effectively, tax havens, they are dudding the country that has nourished them and nurtured them through their growth. This should not be tolerated any longer. It is time that corporate Australia put their hands up. When they have been responsible for such actions of profit-shifting and debt-dumping and successfully litigated and dealt with through the tax office and the courts, they should have the decency to say to the Australian people that this will not happen again. They should have the decency to put up their hand and say they got it wrong, and they should move on so that we can all work together to make our country bigger and better.

"Gosling, Luke, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (16:30):  In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, I take this opportunity to speak about something that I am very proud of: our side's plan for skills and training. Regretfully, I need to draw attention to the Turnbull government's shameful neglect of TAFE and the skills sector of our education system. In my electorate of Solomon, and in Darwin and Palmerston, the capital of Northern Australia, the cuts to Charles Darwin University are hurting this sector, I'm sad to say. But there is a light on the hill: the Labor Party and Labor leader Bill Shorten's announcement that a Labor government will scrap up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students.


Of course, this is welcome news for my electorate of Solomon. We've got major projects in the Top End. However, some of those are winding down. As some of our skilled workers leave, we need to train our own people—our young Territorians—to meet a growing skills shortage. That will happen when Labor gets on those Treasury benches and starts developing northern Australia. We're going to need skilled workers. Labor's policy will open up access to TAFE and will make it easier for young Australians and young Territorians to gain valuable skills and education. Waiving up-front TAFE fees for 100,000 students will mean that many students will be able to attend TAFE without incurring any fees.


As part of a comprehensive plan to support TAFEs, vocational education and apprenticeships across our country, we will guarantee two-thirds of government vocational education and training funding goes to TAFE to ensure that quality learning and improved job opportunities are there for Australians. As I said, for my electorate that means that organisations and education facilities like Charles Darwin University will be invested in to train young Territorians. Labor will also invest $100 million in a building TAFE for the future fund to revitalise TAFE campuses and facilities in regional and outer metropolitan areas.


It gives me no satisfaction whatsoever to say that those opposite, the Liberal-National coalition, have cut $3 billion from skills, TAFE and apprenticeships funding since they came to office in 2013, with a further $270 million cut in the last budget. They've defunded and neglected TAFE and our apprenticeships system—a system that has for many, many years provided young Australians the training that they need to have the jobs that make our country run and that have built our country. Again, $3 billion has been cut from TAFE since 2013. In this year's budget, as I said, another $270 million was cut from apprenticeship funding over the next four years. Australia now has 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees than it did when the Abbott and Turnbull governments were elected.


For TAFE and vocational education funding, the number of supported students is lower than it was a decade ago at the very time when we need more young Territorians, more young Australians, trained up for those jobs of the future. Between 2013 and 2016, the government funded hours of training delivered through TAFE collapsed by 30 per cent. In too many towns and regional centres across Australia, TAFE campuses have closed, courses have been scaled back and fees have increased.


My electorate of Solomon has seen a collapse in apprentice and trainee numbers since those opposite came to government. The number of apprentices and trainees in my electorate has declined by 30 per cent—that's three in ten fewer trainees and apprentices. It's now standing at just over 600 trainees and apprentices currently in training in my electorate. Right now, about 400 of those are at CDU and, as I mentioned, CDU has had its funding cut by a further $15 million and it's not helpful; in fact, it's shameful. It's betraying our young people, many of whom are leaving the Territory to seek opportunities elsewhere. In our electorate, the northern capital of Australia, we want them to stay. We need them to stay in Darwin and Palmerston to build our economy, to build the Territory's future and to build their own lives and families. 


I met with some of these young men and women recently. I just want to mention a couple and the great work that's being done by people like Lee Darra at Charles Darwin University. As Lee rightfully says, 'We need to get more young kids off the couch, get the computer game controllers out of their hands, and get them on the tools, get them learning how the computers in modern-day motors work, not only so that they can find new jobs in the growing STEM sector, but also for the more advanced jobs in automotive engineering that there are these days.' And there are plenty of opportunities. I want to acknowledge a couple of those young lads that I met recently. They're doing their certificate III in automotive training with CDU. Lachie Durrington is doing his apprenticeship with Kmart Auto in Palmerston—well done, Kmart Auto, Palmerston. Joel Bernon is doing his apprenticeship with Bridge Toyota in Darwin—well done, Bridge Toyota. I go there because they're investing in these young men, giving them the training that they need and are partnered with Charles Darwin University. Those lads are nearly finished their cert III.


There's also a couple of trainees that are going through the VET in Schools program at Haileybury College. I also want to acknowledge the Nightcliff, Casuarina and Taminmin colleges that are offering the certificate I, or the 'taster' programs, to give them a taste what of it's like to start some certificate training in the hope they will go on and do their cert III and get out into the industry.


Today I co-hosted a lunch with Impex. Impex has had 500 or so trainees and apprentices go through that project site to date. This is one of the most advanced LNG facilities, a $40 billion project in Darwin. And what a great experience for those young Territorians to have those traineeships and apprenticeships out on site. I encourage Impex to continue to provide those opportunities for young Territorians to get a trade in order to get the jobs of the future in that massive industry.


I also want to give a big thumbs up and a shout-out to Engines Engineering, a great Territory company out at East Arm that are doing a fantastic job taking on young Territorians. So well done, Engines Engineering. 


I also want to shout out to YouthWorX NT for their assistance and dedication to finding suitable pathways for young people in Darwin and Palmerston, particularly for young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Great work, YouthWorX NT. Likewise, when it comes to remote work, the not-for-profit Ironbark is doing fantastic outreach work with Charles Darwin University, particularly in civil construction. It is doing certificates in civil construction, which is really practical and is a fantastic qualification for people out in the remote areas of the Northern Territory to get, because they can maintain their own roads, their community roads. That is a fantastic assistance to those communities, because it allows them to get in and out, and that is going to allow more and more industries to start operating in those more remote areas of the Territory, which will lead to jobs for young Territorians. I also hear good things about McArthur River Mine and some of the things they're doing with their apprentices. I look forward to finding out a bit more and to talking to some apprentices at McArthur River Mine when I visit there soon.


The Territory and the Top End have a great future. There are great opportunities, but we need skilled workers. Neglecting training and defunding TAFE is short-sighted, and I very much hope that those opposite review those policies. They're not likely to get another budget, but if they were to, winding back those cuts to TAFE would be a good start. I don't want to belabour the point, but across the country there are 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees, so there has been a significant decline, of 35 per cent.


I've touched on some of the things that Labor intends to do. We have a plan, and the reason we have a plan is that we value this sector. We think the VET sector—the TAFE institutions and institutions like CDU—is an important part of our education system. We'll work with the school systems to ensure that kids, as they go through school, don't think that the whole reason they're at school is just to get into university. We understand that STEM, jobs of the future and a whole number of trades need people who have university qualifications. We understand that. But we also respect and value the VET and TAFE trainers who are skilling up working Australians every day for similar jobs, jobs that we need, jobs that might be in aged care, in automotive or in civil construction—jobs that we're going to need into the future. When you value something you invest in it, and that's what we'll do. We'll guarantee that two out of three public vocational education dollars go to providers like CDU in my electorate and TAFEs around the country. We'll waive the up-front fees for 100,000 students to attend TAFE. We'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. We'll ensure that one in every 10 jobs on Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices. We'll provide 10,000 pre-apprenticeship programs for young people who want to learn a trade. We'll provide 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who want to or need to retrain. We'll also establish a national commission of review into post-secondary education within the first 100 days of government. That's a plan. We value TAFE, trade training, those who provide the training and our young people and people in transition who need that training.


Labor's plan has a budget impact of $473 million over the forward estimates, and $708 million over the medium term. But we will prioritise those budget measures. We will, because we value it. We value this training. We value it more than giving $17 billion to the banks. I personally believe we've got enough bankers and there will always be enough people to find their way into that area of work. But it doesn't grow a country. It doesn't grow a nation. The young men and women of Australia who don't choose to or want to get a hands-on trade need to be supported. We'll do that in government by doing those things that I mentioned before. We'll have an inquiry into post-secondary education, and we'll make sure that young Territorians and young Australians that want to go and get a trade aren't left behind.

"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (16:46):  I rise to speak and make a contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-19. In doing so, I want to voice the concern my constituents have about the government's budget and budgets of the past. This budget, in the view of my community, fails the fairness test and it fails the fiscal responsibility test. It effectively fails middle Australia. It also fails the most vulnerable in my community. 


I'll go to one issue that I spoke about in quite a bit of detail last year, and that is that the government is still pursuing measures that will force people to work until 70 years of age. In my electorate, I have people who are engaged in a number of blue-collar jobs—tradies and hospitality staff. I also have nurses and teachers. I have aged-care workers. If you know anything about care aged-care work, you know that the work that they do is very important and very difficult work. These are jobs that are physically and also emotionally very demanding. 


I spoke against these measures last year, and I'll speak against them this year as well. The budget is also maintaining and pursuing measures to axe the energy supplement of $14 a fortnight for single pensioners. I have 16,128 pensioners in my electorate, and that's more than 15,000 elderly and vulnerable Australians that will be impacted adversely as a result of these measures, especially as we approach the coming winter. It's always an issue, in particular, during the winter. This budget still has a freeze on Medicare for specialist visits. In my electorate, those sorts of freezes adversely affect the health and wellbeing of my community. 


My communities have already suffered at the hands of many previous budget measures. They are trying to balance the rising cost of living. Many of them, a large number of them, are employed in insecure work, and a large number of them are unable to afford housing. So they do wonder why the Prime Minister has chosen to prioritise big business and the banks by giving those institutions a $80 billion tax handout, when their own middle Australia—my constituents—need all the assistance that they can get. A Shorten Labor government won't do this. We won't, because we understand what the Australian community needs, and what it needs in order to help advance itself. Labor's approach to the budget offers a fairer and more responsible alternative, fairer to middle Australia and to our most vulnerable, and more responsible when it comes to budget repair. 


We have a plan, a real plan, to see working Australia genuinely get ahead. Our plan will see those who earn up to $125,000 a year paying less tax than they would under the government's proposed tax cuts. That's going to make a huge difference to my constituents who will be among the four million Australians who will get a tax cut of $928 a year—money that they desperately need and money that reflects the Labor Party's priorities. We are prioritising the welfare of middle Australians.


The governments' narrative around the $70 billion tax cut goes along the lines that company tax cuts will by definition enable investment, create more jobs, produce more productivity and lead to wage increases. Well, the people in my electorate don't subscribe to trickle-down economics. They don't subscribe to it because we have a history of big companies abandoning our area—big companies such as Pacific Brands, Yakka and Dunlop. These big employers who took their business offshore in pursuit of greater profit, complaining the Australian labour market was too expensive for them, left thousands of people in my electorate in the lurch, without employment prospects. Also in this mix is the car industry. Ford, a big employer in my electorate, was ditched by this government. So you'll have to forgive my community if they don't believe subscribe to the so-called goodwill of companies to trickle prosperity down to them.


In my electorate, I have a huge number of refugees who have come here in recent years from Syria and Iraq. These people cannot find employment. It is not because they don't want to; it is because they happen to be in a very unusual place. Many of them are highly qualified but their skills are not recognised here. I have spoken about this many times before. They want to make a contribution but they have to suffer the indignity of having Job Network providers who are totally useless in responding to their needs. So their prospects for employment are not enhanced under this government's watch.


Manufacturing and innovation are key to not only Australia's future but also the future of the northern suburbs of Melbourne, where my electorate of Calwell is. Yesterday, Dulux officially opened a paint plant at the Merrifield Business Park in Mickleham, very strongly supported by the Victorian Labor government. In opening this plant in my electorate, Dulux has created 60 local jobs, which for us is a significant number of prospective jobs.


The government, in attempting to amend the research and development tax incentive in an effort to better target it, has turned the offsets into a disincentive. Research and development are fundamental to innovation, advancing manufacturing and creating jobs. Currently companies can claim 8.5 percentage points above the company tax rate for their R&D expenditure up to $100 million. The new amendments will introduce progressive rates for the incentive, affecting companies with an aggregated annual turnover of more than $20 million. These rates will be tied to the amount the company spends on R&D as a proportion of total expenditure. These changes will do the opposite of incentivising companies to invest in Australia. Most established Australian companies spend less than two per cent of their expenditure on R&D. This is because they committed to investing in local jobs, local resources and other local businesses. The rate of their incentive will go from 8.5 per cent to four per cent. Under these changes, Dulux, which has just opened up a plant in my electorate, could lose around $100,000 each year. So, to keep other aspects of their business here, companies will likely decrease their R&D, spend more and more, and either pay someone else to do it or move R&D offshore, therefore depleting Australia of its intellectual capital as well.


Our country was built by strong, established businesses providing stable and decent jobs. Our future depends on workers finding the same security in Australian businesses as our industries advance. Small to medium enterprises in my electorate are leading in innovation and manufacturing, particularly food manufacturing. They are desperately trying to create jobs for our local community and I'm wondering why they're not given enough assistance from this government. Of course, one of their biggest problems, as everyone in this chamber would know, is the high cost of energy. I have some users facing high energy costs in my electorate. They are actually suffering and struggling to stay afloat.


Recently I spoke about car manufacturing, but I also want to speak on behalf of my constituents who own local car repair businesses in my electorate. They are absolutely thrilled that Labor is supporting legislation that will force car manufacturers to share their data with small businesses and loosen the stranglehold they have on the car service and repair market. In February, I visited the family business of Damien and Debbie Theuma of Active Motor Repairs in Craigieburn. They and other business owners detailed the difficulties they were facing with the advent of car dealerships monopolising the repair and warranty market. The lack of data sharing, in particular, has affected their businesses and highlighted the importance of legislating a mandatory code for data sharing. Business owners like Damien and Debbie feel that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry's report into the car retailing industry, which was released in December 2017, should be adopted in its entirety. In short, the report concluded that vehicle manufacturers who sell into the Australian market limit access to service and repair information for independent repairers. The report also found that this created an artificial monopoly and allowed manufacturers to inflate the mark-ups on servicing and repairs. Laws in the USA and the EU prevent this abuse of market power.


The ACCC's report concluded that independent repairers were experiencing issues gaining access to technical information needed to repair and service new cars. Access to technical information held by car manufacturers was becoming increasingly important as repairing and servicing new cars relies on access to electronic information and data produced by car manufacturers. Car manufacturers had previously committed to providing independent repairers with the same access to technical information as the manufacturers' authorised dealers on commercially fair and reasonable terms. However, the ACCC discovered problems with the detail and time lines of the technical information given. The ACCC considered that independent repairers having access to this technical information was important to ensure competition and, ultimately, to benefit consumers. The ACCC proposed a mandatory scheme for car manufacturers to share technical information. The mandatory code recommendation is supported by Labor and all the independent repairer associations; the consumer bodies; the auto associations, including the NRMA and the RACQ; the insurance industry the new car dealers association; and all the major auto repair chains—for example, Kmart Tyre and Auto Service, Repco Authorised Car Service and Bridgestone.


I wrote to the Treasurer on behalf of my constituents, detailing my support for the independent car repairers. In April, the Treasurer wrote back saying that the market study would 'inform the government's further consideration of these important issues'. While the government and the Treasurer are considering what to do, Labor has acted and come out in support of small businesses and their need to access data to ensure their survival. Under a Labor government, car manufacturers would be required to share information about their vehicles with every Australian mechanic. Australia-wide, this means a boost of 23,000 independent mechanics and will allow car owners more choice when it comes to servicing and repairing their vehicles. We will stick up for small business, for Aussie trades, and keeping the costs of living down for families, as Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has said.


Independent mechanics have been going to the wall while the Turnbull government sits on its hands. There is no reason that this reform shouldn't be implemented immediately, in particular in the car repair sector, which traditionally attracts lots of young people, particularly young men, with apprenticeships and pathways for job opportunities into the future. It is an absolute disgrace that this government can sit on its hands while local car repairers face the prospect of being put out of business by car manufacturers who are behaving in a way that my constituents are right about.


Corporate culture does not take into consideration the needs of people and does not put the needs of people ahead of its profit-making culture. That is why my constituents do not subscribe to the trickle-down theory, that is why they oppose the corporate tax cuts, and that is why this government's priority is all wrong. It's all wrong in relation to the people that I represent who need assistance from the government in order to be able to meet the cost of living, find jobs and get on with living their lives and supporting their families, their children and their neighbourhoods.

"O'Toole, Cathy, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms O'TOOLE
 (Herbert) (17:01):  I stand here today in this place to take the fight for my community straight to the Turnbull government. There is not one thing in the budget for Townsville—no funding for Townsville's long-term water security and no funding for our energy infrastructure. This is a slap in the face for the people in my electorate of Herbert, especially given that our electricity bills have been skyrocketing under the Turnbull government.


There's no funding for the Townsville Port Expansion Project. This is essential infrastructure, especially given that, in the very near future, our fuel will be shipped in dual hull ships that cannot access our port. Our fuel will sail straight past Townsville to the south and then be loaded onto trucks and sent back to Townsville along the Bruce Highway. This will result in more maintenance for the Bruce Highway and a higher cost of fuel, which is already expensive in my community.


In fact, there is not one single extra new dollar for infrastructure in this budget for Townsville—not one cent. Townsville has received a nothing budget announcement. This is a budget that has simply been repackaged, keeping the cuts from the previous budgets reworded and presented with a very nice bow on top. The Turnbull government is a government of cuts. The only thing that this budget delivers is cut after cut after cut. There was $9 million cut to Townsville Health and Hospital Service; $40.7 million cut from veterans' allied and dental health services; $36 million cut from James Cook University; $38 million from Central Queensland University; and $14.8 million cut from Townsville schools.


Then, of course, there is the biggest cut of all, which happens to be an $80 billion tax cut to big business and the banks. After the devastation and poor practice that has been revealed in the royal commission into banking, the Turnbull government actually has the gall to give big banks more than $17 billion in tax cuts. That seems typical of LNP priorities. This government would rather give billions of dollars in tax cuts to the same big banks that have behaved badly, as we have witnessed in the royal commission. The same banks tried to evict a blind pensioner from her home; falsely filled out their customers' forms over 350 times, including on life insurance policies, charged people they knew to be deceased for financial advice, sometimes up to 10 years after they passed away; manipulated kids' bank accounts to gain millions in bonuses; advised an elderly widow to put her life savings in to a complicated investment account when she initially came in for a term deposit; and changed nearly 16,000 customer fees for no service for years and then lied to the regulator more than 20 times regarding this, in what can only be described as attempts to cover their tracks. We know there is still more to be uncovered. Yet, given all of this, the Turnbull government still wants to give big banks $17 billion in tax cuts. This is nothing short of rewarding appalling behaviour. Turnbull backs the banks not people. He puts profits before people. He puts top hats before hard hats. More importantly, he puts his job before Townsville jobs.


Townsville knows that these cuts means more job losses. Jobs, workers, families, pensioners and veterans have all suffered under consecutive LNP governments. When Labor left federal government in 2013, Townsville's unemployment rate was lower than both the state and national averages. Now Townsville's unemployment rate is higher than the state average and almost double that of the national average. Townsville's unemployment has almost doubled under the Abbott-Turnbull governments. Under the previous Labor government, manufacturing in Townsville soared. When Labor left federal government in 2013, more than 8,400 people were employed in the manufacturing industry, but under the Abbott-Turnbull governments manufacturing has nosedived, with job losses of more than 3,000. The manufacturing industry made up eight per cent of our local employment. Under the decimation of the coalition governments, manufacturing, jobs and industry have spiralled down to 4.9 per cent. These were good-quality jobs, and now they are gone under the Abbott-Turnbull governments.


There has been the complete and utter decimation of our construction industry. The Townsville Workforce Report January 2018, commissioned by recruitment firm TP Human Capital, showed that Townsville had 442 fewer construction industry business registrations last year compared with 2012. That's a drop of 15.7 per cent. That's more jobs gone from Townsville under the Abbott-Turnbull governments. Then there is the retail industry. The retail industry is often a very good yardstick that one can use to measure how the local economy is thriving. That same Townsville workforce reportindicates that Townsville is not thriving. There was also a loss of 153 retail business registrations in the same period between 2012 and 2017. That's a fall of 17 per cent. That's more jobs gone. And let's not forget the coalition government job cuts to the public sector. One hundred and ten ATO jobs have gone. Fifty defence jobs have gone. Forty aviation jobs at No. 38 Squadron have gone. Nineteen CSIRO jobs have gone. The coalition is a government of job cuts.


Then there's the LNP's track record for our veterans. Townsville is the largest garrison city in Australia, and I am proud to represent a strong and vibrant defence community. I am passionate about supporting our veterans because they have fought for the freedoms that we enjoy in this great country today. But they also deserve the support that they need when they return home. However, sadly, this is not the case under the Abbott-Turnbull governments. First, there were the cuts to the pay of our defence personnel. This was completely inexplicable, especially when the LNP government was sending our service men and women into harm's way whilst at the same time forcing the ADF to take a real pay cut. However, Labor stood by our defence personnel and fought against those wage cuts. Then there is the $40.7 million cut to veterans' allied and dental health services and the freeze to the repatriation medical fees scheme, which is creating a reduction in access to critical medical services for our veterans. They are not even delivering on their own commitments. In 2006, the Turnbull government said that they would establish a DVA mefloquine support team to assist our serving and ex-serving ADF community with mefloquine related claims, and in 2018 our defence community and their families are still waiting. When asked at Senate estimates about the minister's dedicated team, DVA confirmed that there was no dedicated team and that, rather, this was spread across a handful of DVA staff who deal with a range of issues at any one time. This is shameful, disgraceful and frustrating for our veterans.


Another issue of major concern for veterans in my electorate of Herbert is that of transitional employment. Transitional employment issues can impact severely on a veteran's mental health if they are unable to secure employment. Given the significance of this issue, I was very disappointed to find that the Turnbull government has only committed $8.3 million over four years for veterans' employment, which pales in comparison to Labor's $121 million program. If the Turnbull government had matched Labor's commitment, I would have extended my sincere congratulations, but this difference in funding can only indicate a difference in priorities. Labor will put our veterans first. Labor have our priorities right. We are putting people first. We are prioritising health, education, pensioners, workers, families, aged-care facilities, and veterans before an $80 billion tax cut for big business and the banks. 


More importantly, Labor is prioritising Townsville. Labor will fund $100 million towards Townsville's long-term water security. Labor will fund $200 million towards energy infrastructure in the form of hydropower on the Burdekin Falls Dam. Labor will fund $75 million towards Townsville's port expansion project. This investment alone will return more than $580 million to our local economy. Labor will fund the Townsville Health and Hospital Service. Labor will fund our schools with proper, needs based funding. Labor will fund our regional universities, James Cook University and Central Queensland University. Labor will deliver a fairer taxation reform. 


We believe in supporting workers and families, not big businesses and the banks. The median weekly personal income in Herbert is $672. Under Labor, a person receiving $672 in Herbert will be $350 better off, and that is $150 more than the Turnbull government's plan. Families will also be much better off. The median weekly family income in Herbert is $1,640. Under Labor, families in Herbert will be $928 better off. That is more than $398 better than the Turnbull government's plan. 


It is very clear that a federal Labor budget is the only winner for the people in my electorate of Herbert. These are all Labor priorities, because these priorities put people first. Labor has always been committed to a fair go for all citizens, and we will continue to be committed to a fair go for all citizens. That's exactly what a Labor budget will do for Australia, and particularly for the people in my electorate of Herbert.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (17:12):  I'm very pleased to stand up and speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, and I'm pleased to stand up and point out some of the very significant flaws that we see in this bill. These appropriation bills continue to lock in some of the worst features of previous budgets from this Turnbull-Abbott government. 


These appropriations bills—this budget—still continues to rely on cuts to the pension, to increasing the pension age to 70, one of the oldest in the world. There's a continued commitment to taking $14 a fortnight away from pensioners. We know that energy costs are through the roof but, of course, this government wants to take away the energy supplement from pensioners. The $715 million of cuts to hospitals are still there. The $40 million cut from allied health services for veterans is just an extraordinary little nugget of cruelty in this budget. $40 million is not a great deal in the size of the federal budget, but to take that money away from veterans who rely on this service to have their teeth seen to just shows the cheapness and the meanness, and how out of touch this government is. 


Of course, there's the $83 million cut from the ABC. This is a government that will take any opportunity it can to shut down dissent, criticism or even scrutiny of its own agenda or claims. The ABC are copping it once again. And Medicare is still frozen for specialists. We will see, of course, more and more stories about continuing increases in out-of-pocket expenses for patients struggling to afford to see a specialist. 


Yes, there are some tax cuts in this budget. We are very pleased to support the early years—the immediate tax cuts offered from 1 July this year—but we are very troubled by a long-term trajectory that takes tax cuts out beyond—it's assuming that Malcolm Turnbull's got a longevity that I'm not even sure that the Deputy Speaker would imagine he has. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Andrews
):  The member should refer to other members by their correct titles. 




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  When it comes to tax cuts promised into the never-never, we are very concerned that a nurse on $41,000 will be paying the same rate of tax as a doctor on $200,000 a year. It just hardly seems fair to be doing that. And of course there is the $80 billion of big business tax cuts that continue to haunt us.


There's no action on debt, and that is really one of the most extraordinary things about this budget for a government that claimed in opposition to be riding in with the fire engine to put out the fire and that drove the debt truck around the country. It is pretty extraordinary that net debt this year is double what it was when the Liberals came to office. Gross debt has crashed through half a trillion dollars. It's pretty handy that the government was able to do a deal with the Greens political party to get rid of the debt cap; otherwise, they'd have to return to the parliament again and again to explain why net debt's doubled and why gross debt's crashed through half a trillion dollars and will remain over half a trillion dollars for every year over the next decade.


Of course, Labor will achieve a budget surplus in the same year as the government. Because we are not giving away $80 billion in big-business tax cuts, because we're not giving tax cuts to people on more than $180,000 a year and because we've made very tough decisions around negative gearing, capital gains tax, family trusts, high-end superannuation concessions and multinational tax, we are able to see bigger surpluses than the government over coming years. So we're able to have a bigger tax cut for low- and middle-income earners. In fact, we're almost doubling the tax cut for low- and middle-income earners—about 10 million working Australians. We're able to protect the services that Australians rely on: a great education system for their kids, strong health care, aged care, child care and making sure that we're continuing to build the productivity-enhancing infrastructure that makes our cities and regions more liveable. We're able to do all of that, give bigger tax cuts and have stronger surpluses because we're not spraying around tax concessions to the big end of town as this government insists on doing.


To turn specifically to the education areas in this budget: of course we continue to see a $17 billion cut to schools baked into this budget. I think it does tell you all you need to know about the priorities of this government that the $17 billion cut from schools is the same amount that the big banks will get in tax cuts because of the big-business tax cuts. So you can spend $17 billion giving our kids a better future, investing in our nation to make sure that we develop the intellectual skills in our people, to make sure that we are a prosperous and successful nation in the future—you could do that one on the one hand if you had $17 billion to spend—or you could just give it to the big banks and spray it around as executive bonuses and dividends to overseas shareholders. We know which side of that choice we are on. We know which side the government's on too.


We also see locked in the inequitable funding formula that gives a maximum of 20 per cent of the schooling resource standard—the cost of educating a child—to kids in public schools. It is 20 per cent of the schooling resource standard if you're educating a child in a public school and 80 per cent if you're educating a child in a non-government school. Why you would think for a moment that this is a sector-blind approach, as the Prime Minister keeps saying, is just absolutely impossible to understand. This approach could not be more sectors-specific than it is. One school system gets 20 per cent of the cost of educating a child, and another school system gets 80 per cent of the cost of educating a child. That's not sector-blind. That is absolutely as sector-specific as it possibly could be.


We also see in this budget the continued cuts to public schools, which educate 74 per cent of students with disabilities, 82 per cent of kids from the bottom quarter of socioeconomic advantage and 84 per cent of Indigenous children. But it's not just the public schools that have suffered. The Catholic sector are particularly incensed about the billions of dollars of cuts that they are facing because of these changes.


We see the government talking about the Gonski report mark 2, which is supposed to look at how money should be spent within the schooling system. I thought it was very instructive that we heard from Mark Scott today, the Director-General of the New South Wales Department of Education. He said: 'Yes, great idea; let's do more of this one-on-one individual programming for individual kids. But it will cost more. It will be expensive.' We're very happy to see a number of these recommendations. In fact, they reflect Labor policy with the national agreements that we had when we were last in government—agreements that were dispensed with by the previous Minister for Education, the member for Sturt, who said they were simply red tape. Well, they've been resurrected in this Gonski report—and Mark Scott has agreed that many of them are a good idea, but they'll need extra funding.


This government has cut $17 billion—and even agreeing with things like the evidence institute, which would do more education research and promulgate that research into our schools to make sure we were using the best and newest available information to teach our kids well. They've agreed that that's a good idea. Labor's got $280 million on the table for an evidence institute for schools. Guess how much the government's got on the table for an evidence institute for schools? A big fat zero. It's all very good to say the ideas are great, but if you're cutting funding to our schools at the same time, it's very difficult to see how these ideas might be implemented. There's no extra money in this budget for the ideas that are raised in the second Gonski report. In fact, the only thing in the budget are the baked-in cuts—$17 billion cut from schools.


Turning to TAFE and universities, since the election of this government we've seen more than $3 billion cut from TAFE skills and apprenticeships. The National Partnership Agreement on Training Places for Single Parents has been cut. There has been a cut to workplace English language and literacy programs. We have seen the Apprenticeship to Business Owner program cut. Productive Ageing through Community Education has been cut. The Australian Apprenticeships Access program has been cut. I think it tells you all you need to know about the education minister that he said TAFE education was about 'basket weaving and essential oils'. These are the sorts of programs that they're cutting—workplace English language and literacy programs and the Apprenticeship to Business Owner program, which I would have thought would be right up the government's alley.


This budget cuts a further $270 million from TAFE. On top of all the cuts we've already seen, on top of the fact that we've got 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees than when the Liberals came into office, we're now seeing an extra $270 million cut from TAFE over the next four years. The Skilling Australians Fund, from last year's budget, was set to be $1.47 billion over four years. In this budget it is $1.42 billion. We've also seen TAFEs closing right around Australia—in regional centres like Dapto, in New South Wales; Ithaca, in Queensland; Newport, in Victoria; and in Petersham West and Crows Nest, in New South Wales. Courses have been scaled back, fees have increased and we continue to see skills shortages. We see professions on the skills shortage list that have been there for five years—the whole time this government's been in power. People could have been trained if we had a properly resourced TAFE and vocational education sector.


Labor, in contrast, has promised to scrap up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students who choose to learn the skills that Australia needs. We've said that two out of every three Commonwealth dollars will go to TAFE. We've promised to provide 10,000 pre-apprentice places for young people who want to learn a trade and 20,000 adult apprenticeships for older workers who want to retrain. And we've said we'll invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country.


We also see in this budget the locking in of cuts to universities. Of course, some of these cuts were made just before Christmas, in the mid-year economic and fiscal update, in a way that prevented the cuts coming before the parliament. They were able to sneak $2.2 billion of cuts in through the back door, which shows that the Liberals absolutely don't care that hundreds of thousands of Australians who have the desire and the competency to go to university will actually miss out. We think that that is wrong. It's wrong for those individuals, and it's absolutely wrong for our nation. As the world becomes more complex and as work becomes more complex, we want more of our young people to have a TAFE or a university education after school. We want more of our people who've been in the workforce for many years to retrain. Because the world of work is changing so quickly, people will have to upgrade their skills throughout their working lives.


Modelling by the Mitchell Institute shows that our commitment to uncap university places will mean that almost 200,000 more Australians will benefit from our plan over 12 years. When we previously uncapped university places, it meant that, by 2016—as this government's effectively reintroduced caps—the number of students from poorer backgrounds was up by 55 per cent, Indigenous student numbers had jumped by 89 per cent, enrolments by students with a disability had more than doubled and enrolments by students from country areas had grown by 48 per cent.


In a nutshell, I'd say that this is a budget that fails Australia when it comes to education. When it comes to school education, TAFE education and university education, there is nothing in this budget but baked-in old cuts and further new cuts. It's short-sighted because it robs our people of a chance at an education, and it's short-sighted because it robs our nation of our future prosperity.

"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson) (17:27):  I warn the chamber that this speech will not be nearly as coherent as what you've just heard. I plan to take full advantage of the fact that the relevance rule is completely disregarded during appropriations debates. I have four different speeches that I've been wanting to deliver, and I'm just going to do one after the other with absolutely no segue. To anyone who tries to string it together in a coherent way in the years to come, I wish you well.


I will start with a message that I would have delivered next week were parliament sitting—but it won't be, so I will offer the message now and distribute it later. Of course, while parliament's not sitting will be the end of the period of Ramadan and the celebration of Eid al-Fitr. On behalf of federal Labor, I would like to extend my best wishes to all Muslim communities in Australia and around the world that are celebrating the end of a month of fasting and the beginning of Eid al-Fitr. The announcement of Eid al-Fitr is made at the sighting of the crescent moon, an Islamic tradition which was used to identify the new month in the Islamic calendar. It marks the end of a month which many thousands of Australians have dedicated to fasting, praying and performing acts of charity. While technically, I suppose, there are some parallels with my own tradition of Lent, I think it's fair to say that my tradition has no understanding of fasting when compared to the fasting that takes place during the blessed month of Ramadan.


Preparations for Eid al-Fitr begin well before the sighting of the moon, with decorations going up in homes, on shopfronts and at local mosques. The sweet aroma of the traditional shortbreads, ma'amoul, fills homes and streets the nights before as families and friends unite for a final iftar, a final breaking of the fast, and gather to share the last Ramadan prayers and blessings. Celebrations begin at dawn, with traditional prayers at the local mosque, and are followed by the visiting of families, friends and communities, sharing the stories of the month that passed and the blessings of the year to come. Whenever I go down to celebrate with so many friends at the end of Ramadan, I always park many, many blocks away. There's this wonderful period before dawn of people walking and the group gradually getting larger and larger as you get closer. That journey towards the gathering is a beautiful part for me every time we get to Eid al-Fitr.


One of the nicest things about the celebration is the sense of unity and happiness shared amongst Muslims from various cultural backgrounds. Colourful displays of new garments are paraded, and the exuberant faces of the children fill the space as they collect money and gifts. The celebration of Eid al-Fitr, like the celebrations we mark from around the world throughout the year, is a great example of how strong and successful modern multicultural Australia is, and how our Australian story is built on the experiences of communities from around the world. To everyone celebrating, Eid Mubarak.


I want to let the House know about a wonderful victory for a school only a few blocks from where I live, Punchbowl Boys High. There is a band competition running in New South Wales for high school bands, known as YouthRock, and this year Punchbowl Boys' High won. I'm tremendously proud of them. The band members are Lucas Tekii, Yoosuf Mohamed, Eliata Ulutui, Wilkinson Papalii-Afoa, Theodore Crysma Tavete, and Micah Papalii-Tulanai. They're a great band. They're a band that has been kind enough to allow me to jam with them. I've turned up at the school with a guitar, and they've been kind enough to allow me to jam with them. They are known as the 320—that's the name of their band. There's a thing where on the one hand you have three fingers, and on the other you have two, and you're photographed. For those wondering about the mystery of how a band becomes 320, 320 it's the room number of the music room at Punchbowl Boys High. They have been writing originals for some time. One of their songs which was actually played on ABC Radio today is 'My Way', which, for members who might be concerned, is not the Frank Sinatra version but an original by themselves. To their music teacher, Michael White, I extend congratulations. They are a group of young men of great talent. We wish them well, and I hope that they're well on the way to adding their music to what forms the soundtrack of our nation.


Shortly before the change of government back in 2013, the Live Music Office was established. There was a reason we established the Live Music Office: for a long time in the arts there was a view that popular music didn't really need government support because it is so commercial and has been able to very much look after itself. However, there are some challenges that have been emerging over the years. The business model that Australian popular music has largely been built on has been changing fundamentally. The shift from purchasing of albums—I'll admit, I still purchase vinyl, but many people don't—to the purchasing of downloads and streaming has meant a significant difference in how bands earn their money.


At the same time, there's been a rapid decline in the number of venues available for them. The bands that many of the members of this place grew up with worked a pub circuit. In evidence that was given in New South Wales only yesterday, Isabella Manfredi from The Preatures—spelt the way you spell 'creatures', not with any other meaning—listed off a series of venues that were important to her band in Sydney when they were getting started. Having gone through the list of the venues—she went through Drummoyne RSL, Spectrum, Q Bar, Deans, Candy's Apartment, Bar Me, Flinders Bar, World Bar, The Gaelic, The Hopetoun, The Sandringham, The Lizard Lounge, The Standard, The Hi-Fi, Oxford Art Factory, The Lansdowne and Club 77—only two of them still exist as live music venues. This is a challenge that's happening around the country. There's a series of issues that have caused this. Ultimately our music industry has challenges now that are different to what it used to have. Some of those are caused by government policy and some of those need to be facilitated and improved through government policy.


I want to make sure that Australian music always forms the soundtrack to our lives. I want the next generation to grow up with Australian music. I want all of us to grow old with Australian music. That means we need to make sure that the entire ecosystem around our music industry survives. A whole lot of the forms of revenue that used to be there for bands are not there at the moment, and we can't just say, 'Okay, we need to have the big venues where someone's playing for 10,000.' That would be like saying, 'The only athletes we need to look after are the Australian Olympic team.' Cultural activity like popular music is the same as any area of excellence. You need your community level that people come through—where they grow, where they practise, where they play again and again—and 200 gigs later they're playing to very large venues. That is what needs to be possible.


The Live Music Office, since it was established, has been making sure there is a body to deliver on that. The guaranteed funding that we had put in place continued for the contracted period that we had left, but after the initial three-year funding, which was provided until 2016, the Live Music Office subsequently received project funding from the Australia Council, which has now run out. With APRA AMCOS, it then delivered further financial support. The Live Music Office matters. It might not matter if you didn't mind what came on on the radio—if you didn't mind that all the songs people are hearing have American accents and if you didn't mind that the places being sung about are on the other side of the planet—but, if we want Australian stories and Australian imagination and Australian voices to be what we get to hear as the soundtrack to our lives, then backing the Live Music Office is something that needs to happen. The government has still baulked at providing continued funding for them, and I would simply urge the government in the strongest terms. This doesn't need to be political. In fact, it would be bizarre for anyone to say only one side of politics supports popular music. When Rock The House is on, I see members of parliament from both sides all going up to enjoy the popular music. Those artists don't come here simply to entertain us; they come to make sure that we hear them—that we hear them about copyright, that we hear them about venues, that we hear them about making sure the entire ecology that makes for a viable, strong, resilient music industry is always there—and the Live Music Office is a critical part of that.


There is a final thing I want to say a few words about. I want to advise the House why it is that on so many occasions I stand up and make speeches about the different celebrations that are being enjoyed around Australia. Sometimes they're faith based; sometimes they're culturally based. Sometimes they're about my faith; sometimes they're about the faiths of others. Whenever I put one of those speeches up on social media, if it's a message about, for example, Ramadan, Holi or a series of different celebrations, it's interesting that I'll straightaway get the comments: 'I didn't hear you mention Christmas in that speech. Why don't you ever say anything about Christmas and Easter?' Then, at Christmas and Easter time, when I put up messages about those celebrations—and with Easter I often have to put up two because of the different Orthodox dates—the message that comes back is: 'How dare you try to impose your faith on me?' I think we all need to understand that Australia is a nation of 24 million stories and they're all as Australian as each other. They come in two broad forms: either stories that have always, ever since the first sunrise, had their heritage on this land or stories that, at some point, have come here through immigration. But they're all Australian.


I'll always resist being told, 'Instead of saying ""Happy Christmas!"" you should say ""Happy holidays!""' If what someone is celebrating is a holiday, then I'm really happy for them to wish me a happy holiday, if that's what matters to them. If what matters to them is that they're celebrating Hanukkah and they want to wish me a 'Happy Hanukkah!' I think that's great and I'll wish them a 'Happy Christmas!' And when we have carols in my local area at Wiley Park, the place will be full of people. And from the way that they are dressed when they come to those carols, it's pretty obvious they're from a range of different faiths.


Last Saturday night, for the first time, we closed Howden Street in Lakemba during Ramadan, and the street was packed. There were plenty of people there who were there to eat the different food from different cultures and plenty of those people had not been fasting all day—me included—but they'd come because that sense of invitation we offer to each other is itself part of being Australian. Since I issued the invitation for people to come down to Lakemba any time of night during Ramadan, I have seen one other member there—I won't give him up—from the other side of politics. He was there on a private basis, but he came. The invitation was real.


What I'd encourage everybody to think about is we either end up with all the different cultures and become a nation where we tell some people they don't belong or we go down even the American path of assimilation, where you often don't wish anybody a happy anything other than 'Happy Holidays!' because you don't want to offend. There is no offence in generosity. There is no offence in embracing each other's celebrations. Those of us who don't have a First Nations background here on this land still appreciate the welcome to country. All of us can take the goodwill of a Christmas message, of an Eid message, of a Hanukkah message, of a Dipawali message and, with that, build that sense, not of a soup—where everything is pureed and where all the ingredients come out tasting the same—but of a salad, where every ingredient keeps its identity. Together we form a flavour that's distinctively, uniquely and proudly Australian.

"Byrne, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (17:42):  I rise tonight to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019, which provides appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the annual services of the government for 2017-18 and for the remainder of 2018-19. I want to talk about how the budget affects my local electorate in Holt and some other issues. The local residents in Holt, in my experience and that of my staff, need financial relief given the very low wage growth that we've had over a number of years, the continued rise in the cost-of-living expenses and cuts to penalty rates. And they also are in urgent need of new infrastructure to keep pace with the rapidly growing population in the outer south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.


The City of Casey, as of the end of 2017, had a population of 327,380 people. I'm sure it's well into the 330,000s now. In another 20 years, its size will be past Canberra's, basically. It's one of the fastest-growing areas of Australia. It's an area that, regardless of how it's portrayed in the press, offers, I think, a lot of hope for the future of our country. I'll be talking a bit further about how we can assist those many young families who have shifted into the area to make a life not only for themselves and their families but for their family's families, and talk about how they are portrayed and about how the real contribution that hardworking families in the outer suburbs make to our country's future should be appropriately recognised. I think the member for Werriwa has an outer suburban constituency as well, so she would well know what I'm talking about. Before I amplify that particular discussion point, we on this side certainly believe that more funding should have been committed to the City of Casey region. Some ideas include the duplication of Thomsons Road between Cranbourne and Clyde, and also an idea that I had that we had secured opposition support for prior to the last election, which was an overpass on the intersection of Thomsons Road and Western Port Highway. The budget delivered by the government does not invest in much needed infrastructure projects like that and other projects in the outer suburbs of Melbourne and in my area. The government certainly hasn't delivered in areas like protecting pensioners. It's cut the energy supplement, costing pensioners $14 a fortnight. It also has failed to deliver in areas such as education in schools and cuts to TAFE.


One contrast I would make is what the Andrews Labor government has achieved in Victoria, particularly in the infrastructure area, in the past 3½ years. Since being elected in November 2014, the Andrews Labor government has invested more than $48 billion to build the schools, the hospitals, the roads and the public transport system our state needs. Construction work completed in Victoria is up 6.5 per cent in the March quarter, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, compared with the national average of just 0.2 per cent. As a result, more than 320,000 jobs have been created since the Andrews Victorian Labor government came to office. Business owners said to me for a long time before the election of the Andrews state Labor government that they wanted a government that invested in infrastructure, roads, construction and rail. With that investment, as testified by the figure of $48 billion, there are a lot of cranes, Deputy Speaker Kevin Andrews, as you would know, in the sky in Victoria. That's always a good sign. There is a lot of road and rail work being done and a lot of hospitals are being built. The Casey Hospital, for example, is very close to where I live. It's adjacent to my constituency, as it currently stands, with perhaps some alterations to occur in the future. The Andrews Labor government has made a very substantial investment there.


When people drive on the roads that are being widened, such as the Monash Freeway, or they travel on sky rail, particularly around the Cranbourne area, or they see the extension of the Narre-Cranbourne Road, TAFEs being built and expanded like the Chisholm Institute of TAFE, and the Casey Hospital—and that is a very, very large building that is offering excellent service to a growing community, one of the fastest-growing areas in Australia—they know that the state government is investing in essential infrastructure: road infrastructure, rail infrastructure and what I call medical infrastructure.


The other thing I want to compliment the Andrews government on is the number of new schools that have been opened in our area. It is amazing to see the number of almost high-tech schools that are catering to the growing community that we have in our region. I believe that the Andrews government has made a commitment for another three schools just in that growth corridor, approximate to where I represent. That is a government that really is reacting to the needs of the community. The sense that I get when speaking to people about the Andrews government—in contrast to what, I regret to say, the Turnbull government has been doing in the south-east in terms of investment in infrastructure—is that Daniel Andrews is getting things done. Certainly, when you look at the hospitals, the roads and the new schools, you can see a lot of work being done. People believe that this government is investing in them and their future. I'd like to commend the government. I hope that the Andrews Labor government is re-elected, particularly on the basis of all the fine work that it's done for the outer suburbs. I respectfully draw your attention, as a comparison, to the investment that we've seen by the Turnbull government. As an example, there has been very little investment in contrast to the splendid new series of wards that have been built at the Casey Hospital.


We have been meeting. Ever since I shifted into the region in 1996, there has been a discussion about a second airport in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, as you would know. A consortium has been working with the Andrews Labor government to finally, after many, many years, potentially invest in an airport after the appropriate environmental impact statements have been made so that the growth corridor would not be adversely affected by the creation of a second airport. But I think we are very close. My understanding is that that consortium has been supported by the Andrews government, and that is something. I do support this second airport with the proviso that those appropriate environmental impact statements are taken into account and the flight paths of what would be Melbourne's second major airport do not adversely affect pockets in some of the growth belt suburbs. I do completely support that. There would be a thousand jobs.


The potential here is this: we will have a second major airport and potentially an airport that could rival Tullamarine down the track—and we're talking about the next 40 or 50 years. This will transform the south-eastern region of Melbourne. And the investment, as I understand it, having spoken to the consortium concerned, is somewhere in the order of about $7 billion. But my point is that I'm not aware of the engagement with the federal government with respect to that, and that's a disappointment. These matters need to be negotiated with both the state government of Premier Andrews, which has been supportive, and the federal government, and, from my understanding, that sort of engagement has not happened. I think that's a bad thing when this federal government's touting a lot of the work and a lot of the investment it has made. It could have made, for example, the overpass investment on the corner of Thompsons Road and Western Port Highway. It did not.


We took, as I said, to the last election a $65 million commitment, as I understand it, to actually help the state government construct that overpass. The state government is widening Thompsons Road. It's put Skyrail over Thompsons Road. It's an important east-west feeder and connector and it's of critical significance in feeding traffic into, particularly, EastLink as well, taking traffic from Frankston almost all the way up to Berwick. It needs that sort of investment and that commitment, and that affects marginal seats like Dunkley and places like that, so you would think that a government that did have some measure of concern about its seats would do that.


We certainly did not have that bipartisan support that I would have expected at the last federal election, but we will obviously be speaking to our relevant shadow ministers to talk about, prior to the next election, how they can assist as they have in the past. I can recall, as an example, that prior to the 2007 election the federal government was not investing in part of one of the rural and regional development funding programs for a water-harvesting facility at Casey ARC. I understand that, finally, just prior to the election the then Howard government was prepared to invest, I think, a million dollars. We had our shadow minister, who was Anthony Albanese, that came down. We made a $5 million investment. We have invested. I'd like to point out also what we have done as well.


We invested, particularly during the global financial crisis during the Rudd-Gillard prime ministerships, over $10 million in the City of Casey in emergency funding to ensure that jobs were generating. There is a very fine state-standard athletics track that was funded to the tune of, I think, about $9 million post around the 2009-10 period due to the rural regional infrastructure funding.


Why do I raise this? Because, even with the $10 million that was given by the Abbott government for Bunjil Place, which is a significant, region-leading, $125 million investment by the state government, we cannot access funding anymore through that program line. It's changed from the National Stronger Regions Fund to the Building Better Regions Fund. That's great. We can say to people, 'We invested $10 million,' but, when we have significant other projects that are desperately needed, there is no funding opportunity for us to pursue that.


Cranbourne East is the fastest-growing area in Australia. To say to them that it's okay to fund the regions, but you don't have a discrete outer region funding mechanism, as was used by the previous Abbott government to get the City of Casey the $10 million, is completely unsatisfactory. Tell that to the people who wait in a kilometre-long queue on Clyde Road every morning, when they're coming to work and trying to connect to the Monash Freeway. That is completely unacceptable.


I note that the member for Jagajaga is in the chamber. One of the signature achievements of the Keating prime ministership in particular was the Building Better Cities program. I think it was administered by Brian Howe. It was an inspired program. It was a program that was meant for the outer suburbs, to make our cities more livable and more equitable. They were the two terms used. Time after time you would come across projects across the city—these community-building projects. You would see these great projects—project after project—across the country. Myuna Farm in the suburb of Doveton was one and I think there was another project funded in the city of Elizabeth in South Australia. The feedback that we got was that they were projects that were needed by the community. That $816 million between 1991 and 1996 is a heck of a lot more money now. I represent the fastest-growing suburb, Cranbourne East and I contrast that funding with the level of funding that has been put in with the federal government investment in Cranbourne East now, which is about 0.0 dollars. That doesn't make people happy when they're waiting for half an hour to get onto the Monash Freeway, but it's also about more schools. It's about community based facilities. It's an amazing community, badly portrayed, I might say, by articles in The Age. The fact is when people go out there to make a life for themselves with their families, they shouldn't be written about pejoratively, as they were in The Age saying this area has become a large slum because it doesn't have the social infrastructure. The social infrastructure's not being there is the responsibility of governments that allowed that work to happen. It is our responsibility to provide the social infrastructure for these people in areas such as mental health and a whole range of other areas.


In concluding—I could go on and on, but I won't for the wellbeing of this chamber—the Andrews government has made significant investments in the outer suburbs. The Turnbull government needs to do this and it needs to do it soon.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2018-05-29,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (17:57):  This is the fifth Abbott-Turnbull budget. In every single budget from this conservative government there have been cuts to the age pension, cuts to Newstart, cuts to hospitals and schools, an increase in the pension age to 70 and now in this budget the latest proposal: a flattening of the income tax system that will see inequality get worse in this country. It's very clear that with this budget the Prime Minister wants people to forget its five-year catalogue of cuts, cuts that define this government and have defined this government since the horror budget of 2014.


The Prime Minister would of course like to go to the next election having whitewashed the terrible cuts of the last five years. I say to him and to all of the Liberal and National party members that over the last month or so I've done a number of very large pension forums, particularly in Perth—I did five very well attended pension forums there—and more recently in Tasmania and down in Frankston, in Victoria. Pensioners have not forgotten what this government wants to do to them. They understand the implications of the government's desire to increase the age-pension age to 70. I should say to anybody who's listening that this isn't some policy change that's off on the never-never. People who turn 60 from this July will have to work longer because of Mr Turnbull's plan to increase the pension age to 70. It's not something that's just going to affect people who are in their 40s or their 50s; it's actually going to start affecting people who turn 60 very, very soon.


Australians also haven't forgotten what this government wants to do to the energy supplement. For the information of those opposite, who I'm sure would like to forget that this is what they have already voted for twice and that the government has it in this budget again, they want to axe the energy supplement. This is worth $14 a fortnight for single pensioners and $8.80 a fortnight for people on Newstart. Very vulnerable people who find themselves out of work and need to rely on Newstart will face a cut to Newstart as a result of this government's budget. This is a cut in this budget. Of course, it has been a cut in previous budgets. The government has so far been unable to get this through the parliament, but it is in this budget. This government is determined to see a cut to the pension, with the abolition of the energy supplement, and a cut to Newstart. Labor will continue to strongly oppose this very significant cut.


We hear the government boast every day about the number of jobs that have been created. But what they don't tell us, what isn't said every day but Australians understand, is that there are about one million people in our country who are underemployed. That is on top of the people who are unemployed. According to the Australian Council of Social Service, 730,000 children are living in poverty. And another fact that never crosses the lips of those opposite is that nearly half the number of people on Newstart, nearly half the number of people on unemployment benefits, are unemployed for more than a year. Long-term unemployment in this country is getting worse and this government is doing absolutely nothing about it.


Inequality in this country is at a 75-year high. This isn't the 'jobs and growth' story that you hear from the Prime Minister every day, but these are the facts. It is a fact of life for millions of Australians who are really doing it very tough under this government. It is not what our country should be like. It certainly is time that we gave these people and families a much better shot at a decent life. One of the important ways in which Labor wants to address this fundamental inequity in our country is to make sure those people who are struggling can get the skills that they need to get the jobs that they want. We want to improve their capacity to get a TAFE qualification. Labor, in government, would scrap up-front fees for around 100,000 TAFE students and also spend $100 million upgrading our TAFEs around the country.


It is also why Labor is determined to seriously invest in our schools. This government made huge cuts to school funding back in the 2014 budget. Labor has promised to put into our schools over the next 10 years the $17 billion that is needed and, in particular, make sure that those areas in our country that are very disadvantaged are able to deliver great educational opportunities for our children. That includes areas like Doveton, in Victoria, which is not far from the member for Bruce's electorate. It has a fantastic primary and secondary school delivering 'Our Place', a model of education and support for families that is really turning those families around. But it costs money. You actually need to spend the extra money to make sure that those schools can deliver to those families, children and young people. Labor, of course, is determined to improve access to universities, with 200,000 extra places at our universities, and provide additional funding for hospitals to completely reverse the coalition's cuts. All of these initiatives that Labor would put in place are about investing in our people and also making sure that we protect people when they fall on hard times. By contrast, what we see in this budget is a plan by the Liberals that favours the well off and will worsen inequality.


I want to talk about tax, because that is the starkest demonstration in this budget of how this government will, in fact, increase inequality in our country. How we raise the money that we need for our schools and hospitals and to have a decent safety net determines whether or not we have a fair society. There's been some excellent analysis done at ANU, NATSEM and the Grattan Institute, and all have pointed out that this government's tax cuts are deliberately designed to deliver the biggest gains to those people who need them least in our community. These are the facts: about 60 per cent of the benefit of the government's tax changes would go to the wealthiest 20 per cent in this country. Just today, in Senate estimates, the secretary of Treasury said that a worker on $80,000 a year would receive a tax cut worth $540 a year by the end of the government's seven-year plan, whereas someone earning $200,000 a year would get a tax cut of $7,225 dollars a year. If you want a demonstration of how this government's going to increase inequality, that is it in a nutshell.


By contrast, Labor will deliver much fairer tax cuts for 10 million working Australians and for those people who really need it most. Of course, we can afford to deliver these fairer and larger tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners because we are prepared to make some very, very significant and progressive changes to the tax system, with reforms to negative gearing, capital gains tax, discounts, family trusts, and dividend imputation. Of course, all are opposed by the conservatives because they want to keep the benefits of those tax-avoidance mechanisms going to the top end of town.


Of course, it's not just about tax. We understand that, in addition to tax cuts, we need to make sure that we protect people's penalty rates. Those opposite, of course, have sat by while people's penalty rates have been lost. One of the most significant changes in this budget is this government's decision to flatten our tax system, meaning that somebody earning $40,000 a year and somebody earning $200,000 a year will be in the same tax bracket. Now, how on earth could that be fair? As we have said time and time again, we certainly do not want to see an $80 billion handout to big business, especially when $17 billion of it is going to the big banks.


I want to finish by talking about something that's very dear to my heart, and that is, of course, the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I'm very glad to see that the government has finally come to acknowledge that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is, and always has been, fully funded, even though this lot opposite have spent years undermining the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The government has tried to say that people have to put up with cuts to family tax benefits, cuts to the energy supplement, cuts to Newstart, cuts to pensions and cuts to paid parental leave—all of these cuts were used as excuses; they were apparently needed to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Of course, last year, the Treasurer said with great fanfare that we needed a tax rise on the lowest-income people in the country to fund the NDIS. All of this was false. People with disability were used as a political football. It was a complete and utter disgrace on the part of both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Playing politics with people with disability, holding people with disability to ransom in this way, must never happen again. It is now time for all of us to focus on making sure that the NDIS actually fulfils the promise that I would hope we all have see in it, which is to improve the lives of people with disability.


We are all getting hundreds and hundreds of calls from people who feel let down and frustrated with the rollout of the NDIS. People want this government and this minister to step up and actually fix the problems with the NDIS. They don't want them blaming people with disability; they actually want the problems fixed. Let's get it back on track. Fix the ICT system. Don't treat it like a big bureaucracy which is driving people to enormous frustration. We all want a people-centred organisation. It has to actually be about helping people with disability and their families to lead the lives that they want for themselves—a life of independence, if possible, so people are able to work, have fun, live in the community and have a decent home. That's the promise of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It's a promise that Labor is absolutely determined to see delivered, and this government should do likewise.

Ms STANLEY
 (Werriwa) (18:11):  I rise to make my contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2018-2019 and the related bills and to add the voice of my community, which would have liked to have seen a fairer budget which addressed the needs of people all over our electorate—people who tell me every day they're struggling with higher costs, electricity bills, lack of parking, traffic jams, high childcare costs and cuts to school, TAFE and university. Yet, instead of addressing the concerns of the people in my electorate, this budget continues with a handout to big business and the big banks. The residents in my electorate of Werriwa have suffered thanks to the government's ideological war against Medicare and public health care. The Liberals have cut from Medicare and hospitals every year since the 2014 budget. The assault has continued in this budget, which cuts $2.8 billion from hospitals between the next election and 2025. Under this government, the national average waiting time for elective surgery is the longest on record, the number of people presenting at emergency departments is the highest on record, and the number of hospital beds available for elderly Australians is the lowest on record.


This crisis was felt on a local level with the debacle around the closure and reopening of two after-hours GP clinics in my electorate. In mid-December, with zero public consultation, it was announced that after-hours GP clinics at Liverpool and Campbelltown hospitals would be closing on New Year's Eve and in early January. Following an outcry from the community and pressure from me and the member for Macarthur, they announced in March that they would reopen the after-hours clinics. Both are now well away from the hospitals they had been connected to. The connection of the two clinics to their respective hospitals had helped ease the pressure on the emergency departments located there. Worse still, the new Liverpool clinic had moved out of the Liverpool CBD and across the Georges River to the suburb of Moorebank, into an area not easily accessible by public transport for the people of my electorate.


The importance of easing the pressure on emergency departments can't be overstated. There were 7.8 million emergency department presentations in 2016-17—one million more than five years ago. This level of growth is putting our hospitals and their staff under immense pressure. They need more funding to keep up. People living in south-west Sydney have been hit particularly hard by this. Hospitals like Liverpool are dealing with this increase and the increases that come with ageing populations, as well as with the huge growth in population from Sydney's south-west suburban fringes. Hospitals like Liverpool will benefit from Labor's alternative budget through a $2.8 billion better hospitals fund. As a result of this, hospitals like Liverpool will have more doctors, nurses, health staff and beds in the emergency departments. This is important. This is needed. And this will make a real difference in the lives of ordinary Australians. Unfortunately, this government is giving an $80 billion handout to big business and the banks instead of funding health. We don't need a tax giveaway to the banks. We need to get people off long waiting lists for hip operations, knee replacements and cataract removal. 


With the 2018 budget, the Turnbull government has locked in huge education cuts, using them to pay for the tax handouts to big business, cutting $17 billion for schools and giving $17 billion to big banks, and we've seen from the royal commission they don't need it. In the strange world that this government inhabits, banking executives have been hauled before a royal commission and seem to be more deserving of a handout than the kids in my electorate, who have all the talent and potential in the world but not enough resources at their local school to realise that potential. 


I believe Australian families would prefer their taxes going to schools, universities and TAFE, and not big business. But, sadly, TAFE is also having its funding slashed as a result of this budget and the New South Wales state Liberal government. With an extra $270 million cut from TAFE and training, this allows for more than $3 billion in cuts since the government came to power in 2013. Australia now has 140,000 fewer apprentices than we did when the Liberals were first elected.


South-west Sydney is a rapidly growing area. With the construction of Badgery's Creek Airport, there are great opportunities for work for local people. I want the young and the unemployed of Werriwa to benefit from this growth. Unfortunately, this government's war on vocational education means that tomorrow's carpenters, plumbers and bricklayers who build the infrastructure in growth areas won't come locally, but may have to come from foreign worker visa holders. This skills shortage is wholly manufactured by this government, which does not see the purpose of a strong TAFE system, and which has set out to dismantle it at every opportunity. The community thinks otherwise, and so do we on our side of the House. 


A Shorten Labor government will scrap up-front fees for 100,000 TAFE students who choose to learn the skills that Australia needs. Despite high unemployment in some areas, workers can't learn the skills that industries are crying out for, and that we have shortages—like carpenters, bricklayers, bakers or pastry chefs. The TAFE system has proved itself over and over again to be the best place for young Australians to develop these skills, and it's Labor's policy to scrap the up-front fees, making it easier for Australians to get the skills they need for a trade, a traineeship, and then a quality job. 


But we won't just stop there. Labor will invest $100 million in modernising TAFE facilities around the country. We'll guarantee at least two out of three Commonwealth training dollars goes to TAFE. We'll ensure one in every 10 jobs in the Commonwealth priority projects are filled by Australian apprentices. We'll provide 10,000 pre-apprentice programs from young people who want to learn a trade, and 20,000 adult apprentice programs for older workers who need to retrain. Labor will abolish the Prime Minister's unfair cap on university student places, meaning the number of Australians getting an education at university will soar to around 200,000, undoing the government's $2.2 billion cut from universities last December. 


Ninety per cent of the jobs created in the coming years will need a university or TAFE qualification. We recognise this. We will invest in education. For all the government's bluster in the lead-up to the budget, you would be forgiven for thinking that, despite this budget's many failings, there would at least be some much-needed infrastructure proposals, and some much-needed proposals that would help build our nation. Unfortunately, the budget included no new money for infrastructure. Every project announced in the budget was funded from previous allocations. There are no plans to lift investment over years and years of cuts. It is another hoax.


Government infrastructure grants to the states, in fact, will fall over each of the next four years—from the promised $8 billion in 2017-18 to $4.5 billion in 2021-22. Commonwealth infrastructure investment over the next decade will fall from 0.4 per cent of GDP to 0.2 per cent. This is a worry for all Australians, but particularly for people living in the outer suburbs of rapidly expanding cities like Melbourne and my home town of Sydney. While the Prime Minister has been making promises over the last six months, the budget wrongly does not seem to be doing anything to actually bring these promises to fruition.


In March, there was much fanfare as the Western Sydney City Deal was announced, and there was an announcement by the Prime Minister that there would be a rail line to Badgerys Creek airport. But the budget includes no money to build this railway line, just $50 million to prepare a business case. With the airport set to open in 2026, we really need to start building the airport line soon. This isn't good enough, but it is what we've come to expect. In this government's first four budgets, investment was $4.7 billion less than was promised.


In Werriwa, residents are all too familiar with this under-investment. Commuter car parks are full by 7:00 am. If you're lucky enough to find a park, the trains are overcrowded. If you drive, the roads are congested. People are being pushed further and further away from the major employment and transport hubs because of the cost of housing. Only 30 per cent of the people who live in the Liverpool local government area also work in it. Seventy per cent of working people who live in my electorate drive to work and only 12 per cent use public transport. Sixty-nine per cent of the journeys on the M5 experience delays, and trains from Liverpool to Central take close to double the time in peak hour than they did in 1975—the journey took 37 minutes in 1975 but now, if you're lucky, it's 63 minutes. Aside from Leppington and Edmondson Park stations, which opened in 2015, and Holsworthy, which opened in 1987, every other train station in my region was opened in the 19th century. South-west Sydney demands real infrastructure spending for real projects. The government has failed us, just like it has on many other things. Labor has shown itself to be the party that will address Australia's infrastructure needs and make meeting the needs of my growing community a major priority.


If you need any further evidence that this is an unfair budget full of hoaxes, look no further than aged care. The government trumpeted 14,000 new in-home aged-care packages over the next four years—3,500 a year. While any increase is welcome, 14,000 is far from adequate; it's merely a drop in the ocean. As of December last year, waiting lists sat at 105,000, and grew by 20,000 in the last six months of 2017 alone. Almost 82,000 of those people waiting have high needs, many with dementia. The government refuses to give us more up-to-date figures. Given our ageing population, the waiting lists will then no doubt continue to grow, and the crisis in aged care will become more acute year after year. Although welcome, 3,500 additional aged-care packages a year are simply not enough. How will the government fund these additional packages? It seems by taking it out of residential care. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are performing a deception, moving money from A to B. And while older Australians are still waiting in care, the government is unable to find any additional funding to address the waiting lists of over 100,000. But it has managed to find the $80 billion tax cut for big business and $17 billion for the big banks.


Budgets are always about choices. What is concerning for me is this budget does not choose the people of my electorate or of Australia. It continues with tax cuts for corporate Australia when it should be supporting students at school, TAFE or university. It should support health care and our older Australians. It should provide infrastructure to make people's lives more bearable. The choices should be fairer and take into account all of us, particularly those in my electorate.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  It being approximately 6:30 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 192(b). The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

Ms MADELEINE KING
 (Brand) (18:24):  One of the many things I enjoy about my role as a member of parliament for Brand in Western Australia is visiting schools throughout the communities of Rockingham and Kwinana, attending their Anzac Day ceremonies and their special assemblies, and seeing how much has changed and, moreover, how this country has changed very much for the better. Happily, long gone are the days when students would sing at school assemblies, as I remember doing, God Save the Queen and Land of Hope and Glory—a triumphant hymn that I, as a child, thought was about Australia. I was devastated at my father's revelation to me that my enthusiastic singing was directed to the United Kingdom half a world away—somewhere I had never seen, had never been to and had nothing to do with. I suspect that this early loss and disappointment marked the time I became determined to see the day when an Australian could be our head of state.


Much has changed since I was a young girl. I was at Bertram Primary School recently to present an Indigenous flag and an Australian flag. Two young students, speaking in Noongar language, acknowledged that the land upon which the school rests is the land of the Noongar people of the Whadjuk nation. They paid their respects to their eldest past and present. These two young people are the emerging Noongar leaders we speak of when we acknowledge the custodianship of the land. Watching two young Noongar students acknowledging their land and their elders on behalf of all present at their assembly in the first language of Whadjuk country was remarkable. I remember the moment distinctly and I remember thinking how far we thankfully have come since I was seven at school at Safety Bay, singing British hymns and not for one moment learning or thinking about Indigenous Australia and its vast culture and history.


I feel sad at practically every welcome to country ceremony I attend and acknowledgement of country that I witness. My response is from a deep sorrow of how rotten the British-led occupation of this continent has been for those who have been here for eons, before us newcomers. Also, my sadness is borne out of regret for what we, as newcomers to this land, have missed out on by our centuries-old practice of dominating every culture we find, taking whatever we want and dismissing languages and lives we don't care to understand. Luckily for us newcomers, Indigenous Australians have millennia-old practice of patience and care for this land. Sixty-five thousand years on this continent is an eternity for human purposes. New Australians exploiting this continent for 230 years is but the blink of an eye in relation to that endless time line. But those short 230 years have devastated Indigenous Australia. Nonetheless, our Indigenous sisters and brothers are patient with us and continue to try to share their extraordinary culture, history and knowledge of country with us with good humour and generosity, despite our ignorance and despite how long it has taken us, as new Australians, to understand what we have missed out on. An example of this generosity took place outside this place on the forecourt near the mosaic based on Michael Nelson Jagamara's 'Possum and Wallaby Dreaming'. On the 30th anniversary of the opening of this Australian Parliament House and the welcome to country and smoking ceremony conducted by the Ngunnawal siblings, Tina and Adrian Brown, Aunty Tina reflected on this nation's history and said, 'Here, now, the bones of my ancestors mix with the bones of your ancestors.' In so doing, she recognised modern Canberra, modern history and today's Australia. We are all here now, and that will always be the case.


I've said before in this place that the young people of this country will be called upon to make important social reforms in this country happen. Those in school today will be those voting on a referendum to ensure Indigenous Australians and their eternal ownership of this land is recognised in our Constitution. School students across Rockingham and Kwinana and across the country are so much more aware of Indigenous Australia than students such as I was 30 years ago. Young people in this country acknowledge the traditional ownership of this land and they are taught the truth and they accept the truth. They have a tremendous opportunity to learn and share in 65,000 years of Indigenous culture and knowledge. I think it is inevitable that this nation will adopt the recommendations of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. First Nations people should not have to wait to watch a lacklustre conservative government throw up their collective hands and claim it is all too hard and that the Constitution is somehow sacred and not to be changed. It can be changed and it should be changed. If members in this place fail to show leadership, young people will demand change because what is required will be so obvious to them.


From the higher levels of La tour Eiffel, you can look at the magnificent city of Paris. All of Paris surrounds you. You can see the artwork of Lena Nyadbi of the Gija people. Her painting Dayiwul Lirlmim shows the world the barramundi scales reimagined on the vast roof of Le musee du quai Branly. From the Eiffel Tower on the banks of the River Seine, the world sees the dreaming of her homeland, Dayiwul country, in the vast Kimberley in remarkable Western Australia.


 In Germany the Central Australian Aboriginal Women's Choir sang the songs the German Lutheran mission brought to Australia 140 years ago. They traditional hymns were translated into Western Arrernte and Pitjantjatjara and sung for a century in our central desert before returning to the cathedrals of Germany, carried on the voices of Aboriginal women.


Emily Kame Kngwarreye has been recognised as one of the world's greatest painters, compared favourably as she has widely been with Claude Monet, Henri Matisse and Jackson Pollock. Emily Kngwarreye was born in 1910 in the desert area north-east of Alice Springs known as Utopia. It an obituary published in London's The Independent in 1996 it was said:


… she carried aboriginal art beyond the limited sphere of ethnographic curiosity into the broad stream of contemporary culture.


Through these examples and many more, Indigenous Australia contributes to the art and culture of the world and a greater understanding of our collective humanity.


And the gift that Emily Kngwarreye shared with us all proved our shared humanity and continues to prove it and its wonderful creativity, as how could a tiny Aboriginal woman from the central desert area of the Northern Territory, who didn't see a white man until she was nine, possibly know who Monet, Matisse or Pollock were or have been influenced by their great works? Her brief artistic life, which started when she was 78 and ended when she left this earth aged 86, demonstrates the wonders that exist within Indigenous Australia in the remote communities and in urban communities around this country.


Indigenous Australians are feted around the world and increasingly at home. The recent Songlines: Tracking the Seven Sisters exhibition at the National Museum of Australia told all of us who viewed it the epic tale of ancestral beings traversing this vast, ancient continent from west to east and represented in the cluster of stars known by the Ancient Greeks as the Pleiades. The songlines captured in the dreaming of the Seven Sisters predate any of the epic Ancient Greek legends by thousands of years just as the First Nations people have lived here for literally tens of thousands of years before humans even arrived in Europe, let alone created civilisations such as Ancient Greece. I think it's worth thinking about time and how the way we think of time as newcomers to this country is so different to the otherworldly, eternal time of Indigenous Australia and Indigenous Australians that have created vast songlines, stories and art that they are willing to share with the whole of the world.


Across the nation people are celebrating Reconciliation Week, which this year commences on the 51st anniversary of the 1967 referendum and concludes on the 26th anniversary of the Mabo native title decision in the High Court. Both events are epic stories of modern Indigenous Australia, and there is one more epic story to come, and that is how this nation will come, quite literally, to just terms with Indigenous Australia, and how it embraces the Uluru Statement from the Heart, delivered to this place one year ago.


When I see the art of Indigenous Australia, when I meet with the people in my community and experience their generosity, I wonder what this government and conservatives across the country are afraid of in not embracing the Uluru Statement from the Heart. In relation to the hysteria that erupted after the Mabo decision, Paul Keating said in Redfern in 1992:


… that there is nothing to fear or to lose in the recognition of historical truth, or the extension of social justice, or the deepening of Australian social democracy to include Indigenous Australians.


…   …   …


… there is everything to gain.


There is everything to gain. And I say also that there is everything to gain in listening to Indigenous Australia, in seeking to adopt in our hearts the Uluru Statement from the Heart. There's everything to gain from us seeking to reach agreements with First Nations People across the country and embracing a makarrata commission that will help with our collective need for truth-telling. There's everything gain and nothing to fear for everyone fortunate enough to call Australia home in delivering the First Nations of Australia a voice enshrined in the Constitution.


No matter who governs this country, eventually young Australians like the two young Noongar students at Bertram Primary School, their classmates and all the young people across my electorate and across the nation that have grown up knowing the truth of Australian history and are fortunate enough to share in the rich culture of First Nations People will change the nation. They will recognise properly the place of Indigenous Australia if we fail to. I look forward to the day that it happens and I undertake to do all I can to ensure that day comes as soon as possible.
