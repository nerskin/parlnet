Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (09:32):  Today I continue my remarks on the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 so that the Senate may have the opportunity to consider this crucially important matter. Freedom of thought, freedom of belief, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of the press are fundamental to the rule of law. For the rule of law to function properly, a country's citizens must be able to observe, comment and critique the existence or non-existence of laws, the making of laws and the application thereof in the court system.


These freedoms are so critical to the very existence of a strong democracy and an acceptable way of life. They are recognised in international treaties and conventions, to which Australia is a party. At the same time these freedoms I refer to must be both well coupled and well balanced with protection against defamation, vilification, obscenity, sedition, copyright, commercial confidentiality, contempt of court and national security.


When the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was originally passed by parliament, the intent of the legislation was obviously the prohibition of racial discrimination and, in particular, to make provision for giving effect to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. However, subsequent amendments to the act have in fact created a serious imbalance between freedom of speech and racial discrimination. In particular, section 18C of the act restricts even objective and fair-minded opinion and expression.


The amendment proposed by the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill is very minor. It simply removes the words 'offend' and 'insult'. Those other words 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' remain. If this bill is passed, the original intent of the act will be restored and both freedom of speech and the protection against racial discrimination will be able to coexist in proper equilibrium. Reasonable people do not support racial discrimination; however, reasonable people do support and defend their very precious freedom of speech, expression and opinion. 


I would like to indicate that I intend to be the person moving conclusion of the debate, not one of my co-sponsors, and further indicate that it is my intention to adjourn debate at the conclusion of the allocated time today so that other senators may have the opportunity to speak on the bill at a later date.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (09:35):  Today I rise in support of the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 which seeks to remove two words, 'insult' and 'offend', from section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.


The motivations behind my advocacy for this bill are mirrored in some of the strongly worded phrases from colleagues like Senator Brandis when he said: 


Section 18C, as presently worded, has no place in a society that values freedom of expression and democratic governance.


And also these words by our Prime Minister:


Expression or advocacy should never be unlawful merely because it is offensive.


I agree wholeheartedly with them. It defies common sense for it to be illegal to make statements that are likely to insult or offend an individual or a group.


So I stand proudly here today knowing that I have devoted much of my time in public life to defending free speech. This defence has consisted mainly of my opposition to the toxic, destructive doctrine of political correctness. My co-sponsoring of this bill is a continuation of this fight. It is yet another episode in the battle to preserve the fundamental freedoms we so often see under attack in this country. These threats are sometimes well-intentioned but, despite this, they have damaging implications for our way of life and for the freedoms we enjoy. 


Before those on the other side of this debate or the leftist commentariat dismiss my contributions as the ranting of some conservative, let's have a look at exactly who supports changing section 18C. I want to quote again:


My personal view is that 18C probably reached a bit far. The mere fact that you insult our offend somebody probably should not of itself give rise to legal liability—


they are the words of human rights lawyer Julian Burnside QC suggesting that 'speech which ""insults a group"" is arguably going too far' and that this part of the act might need 'a bit of finetuning'.


Let's look at another supporter, David Marr, a person who I would hazard a guess does not agree with conservatives on many things. Mr Marr has said: 


… in a free and energetic society, giving offence is necessary.


…   …   …


Offence and insults are the everyday reality of free discourse.


And:


Hurt feelings should never attract the law as they do now under section 18C.


Even former AWU Secretary, Paul Howes, called the racial discrimination act an:


Orwellian law that, probably, should not be there.


Then we have Jim Spigelman, the ABC chairman and former Chief Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court, who says: 


I am not aware of any international human rights instrument, or national anti-discrimination statute in another liberal democracy, that extends to conduct which is merely offensive.


And:


The freedom to offend is an integral component of freedom of speech. There is no right not to be offended.


Even ABC journalist Chris Uhlmann has said that 18C is:


… an insidious, creeping assault on free speech.


Mark Leibler from the Australian Jewish community has said that:


If all the government wants to remove the word offend, I think at the end of the day everyone could live with that.


Journalist David Penberthy wrote earlier this year:


The changes should be supported by people who believe in the importance of freedom of expression.


And:


There's a difference between being offended by a reasonably held view, and being the victim of a sustained and generalised campaign to smear your collective name. 


I also recall Senator Bullock's opinions in his first speech in this place. He said:


To be tolerant of your views I do not need to pretend that you are just as right as I am but rather to accept that you have a perfect right to hold a view I believe to be wrong, even if I find your view offensive.


That is a brief and in no way exhaustive list of people who may disagree with Liberals and conservatives on something or all things, yet we have managed to find common ground on the need to reform section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in defence of freedom of speech. They join a list of people like Janet Albrechtsen, Piers Akerman, Nick Cater and John Roskam, just to name a few, who are joined together in seeking to strengthen free speech and bolster the ability of all Australians to get involved in the battle of ideas.


The broad political and public support for freedom of speech is also reflected in the co-sponsors of this bill: four senators from three different parties. I applaud my friend and colleague Senator Day for initiating this bill. I am grateful to Senators Leyonhjelm and Smith for their courage in co-sponsoring this bill along with me. It certainly reflects well on and it is a credit to this parliament and this chamber that representatives from three different parties can come together to protect every Australian's right to free speech.


I have to confess that, in all honesty, I was disappointed by the government's decision to drop its plans to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Throughout 2012 and 2013, when Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister said that 'the coalition would repeal section 18C in its current form'—that we would 'change section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act so that merely giving offence is not a ground for a successful prosecution'. We took that to the Australian people at the last election. I do understand that governments have competing priorities to deal with and sometimes concessions have to be made and priorities realigned. But I did sincerely hope that our nation would be mature enough to handle discussions about counter-terrorism laws, on one hand, alongside honest debate about freedom of speech, on the other hand, and that one would not necessarily push aside the other to accommodate the due concerns of a small section of our community. But, in the end, that decision was made, and it has resulted in this private senators bill being debated today.


The bill being debated today does not go as far as what was originally proposed by the coalition. It provides some finetuning, if you will: the simple removal of two words—and I hope that the fact that it is so simple encourages more of my colleagues to support this bill should it come to a vote. Currently, section 18C goes beyond being a mere complaint. It goes beyond expressing one's outrage at something offensive. It actually makes it illegal to offend someone. It prohibits people saying things even if there is a likelihood that those words might cause offence to or insult another person. Again I quote the journalist David Penberthy. He said:


… it is possible for people to arc up about any comments which they find offensive, even if those comments are reasonably held and based on fact.


People can still find themselves taken before a legal tribunal or a court. It is simply absurd, to my way of thinking, that you could be hauled in front of a court and a judge because someone has taken offence at what you have said. It is grounds to hold someone accountable in law simply because someone else's feelings hurt.


I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act has created an Orwellian environment. This is a climate in which the tyranny of political correctness has become the price of freedom. It has become a tactic of the socially progressive agenda to decry something as offensive merely to throw it out of the public arena. 


I believe this bill provides an appropriate balance between free speech and social order. I say again: it only removes two words, 'offend' and 'insult'. It is does not touch other parts of section 18C—namely, that it is unlawful to 'humiliate or intimidate another person or a group' based on their race or ethnicity. Those provisions will remain in place. I just want to make that clear. It will remain unlawful to humiliate or intimidate someone based on their race or ethnicity.


What Senator Day has initiated here is, I think, an elegant solution that strengthens free speech while also addressing the concerns of those people who thought that the government's earlier attempts in this space went too far. I would like to imagine, and the evidence suggests, that most fair-minded people should accept this position because freedom of speech is one of our most fundamental rights. I will not, now or ever, walk away from defending a commitment to free speech in this country.


Through this bill, we are defending an essential principle of our democracy. People, whatever their background, whatever their culture, whatever their religious beliefs, should be free to say what they think, and this bill strengthens all Australians' ability to do that. The best way to counteract bad ideas, quite frankly, is to shine a light on them, and you do that best through free debate rather than by pushing them into the shadows. As Janet Albrechtsen put it:


… that's the point of free debate. It is the single most effective mechanism for disposing bad ideas.


So, if you are offended by what someone says, you can say so. You can call that person out and put your opposing views forward. Silencing opposing views and views that you might not like only serves to push unsavoury ideas underground, where they fester away and become a bigger problem later on. It is much better to shine the light on them right now and expose them for the garbage that they are, and that is a true virtue of a harmonious society.


Limiting free speech only hampers our right to hear others' opinions and decide for ourselves. That is why free speech is an essential characteristic of free expression—because it renders a diversity of debate. It renders debate vibrant and alive. It is healthy for any democracy. Without that debate, we cannot make informed decisions on policies, on values and on thoughts. And I do not want that for our country.


An editorial by The Australian late last year said:


A core duty of citizens in a free society is to welcome debate on contentious subjects. A mature country that is comfortable with its own laws, cultures and traditions would defend the right to express views that some of its citizens may not agree with.


I like to think that Australia is mature enough to defend free speech in this manner. After all, meeting challenges head on is the best way to deal with them, and that is why this bill is so important.


Australians simply should not be taken to court for simply offending or insulting someone. Other safeguards are in place within this bill, the Racial Discrimination Act and a myriad of other acts for more strident offences, but causing mere offence should not be grounds for hauling someone before a judge. The Prime Minister once said:


… if free speech is to mean anything, it's others' right to say what you don't like, not just what you do.


Today, with this bill, we want to put more meaning back into free speech. The Attorney-General has said:


By making the reasonable likelihood of causing offence or insult the test of unacceptable behaviour … section 18C is a grotesque limitation on ordinary political discourse.


Today, with this bill, we want to help end that limitation.


In conclusion, I again want to quote from the Prime Minister. He said:


A 'hurt feelings' test is impossible to comply with while maintaining the fearless pursuit of truth which should be the hallmark of a society such as ours …


With this bill, we seek to maintain that fearless pursuit of truth. The famous saying often attributed to Voltaire sums up the essence of what this bill is seeking to protect. It is one we hear often but one that rings just as true today as when it was first uttered many years ago: 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.' This bill seeks to defend that great principle of our democracy, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-10-02,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (09:49):  I rise to speak on the contained in the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014. I do not think any senator here holds the view that these issues do not warrant very careful consideration. As we have said in an earlier debate on these matters, the provisions have been in place for around 20 years. I am aware even before entering political life of some of the debate about whether the balance was quite right. So, Senator Bernardi, in part I take exception at the suggestion that the debate here is the tyranny of political correctness, because I hold a view contrary to yours and I support the Labor Party's position that we should not attempt to weaken the provisions as they currently apply. 


There is not a tyranny of political correctness occurring at the moment. Instead, we have a situation where, fortunately, the Attorney-General at the Press Club yesterday indicated a somewhat new perspective on these issues, which I think is important to highlight. He told the Press Club yesterday that, in the face of a rising risk of terrorism, there could be no greater error than for Australians to demonise our fellow Islamic citizens. While I accept that there is a genuine debate about these issues, unfortunately, at this time, there are those who are happy to use this debate as a means of fanning prejudice—and that is something we must not do. 


As I said, in the past I have weighed these issues and concluded well in the past that we do indeed have the balance fairly right. I am a Victorian senator. I live in Melbourne. These issues have, as I said, flared in the past and we have addressed them. We have considered whether we have the balance right, and in my home and in my community I believe there is general acceptance of that. More recently, with the draft circulated by the Attorney-General, broader community debate concerned these issues, and that community debate, I believe, demonstrated well beyond the Melbourne community that there is a consensus that the current balance is correct. While I appreciate there are a handful of senators in this place wanting to redress these issues again, I take exception at the suggestion from Senator Bernardi that what we are dealing with is a tyranny of political correctness, because it is just not the case. 


I will come in a moment to why it would be better to see some greater leadership in how we deal with some of these issues; but, before I do, I want to address one other issue raised by Senator Bernardi in his contribution, because he suggests to us that just removing 'taking offence; is no big deal, that it is not an issue. I want to share with you an anecdote—gosh! it is almost 30 years old now—about taking offence. In my youth it highlighted to me that sometimes, indeed, the law is an ass. I was on my way to work one morning, taking a train in inner Melbourne, and there was a flasher near the station. I thought, 'That's a bit concerning.' I was not particularly offended by it, but I was aware that there had been reported rapes in the vicinity of that station. So I took time out that day to attend the police at Flinders Street Station, and I was astounded to hear from the police that they were not prepared to take a statement from me about this incident unless I was prepared to say 'I was offended'. So please do not pretend that simply removing 'taking offence' is insignificant in legal terms, as Senator Bernardi did, because it is not. The notion of taking offence moves through our laws in so many interesting ways and, on that occasion, it demonstrated to me that sometimes our law is an ass. We could not address personal safety and security issues for women without me being prepared to say 'I had taken offence'. That is simply bizarre.   


So I thought that on this occasion I would go and look at some of the applications—perhaps those that are bit less notorious than the Andrew Bolt incident—and bring to the Senate's attention some of the uses of the provisions as they currently stand.


Before I do so, I will again reiterate the Labor Party's position: we indeed introduced section 18C and we will fight to retain it. We, along with many other Australians, have campaigned in the streets to protect it and we will vote in this parliament to oppose any attempt to weaken the vital protections it contains against the scourge of racist hate speech.


Section 18C is a critical element of Australia's antidiscrimination framework, which has served our country well for 20 years. It strengthens the rich fabric of Australia's successful multicultural community. Section 18C appropriately balances freedom of speech with the right of all Australians to live in dignity, free from bigotry and the destructive, divisive effects of racially-motivated hate speech. This is the Labor Party's position, and we are proud of it. As I mentioned, coming from Melbourne, I am particularly proud of the balance that we are able to achieve amongst a very vibrant, diverse community. As I said before, we have never wavered on these provisions and we will not. Almost two decades of experience has convincingly demonstrated that this is the right policy for Australia, and the community response to the draft highlights that further.


As we have seen, the coalition's position, though, is much less clear. Indeed, numerous senators have co-sponsored this bill, and it is now before us. It is been reported, though, that as many as 10 coalition senators wished to add their names to this bill, only to be overruled by the Prime Minister's office. So perhaps I should highlight that this is perhaps more than the handful that I first indicated.


But we in the Labor Party believe that Australia's political leaders ought to focus their energies on bringing people together and protecting social cohesion that underpins our proud and successful multicultural community. It is disappointing that some voices from within the coalition seem to feel that their energies are better directed at prosecuting an agenda of intolerance, bigotry, fear and hatred. I am sure that is not all senators who are involved in supporting this bill. I am sure that for some they have not yet worked through the issues I have in the past in assessing whether we have the balance right. But then, equally, at this point in time they fall easily into the trap, as highlighted by Peter Hartcher today in TheSydney Morning Herald, of working with those who really are only interested in fanning prejudice. And that is an association that I would encourage senators to think carefully about. If coalition senators are going to vote in favour of this bill they should be honest with the Australian people about what they are actually voting for. The contribution from Senator Bernardi simply referring to 'a limited view' about what the impact of taking offence out of the provisions would be and glib comments about the 'tyranny of political correctness' does not indeed do that.


Section 18C has been used to combat the vilest forms of hate speech; behaviour which the Labor Party believes has no place, not only in Australian society but in any civilised society. In the case of Jones v Toben, section 18C was used to combat infamous Holocaust denier, Fredrick Toben, who sickeningly claimed that there is serious doubt about the Holocaust actually occurring. He also claimed that it is unlikely that there were homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz, that Jewish people who are offended by and challenge Holocaust denial are of limited intelligence, and that some Jewish people, for financial gain, exaggerated the number of Jews murdered during World War II and the circumstances in which they were murdered.


The Labor Party does not believe that this sickening attack has any place in Australian society. If coalition senators want to vote to support Fredrick Toben and his ilk, then the Australian people will judge them accordingly. It is easy to say that we should out these sorts of views and their exposure will diminish them, but I think that is far less than clear.


In the case of Hobart Hebrew Congregation v Scully, a Hobart woman was restrained from distributing hate mail in letterboxes and at a public market which described Jewish people as 'leeches' who were involved in 'destroying white society' and using 'predatory tactics'.


In the case of Campbell v Kirstenfeldt, a Perth man was found to have breached section 18C by repeatedly calling his neighbour, an Indigenous woman, deeply offensive racists names and telling her to go 'back to the scrub where you belong'. The abuse was often made in the presence of Campbell's family and friends.


We, in the Labor Party, say that this sort of behaviour has no place in Australia. Senators who vote for this bill are compromising the strong standards that we currently have that have been demonstrated by the outcomes of these cases under section 18C. But they are also contributing to a broader concerning issue. In his address to the Press Club yesterday, Senator Brandis has perhaps moved away from the notion that you have a right to be a bigot. I hope he has. I hope he has seen the error in what was hopefully a glib question time expression from the comments he indicated yesterday. I do not believe there is a right to be a bigot and I would be interested to see the vote in this chamber on the actual question.


As I indicated previously, I have weighed up these issues in the past and I do believe that the current provisions have the balance right. Now that I have heard some of the argument about how innocuous it would be to remove the notion of taking offence, I will revisit this and I will have another look at that point. As I highlighted from my experience, the notion of offence is deep within the law's consideration of many matters and it is, I think, a bit deceptive to suggest that simply removing the taking of offence will not compromise the standards as they currently exist. 


I want to conclude on one point and that is a point I alluded to earlier about leadership. Where is the political leadership on some of these issues? I was taken back to this point when I read The Sydney Morning Herald today and Peter Hartcher makes the point that Tony Abbott has implicitly endorsed, he says:


their dirty, divisive, dogwhistle politics to appease them—


referring to two government members' plans around, on this occasion, the issue of wearing a burqa in Parliament House. Peter Hartcher says:


Instead of winking at their intolerance, a real leader would have shut them down in a moment of crisis.


But he has not. He has not been able to shut them down. A real leader would be in that position. Instead, what we have seen from our current leader in relation to section 18 C was the fanning of this issue in the lead-up to the last election. It was deliberately fanned. Looking at the Bolt case, the Prime Minister was more concerned about Andrew Bolt than about those who felt they had been vilified.


The coalition indicated that in government they would deal with this issue, and the Attorney-General distributed the draft paper—and I think Senator Bernardi, in commending Senator Day on the current provisions in this bill, seemed to imply that even he accepted the draft paper went too far. And it did. As I said before, the community accepted that they went too far. This was not my narrow but somewhat proud experience of community life in Melbourne; this was a broad, cross-Australian cry that, in response to the Andrew Bolt case, this government on this issue was going too far.


So, Senator Day, I will be interested in looking at the broader implications of removing 'offend', because I am convinced it is nowhere near as simple as Senator Bernardi has suggested. But at the same time I decry the lack of genuine leadership in this area. I believe that your intentions are genuine but, over the last 18 months, I have seen this issue used solely to fan prejudice—to fan prejudice to the extent that we saw in this place, in question time, the Attorney of all people say, 'People have a right to be bigots.' And we saw the outcry over that. Senator Day, I accept that there are genuine concerns about how these provisions have operated. I have watched them over the years, I have weighed them and I have assessed that we have generally got the balance right. I have not accepted reasonably glib contributions about how insignificant the removal of 'offend' would be and I am happy to look at those issues. However, my message to all of us is: be very careful; do not allow us to be used to fan prejudice here in Australia. 


As I said, I decry the lack of leadership from our Prime Minister on this issue. He should shut down debates which will only fan prejudice, particularly as we look at issues around national security legislation. He should have shown stronger leadership earlier. He should not have fanned this debate. This should not have been an issue he campaigned on before the last election which has led to the situation where we were told we have 'a right to be bigots'. I hope to hear other senators in this debate disassociate themselves from that view. I do not believe any member of this Senate genuinely believes that here in Australia we have a right to be bigots. 


I accept that the balance of these provisions are something that it is appropriate for us to consider, but it is not a new debate. It is not something that has not been considered over the years and, in my view and in the Labor Party's view, we do indeed have that balance right. The Prime Minister should be exercising more leadership to promote social cohesion and fairness and the Australian way of life, rather than allowing coalition senators to join here and fan the prejudice— (Time expired)

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2014-10-02,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:09):  I speak in support of the bill to remove 'insult' and 'offend' from section 18C of the Radical Discrimination Act. Mr Abbott says we need to adjust the delicate balance between freedom and security. Let me give him a tip. When you make decisions that authoritarians such as jihadists would approve of, like preventing people from saying what they think, when you threaten to haul journalists before courts and into jail and when you introduce provisions that give your security organisations the power to snoop on your own people, you have got the balance wrong. In fact, whenever you throw away the freedoms others have fought and died for, you have got the balance wrong. Mr Shorten says this is not the time to be removing the government censorship that is 18C on account of maintaining national unity. Sorry, Mr Shorten, but free speech does not have a timetable. Either you believe that we are entitled to say what we think or you don't. Either you believe this is a free country or you don't. Either you get the first line of the national anthem or you don't. In times of trouble true leaders speak for a nation about what they stand for, not which freedoms they have decided to give away. 


I fear that Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten are not true leaders. When they talk about freedom there is always a 'but' to be found nearby. They believe in freedom but not if someone might have their feelings hurt. They believe in freedom but not all the time. They believe in freedom but will vote the same way that barbarians would vote. A lot of people, I suspect, are sick of hearing about democracy's 'but'. Those, like Mr Shorten, who believe we need to keep 18C for the sake of national unity do not seem to understand that democracies were never meant to be places of unity. That is a feature of fascist and communist regimes and, dare I say it, Islamist regimes. 


The difference that characterises a democracy is its greatest strength, because it means that propositions are put to the test of public deliberation. People who make national unity arguments in a democracy probably do not understand democracy at all. Unfortunately, when it comes to section 18C, opinions are protected from public deliberation, in part because people are considered too 'weak' or 'vulnerable' and somehow incapable of bearing too much reality. Of all the people in the world, surely Australians are not so fragile or so gullible. 


Questions of Aboriginality and Australian identity are matters of great public importance. They should be debated on the basis of evidence. Likewise, the Palestinian question is a matter that also should be debated and assessed on its merits. The Andrew Bolt and Mike Carlton controversies illustrate the silliness of this uncommonly silly law. I have no time for racism and other types of vilification, but we cannot have a situation where important matters are closed off from debate because of the potential for someone to claim that they have hurt feelings. Both Bolt and Carlton may have made some errors, but the remedy for errors of fact is a correction, an apology or even defamation proceedings. Section 18C gives certain people an extra remedy based on an arbitrary characteristic, which is a departure from the rule of law. In short, it is not a bad time to repeal 18C in the name of national unity; rather it is a good time to repeal section 18C in the name of national diversity.


When the government first suggested changes to the Racial Discrimination Act much was made of the connection between offence and insult—words I wish to see removed from the act—and subsequent racial violence. But while vilification might incite violence, there is no evidence that to offend or insult someone is to incite violence against that person. Indeed what evidence we have shows the opposite effect, because words often serve to replace violence.


As the law currently stands, instead of issues being debated and ideas criticised, toxic attitudes are driven underground or through the wires of the internet. This implicitly justifies handing over increased powers to Australia's security agencies so that the speakers of various nasty words can be watched over by the powers that be. 


If people were free to speak, there would be less need for such surveillance. We would all know which imams think young Australian Muslims should fight in Iraq and Syria and we would also identify those who believe all Muslims to be terrorists. 


Racial incitement and racial vilification are crimes, because it is possible for a reasonable person to identify them and for evidence of their effects to prevail in court. Offence and insult, by contrast, should not attract even a civil remedy because their effects are subjective, capable only of assessment by the person who chooses to take exception to them. 


Last week there were repeated calls for Tony Abbott to pull his dissenting senators into line on section 18C. This strikes me as contradictory for the simple reason that many of those now making calls for party discipline will, when I introduce my marriage equality bill, demand that Tony Abbott grant a conscience vote. 


I commend to my fellow senators Edmund Burke's speech to the electors of Bristol. In it Burke points out that a political representative owes his party and constituents not only his industry but also his independent judgement. People are elected to this place on the understanding that they have their own minds. It is not possible in my view to engage your conscience selectively. You either use your mind or you do not. Senators and members, to paraphrase Bourke, ought to be faithful friends and devoted servants of their parties and constituents but not flatterers. 


With this bill, senators get a chance to not just vote on their position on government censorship but also reveal a bit about themselves. Some of you, I know, are passionate supporters of freedom of speech and will be voting to repeal 18C. I congratulate Senator Day for introducing the bill and I congratulate those who will show the courage of their convictions by crossing the floor. 


Then we have those who oppose the bill, because they disagree with it. At least you have the courage of convictions, but under what authority can you constrain freedom of speech of others while being protected by parliamentary privilege? Why is it okay for you to enjoy freedom of speech but not for other Australians? Do you accept this privilege because you are a senator and your constituents are not; or do you think your constituents are too fragile or stupid to manage a debate amongst themselves? When you prevent someone from expressing their thoughts, you are, in fact, insulting them. 


And then there are those who support Senator Day's bill but are voting against it anyway for the sake of expediency or some misguided belief in party loyalty. I would remind you that voting against this bill will not be an act of party loyalty but an act of betrayal on your electors.


I commend the bill to the Senate. I put it to you that if you are one of those people who vote this down, that maybe you do not believe in anything much at all. I commend the bill to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (10:20):  I also rise this morning to speak on the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014, brought to this Senate by Senator Day, which I have chosen to co-sponsor. I do not think my decision to co-sponsor this bill will come as a surprise to those in this place or to those outside it who have closely followed the debate of reform of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. I do not doubt the sincerity of those who have spoken or those who have yet to speak. A serious issue like this requires a serious and sincere debate. 


As I noted in my contribution to an urgency motion in this debate just some weeks ago, I was an enthusiastic supporter of the government's proposals to reform the law in this area. As can sometimes occur, unexpected developments in the international arena meant the priorities of the government had to change, and I accept that. However, an independent senator has now brought a bill to the parliament that presents an opportunity to achieve reform that I believe is important in underpinning and protecting one of our most cherished rights in Australia: the right of all of us to the freedom of speech. That is, as will be well known to us, a founding principle of our democracy. To put it simply, I do not believe that the most effective way to uphold your values is to loosen your principles. I do not believe you do not uphold your values by loosening your principles.


The right to live in freedom, to speak freely and to treat with respect and dignity those who may hold different views from ourselves is the key difference between ourselves and those who would wish to do us harm. As the Prime Minister has noted, those who now pose a security threat to Australia do not hate us because of anything we have done; they hate us because of what we are and who we are: a stable, a mature and a free democratic society that not merely tolerates but celebrates diversity in all its forms—racial, religious, political, sexual, cultural. This has long been the case. Our record is not perfect but no nation's is. But Australia's reputation as one of the world's freest and most tolerant societies goes back many decades, certainly before 1995. 


Tolerance in Australia did not simply materialise with the advent of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Equally, it will not suddenly disappear if the words 'insult' and 'offend' are removed, which is what this bill seeks to do. I was bemused last week, when I agreed to co-sponsor this bill, to be described by Labor's spokesman as a radical senator. I have been called many things but that is a first. This is not a radical proposal. It is actually a minimalist proposal which highlights a simple point. In the end, our core philosophical difference in this place relates to the role of government. Many of those opposite believe that the government and legislation and regulation can and should cure all society's ills. 


The simple fact is there are limits to what legislation can achieve. You cannot legislate to make people believe something or think a certain way, and that is certainly not the role of this parliament. That is the problem with section 18C as it currently exists. It criminalises the holding of an opinion and that is wrong. I may not like your opinion, but the idea that you can be taken to court and charged and fined for holding it is antithetical to that principle of freedom on which this nation and its core values are based.


I noted some comment last week in the media that retaining section 18C might be a way to combat hate preachers. Again, with respect, I do not find that argument especially compelling. If someone is so irrational and so filled with prejudice and hatred that they engage in the sort of preaching that urges the followers of a religion, a political party or some other organisation to physically attack or degrade those of a different view, I am not sure why anyone would think that two words in a piece of legislation are going to stop them. Irrational people—and that is what hate preachers are—do not sit down and think through the legal implications of their actions. It is much like those opposed to reform of section 18C arguing that change will lead to a torrent of racist abuse in our streets. Again, the thug who physically assaults someone because of their religious beliefs or launches into a racist rant generally will not be the type to pause and think, 'I better not do this because section 18C makes it illegal to offend and assault someone.' Those people are irrational and by definition are not capable of that logical thought process.


The ugly Cronulla riots in 2005 are often cited by supporters of section 18C as the sort of behaviour they are keen to stamp out but, as I have noted before, the Cronulla riots occurred 10 years after section 18C came into being. Section 18C manifestly did nothing to prevent those rights and those charged as a result of those riots were charged with criminal offences under different statutes, as they should have been.


The biggest problem with section 18C at present is it does not do anything to combat racism; it merely serves to hide it. Hiding the problem is not good enough. Our job in this parliament is not to create a better appearance but to create a better Australia. I want racists, bigots and, dare I say, homophobes to air their ugly prejudicial views so that they can be shown for what they are. We can only defeat racism and prejudices through argument and a clear demonstration that the facts do not support the bigots. If we shut down discussion, if we use legislation to declare certain subjects somehow off limits, then we have not defeated the problem; we have merely hidden the problem. Pushed into the darkness, the ugliness will simply continue to fester.


I was also struck by the words of Senator Bullock, a Labor senator, who said in his first speech in this place:


To be tolerant of your views I do not need to pretend that you are just as right as I am but rather to accept that you have a perfect right to hold a view I believe to be wrong, even if I find your view offensive.


That is a crucial point. A free and mature democracy does not have to accord all views equal weight in public discourse but it does need to permit people the right to express them. President Obama, who I suspect knows a good deal more than many of us in this place about what it is like to be attacked on the basis of race, made his view very clear. He said:


When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance you don't really have to do anything—you just let them talk.


In preparing my contribution for this morning I looked at Hansard from the mid-1990s when the Keating government's racial hatred legislation was being debated. In the course of perusing that material I came across this contribution:


… under this bill all that is necessary to create a civil offence is for someone to feel offended, insulted or humiliated. In other words, all that is necessary to create a civil offence … for someone to have hurt feelings.


It continues:


… the best argument against bad taste is not to make it illegal. What we need to combat racism is argument, not censorship; we need exposure, not suppression.


I would have applauded those comments in November 1994 as much as I do today. I thank the member for Warringah, the now Prime Minister, for making them.


As I have noted in some earlier contributions to Senate debates on this subject, tone is very important. We can disagree but we should do so respectfully. So it has been somewhat surprising that all the hectoring, finger-pointing, misrepresentation and name-calling in this debate has come from those who believe they are paragons of tolerance and virtue in our community, even in our parliament. During question time in the other place yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition said that I and others who support this bill are wanting to give the green light to racist, hate speech. 


Let me make this plain, in terms even the Leader of the Opposition should be able to understand, I will not be lectured on racism and xenophobia by this man, I will not. I will not be lectured to about racism and xenophobia by a man who less than one month ago stood before a crowd of unionists on a flat-bed truck in Adelaide and gave the most disgraceful, racist and xenophobic speech any Australian political leader has given in decades. His speech that day was so appalling and so embarrassing that, at first, his own office refused to transcribe or distribute it. It was so disgraceful that one longtime Labor staffer described it as 'an inexcusable performance that stank with racist rhetoric'. The claims of those opposite to be guardians of racial tolerance in Australia might ring a little truer if a single one of them had taken their leader to task over his disgusting contribution. Unsurprisingly, none of them have. 


I said at the beginning of this debate that I fully accept that developments in relation to national security required the government to reprioritise its own plans to reform section 18C. Nonetheless, this Senate is now being presented with a bill that will enhance the right of all Australians, no matter what their racial or religious background is, to freedom of speech. As I have just shown, the view that the best way to combat offensive view is to expose rather than suppress is one that transcends the usual party political boundaries. I encourage, with all of my heart and with the greatest of sincerity, senators to demonstrate their confidence in the fundamental decency and intelligence of our fellow Australians by supporting this bill. I also seek leave to continue my remarks.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-10-02,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:33):  Earlier this week, a 26-year-old Muslim woman was bashed and thrown off a train at Batman railway station in Melbourne. The attack was vicious and completely unprovoked. The victim did not know the attacker, had not talked to the attacker and was attacked purely on the religious faith she held based on the clothes she wore. This is a reprehensible and disgusting act, and police are still looking for the person responsible. I hope they find them very soon. I believe that the fundamental purpose of government is to protect the weak from the strong, to ensure that we have a community where everyone can feel safe and contribute without fear of being vilified, where the circumstances of someone's birth or religious beliefs do not affect the opportunities available to them or how they are treated. No-one should fear that they will be vilified when walking down the street, going to work, catching the train or listening to the radio.


The Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 is a debate on what values we as a nation hold as core values, on what we as a nation believe is important. Do Australians really believe it is more important to protect the so-called right of people to vilify others even when it comes at the expense of the right of people not to be vilified? I do not think they do. 


One of the co-sponsors of this bill, Senator Leyonhjelm, has said previously that his political philosophy is grounded in the philosophical principles of John Stuart Mill:


That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.


I would argue that in this case section 18C as it stands would be thoroughly supported by John Stuart Mill, because it fulfils his requirement for the exercising of power. It prevents harm to others. Because it is harmful to others when they hear their names slandered on national syndicated radio. It is harmful to others when they are humiliated and insulted based on ethnicity or religion, and it is harmful to others to be demeaned because of the faith they practise or the garments that they wear to practise this faith. 


Senator Leyonhjelm and others with his views will argue whether it is up to this place to regulate such behaviour. Once again, taking the views of his beloved John Stuart Mill, I would like to quote chapter four on liberty, where he states: 


As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion.


To hammer that point home: as soon as any part of a person's conduct effects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it. That means it is a perfectly legitimate act of this place and the other place, even within Senator Leyonhjelm's own ideological framework, to legislate against despicable racist acts and slurs. Senator Leyonhjelm and others in this place cannot argue for the freedoms espoused by Mill if they do not also accept where he believes power should be exercised by the state. They cannot cherry pick from Mill when it serves their own interests. 


As the body responsible for creating legislation as the duly elected, freely chosen body of the people, it is therefore this parliament's right, indeed its duty, to improve the general welfare by enacting laws that prevent people from prejudicing the interests of others. This is what this parliament has done. It is what this parliament did almost forty years ago when the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was passed through this parliament during the government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. The act has served this nation well since that time. 


Unfortunately, racism has not been eradicated completely but it is important that the fight against it is continued. Mr Whitlam gave an eloquent explanation as to why racism was so abhorrent in the 1972 debate in the other place when he said: 


Racism is the ultimate violence because it begins and ends with the denial of man's basic humanity. 


Does Australia really want to be a place that espouses denying people's humanity through hate speech? Senators Bernardi and Smith are also co-sponsors of this bill and, Senator Smith, I was surprised that you were co-sponsoring this bill. You said you didn't think anyone was. Trust me: I was—not with anybody else, but with you I was. 


Months ago Mr Abbott told us that changes to the Racial Discrimination Act were no longer being considered. Mr Abbott said: 


It's off the table, it's gone, it's disappeared …


But now, Mr Abbott's own senators have come into this place and sought to make changes to section 18C that Mr Abbott promised would not happen. This is another broken promise by Mr Abbott and he really needs to get his house in order.  If Mr Abbott really believes himself to be captain of Team Australia, then he should show some leadership and tell his forward line to stop attacking the other members of the team. 


Senator Bernardi has told this place time and time again that he is in favour of free speech, that he believes in freedom; except Senator Bernardi also seeks to ban the religious garments of Islam. I find it hypocritical when senators come into this place advocating for the freedom to vilify and hate on the one hand but wish to deny freedom of religious practice for others. This is what freedom means to Senator Bernardi. People should be free to do whatever they like as long as Senator Bernardi approves. 


Are senators really in this place to advocate for hatred and against tolerance? I think they need to have a good hard look at their conscience and realise that they are here to legislate for the benefit of all Australians. This bill has generated great interest from both sides of the debate; however, I believe that when we look at the bills in this place, we have to ask ourselves a number of questions: who will this change harm? Who would this change benefit? Will this improve the general welfare? Why would a senator in this place support this legislation?


Looking at these questions, the answers seem quite clear. The changes in this bill will harm decent, upstanding law-abiding members of culturally and linguistically diverse communities. It will harm decent, upstanding members of our community who seek to practice their religion peacefully without harming others.


So, who will this change benefit? Unfortunately, this change would benefit those that seek to insult and offend people based on their religious beliefs or ethnicity. Will this bill improve general welfare? In addition to the harm to others, it also does great harm to our society. Radicalism rises when we tell people that they are not welcome and when we say that Australia has no issue with allowing our culturally and linguistically diverse citizens to be vilified based on race or religion.


Which brings us to our final question: why would a senator in this place support this change? I would just like to take a moment to quote from the then member for Isaacs, Mr Clayton, during the 1975 debate in the House, when he spoke of those who opposed the introduction of the Racial Discrimination Act. He said:


… I still have no possible explanation of why he is really opposed to this legislation except to conclude that what he really seeks is to perpetuate in this country the existing situation in which people can and do commit acts which discriminate against people of particular races and hide behind supposed rights at law in order to protect themselves from being brought to justice for committing these acts.


And that is the crux of this bill and this debate.


We, too, must conclude that senators Bernardi, Day, Smith and Leyonhjelm, through the sponsorship of this bill, seek to allow people to commit acts which discriminate against people of particular races and hide behind supposed rights at law in order to protect themselves from being brought to justice for committing these acts.


I know that some senators do not always necessarily treat this place as they should but I do have to say that I find this bill quite disgusting.


Debate adjourned.

"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2014-10-02,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (09:32):  Today I continue my remarks on the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 so that the Senate may have the opportunity to consider this crucially important matter. Freedom of thought, freedom of belief, freedom of opinion and expression, and freedom of the press are fundamental to the rule of law. For the rule of law to function properly, a country's citizens must be able to observe, comment and critique the existence or non-existence of laws, the making of laws and the application thereof in the court system.


These freedoms are so critical to the very existence of a strong democracy and an acceptable way of life. They are recognised in international treaties and conventions, to which Australia is a party. At the same time these freedoms I refer to must be both well coupled and well balanced with protection against defamation, vilification, obscenity, sedition, copyright, commercial confidentiality, contempt of court and national security.


When the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was originally passed by parliament, the intent of the legislation was obviously the prohibition of racial discrimination and, in particular, to make provision for giving effect to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. However, subsequent amendments to the act have in fact created a serious imbalance between freedom of speech and racial discrimination. In particular, section 18C of the act restricts even objective and fair-minded opinion and expression.


The amendment proposed by the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill is very minor. It simply removes the words 'offend' and 'insult'. Those other words 'humiliate' and 'intimidate' remain. If this bill is passed, the original intent of the act will be restored and both freedom of speech and the protection against racial discrimination will be able to coexist in proper equilibrium. Reasonable people do not support racial discrimination; however, reasonable people do support and defend their very precious freedom of speech, expression and opinion. 


I would like to indicate that I intend to be the person moving conclusion of the debate, not one of my co-sponsors, and further indicate that it is my intention to adjourn debate at the conclusion of the allocated time today so that other senators may have the opportunity to speak on the bill at a later date.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2014-10-02,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (09:35):  Today I rise in support of the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 which seeks to remove two words, 'insult' and 'offend', from section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.


The motivations behind my advocacy for this bill are mirrored in some of the strongly worded phrases from colleagues like Senator Brandis when he said: 


Section 18C, as presently worded, has no place in a society that values freedom of expression and democratic governance.


And also these words by our Prime Minister:


Expression or advocacy should never be unlawful merely because it is offensive.


I agree wholeheartedly with them. It defies common sense for it to be illegal to make statements that are likely to insult or offend an individual or a group.


So I stand proudly here today knowing that I have devoted much of my time in public life to defending free speech. This defence has consisted mainly of my opposition to the toxic, destructive doctrine of political correctness. My co-sponsoring of this bill is a continuation of this fight. It is yet another episode in the battle to preserve the fundamental freedoms we so often see under attack in this country. These threats are sometimes well-intentioned but, despite this, they have damaging implications for our way of life and for the freedoms we enjoy. 


Before those on the other side of this debate or the leftist commentariat dismiss my contributions as the ranting of some conservative, let's have a look at exactly who supports changing section 18C. I want to quote again:


My personal view is that 18C probably reached a bit far. The mere fact that you insult our offend somebody probably should not of itself give rise to legal liability—


they are the words of human rights lawyer Julian Burnside QC suggesting that 'speech which ""insults a group"" is arguably going too far' and that this part of the act might need 'a bit of finetuning'.


Let's look at another supporter, David Marr, a person who I would hazard a guess does not agree with conservatives on many things. Mr Marr has said: 


… in a free and energetic society, giving offence is necessary.


…   …   …


Offence and insults are the everyday reality of free discourse.


And:


Hurt feelings should never attract the law as they do now under section 18C.


Even former AWU Secretary, Paul Howes, called the racial discrimination act an:


Orwellian law that, probably, should not be there.


Then we have Jim Spigelman, the ABC chairman and former Chief Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court, who says: 


I am not aware of any international human rights instrument, or national anti-discrimination statute in another liberal democracy, that extends to conduct which is merely offensive.


And:


The freedom to offend is an integral component of freedom of speech. There is no right not to be offended.


Even ABC journalist Chris Uhlmann has said that 18C is:


… an insidious, creeping assault on free speech.


Mark Leibler from the Australian Jewish community has said that:


If all the government wants to remove the word offend, I think at the end of the day everyone could live with that.


Journalist David Penberthy wrote earlier this year:


The changes should be supported by people who believe in the importance of freedom of expression.


And:


There's a difference between being offended by a reasonably held view, and being the victim of a sustained and generalised campaign to smear your collective name. 


I also recall Senator Bullock's opinions in his first speech in this place. He said:


To be tolerant of your views I do not need to pretend that you are just as right as I am but rather to accept that you have a perfect right to hold a view I believe to be wrong, even if I find your view offensive.


That is a brief and in no way exhaustive list of people who may disagree with Liberals and conservatives on something or all things, yet we have managed to find common ground on the need to reform section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in defence of freedom of speech. They join a list of people like Janet Albrechtsen, Piers Akerman, Nick Cater and John Roskam, just to name a few, who are joined together in seeking to strengthen free speech and bolster the ability of all Australians to get involved in the battle of ideas.


The broad political and public support for freedom of speech is also reflected in the co-sponsors of this bill: four senators from three different parties. I applaud my friend and colleague Senator Day for initiating this bill. I am grateful to Senators Leyonhjelm and Smith for their courage in co-sponsoring this bill along with me. It certainly reflects well on and it is a credit to this parliament and this chamber that representatives from three different parties can come together to protect every Australian's right to free speech.


I have to confess that, in all honesty, I was disappointed by the government's decision to drop its plans to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Throughout 2012 and 2013, when Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister said that 'the coalition would repeal section 18C in its current form'—that we would 'change section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act so that merely giving offence is not a ground for a successful prosecution'. We took that to the Australian people at the last election. I do understand that governments have competing priorities to deal with and sometimes concessions have to be made and priorities realigned. But I did sincerely hope that our nation would be mature enough to handle discussions about counter-terrorism laws, on one hand, alongside honest debate about freedom of speech, on the other hand, and that one would not necessarily push aside the other to accommodate the due concerns of a small section of our community. But, in the end, that decision was made, and it has resulted in this private senators bill being debated today.


The bill being debated today does not go as far as what was originally proposed by the coalition. It provides some finetuning, if you will: the simple removal of two words—and I hope that the fact that it is so simple encourages more of my colleagues to support this bill should it come to a vote. Currently, section 18C goes beyond being a mere complaint. It goes beyond expressing one's outrage at something offensive. It actually makes it illegal to offend someone. It prohibits people saying things even if there is a likelihood that those words might cause offence to or insult another person. Again I quote the journalist David Penberthy. He said:


… it is possible for people to arc up about any comments which they find offensive, even if those comments are reasonably held and based on fact.


People can still find themselves taken before a legal tribunal or a court. It is simply absurd, to my way of thinking, that you could be hauled in front of a court and a judge because someone has taken offence at what you have said. It is grounds to hold someone accountable in law simply because someone else's feelings hurt.


I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act has created an Orwellian environment. This is a climate in which the tyranny of political correctness has become the price of freedom. It has become a tactic of the socially progressive agenda to decry something as offensive merely to throw it out of the public arena. 


I believe this bill provides an appropriate balance between free speech and social order. I say again: it only removes two words, 'offend' and 'insult'. It is does not touch other parts of section 18C—namely, that it is unlawful to 'humiliate or intimidate another person or a group' based on their race or ethnicity. Those provisions will remain in place. I just want to make that clear. It will remain unlawful to humiliate or intimidate someone based on their race or ethnicity.


What Senator Day has initiated here is, I think, an elegant solution that strengthens free speech while also addressing the concerns of those people who thought that the government's earlier attempts in this space went too far. I would like to imagine, and the evidence suggests, that most fair-minded people should accept this position because freedom of speech is one of our most fundamental rights. I will not, now or ever, walk away from defending a commitment to free speech in this country.


Through this bill, we are defending an essential principle of our democracy. People, whatever their background, whatever their culture, whatever their religious beliefs, should be free to say what they think, and this bill strengthens all Australians' ability to do that. The best way to counteract bad ideas, quite frankly, is to shine a light on them, and you do that best through free debate rather than by pushing them into the shadows. As Janet Albrechtsen put it:


… that's the point of free debate. It is the single most effective mechanism for disposing bad ideas.


So, if you are offended by what someone says, you can say so. You can call that person out and put your opposing views forward. Silencing opposing views and views that you might not like only serves to push unsavoury ideas underground, where they fester away and become a bigger problem later on. It is much better to shine the light on them right now and expose them for the garbage that they are, and that is a true virtue of a harmonious society.


Limiting free speech only hampers our right to hear others' opinions and decide for ourselves. That is why free speech is an essential characteristic of free expression—because it renders a diversity of debate. It renders debate vibrant and alive. It is healthy for any democracy. Without that debate, we cannot make informed decisions on policies, on values and on thoughts. And I do not want that for our country.


An editorial by The Australian late last year said:


A core duty of citizens in a free society is to welcome debate on contentious subjects. A mature country that is comfortable with its own laws, cultures and traditions would defend the right to express views that some of its citizens may not agree with.


I like to think that Australia is mature enough to defend free speech in this manner. After all, meeting challenges head on is the best way to deal with them, and that is why this bill is so important.


Australians simply should not be taken to court for simply offending or insulting someone. Other safeguards are in place within this bill, the Racial Discrimination Act and a myriad of other acts for more strident offences, but causing mere offence should not be grounds for hauling someone before a judge. The Prime Minister once said:


… if free speech is to mean anything, it's others' right to say what you don't like, not just what you do.


Today, with this bill, we want to put more meaning back into free speech. The Attorney-General has said:


By making the reasonable likelihood of causing offence or insult the test of unacceptable behaviour … section 18C is a grotesque limitation on ordinary political discourse.


Today, with this bill, we want to help end that limitation.


In conclusion, I again want to quote from the Prime Minister. He said:


A 'hurt feelings' test is impossible to comply with while maintaining the fearless pursuit of truth which should be the hallmark of a society such as ours …


With this bill, we seek to maintain that fearless pursuit of truth. The famous saying often attributed to Voltaire sums up the essence of what this bill is seeking to protect. It is one we hear often but one that rings just as true today as when it was first uttered many years ago: 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.' This bill seeks to defend that great principle of our democracy, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-10-02,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (09:49):  I rise to speak on the contained in the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014. I do not think any senator here holds the view that these issues do not warrant very careful consideration. As we have said in an earlier debate on these matters, the provisions have been in place for around 20 years. I am aware even before entering political life of some of the debate about whether the balance was quite right. So, Senator Bernardi, in part I take exception at the suggestion that the debate here is the tyranny of political correctness, because I hold a view contrary to yours and I support the Labor Party's position that we should not attempt to weaken the provisions as they currently apply. 


There is not a tyranny of political correctness occurring at the moment. Instead, we have a situation where, fortunately, the Attorney-General at the Press Club yesterday indicated a somewhat new perspective on these issues, which I think is important to highlight. He told the Press Club yesterday that, in the face of a rising risk of terrorism, there could be no greater error than for Australians to demonise our fellow Islamic citizens. While I accept that there is a genuine debate about these issues, unfortunately, at this time, there are those who are happy to use this debate as a means of fanning prejudice—and that is something we must not do. 


As I said, in the past I have weighed these issues and concluded well in the past that we do indeed have the balance fairly right. I am a Victorian senator. I live in Melbourne. These issues have, as I said, flared in the past and we have addressed them. We have considered whether we have the balance right, and in my home and in my community I believe there is general acceptance of that. More recently, with the draft circulated by the Attorney-General, broader community debate concerned these issues, and that community debate, I believe, demonstrated well beyond the Melbourne community that there is a consensus that the current balance is correct. While I appreciate there are a handful of senators in this place wanting to redress these issues again, I take exception at the suggestion from Senator Bernardi that what we are dealing with is a tyranny of political correctness, because it is just not the case. 


I will come in a moment to why it would be better to see some greater leadership in how we deal with some of these issues; but, before I do, I want to address one other issue raised by Senator Bernardi in his contribution, because he suggests to us that just removing 'taking offence; is no big deal, that it is not an issue. I want to share with you an anecdote—gosh! it is almost 30 years old now—about taking offence. In my youth it highlighted to me that sometimes, indeed, the law is an ass. I was on my way to work one morning, taking a train in inner Melbourne, and there was a flasher near the station. I thought, 'That's a bit concerning.' I was not particularly offended by it, but I was aware that there had been reported rapes in the vicinity of that station. So I took time out that day to attend the police at Flinders Street Station, and I was astounded to hear from the police that they were not prepared to take a statement from me about this incident unless I was prepared to say 'I was offended'. So please do not pretend that simply removing 'taking offence' is insignificant in legal terms, as Senator Bernardi did, because it is not. The notion of taking offence moves through our laws in so many interesting ways and, on that occasion, it demonstrated to me that sometimes our law is an ass. We could not address personal safety and security issues for women without me being prepared to say 'I had taken offence'. That is simply bizarre.   


So I thought that on this occasion I would go and look at some of the applications—perhaps those that are bit less notorious than the Andrew Bolt incident—and bring to the Senate's attention some of the uses of the provisions as they currently stand.


Before I do so, I will again reiterate the Labor Party's position: we indeed introduced section 18C and we will fight to retain it. We, along with many other Australians, have campaigned in the streets to protect it and we will vote in this parliament to oppose any attempt to weaken the vital protections it contains against the scourge of racist hate speech.


Section 18C is a critical element of Australia's antidiscrimination framework, which has served our country well for 20 years. It strengthens the rich fabric of Australia's successful multicultural community. Section 18C appropriately balances freedom of speech with the right of all Australians to live in dignity, free from bigotry and the destructive, divisive effects of racially-motivated hate speech. This is the Labor Party's position, and we are proud of it. As I mentioned, coming from Melbourne, I am particularly proud of the balance that we are able to achieve amongst a very vibrant, diverse community. As I said before, we have never wavered on these provisions and we will not. Almost two decades of experience has convincingly demonstrated that this is the right policy for Australia, and the community response to the draft highlights that further.


As we have seen, the coalition's position, though, is much less clear. Indeed, numerous senators have co-sponsored this bill, and it is now before us. It is been reported, though, that as many as 10 coalition senators wished to add their names to this bill, only to be overruled by the Prime Minister's office. So perhaps I should highlight that this is perhaps more than the handful that I first indicated.


But we in the Labor Party believe that Australia's political leaders ought to focus their energies on bringing people together and protecting social cohesion that underpins our proud and successful multicultural community. It is disappointing that some voices from within the coalition seem to feel that their energies are better directed at prosecuting an agenda of intolerance, bigotry, fear and hatred. I am sure that is not all senators who are involved in supporting this bill. I am sure that for some they have not yet worked through the issues I have in the past in assessing whether we have the balance right. But then, equally, at this point in time they fall easily into the trap, as highlighted by Peter Hartcher today in TheSydney Morning Herald, of working with those who really are only interested in fanning prejudice. And that is an association that I would encourage senators to think carefully about. If coalition senators are going to vote in favour of this bill they should be honest with the Australian people about what they are actually voting for. The contribution from Senator Bernardi simply referring to 'a limited view' about what the impact of taking offence out of the provisions would be and glib comments about the 'tyranny of political correctness' does not indeed do that.


Section 18C has been used to combat the vilest forms of hate speech; behaviour which the Labor Party believes has no place, not only in Australian society but in any civilised society. In the case of Jones v Toben, section 18C was used to combat infamous Holocaust denier, Fredrick Toben, who sickeningly claimed that there is serious doubt about the Holocaust actually occurring. He also claimed that it is unlikely that there were homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz, that Jewish people who are offended by and challenge Holocaust denial are of limited intelligence, and that some Jewish people, for financial gain, exaggerated the number of Jews murdered during World War II and the circumstances in which they were murdered.


The Labor Party does not believe that this sickening attack has any place in Australian society. If coalition senators want to vote to support Fredrick Toben and his ilk, then the Australian people will judge them accordingly. It is easy to say that we should out these sorts of views and their exposure will diminish them, but I think that is far less than clear.


In the case of Hobart Hebrew Congregation v Scully, a Hobart woman was restrained from distributing hate mail in letterboxes and at a public market which described Jewish people as 'leeches' who were involved in 'destroying white society' and using 'predatory tactics'.


In the case of Campbell v Kirstenfeldt, a Perth man was found to have breached section 18C by repeatedly calling his neighbour, an Indigenous woman, deeply offensive racists names and telling her to go 'back to the scrub where you belong'. The abuse was often made in the presence of Campbell's family and friends.


We, in the Labor Party, say that this sort of behaviour has no place in Australia. Senators who vote for this bill are compromising the strong standards that we currently have that have been demonstrated by the outcomes of these cases under section 18C. But they are also contributing to a broader concerning issue. In his address to the Press Club yesterday, Senator Brandis has perhaps moved away from the notion that you have a right to be a bigot. I hope he has. I hope he has seen the error in what was hopefully a glib question time expression from the comments he indicated yesterday. I do not believe there is a right to be a bigot and I would be interested to see the vote in this chamber on the actual question.


As I indicated previously, I have weighed up these issues in the past and I do believe that the current provisions have the balance right. Now that I have heard some of the argument about how innocuous it would be to remove the notion of taking offence, I will revisit this and I will have another look at that point. As I highlighted from my experience, the notion of offence is deep within the law's consideration of many matters and it is, I think, a bit deceptive to suggest that simply removing the taking of offence will not compromise the standards as they currently exist. 


I want to conclude on one point and that is a point I alluded to earlier about leadership. Where is the political leadership on some of these issues? I was taken back to this point when I read The Sydney Morning Herald today and Peter Hartcher makes the point that Tony Abbott has implicitly endorsed, he says:


their dirty, divisive, dogwhistle politics to appease them—


referring to two government members' plans around, on this occasion, the issue of wearing a burqa in Parliament House. Peter Hartcher says:


Instead of winking at their intolerance, a real leader would have shut them down in a moment of crisis.


But he has not. He has not been able to shut them down. A real leader would be in that position. Instead, what we have seen from our current leader in relation to section 18 C was the fanning of this issue in the lead-up to the last election. It was deliberately fanned. Looking at the Bolt case, the Prime Minister was more concerned about Andrew Bolt than about those who felt they had been vilified.


The coalition indicated that in government they would deal with this issue, and the Attorney-General distributed the draft paper—and I think Senator Bernardi, in commending Senator Day on the current provisions in this bill, seemed to imply that even he accepted the draft paper went too far. And it did. As I said before, the community accepted that they went too far. This was not my narrow but somewhat proud experience of community life in Melbourne; this was a broad, cross-Australian cry that, in response to the Andrew Bolt case, this government on this issue was going too far.


So, Senator Day, I will be interested in looking at the broader implications of removing 'offend', because I am convinced it is nowhere near as simple as Senator Bernardi has suggested. But at the same time I decry the lack of genuine leadership in this area. I believe that your intentions are genuine but, over the last 18 months, I have seen this issue used solely to fan prejudice—to fan prejudice to the extent that we saw in this place, in question time, the Attorney of all people say, 'People have a right to be bigots.' And we saw the outcry over that. Senator Day, I accept that there are genuine concerns about how these provisions have operated. I have watched them over the years, I have weighed them and I have assessed that we have generally got the balance right. I have not accepted reasonably glib contributions about how insignificant the removal of 'offend' would be and I am happy to look at those issues. However, my message to all of us is: be very careful; do not allow us to be used to fan prejudice here in Australia. 


As I said, I decry the lack of leadership from our Prime Minister on this issue. He should shut down debates which will only fan prejudice, particularly as we look at issues around national security legislation. He should have shown stronger leadership earlier. He should not have fanned this debate. This should not have been an issue he campaigned on before the last election which has led to the situation where we were told we have 'a right to be bigots'. I hope to hear other senators in this debate disassociate themselves from that view. I do not believe any member of this Senate genuinely believes that here in Australia we have a right to be bigots. 


I accept that the balance of these provisions are something that it is appropriate for us to consider, but it is not a new debate. It is not something that has not been considered over the years and, in my view and in the Labor Party's view, we do indeed have that balance right. The Prime Minister should be exercising more leadership to promote social cohesion and fairness and the Australian way of life, rather than allowing coalition senators to join here and fan the prejudice— (Time expired)

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2014-10-02,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (10:09):  I speak in support of the bill to remove 'insult' and 'offend' from section 18C of the Radical Discrimination Act. Mr Abbott says we need to adjust the delicate balance between freedom and security. Let me give him a tip. When you make decisions that authoritarians such as jihadists would approve of, like preventing people from saying what they think, when you threaten to haul journalists before courts and into jail and when you introduce provisions that give your security organisations the power to snoop on your own people, you have got the balance wrong. In fact, whenever you throw away the freedoms others have fought and died for, you have got the balance wrong. Mr Shorten says this is not the time to be removing the government censorship that is 18C on account of maintaining national unity. Sorry, Mr Shorten, but free speech does not have a timetable. Either you believe that we are entitled to say what we think or you don't. Either you believe this is a free country or you don't. Either you get the first line of the national anthem or you don't. In times of trouble true leaders speak for a nation about what they stand for, not which freedoms they have decided to give away. 


I fear that Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten are not true leaders. When they talk about freedom there is always a 'but' to be found nearby. They believe in freedom but not if someone might have their feelings hurt. They believe in freedom but not all the time. They believe in freedom but will vote the same way that barbarians would vote. A lot of people, I suspect, are sick of hearing about democracy's 'but'. Those, like Mr Shorten, who believe we need to keep 18C for the sake of national unity do not seem to understand that democracies were never meant to be places of unity. That is a feature of fascist and communist regimes and, dare I say it, Islamist regimes. 


The difference that characterises a democracy is its greatest strength, because it means that propositions are put to the test of public deliberation. People who make national unity arguments in a democracy probably do not understand democracy at all. Unfortunately, when it comes to section 18C, opinions are protected from public deliberation, in part because people are considered too 'weak' or 'vulnerable' and somehow incapable of bearing too much reality. Of all the people in the world, surely Australians are not so fragile or so gullible. 


Questions of Aboriginality and Australian identity are matters of great public importance. They should be debated on the basis of evidence. Likewise, the Palestinian question is a matter that also should be debated and assessed on its merits. The Andrew Bolt and Mike Carlton controversies illustrate the silliness of this uncommonly silly law. I have no time for racism and other types of vilification, but we cannot have a situation where important matters are closed off from debate because of the potential for someone to claim that they have hurt feelings. Both Bolt and Carlton may have made some errors, but the remedy for errors of fact is a correction, an apology or even defamation proceedings. Section 18C gives certain people an extra remedy based on an arbitrary characteristic, which is a departure from the rule of law. In short, it is not a bad time to repeal 18C in the name of national unity; rather it is a good time to repeal section 18C in the name of national diversity.


When the government first suggested changes to the Racial Discrimination Act much was made of the connection between offence and insult—words I wish to see removed from the act—and subsequent racial violence. But while vilification might incite violence, there is no evidence that to offend or insult someone is to incite violence against that person. Indeed what evidence we have shows the opposite effect, because words often serve to replace violence.


As the law currently stands, instead of issues being debated and ideas criticised, toxic attitudes are driven underground or through the wires of the internet. This implicitly justifies handing over increased powers to Australia's security agencies so that the speakers of various nasty words can be watched over by the powers that be. 


If people were free to speak, there would be less need for such surveillance. We would all know which imams think young Australian Muslims should fight in Iraq and Syria and we would also identify those who believe all Muslims to be terrorists. 


Racial incitement and racial vilification are crimes, because it is possible for a reasonable person to identify them and for evidence of their effects to prevail in court. Offence and insult, by contrast, should not attract even a civil remedy because their effects are subjective, capable only of assessment by the person who chooses to take exception to them. 


Last week there were repeated calls for Tony Abbott to pull his dissenting senators into line on section 18C. This strikes me as contradictory for the simple reason that many of those now making calls for party discipline will, when I introduce my marriage equality bill, demand that Tony Abbott grant a conscience vote. 


I commend to my fellow senators Edmund Burke's speech to the electors of Bristol. In it Burke points out that a political representative owes his party and constituents not only his industry but also his independent judgement. People are elected to this place on the understanding that they have their own minds. It is not possible in my view to engage your conscience selectively. You either use your mind or you do not. Senators and members, to paraphrase Bourke, ought to be faithful friends and devoted servants of their parties and constituents but not flatterers. 


With this bill, senators get a chance to not just vote on their position on government censorship but also reveal a bit about themselves. Some of you, I know, are passionate supporters of freedom of speech and will be voting to repeal 18C. I congratulate Senator Day for introducing the bill and I congratulate those who will show the courage of their convictions by crossing the floor. 


Then we have those who oppose the bill, because they disagree with it. At least you have the courage of convictions, but under what authority can you constrain freedom of speech of others while being protected by parliamentary privilege? Why is it okay for you to enjoy freedom of speech but not for other Australians? Do you accept this privilege because you are a senator and your constituents are not; or do you think your constituents are too fragile or stupid to manage a debate amongst themselves? When you prevent someone from expressing their thoughts, you are, in fact, insulting them. 


And then there are those who support Senator Day's bill but are voting against it anyway for the sake of expediency or some misguided belief in party loyalty. I would remind you that voting against this bill will not be an act of party loyalty but an act of betrayal on your electors.


I commend the bill to the Senate. I put it to you that if you are one of those people who vote this down, that maybe you do not believe in anything much at all. I commend the bill to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2014-10-02,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (10:20):  I also rise this morning to speak on the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014, brought to this Senate by Senator Day, which I have chosen to co-sponsor. I do not think my decision to co-sponsor this bill will come as a surprise to those in this place or to those outside it who have closely followed the debate of reform of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. I do not doubt the sincerity of those who have spoken or those who have yet to speak. A serious issue like this requires a serious and sincere debate. 


As I noted in my contribution to an urgency motion in this debate just some weeks ago, I was an enthusiastic supporter of the government's proposals to reform the law in this area. As can sometimes occur, unexpected developments in the international arena meant the priorities of the government had to change, and I accept that. However, an independent senator has now brought a bill to the parliament that presents an opportunity to achieve reform that I believe is important in underpinning and protecting one of our most cherished rights in Australia: the right of all of us to the freedom of speech. That is, as will be well known to us, a founding principle of our democracy. To put it simply, I do not believe that the most effective way to uphold your values is to loosen your principles. I do not believe you do not uphold your values by loosening your principles.


The right to live in freedom, to speak freely and to treat with respect and dignity those who may hold different views from ourselves is the key difference between ourselves and those who would wish to do us harm. As the Prime Minister has noted, those who now pose a security threat to Australia do not hate us because of anything we have done; they hate us because of what we are and who we are: a stable, a mature and a free democratic society that not merely tolerates but celebrates diversity in all its forms—racial, religious, political, sexual, cultural. This has long been the case. Our record is not perfect but no nation's is. But Australia's reputation as one of the world's freest and most tolerant societies goes back many decades, certainly before 1995. 


Tolerance in Australia did not simply materialise with the advent of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act. Equally, it will not suddenly disappear if the words 'insult' and 'offend' are removed, which is what this bill seeks to do. I was bemused last week, when I agreed to co-sponsor this bill, to be described by Labor's spokesman as a radical senator. I have been called many things but that is a first. This is not a radical proposal. It is actually a minimalist proposal which highlights a simple point. In the end, our core philosophical difference in this place relates to the role of government. Many of those opposite believe that the government and legislation and regulation can and should cure all society's ills. 


The simple fact is there are limits to what legislation can achieve. You cannot legislate to make people believe something or think a certain way, and that is certainly not the role of this parliament. That is the problem with section 18C as it currently exists. It criminalises the holding of an opinion and that is wrong. I may not like your opinion, but the idea that you can be taken to court and charged and fined for holding it is antithetical to that principle of freedom on which this nation and its core values are based.


I noted some comment last week in the media that retaining section 18C might be a way to combat hate preachers. Again, with respect, I do not find that argument especially compelling. If someone is so irrational and so filled with prejudice and hatred that they engage in the sort of preaching that urges the followers of a religion, a political party or some other organisation to physically attack or degrade those of a different view, I am not sure why anyone would think that two words in a piece of legislation are going to stop them. Irrational people—and that is what hate preachers are—do not sit down and think through the legal implications of their actions. It is much like those opposed to reform of section 18C arguing that change will lead to a torrent of racist abuse in our streets. Again, the thug who physically assaults someone because of their religious beliefs or launches into a racist rant generally will not be the type to pause and think, 'I better not do this because section 18C makes it illegal to offend and assault someone.' Those people are irrational and by definition are not capable of that logical thought process.


The ugly Cronulla riots in 2005 are often cited by supporters of section 18C as the sort of behaviour they are keen to stamp out but, as I have noted before, the Cronulla riots occurred 10 years after section 18C came into being. Section 18C manifestly did nothing to prevent those rights and those charged as a result of those riots were charged with criminal offences under different statutes, as they should have been.


The biggest problem with section 18C at present is it does not do anything to combat racism; it merely serves to hide it. Hiding the problem is not good enough. Our job in this parliament is not to create a better appearance but to create a better Australia. I want racists, bigots and, dare I say, homophobes to air their ugly prejudicial views so that they can be shown for what they are. We can only defeat racism and prejudices through argument and a clear demonstration that the facts do not support the bigots. If we shut down discussion, if we use legislation to declare certain subjects somehow off limits, then we have not defeated the problem; we have merely hidden the problem. Pushed into the darkness, the ugliness will simply continue to fester.


I was also struck by the words of Senator Bullock, a Labor senator, who said in his first speech in this place:


To be tolerant of your views I do not need to pretend that you are just as right as I am but rather to accept that you have a perfect right to hold a view I believe to be wrong, even if I find your view offensive.


That is a crucial point. A free and mature democracy does not have to accord all views equal weight in public discourse but it does need to permit people the right to express them. President Obama, who I suspect knows a good deal more than many of us in this place about what it is like to be attacked on the basis of race, made his view very clear. He said:


When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance you don't really have to do anything—you just let them talk.


In preparing my contribution for this morning I looked at Hansard from the mid-1990s when the Keating government's racial hatred legislation was being debated. In the course of perusing that material I came across this contribution:


… under this bill all that is necessary to create a civil offence is for someone to feel offended, insulted or humiliated. In other words, all that is necessary to create a civil offence … for someone to have hurt feelings.


It continues:


… the best argument against bad taste is not to make it illegal. What we need to combat racism is argument, not censorship; we need exposure, not suppression.


I would have applauded those comments in November 1994 as much as I do today. I thank the member for Warringah, the now Prime Minister, for making them.


As I have noted in some earlier contributions to Senate debates on this subject, tone is very important. We can disagree but we should do so respectfully. So it has been somewhat surprising that all the hectoring, finger-pointing, misrepresentation and name-calling in this debate has come from those who believe they are paragons of tolerance and virtue in our community, even in our parliament. During question time in the other place yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition said that I and others who support this bill are wanting to give the green light to racist, hate speech. 


Let me make this plain, in terms even the Leader of the Opposition should be able to understand, I will not be lectured on racism and xenophobia by this man, I will not. I will not be lectured to about racism and xenophobia by a man who less than one month ago stood before a crowd of unionists on a flat-bed truck in Adelaide and gave the most disgraceful, racist and xenophobic speech any Australian political leader has given in decades. His speech that day was so appalling and so embarrassing that, at first, his own office refused to transcribe or distribute it. It was so disgraceful that one longtime Labor staffer described it as 'an inexcusable performance that stank with racist rhetoric'. The claims of those opposite to be guardians of racial tolerance in Australia might ring a little truer if a single one of them had taken their leader to task over his disgusting contribution. Unsurprisingly, none of them have. 


I said at the beginning of this debate that I fully accept that developments in relation to national security required the government to reprioritise its own plans to reform section 18C. Nonetheless, this Senate is now being presented with a bill that will enhance the right of all Australians, no matter what their racial or religious background is, to freedom of speech. As I have just shown, the view that the best way to combat offensive view is to expose rather than suppress is one that transcends the usual party political boundaries. I encourage, with all of my heart and with the greatest of sincerity, senators to demonstrate their confidence in the fundamental decency and intelligence of our fellow Australians by supporting this bill. I also seek leave to continue my remarks.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted? Leave denied? I call Senator Bilyk.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-10-02,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:33):  Earlier this week, a 26-year-old Muslim woman was bashed and thrown off a train at Batman railway station in Melbourne. The attack was vicious and completely unprovoked. The victim did not know the attacker, had not talked to the attacker and was attacked purely on the religious faith she held based on the clothes she wore. This is a reprehensible and disgusting act, and police are still looking for the person responsible. I hope they find them very soon. I believe that the fundamental purpose of government is to protect the weak from the strong, to ensure that we have a community where everyone can feel safe and contribute without fear of being vilified, where the circumstances of someone's birth or religious beliefs do not affect the opportunities available to them or how they are treated. No-one should fear that they will be vilified when walking down the street, going to work, catching the train or listening to the radio.


The Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 2014 is a debate on what values we as a nation hold as core values, on what we as a nation believe is important. Do Australians really believe it is more important to protect the so-called right of people to vilify others even when it comes at the expense of the right of people not to be vilified? I do not think they do. 


One of the co-sponsors of this bill, Senator Leyonhjelm, has said previously that his political philosophy is grounded in the philosophical principles of John Stuart Mill:


That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.


I would argue that in this case section 18C as it stands would be thoroughly supported by John Stuart Mill, because it fulfils his requirement for the exercising of power. It prevents harm to others. Because it is harmful to others when they hear their names slandered on national syndicated radio. It is harmful to others when they are humiliated and insulted based on ethnicity or religion, and it is harmful to others to be demeaned because of the faith they practise or the garments that they wear to practise this faith. 


Senator Leyonhjelm and others with his views will argue whether it is up to this place to regulate such behaviour. Once again, taking the views of his beloved John Stuart Mill, I would like to quote chapter four on liberty, where he states: 


As soon as any part of a person's conduct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not be promoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion.


To hammer that point home: as soon as any part of a person's conduct effects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdiction over it. That means it is a perfectly legitimate act of this place and the other place, even within Senator Leyonhjelm's own ideological framework, to legislate against despicable racist acts and slurs. Senator Leyonhjelm and others in this place cannot argue for the freedoms espoused by Mill if they do not also accept where he believes power should be exercised by the state. They cannot cherry pick from Mill when it serves their own interests. 


As the body responsible for creating legislation as the duly elected, freely chosen body of the people, it is therefore this parliament's right, indeed its duty, to improve the general welfare by enacting laws that prevent people from prejudicing the interests of others. This is what this parliament has done. It is what this parliament did almost forty years ago when the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 was passed through this parliament during the government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. The act has served this nation well since that time. 


Unfortunately, racism has not been eradicated completely but it is important that the fight against it is continued. Mr Whitlam gave an eloquent explanation as to why racism was so abhorrent in the 1972 debate in the other place when he said: 


Racism is the ultimate violence because it begins and ends with the denial of man's basic humanity. 


Does Australia really want to be a place that espouses denying people's humanity through hate speech? Senators Bernardi and Smith are also co-sponsors of this bill and, Senator Smith, I was surprised that you were co-sponsoring this bill. You said you didn't think anyone was. Trust me: I was—not with anybody else, but with you I was. 


Months ago Mr Abbott told us that changes to the Racial Discrimination Act were no longer being considered. Mr Abbott said: 


It's off the table, it's gone, it's disappeared …


But now, Mr Abbott's own senators have come into this place and sought to make changes to section 18C that Mr Abbott promised would not happen. This is another broken promise by Mr Abbott and he really needs to get his house in order.  If Mr Abbott really believes himself to be captain of Team Australia, then he should show some leadership and tell his forward line to stop attacking the other members of the team. 


Senator Bernardi has told this place time and time again that he is in favour of free speech, that he believes in freedom; except Senator Bernardi also seeks to ban the religious garments of Islam. I find it hypocritical when senators come into this place advocating for the freedom to vilify and hate on the one hand but wish to deny freedom of religious practice for others. This is what freedom means to Senator Bernardi. People should be free to do whatever they like as long as Senator Bernardi approves. 


Are senators really in this place to advocate for hatred and against tolerance? I think they need to have a good hard look at their conscience and realise that they are here to legislate for the benefit of all Australians. This bill has generated great interest from both sides of the debate; however, I believe that when we look at the bills in this place, we have to ask ourselves a number of questions: who will this change harm? Who would this change benefit? Will this improve the general welfare? Why would a senator in this place support this legislation?


Looking at these questions, the answers seem quite clear. The changes in this bill will harm decent, upstanding law-abiding members of culturally and linguistically diverse communities. It will harm decent, upstanding members of our community who seek to practice their religion peacefully without harming others.


So, who will this change benefit? Unfortunately, this change would benefit those that seek to insult and offend people based on their religious beliefs or ethnicity. Will this bill improve general welfare? In addition to the harm to others, it also does great harm to our society. Radicalism rises when we tell people that they are not welcome and when we say that Australia has no issue with allowing our culturally and linguistically diverse citizens to be vilified based on race or religion.


Which brings us to our final question: why would a senator in this place support this change? I would just like to take a moment to quote from the then member for Isaacs, Mr Clayton, during the 1975 debate in the House, when he spoke of those who opposed the introduction of the Racial Discrimination Act. He said:


… I still have no possible explanation of why he is really opposed to this legislation except to conclude that what he really seeks is to perpetuate in this country the existing situation in which people can and do commit acts which discriminate against people of particular races and hide behind supposed rights at law in order to protect themselves from being brought to justice for committing these acts.


And that is the crux of this bill and this debate.


We, too, must conclude that senators Bernardi, Day, Smith and Leyonhjelm, through the sponsorship of this bill, seek to allow people to commit acts which discriminate against people of particular races and hide behind supposed rights at law in order to protect themselves from being brought to justice for committing these acts.


I know that some senators do not always necessarily treat this place as they should but I do have to say that I find this bill quite disgusting.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (12:18):  The coalition went to the last election with a plan to alleviate pressure on the training system for medical students and graduates, and we are delivering on that commitment. To assist with an increase in recent years of the number of graduating medical students, the Australian government has committed $40 million to support up to 100 additional intern places each year in private hospitals, with priority for rural and regional areas, during this period of growth in student numbers. This will provide more certainty for students and alleviate pressure on public hospitals for training. To bolster the medical workforce in rural and regional areas, priority is being given to positions and rotations outside major metropolitan centres.


Applications for final year medical students for Commonwealth medical internships open on 19 September and close on 3 October. A list of eligible applicants will be provided to participating hospitals for recruitment by early November. This is an issue the Commonwealth takes seriously.

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (12:19):  Notwithstanding the government's modest commitment to increased training places for medical interns, at the conclusion of this training year there will be approximately 240 interns who will find themselves without access to a training place, effectively rendering their medical degrees useless. If we are prepared to make the investment in training these people, we need to ensure that we also provide them with the opportunity to obtain an medical internship to give weight to that degree. It is an important workforce measure. It is also an important measure in terms of a very critical export industry for Australia—that is, the education of overseas trained students. We should ensure that every medical student trained in an Australian university is provided with an internship at the completion of their training.

Senator SMITH:
  The government does not support this motion, because this is a matter for the Western Australian government and not the Commonwealth government. It is clear that Senator Siewert does not have the full story. Oombulgurri was formally closed in November 2011, following our coronial inquiry into five deaths in the community. Former residents have now been housed elsewhere. Houses and buildings in Oombulgurri are now been demolished due to health and safety concerns, including because some buildings contain asbestos. Infrastructure which is still in good condition, including six houses, is being retained and will be able to be used by traditional owners in the future. The government cannot support this motion and encourages Senator Siewert to reconsider the facts.

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



SOCIAL SERVICES AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2014 BUDGET MEASURES NO. 6) BILL 2014


This Bill will reintroduce a number of measures that were previously introduced in the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 1) Bill 2014 and the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 2) Bill 2014.


Most of the reintroduced measures are from the 2014 Budget. The first will, from 20 September 2014, rename the Clean Energy Supplement as the Energy Supplement, and permanently cease indexation of the payment.


The second Budget measure will implement two changes to Australian Government payments – pausing indexation for two years from 1 July 2015 of the assets value limits for all working age allowances, student payments and Parenting Payment Single, and pausing indexation for three years from 1 July 2017 of the assets test free areas for all pensions (other than Parenting Payment Single).


From Royal Assent, Disability Support Pension recipients under age 35 will be reviewed against revised impairment tables and the Program of Support requirements applied.


From 1 January 2015, the Bill will limit the six-week overseas portability period for student payments.


The Bill will also include amendments that generally limit the overseas portability period for Disability Support Pension to 28 days in a 12-month period from 1 January 2015.


Amendments will exclude from the social security and veterans' entitlements income test any payments made under the new Young Carer Bursary Programme from 1 January 2015.


Untaxed superannuation income will be included in the assessment for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card (with products purchased before 1 January 2015 by existing cardholders exempt from the new arrangements), and the portability period for cardholders will be extended from six to 19 weeks.


From 1 January 2015, relocation scholarship assistance for students relocating within and between major cities will be removed.


In the last of the Budget measures, three family payment reforms will be implemented from 1 July 2015. The first of these will limit the Family Tax Benefit Part A Large Family Supplement to families with four or more children.


Amendments will remove the Family Tax Benefit Part A per-child add-on to the higher income free area for each additional child after the first.


The Bill will improve targeting of Family Tax Benefit Part B by reducing the primary earner income limit from $150,000 a year to $100,000 a year.


Lastly, in a non-Budget amendment, the Bill will add the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision of 29 August 2013 as a pay equity decision under the Social and Community Services Pay Equity Special Account Act 2012, allowing payment of Commonwealth supplementation to service providers affected by the decision.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (12:32):  This morning, in the House, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (2014 Budget Measures No. 6) Bill 2014 was passed very quickly. That is no surprise in terms of the way the House operates with the current numbers; but, nonetheless, when our shadow minister Jenny Macklin got up to speak on the bill, she made it very clear that it could have been brought in this form up to four months ago. Directly after the budget was delivered, our leader pointed out the elements in the budget to which we were completely opposed, and they were the reductions, the cuts, to pensions. Of course, the government continues to say that they are not cuts, but everybody knows—from the seniors groups, the different community organisations and, indeed, individual pensioners themselves—that changes in the indexation to pensions constitutes a cut. So Labor said that we would not support any cuts to our pensions. 


We also said at that time that we rejected the range of attacks on people who are unemployed that were in the budget papers and that were in the original social security bills. We said that we did not believe in the attacks on people defined as 'young'—and the definition of 'young' seems to vary across various elements of legislation. However, in this legislation, 'young' is defined as people who are under 30. We said that the attacks on these young people, using the government's definition, seemingly in an attempt to encourage them into work, would require unemployed people to live without any support at all from the social welfare system for a series of rolling six-month periods. We questioned that. We clearly identified that we would not support those elements proposed by the government. 


We also went on to talk about a range of other issues. Only earlier this week I seemed to have been making a very similar contribution in this place. A range of issues in these two pieces of legislation were put before us earlier this week, and Labor opposed them—and we listed them. We also said at the very start that we were prepared to look at individual proposals on budget savings put forward by the government. Despite the rhetoric from the other side, we were not unilaterally saying that there was no need to look at the budget proposals being put forward. Despite the rhetoric from the other side, we on this side of the chamber said that we would consider the proposed budget savings that were brought forward. We would give them consideration to see whether they were effective, whether we felt they were fair and whether, within our overall budget process, our overall social welfare process, we believed that those changes would benefit our society. There was no doubt about the issues which we supported and the issues which we did not support. That was four months ago. In that time there have been innumerable meetings, to say a nothing of an extensive Community Affairs Legislation Committee process, where, again, there was no doubt about the proposals in the legislation which we supported and those with which we disagreed. Anyone looking at the report put forward by that community affairs committee would surely see the outrage, the concern, the fear and the worry that was expressed by a range of community organisations about the proposals in those two social security bills. Those two bills were live before this Senate until this morning. There was no doubt about those concerns, and we responded to those concerns.


Some of the proposals that are before us to which we have agreed from the start are not easy 


They are not easy things to make a decision about but we looked at them and felt that, within the context of what we would do into the future and the need to be careful about budgetary expenditure, we were prepared to consider those aspects and agree to them. At any time in the last four months there could have been a response from government to say that these things could be presented in another form. We actually asked for the bills to be split. There was no response from the government.


It is deeply offensive that we heard only yesterday through the media that some kind of deal has been established between the government and the Labor Party about what legislation would go forward. People have been ringing and asking us why we were making deals. It is absolutely essential that it is put on record in this place and for the community that there has not been any deal. In fact, there have been months of consideration and no movement from us about what we consider to be appropriate. There have been attempts by the government to portray a four-month old response that we were prepared to make an agreement as some kind of magical deal being arranged and imply that, somehow, the Labor Party had been involved in such a process. That is not on. It is not accurate. It takes away from the reality of what happens in this place. Proposals are put forward for consideration and there are a range of negotiations. Indeed in this case, the full process took place.


Two bills were brought forward after the budget very early. The bills were not late after that budget process. They came out very early in terms of the government's wide range of proposed savings within social welfare. At the same time, the government is talking about a major review of our whole welfare process, the McClure review, which is happening now. The government says that this is the range of changes they wanted to bring forward. They identified and costed them. Throughout the estimates process, we asked significant questions about where the costings came from, how the numbers were established, what the proposed impact on the community would be and whether any modelling had been done. When you ask people in the current government's departments about modelling, it is almost like you are using some kind of offensive language. We wanted to see what the actual impact on people in the community from these two pieces of legislation would be. It was very difficult to get those answers. In fact, we still do not have some answers to our questions from the Senate estimates process and also from the Senate community affairs process. That is the difficulty in looking completely at any piece of legislation. Nonetheless, we went through that process. We established clearly which proposals in the legislation we would support. We also established extremely clearly the ones for which there was no support, such as attacks on pensioners, attacks on unemployed people and also attacks on single parents. These are all groups of people who have been impacted by so many changes from the legislation. We listened to concerns that not only a single change proposed by the government but the series of changes imposed by the government would have a cumulative effect which would have a deeply troubling impact on different people in our community. We said, without any doubt, that we were opposed to these changes. So the process continued. The Senate legislation committee reported to this place. Again, there was no doubt. The opposition senators' minority report pointed out clearly the elements of the two previous pieces of legislation to which we had objections and established what those objections were. The minority report even at that time suggested that it would be a preferable option to split the bills if the government was determined to move forward on the savings that they hoped to achieve by making changes to the social welfare system. It would seem to be eminently sensible to come up with a proposal and, when it had agreement, bring it forward. We are pleased that, finally, that seems to have been happening.


We found out this morning that there was going to be a new bill before the parliament which would look at what we already had on record. There were 12 separate proposals in the original legislation to which Labor did not have any opposition. Magically, a new bill is before the parliament today which lists those 12 proposals. You will not be surprised, Mr Acting Deputy President Bernardi, that we will be supporting that, as we said we would do four months ago, as we said we would do three months ago, as we said we would do two months ago and as I said in this place talking on the previous legislation earlier this week. I said these are the things to which we would offer support. I put clearly on record that there is no deal. There is movement from the government, which finally accepts that achieving over $2.5 million of savings—which was assessed clearly by the opposition as those savings which we would not oppose—is a better result for any government claiming that there is such a need to harvest savings. That is a better result than continuing ineffective and increasingly acrimonious debate about issues where the positions have been made absolutely clear.


It is important that we have the opportunity to have discussions around the issues that have been in the public agenda for months. As I said earlier, some of the proposals continue to create great uncertainty, fear and anxiety amongst many people in the community. I would trust that members of the government have been receiving the same emails and letters that many people on this side of the chamber have been which have been crying out to say that people are fearful and utterly at a loss as to how their government could have such little understanding of the reality of their lives that it could be putting forward— (Time expired)

"PRESIDENT, The",,2014-10-02,"



The PRESIDENT
 (15:01):  Senator Wong, I am happy to address that matter now. Immediately prior to question time the Speaker and I had some lengthy meetings involving department officials, also the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives and the Usher of the Black Rod of the Senate.


It was decided that, as an interim measure—not a permanent measure—whilst we are awaiting further advice from specialist agencies in relation to identification upon entering this building and clear identification whilst remaining in the building, as a security measure and also as a management measure in relation to the public galleries and control of the public galleries, we would implement a number of measures.


The first one is that anyone entering the building covering themselves in such a way they cannot be clearly identified will be asked to be identified and to produce identification that matches their identity. If people have a cultural or religious sensitivity in relation to this, they will be given the privacy and sensitivity that is required in relation to that identification. Anyone is then free to move within this building in whatever manner they wish, provided it does not breach any security aspects, in all public areas barring segmented areas of the chamber galleries. Those are the galleries that do not have the glass enclosure. If people do not wish to be readily identified in the galleries of each chamber, they may use the galleries that are fully enclosed in glass.


One of the key reasons for this decision is that if there is an incident or if someone interjects from the gallery, which, as senators would know, happens from time to time, they need to be identified quickly and easily so that they can be removed from that interjection. Or if they are asked to be removed from the gallery, we need to know who that person is so they cannot return to the gallery, disguised or otherwise. These are the reasons that these interim measures have been placed into the Parliament House precinct until we get a firm set of advice from some key agencies, including the Australian Federal Police and ASIO, with whom we discussed this matter earlier in the week.


I hope, Senator Wong, that clarifies your question in relation to the substance. In relation to consultation with senators, I have not seen the circular, as I have been sitting in the chair whilst it was being circulated. However, I understand the content of the circular. That was the immediate advice that we have circulated to senators and members and all building occupants. This measure takes effect as of now. If any further statements need to be made, I will certainly make those statements to the Senate and I am sure the Speaker will to the House of Representatives.

 (Tasmania) (16:14):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Minister for Social Services (Senator Fifield) and the Minister for Employment (Senator Abetz) to questions without notice asked by Senators Polley and Bullock today relating to the Dementia and Severe Behaviours Supplement and to the superannuation guarantee.


Today in question time, for those who have just joined us, I did ask the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Senator Fifield, how much longer aged-care providers and people suffering with severe symptoms of dementia and their families would have to wait for this government to do something about ensuring that those people that are cared for are given the appropriate care from the funding that was axed, as we know, at the end of June.


The day after tomorrow will in fact mark 100 days since the Abbott government announced the axing of the Dementia and Severe Behaviours Supplement. After 100 days, we still have no real indication of what the government intends to do. Today Senator Fifield continued to be evasive in giving us any sort of answer. This is hardly surprising from a minister who clearly has not had his eye on the ball. The government's incompetence, inattention and inaction have hurt aged care providers, big and small. More significantly, the government have hurt the most vulnerable residents in aged care facilities and, all the while, they have refused to provide answers or outline any sort of plan that will restore certainty to the sector. 


The review which the minister spoke about was a result of the fact that there were signs of a cost blow-out. But what is critical here is that the department advised the government in clear terms that government could fund interim projects while a new scheme was being designed so that the aged care providers would not be left high and dry. In fact, we know that Senator Fifield wrote to the secretary of the Department of Social Services, Finn Pratt, promising that he intended to develop—and I quote directly—'an interim and ongoing measure to fill the void left by the scrapping of the supplement'. But, of course, he did not do this. One hundred days later and we still have nothing in place. The documents that we have also reveal what we have suspected all along: the government was incredibly slow to communicate their future plans and failed to provide assurances to a nervous aged care sector, and this is despite the department warning about the sensitivities to axing this supplement. In fact, on 4 February this year, the department informed Senator Fifield that prior to commencing its review it would write to the aged care peak bodies informing them of the review. But did they receive this correspondence? Was there any consultation? No. The peak bodies and the large providers have indicated that they received no correspondence—none at all. Senator Fifield clearly was not on top of what was occurring, or rather what was not occurring, in his department. 


The government has been asleep at the wheel on the Dementia and Severe Behaviours Supplement. It is as simple as that. On their watch, the government allowed this supplement to spiral completely out of control. There were warning bells, and they were ignored. It became clear early on that the implementation of the scheme needed to be addressed. Leadership was required to steer this ship back on course. The fact is that this government would have known in late 2013 that the supplement needed to be addressed, but it was not tackled in MYEFO last November or in this year's budget. Senator Fifield and his government dithered, waited and failed to act. And then they panicked and scrapped the supplement. Is this really good enough? Of course it is not. We need a minister who is on top of his brief. We need a minister who has his department monitoring compliance with key government schemes. We need a minister who has a solid working relationship with his department and a real interest in his portfolio. Right now, we do not have that and the real losers are the hardworking staff in the aged care sector and the vulnerable people with dementia. These people deserve much better. Clearly this is a minister who has no interest in his portfolio. This is a minister who is not on top of his brief. This is a minister who obviously does not have a good working relationship with his department. It is not good enough for those people on that side of the chamber who are now in government to continually blame the former government for something which they now have responsibility for.

So confident were the Labor Party, the Labor opposition, in their performance at question time today that, for the last 45 minutes, they have been talking about issues that were not the substance of their question time contribution. What does this mean? We now have half the time available to us to discuss the issues raised at question time. What does this demonstrate? It demonstrates that Labor do not even trust their own performance in question time. 


Senator Polley said something very important. She said that leadership was required to steer the ship back on course. What ship are we talking about? We are talking about the Dementia and Severe Behaviours Supplement. There is no-one doubt that, as a consequence of the ageing population, more of our older Australians will unfortunately suffer from dementia. A smaller group of them, just as unfortunately, will suffer from severe behaviour difficulties. We know that, with age, the prevalence of dementia rises from one in 10 when you are aged 65 years and over to three in 10 when you are aged 85 years and over. 


So let us just get to the nub of the problem. The Dementia and Severe Behaviours Supplement was the NBN of the aged care system under Labor. It was poorly designed and badly implemented. Its costs were exaggerated because Labor designed it badly. How badly did you design it? How badly could Labor have designed it? What was the depth of your poor design? Let us think about this. Originally, the program was designed to support the care of 2,000 residents with severe behaviours; at last count, it was supporting 29,000 residents. You designed a system that would cost the taxpayer $110 million over those 11 months. Now those costs are extreme, because you designed a very bad system. It must be embarrassing to find yourself in opposition now, having to curry favour with people and hide from your poor—



Senator Polley interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! There is too much interjecting happening.




Senator SMITH:
  Hide from your poor design. What would the future have looked like if the very responsible minister did not take any action? What would the future have looked like, Senator Polley? Let me tell you. Had it continued—



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Senator Polley, apologies: I cannot understand a word you are saying. Let me speak.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Smith, you are quite correct. You have the call, and I call the chamber to order. There has been enough interjecting in this contribution. I would like Senator Smith to be heard in silence.




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I will change my tone slightly. If corrective action had not been taken by the new government and the new minister, and the dementia and severe behaviour supplement been allowed to continue, the payment would have cost $780 million over four years, rather than the $52 million that had been budgeted under Labor, and more than $1.5 billion over 10 years. Let us be clear, the coalition believes that people with dementia and severe behaviour issues need to be supported. We disagree with the way that you did it. It was irresponsible from a policy perspective and irresponsible from a budget perspective. I have a challenge for Labor. Let us assume for one second that the supplement should stay. How does Labor propose to meet the financial cost of $780 million?



Senator Bilyk interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Senator Bilyk, which programs would you like to see end?



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Senator Polley, which programs would you like to see end?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Smith, I will ask you not to direct your comments at senators, because it does not assist the chamber. I would ask you to direct your comments through the chair.




Senator SMITH:
  Through you, Mr Deputy President, the challenge for the Labor opposition is to identify what programs and policies they would end if they were to support the supplement in its current form. (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bilyk, I forewarn you that this debate will close at 4.30.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:24):  I rise today to take note of answers from Senator Abetz to Senator Bullock with regard to the very important question of superannuation for Australian workers. In government, federal Labor put in place mechanisms to lift the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent from 1 July 2013. That would have boosted the retirement savings of 8.4 million Australians and would have lifted retirement savings more than $500 billion by 2037. A person aged 30 today on average full-time earnings would have retired with an extra $127,000 in superannuation savings.


Before the election, on 14 different occasions, Mr Abbott promised there would be no unexpected adverse changes to superannuation. Because of a tawdry backroom deal with Mr Palmer, over nine million working Australians will be worse off in retirement. Mr Abbott, we know, does not believe that superannuation is necessary. I have a quote from him that says:


Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.


He said that back in 1995, but I do not for a minute think that he has changed his mind with regard to superannuation. In March 2012, he said:


We have always as a coalition been against compulsory superannuation increases.


They were being honest, for a change, about what they think about superannuation. But in 2013 the Prime Minister appeared to have moved a bit, because he said in a doorstop interview:


… the commitment I give is that there will be no unexpected adverse changes to superannuation.


If people's not being able to put away enough money to have a comfortable retirement is not an adverse change, I do not know what is. In my book, that is an adverse change.


The government's freezing of the superannuation guarantee is another broken promise, which will hit the retirement savings, as I said, of nearly nine million Australian workers. If you are 25 and you are earning an average income, you will be $100,000 worse off by the time you retire. I would like people to think about that, because, with an ageing population, people are going to rely more on their superannuation. I notice that those on the other side—the couple that are able to be here—have their heads down. I think that is because they are very ashamed of that fact. They realise that people work very hard all their life to be able to live in their retirement in a comfortable—I am not talking about lavish—lifestyle. But, no, according to that side of the room, you do not deserve to have that comfort. In question time, Senator Abetz said words to the effect that people would receive the difference in their wages. Senator Abetz, I have news for you. Talk to some of the local small businesses in the area in which you and I live, because they are telling me that they are not going to pay it into wages. Those people are going to miss out altogether. It is not a swap; it is a dud deal by those on the that side. I am not saying that all employers will not pass it on, but I know already of a number in Tasmania, Senator Abetz's and my home state, that will not pass it on.


We have people who will be worse off in their retirement, due to the heartless, cruel tactics of the government. They have come in and said, 'No cuts to pensions, no adverse effects to superannuation, no cuts to education,' but all we have had from them is exactly the opposite. They do not have the honesty to face the people before the election and say that there will be no changes to superannuation. Superannuation is an important part of most people's future planning and future strategy. People plan a long time ahead for their superannuation and their retirement. So not having that money available to them because it has been frozen by this government, because allegedly there is some budget crisis— (Time expired)


Question agreed to.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (16:30):  I move:


That the Senate notes the adverse impact of the Abbott Government's proposed cuts to university funding and deregulation of higher education fees.


Today is a very inconvenient day for the Minister for Education because today a report card has been delivered on the performance of the Australian university system, and it is a very good report card. The Times Higher Education world university rankings show Australia has, indeed, a world-class university system. As Phil Baty, the editor of the Times Higher Education world university rankings, says:


This has been a strong year for Australia, with just about all of its top universities moving up the rankings.


The data shows that Australia does not have just a few world-class universities, but a world-class system …


Eight Australian universities have now made the top 200 and a further 12 universities have entered into the rankings in the 200 to 400 group. How inconvenient! We had the Treasurer yesterday saying that we had to have deregulation of the university system so we could get into the top 200. But now we clearly have evidence otherwise. It is reflected in so many of the different world indices just how strong the Australian education system is.


There has been no slide in international competitiveness, which is what has been asserted by the government. Rather, what you see on the evidence is improvement in the performance of the Australian university system. Australia's university system is no doubt—and, as a result of these rankings, this cannot be argued—amongst the best in the world. In fact, I believe it is probably fifth in the world systems at the moment.


We, Australia, are not sliding into mediocrity. We are well and truly punching above our weight. These rankings highlight just how good our universities are as a direct result of the funding put to these universities by the Australian Labor Party in government. There was a 100 per cent increase in funding. There was a 100 per cent increase over the life of the Labor government through to the end of the current forward estimates. Our record has shown major investments in science and research, with a 42 per cent increase in funding for science and research.


But all of this great achievement is under threat from the madcap ideology of the North Shore suburbs of Sydney and the merchant bankers' attitude that is so prevalent there, which thinks that everything west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is a foreign land. They take the view that if you are rich and powerful then you are entitled to get public support, and the rest of us can go to blazes. This is a system that we have seen produce the mentality of the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, with his destruction of manufacturing. It is the sort of attitude that you see even Mr Turnbull expressing from time to time. All of those who are very familiar with the millionaires' club understand that if you look after your own people they will look after you as well, won't they? That is the whole premise on which the Liberal Party operates.


Mr Baty, the editor of the Times Higher Education world university rankings, says:


The big question, as Australia moves into a period of radical reform with the full deregulation of tuition fees, is whether this admirable strength-in-depth—


this is how he describes the present system—


can be maintained …


The reforms may help a small … elite protect or even improve their global standing, but what about the rest?


Are we going to see a greater polarisation in Australia between a global super-elite and a large number of also-rans …


In his assessment, a large number would go into a period of decline. These are very good questions. These are very good questions that we in this Senate have to consider because legislation is currently before a Senate committee of this parliament which poses these very questions.


The report we have today from this world index is a stunning rebuke to the government. It is a stunning rebuke to their savage cuts. A 20 per cent reduction is what this government is seeking in the teaching programs of our universities, with substantial cuts to research programs, fee increases of up to 10 per cent for research students and a system of deregulation which would lead to unrestrained increases in student fees and reinforce the notion that those with money should be able to protect their privileged positions in society and pass on to their kids those privileged positions. We see from this index a rebuke to this government's policies on research, with their cuts to the Australian Research Council and the Research Training Scheme and their introduction of higher fees for PhD students. The government's policies are clearly in tatters.


We know that this is a government—whether it be on Medicare changes, the protection of financial services, the wilful destruction, as I say, of manufacturing or the abandonment of Defence workers—that is deeply unpopular as the public understands just how much they were misled. They were misled by a government that went to the last election and said that there would be no cuts to education, there would be no cuts to health, there would be no cuts to the ABC, and of course we see after the election some of the most savage reductions in public expenditure in the nation's history. But it is not just that. We see the attempt to impose a philosophy on the operations of our university system that, at its core, suggests an immorality—an immorality that says that we should abandon people who are not so well off, we should abandon the traditional commitment that this country has had to the idea that if you work hard and if you have the brains then you have the right to expect a quality education.


This government is trying to price education out of the reach of hundreds of thousands of Australian families. You will not be able to find an interest group—one university, one student group, one staff group, one professional group—that actually supports the government's package as it stands; not one. It is a policy that is rotten to the core. It is a policy that cannot be fixed by the odd amendment here or there. It cannot simply be amended. This is legislation that cannot be sugar coated. We know that the minister is talking about the realities, as this government has had to do in so many areas, of introducing such ham-fisted, such illogical, such dishonest legislation as we see in terms of what is being done with the universities.


Yesterday the government had to acknowledge certain realities with regard to social security legislation. In so many areas the government has to recognise that its reductions in people's social rights will not be tolerated. We know now that the education minister is joining that long conga line of ministers trying to find some grovelling way to get out of his predicament. He is talking to his trusted vice-chancellors about how he can put this legislation off until next year. Maybe he can get past March next year. The lie that is being told—that the Senate has this choice between deregulation and budget cuts—is being exposed. The reality is that the government cannot impose its budget cuts without changes to legislation. That requires this Senate to agree. And despite all the minister's efforts to secure a majority, it is quite clear that a majority in this chamber does not exist.


So, the minister is seeking to find an escape hatch—as he should. This is legislation that is fundamentally flawed. This is legislation that should never have been introduced. It certainly should not have been introduced without a proper discussion and in complete contrast with what was actually said prior to the last election. It should not have been introduced in the knowledge that it had such far-reaching implications. In the past when governments have sought to fundamentally change the structure of our university system the established practice has been to talk to people first—to have a green paper, a white paper, a consultative council—and then to have legislation. That is what John Dawkins did, for instance, when he wanted to champion—




Senator McKenzie:
  I'm glad you brought that up!




Senator KIM CARR:
  I recall, Senator: John Dawkins introduced some changes which you vigorously opposed. Do you remember those? I think you are on the public record, down at Deakin saying that you strenuously stood on a platform opposing any fees whatsoever. I look forward to hearing you explain how you now support it. Perhaps you are like the Minister for Education, who, when he has been caught out on this, has said, 'I simply told people what they wanted to hear.' He was in training to be the education minister of the Commonwealth of Australia! As a student, he just told them what they wanted to hear—did not believe a word of it, he says now.


We have a situation where the government is seeking to delay these bills until next year. They will keep on being on the table. They will say, 'Oh, yes, we're sticking to our guns here; we're determined to fight on, but we'll have to deal with it another time.' And of course they know that come next March, under the current law, there is a need for a reconciliation between what is in the budget and what is in the legislation. They are withholding the money from universities at this time, despite the fact that the parliament has now rejected those changes three times. They are saying, 'We'll get them through later on.' We will find that by next March, under law, they are required to make a reconciliation and that universities will be able to pursue their legal rights at law.


It is not good enough for the government to simply announce that they are going to slash the budget where there is a clear piece of legislation indicating the way in which money is to be expended. They expend money on the authority granted by the parliament. They do not have the discretion simply to rewrite the legislation without parliamentary approval. The government knows this. They know it is bad policy, and they know it is flawed policy, so they need to find a new narrative to explain their funding cuts, their breach of promise to the electorate, their undermining of their commitments to the Australian people. They need to explain how they have stripped out of Australia the basic principle of a fair go. They have to explain what they have done to undermine the research program upon which our prosperity—new industries, new technologies, new opportunities—is so heavily reliant. They have to explain all of that. So they will simply be trying to run some sort of argument that the reality of their dog-eat-dog policies, their survival-of-the-fittest vision, has hit this tremendous brick wall. And that is what the Senate inquiry will be able to highlight to them—just how much of a brick wall they have hit. They simply will not be able to conceal the fact that the moral imperative of higher education cannot be escaped.


It is morally wrong to vastly increase the cost of a degree, to shift the burden of paying that cost on to students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. It is morally wrong to claim that you are only asking for 50 per cent in payments when in reality we know that under the charges that have already been proposed by a number of universities, particularly the University of Western Australia, the figure is between 60 and 70 per cent; it is morally wrong to undermine economic and social opportunities particularly for women; and it is morally wrong for governments to undermine the position of rural and regional families and communities—and it is morally wrong for National Party to be so supine in their approach to participating in this government.


The government cannot salvage this plan through any attempt to verbal crossbenchers about what their position has been. How many times have we been told that the crossbenchers will say one thing publicly but privately they are saying something else? Why is it necessary for people to put their views to the minister in writing? That has happened because the minister was not able to get people to the various meetings that he thought they should attend, and that happened simply because they had been told so often what the position is—and, if anything is the case, there might be people on the cross benches to the left of the Labor Party on these questions. 


The government fails to appreciate that these proposals it is advancing are so deeply resented by the Australian people simply because they are not in the national interest. Education is not just about private returns. Yes you receive a private benefit—of course you do—but that is nothing to be squeamish about. Fundamentally, though, the reason the government invests the majority of the money in our universities is the public good. For the basic social and economic infrastructure of our society we need an educated people—not just an educated workforce but an educated people. We need a commitment to ensure that our learning institutions, our universities, are able to pursue important issues in the development of new knowledge and to develop public understandings and civic responsibilities. We also need to ensure we have enough nurses, enough doctors, enough scientists and enough engineers. We have to ensure we have enough vets—even the National Party should understand how important it is to at least have enough vets in this country. They have to understand that, in a market system, if you are not going to earn a lot of money you are not likely to want to go into a program as an act of charity. The government has to ensure we have enough physicists. We have to be able to ensure that the country can progress as a civilised nation. Mr Pyne does not get that. However, I am absolutely confident that the Australian people do. They grasp just how important education is. The public understand how important it is not just to the individual but to society and to the economy. That is why you have this tremendous resentment being developed not just by students but by families across the nation. That is why people have an expectation of the social right that the quality of our education will not be dependent upon the income of mum or dad. The capacity to participate in our society should not ever be a product solely of your postcode. That is why the public is so deeply hostile to what this government is doing—they know that we will all be judged on the measures that this parliament takes. That is why I am looking forward to the next election. I think this will be a central issue. The prospect of full public engagement in the discussion about what sort of society we want to be and what sort of role universities play in that will be an important issue for determining the result of the next election. We want to ensure that access to higher education should depend on individual ability and choice but it should not be dependent on wealth or family background. We believe those principles are worth defending. We want to ensure that there is equality of opportunity in this society. The government's program of deregulation, of price hikes, of raising fees and of pampering to the privileged is disingenuous. They have tried to dress this up as something that it is not and have been found out. We understand in this country how important the education system is and in many respects that is why, up until relatively recent times, education has enjoyed broadly bipartisan commitments. What we do notice—I guess it is a pattern we saw with Minister Vanstone, as we see with Mr Pyne—is that when the Liberals get in they do feel the need to change things. (Time expired)

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2014-10-02,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:50):  It is morally wrong, Senator Carr, to scaremonger. It is morally reprehensible to look at the scenery and induce fear into young people about their future when that fear is incredibly misplaced. To frighten students, to bully vice-chancellors and to bluster and blow is to remain entrenched and immovable in your 1960s Cold War sphere of thinking. Good luck to you—I am looking forward to next week as we travel around the nation listening to stakeholders in this debate. I, unlike Senator Carr, have an open mind about what they will have to say. We have received over 100 submissions to the Senate inquiry on a reform package the likes of which we have not seen since Dawkins. I am so glad Senator Carr brought Dawkins up. Unlike Senator Carr and his generation, I graduated high school into the Dawkins reform year. We took to the streets like no-one's business—we did not just burn effigies here and there. The Treasurer at the time later had some things to say about that—he was Prime Minister by the time he reflected on the Dawkins reforms. Senator Carr, I think what you are actually dreaming of and wishing for is an era long-gone, where free education is a right. Wouldn't it be lovely if it was? But unfortunately that would be financially irresponsible. I am quoting from, I think, Paul Keating's opening of Victoria University—Sunbury campus, which is, as you know, Senator Carr, in western Melbourne—very unlike Western Sydney. Keating said:


HECS was introduced in 1989 to a cacophony of student complaints. We were told that free education is a right, HECS will restrict the access of the poor to higher education. Higher education helps all society, and thus should be fully paid for by the government.


And he just wanted to spend a minute or two, like I do right now, addressing some of these issues. I cannot believe I am agreeing with him, but here I am. 'There is no such thing, of course, as a free education,' said Paul Keating. 'Somebody has to pay.' In systems with no changes those somebodies are all taxpayers, and sorry, but when I look at regional Australia, our median income level is a little lower than for the people who reside in Melbourne and in Sydney, and a lot lower than for the people who reside in Perth. You are asking those Australian taxpayers living in regional Australia to subsidise somebody else's education. I think we have to keep in mind those Dawkins reforms, which have washed through our system over a period of time now, and that we are now entering another great reform phase for our higher education states.


You also mentioned that 'survival of the fittest' is where the government's reforms will lead to. We want to ensure that excellence can grow and be promoted within the global context and that our strong tradition as a nation in ensuring access for all to a quality education can be maintained in a fiscal environment that, thanks to the reforms of former government into the higher education space, are unsustainable. Maybe you need to take a note out of Ed Miliband's conference speech; to have a look at injecting some financial sustainability methodology into your approach to higher education. We would all get on a lot better if you did. But my view of the Senate inquiry is one of openness—we see a lot of submissions and we are going to go out to stakeholders and prosecute those. I am looking forward to the hearing. I would recommend, Senator Carr, that you study the submissions over the weekend. I hope that would improve your line of questioning, given the rhetoric you just spewed out for 20 minutes, to more than inquiring of Vice-Chancellors how much they earn. It sounded like a bit of an NTEU campaign to me—anyone going through an EPA at the moment? Your line of questioning really needs to improve if you are wanting to prosecute the arguments you so strenuously and passionately espouse here within the chamber. So I hope that you can come up with some decent questions over the weekend.


You also touched on research and you claimed that the government was cutting research. Sorry, but we are increasing the ARC budget. We have also done something you did not do—and I hope you had time, Senator Carr, because I know you are quite passionate about science—to get down to see the NCRIS displays in the Great Hall this week in Canberra. It was absolutely fabulous. For those listening who might not know what NCRIS is, it is the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. You may have heard Senator Carr's rhetoric about being passionate about building our scientific capacity and encouraging and ensuring that international research is done here on our shores—well, this is the program and the strategy that delivers it. It was not the former government that chose to fund it—no, you cut it. No money. It is this government that has put $150 million into ensuring this strategy with a review, because you gave them nothing. Talk to the researchers, talk to the scientists—27 projects; 1,500 skilled technical experts; 222 institutions; 30,000 researchers, domestic and international—doing some fabulous cutting-edge and applied research. It was exactly the type of science and research strategy that this nation needs to fill our trajectory as the 21st century centre of excellence, particularly in our region, for higher education.


It amuses me that I am here on Thursday afternoon debating yet another stunt by the Labor Party that is pretending to care about the future of Australia's higher education system and students. This is a Labor government whose legacy to these students, and to the Australian people, is a gross debt that is projected to rise to $667 billion—that is a billion dollars of interest a month. That is a lot of research; it is a lot of support for education, not just higher education. This is a Labor government that proposed cuts to higher education and research of over $6.6 billion, including $2.8 billion on one day in April 2013, in a desperate grab for funds to help their ballooning deficit. A Labor government which capped self-education expenses, leaving thousands of nurses—I am so glad you brought up the nurses, Senator Carr—teachers and other professionals out of pocket. The Labor government left a complicated and unwieldy mess of regulation applying to universities and neglected international education. International education is our third-largest export and No.1 knowledge export—a $15 billion export industry. There are a lot of NTEU members whose livelihood relies on that industry, that fabulous export industry of international education in our higher education institutions, continuing. Yet under Labor's refusal to consider ensuring that their own increase in funding places can be financially sustainable, there will be no future.


Let's not forget Labor's cuts to and neglect of research and, of course, its dismal treatment of regional students throughout their entire tenure. Every time they tried to fix it up another bungled cohort of students and teachers would make their way, thankfully, to Senator Nash's office, where she was able to prosecute their concerns most admirably through the previous parliament.


They are now continuing their financial irresponsibility in opposition. There is no greater example of irresponsibility than opposing your own cuts. They do not want Australia's finances getting back into good health.  I really do not think that is a rational position to continue to take, Senator Carr—because it is stubborn. You are being stubborn about your approach to the fiscal situation and you are being stubborn about higher education reforms. I hope that during our inquiry next week, as we see students, public higher education providers, private higher education providers, TAFE directors and TAFE students, you will keep an open mind and start thinking about how together we can make a difference, how we can put Australia on a sustainable footing going forward. 


Senator Carr also mentioned the international rankings. I love that he chooses to quote people who do not even know how our system operates, but let's not let the facts—or a local—get in the way of a good story! The fact of the matter is that we are doing well. There are some great examples of excellence in this nation. We should be very proud of that. That is why this government has chosen to look forward, to fund Future Fellowships, to back our young researchers, and to make sure that we are giving them the opportunity to study, research and excel here at home—so that we can have continuing research capacity well into the future. Unfortunately, the Labor Party does not back that. 


If you look at the international rankings, yes, there are pockets of excellence—fabulous. In fact, as I have travelled around the country as chair of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, I have noticed that, no matter where you go in this nation, excellent research and teaching is occurring. It is just that we do not all need to do all of that everywhere. That is the reality. There are better ways we can do it—and that is what we are hoping to do, so that excellence can continue to be supported and access can continue to be supported. 


What Senator Carr forgot to tell the Senate, or selectively did not remember, about the higher education rankings is that, whilst we went okay—we added a couple into the top 200, we maintained our ranking and we are in the top six or so internationally in the ranking of institutions—there is an issue with respect to rates of change. That is where, Senator Carr, innumeracy becomes a problem. Quoting numbers is one thing; understanding the rates of change and their context is a much bigger issue. The rate of change of Asian universities through the rankings of both the top 100 and the top 200 is the thing we need to be concerned about. That billion-dollar export industry that we rely on—that employs the union members, Senator Carr, who back your preselection—in turn depends on international students. Our education export industry relies on international students, not international students from America or the UK but international students from this region. As those universities in our region progress through the international rankings, our export industry is at increased risk of becoming unsustainable—and affecting your preselection, Senator Carr, so please get on board.


I have digressed. I shall now talk about the fabulous reforms that our government has instigated. One of the issues that I do not think has been prosecuted enough by the media—and by those stakeholders with vested interests—is the fact that our reforms will see an additional 80,000 students accessing higher education. Research tells us that low-socioeconomic students—students from families where going to university is not the done thing, is not something you naturally head off to do—is that they need supported pathways. We need to have a system that lets them dip their toe in the water with an associate diploma at their local institution—in their own context, in their own space. Confidence builds. 'Hey, I can do this.' That six-month course will become a year. 'I might try and do 18 months.' After that, they might think, 'Okay, I am going really well; I am going to try and get a bachelor's degree.' Research studies have shown that those students who progress through a pathway do incredibly well once they do get to higher education institutions. 


I am a regional Australian, but I do not come to this place with the assumption that, just because I come from the country, that means I am less intelligent. I do not have that assumption. 



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator McKENZIE:
  Senator Polley, I cannot wait to hear your contribution. The year 12 completion rate for your state means that you do not get to bag out this government's absolute, committed attention to the fact the students from your state need to be supported through to a bachelor's degree—through precisely the mechanisms that our reforms seek to promote. When we ensure that happens, it will go gangbusters for the young people in your state and with people that have not completed year 12.

  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for reminding me. Our reforms ensure that those young people—and indeed middle-aged Australians—who have, for a variety of reasons, been unable to access higher education will actually be able to do it. That has to be a good thing. I would really love to have a unity ticket with the Labor Party and the Greens on that particular aspect of our package. 


Our reforms will mean that colleges and TAFEs in regional areas can offer more courses with qualifications leading to careers or further studies. Federation University Australia in Ballarat and La Trobe University, for example, have partnerships with TAFEs in regional Victoria to provide pathways to higher education for people who might not otherwise get an opportunity. Charles Sturt University in southern New South Wales states that 26 per cent of its undergraduate students gained entry via a partnership pathway with their local TAFE—TAFEs like Wodonga TAFE. That has to be a good thing. 


We are abolishing unfair loan fees on VET FEE-HELP. So, rather than stand up here and argue for Grammarians' right to have a free education—they are already there, Senator Carr. We have got enough Grammarians in our higher education system. We need to get some more of my people and some more of your people from the western suburbs of Melbourne into higher education to ensure that they can both have the personal benefit and obviously contribute to the public benefit through their studies. We are also abolishing the unfair loan fees for VET FEE-HELP and FEE-HELP. That is 1,600 bucks a year in the back pocket of the people that need it most. But do not let the facts get in the way of a good story. 


Rather than quote foreigners, I think I will quote locals who are champions of the government's reform agenda, who do recognise the need to change, who do recognise that we must get our higher education sector on a financially sustainable track. I go to the Chair of the Group of Eight universities, Professor Ian Young, who previously was Vice-Chancellor of Swinburne University: 'Deregulation will allow all universities to play to their strengths.'


Regional Universities Network—I love it that Labor comes in here and quotes this side of the Senate's concern for regional Australia. Sorry, through your legislative program over the last six years, it is little bit hard to find your concern with the mining tax, the carbon tax et cetera—but we will not go there. The Regional Universities Network has stated that 'the deregulation of student fees is the only feasible way that the sector can maintain quality and remain internationally competitive', provided that we ensure that those students from regional areas are supported through pathways to get to the higher education of their choice.  


I have not had time to go into the role of Commonwealth scholarships in ensuring that those bright kids from Wycheproof High, from Bendigo, from Ballarat and from Benalla will be able to access higher education no matter where they are, getting them over the financial barrier of the 20-odd grand that it will cost their parents or themselves to fund their relocation expenses and their living expenses. I think that is fantastic. It is not just about ensuring regional kids have access in their local environment; it is ensuring they have access to whatever area of study they feel is best. What we are interested in doing is not only empowering universities to chart their own course but empowering Australian students to make decisions about their future, and hence our nation's future, with respect to where they want to study. I think that has to be a good thing. I cannot believe the Labor Party is proposing that we restrict student choice, that we restrict their capacity.


In relation to the NUS $100,000 scare campaign, I have an alternative press release, and it does quote the NUS report stating that it is not claiming that every degree at every university will cost $100,000. I wish that were out in the media, because that would ensure that those low-SES students who are price sensitive, for very good reasons, are not scared off getting excellent quality at an Australian institution.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2014-10-02,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (17:10):  The higher education package that the government has put before us is very troubling because what it would do to Australia in the long term is extremely serious. It would rip billions of dollars of funding from our public universities, it would put enormous hardship on our students and their families and it would really change the make-up of the types of people who would have the opportunity to gain an education. That is because of the way the government wants to restructure the debt, ripping huge amounts of money, $5 billion, out of the sector. 


It is interesting in this debate to follow on from the previous speaker, Senator McKenzie. She misrepresented what this legislation would do if it were passed. She has failed to represent her own constituency, the regional people of Victoria. The Nationals are failing to speak up for what will happen to regional universities. Maybe that is an area I could start with. Regional universities would be put at huge disadvantage under what is proposed by this government. Let us remember that even large regional centres—for example, Newcastle, one of the biggest regional cities in this country—only have one university. So how does competition work when you only have one university? 


So many of the arguments behind Minister Pyne's justification for bringing in such an extreme range of changes through this legislation just fall over when you start looking at it closely, particularly with regard to how regional universities would work. They would lose out. We are not hearing that from Senator McKenzie. We are not hearing Nationals senators get up and question what will happen to regional students, how their universities will fare. At the moment we can see that they will not benefit and in fact will lose out from the way in which this is structured.


As I said, this legislation will rip billions of dollars out of our public universities. Also significant to this debate is that some of the money that once went to public universities will now go to private providers, private companies, making a profit out of higher education. Effectively these changes would shut the door on educational opportunities for so many young people, particularly disadvantaged people from regional areas. That is something that we should be giving great consideration to. While there were problems under the previous government in terms of how funding was allocated, there was certainly a greater opportunity for a range of people from diverse backgrounds to access our education system. But now funding will be slashed and a higher debt burden will be pushed onto students, with compound interest being imposed. So the debt burden will last for many more years, more so if you are low-income earner and more so if you are a woman who takes time off to have children. The way it targets certain groupings really does reflect poorly on this government and is a reminder that the sort of higher education system we would end up with with this government is a system that really returns us to the old days where higher education was more the domain of wealthy white men. That is certainly not healthy for our society.


Something I have certainly been picking up since the budget was announced, bringing forward this horror package, is the anxiety it is bringing to many students and their families who are unsure of their future, unsure of how much their sons and daughters will have to pay and uncertain about what cost burden they might have to pick up, because, understandably, many parents want the very best for their children and will step in. You start to feel that that is what the government is relying on. I was very disappointed with Senator McKenzie. How she has betrayed the urgent need to have strong voices for regional universities needs to be emphasised because that is one sector that will lose out badly here.


Senator Carr, when he spoke, detailed the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2014-2015 that came out today. That has been very timely on a day when there has been so much about our education system in the news. It has been very useful to be able to have it in the public domain today because, effectively, what that has shown is that so many of our universities have increased their ranking. It is something that we can all be very proud of. Congratulations to the students and staff who put in the hard yards and worked so hard. That is essentially why it has been achieved. It is further proof that what Minister Pyne is bringing forward is not the way we are going to achieve the top ranking—it has already been achieved. Our universities are going up in the rankings already, and his idea that it has to be pushed into the marketplace, that you have to rip the billions of dollars out of it, that we need to bring in all this competition, that we need to deregulate the system and that students should pay record fees is a step backwards. You would see the rankings going down. It is important that we bring those two aspects of the debate together.


The other issue that is very important here and that we need to give attention to is the issue of private providers. Of all the troubling aspects of this legislation, this is one of the most serious. Here we have a minister and a government set to rip billions of dollars from the higher education system. How could you do that? We hear the fine speeches from conservative politicians about how they support an innovative, educated nation. You cannot achieve that when you have cutbacks at this level. But, when you look at the cutbacks, not all of it goes out of the education system. Yes, it goes from public universities, but about $500 million goes to private providers. This is very serious when you look at what has happened to the TAFE system in Victoria and how much that has been damaged by the penetration of private, for-profit companies that undermine the standards, the level of teaching, the range of courses that are available and the pathways of education that bring back into the workforce and into society so many people who have felt marginalised. This is not something to be taken lightly. This really goes to the heart of the future quality of our education. I would argue that the evidence is in that the minister has got it wrong and that he should now be ripping up his elitist reforms because it will strip away opportunity from so many students.


Just on this issue of private providers, I was interested to note Senator Carr's contribution—and I think there was an interjection from Senator McKenzie—about the former minister for education in this parliament, John Dawkins. Some people call him a reforming minister. His name is associated with many aspects of the changes to higher education. It is worth looking at what is happening there. It is a story I am starting to hear about and there will be more about it in coming weeks and months. Let's remind ourselves that it was only as recently as December last year that the former minister withdrew from the policy development that he was involved in. He had been chair of the National Skills Standards Council. He resigned from that. He also said he was not going to continue as chair of the Australian Qualifications Framework Council when his term there expired. What was announced was that he would then move over to the company Vocation.


This is a training, recruitment and student management company that was formed out of the amalgamation of three companies that work in this area. When it was floated on the stock market, this company's shares and value went up very quickly. I want to remind the Senate of the three companies that came together to form this company. This is very significant because it is part of this trend where both Labor, to some extent, and the coalition, to a much greater extent, are pushing our higher education down a track that is largely unproven. Drawing on the TAFE experience, there are now many examples of where it can be damaging. But in terms of a large scale delivery of higher education, there is certainly a big question over it.


In the case of Mr Dawkins, Vocation, the company that he has now moved over to, is made up of three companies: AVANA, a specialist in ecotourism training; CSIA which was one of the founding companies and had a paper value of $378 million when it was floated; and BAWM, which started out as Taylored Gardens and at one stage was the biggest recipient of state government training funds. The huge amount of money that this company has pulled together and the fact that its share price, within just one day when it was first floated, climbed from $1.89 to $2.03 in just a matter of hours does illustrate that there are many people looking at this as a quick and lucrative way to raise money because you are secure in terms of your money source because it is coming from the government. This is an area that is worthy of being watched. Mr Dawkins, when he went over, became the non-executive chair. 


Some information that came out today shows that Vocation, which is a very large training provider, has been frozen in its entirety by Victoria's Department of Education. I draw the attention of senators to that fact. This issue is very relevant. We need to understand what is happening with private providers, because that area is a significant part of this legislation. If the legislation is passed, it is widely understood this will be a growth area. Now one of the biggest companies—with somebody very prestigious at the head of the organisation, Mr Dawkins—is being frozen. Why that has occurred and what the failures were within the company are things that we need to watch very closely.


I want to return to how this proposed legislation is playing out in the community. As I said in an earlier speech today, who can remember when a budget has caused so much anger for so long? What I am finding when I am out and about is that this budget is putting pressure on a lot of people. It is causing a lot of uncertainty; people are wondering about what the future holds for them. Many families are troubled about their children's futures. I would like to share with the Senate a personal story. While the bulk of the harsh measures in this budget are mainly loaded onto disadvantaged people and working-class people, I have realised that when it comes to higher education this budget is reaching into the heart of middle-class Australia. I was at a friend's place having a barbecue on a sunny winter's day. The father is a lawyer, the mother runs a small business and they have four small children. The children were running around. We were chatting about different things, and then all of a sudden the dad said: 'I really wonder how I am going to pay for their education. I don't know how I am going to do it.' These people are not hard up, but they are already looking at what the future holds for their children. They feel very responsible for their children, as so many parents do, with the desire to have higher education. What do they do about it? 


This government would be wise to consider that this issue is resonating widely in the community. The anger is there. What Minister Pyne has brought forward is deeply wrong. He is incredibly out of touch. We know he has an amazing style: he chatters on, he has a laugh, he likes to talk to everybody and he makes out that he is willing to negotiate any time. But in fact this minister is somebody who has gone too far down the neoliberal path of shoving everything into the marketplace. Personally, I do not think that any education should be in the marketplace, but to open the higher education system up to market forces to such a degree cannot work. It cannot work for the system, it cannot work for the business community and it cannot work for industry. We need an educated workforce, but this is not just about skills for a job; it is about the wonder of being informed and the wonder of knowledge. That is something that is being killed off in the way that this minister has structured this bill. This is legislation that should in no form be allowed to pass.


It is worth reminding ourselves that, prior to this government coming into office, Australia was already lagging behind OECD nations in terms of funding. The level of per student government funding in Australia is well below the OECD average. When you look at the OECD analysis, Australia is lagging in a number of areas to do with higher education. That is nothing to be proud of. This is a reminder of how fantastic the news on university rankings was today—that is something to be proud of. It is because of the hard work of those in the sector, even though nearly 50 per cent of the workforce are casual and working under shocking conditions. These people are so deeply committed to their work. A good job is being done, but it is being done on a shoestring budget at the moment. So those figures are very much worth analysis.


In this debate, some comment needs to be made about Labor. I acknowledge the very strong speech made by Senator Carr on Labor's commitment to higher education. We had a debate earlier in the day where we saw Labor go wobbly despite the fact that their opposition leader Bill Shorten signed a pledge about not allowing changes in higher education to go through the Senate. Labor has now flipped over and is ready to work with the government on issues around relocation and other issues to do with student arrangements. We also need to remember that when Labor was in government they planned on cutting the education budget. It was a Saturday in April when the former minister, Mr Emerson, came out with an announcement to cut $2.3 billion from the higher education budget. It is one of the failed policies that they took to the election. 


After the election, a strong campaign kicked in. The Greens, the unions, students and community members put the pressure on Labor, because we thought that Labor in opposition sometimes are a different beast and that under pressure they might come to their senses. They did. They dropped that wrong policy of funding cuts, and now they are resisting the bulk of these changes to higher education. But we need to put on the record that Labor need to be consistent in their policy, not just in opposition but in government, because sooner or later this government will be voted out. We have to ensure that when they are voted out, we have not in the meantime passed this very bad legislation.


I am certainly looking forward to the hearings of the committee that we have set up to inquire into this legislation. A range of people from our universities—including staff and people who analyse trends within the academic world and higher education in terms of government policy—will come to give evidence. That will help inform us to come back to this chamber to have an even more informed debate. There are already many warning signals here around private providers in terms of the level of deregulation and in terms of the way the debt would be structured. The warning bells have already sounded. A wise minister, if Mr Pyne were such a person, would withdraw this legislation, stop this elitist approach and sit down with the sector and with the Greens and Labor to come up with a plan to make higher education work for students and for the country.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2014-10-02,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (17:29):  I rise today to speak once again on the government's reckless move to deregulate Australian universities, cut university spending and increase student fees, and in turn create an endless cycle of debt and inequality in this country.


In November 2013, Christopher Pyne said:


We want university students to make their contribution, but we're not going to raise fees …


And everyone knows the famous quote the now Prime Minister made hours before the last federal election that there will be 'no cuts to education'. We know that that could not be any further from the truth.


But the contribution from Senator McKenzie a little earlier was breathtaking. She comes in here purporting to represent rural and regional Australia, as a Nationals senator, yet she is supporting a government that is going to do nothing but make it even more difficult for students from rural and regional Australia to go to university.


If this bill were to get through we know what effect it would have on universities across the country, no more so than what it would do to the University of Tasmania, in my home state. A lot of what Senator Carr has already put on the record spells out the arguments as to why we are opposed to this legislation and this attack on higher education, and it is for the same reason that many in the community have strongly voiced their concerns. They know what the effect will be, not only on the students who are at university now, but on so many families who will have to make choices. Those choices are going to be tough ones, if these changes were ever to be implemented. There will be some families that will have to make a choice about which of their children, if any, could ultimately attend university. We on this side of the chamber will always stand up for those young people, because they deserve an opportunity to go to university if they choose to.


If only Australians had known of this government's plans before the last election. It really makes you question what this government stands for. In total, this government intends to cut $5.8 billion from higher education, teaching, learning and research in our universities.


Under the government's changes to universities—unprecedented, I might add—they will be forced to put up their fees just to cover the loss of funding, which amounts to an average of 20 per cent across all undergraduate studies. Unrestrained fee hikes, and applying a compound interest rate to all HECS-HELP debts will hurt students across the country. It will create debt for students beyond belief. At worst it would deter Australians from going to university.


Members of this government are the gatekeepers. They are initiating these unfair, unprincipled decisions in order to keep people from going to university. They are engaged in conduct to create further inequality in this country. It is shameful and I will not stand for it, and nor will my colleagues. The Labor Party will not stand for it and the Australian community will not stand for it.


Senator McKenzie said that we should be putting the facts to the chamber, so I would like to address the contribution that was made by Senator Cash. I believe that I will be able to demonstrate that she misquoted the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation. In their submissions to the Senate inquiry on higher education reform, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation said that a nursing degree under a deregulated system would range from $24,000 to $34,000. Whilst this may or may not be right, what it certainly does is dispels the lies and disinformation that is being spread by the other side that a degree would cost $100,000. To quote the federation, 'Depending on fee levels that could be set at any range following deregulation, and as our submission clearly states, nursing degrees could increase in excess of $65,000.' I thought it was important that we put that on the record.


We know that in the United States, the system Christopher Pyne seems so keen to emulate, university fee rises are out of control and student debt now exceeds credit card debt. The system is broken and it feeds inequality. In Australia, under the current system, the very system we have today, universities have perfect freedom to compete on price. So we know fees will go up substantially. We will have $100,000 degrees. But that is not all. This government has also decided to add a real interest charge on the HECS-HELP loans. Just when you thought it could not get any worse, yes, it does. Applying real interest rates to HECS is regressive. That is why students and stakeholders are opposed to it. Every single stakeholder, except the worst Treasurer in our history, Treasurer Joe Hockey, thinks this idea reeks. A real interest rate on HECS-HELP loans means a degree will cost a lot more than the course fee and will take much longer to pay off. Without compounding interest, those who earn low incomes or who take time out of the workforce to raise a family will end up paying the most. That is what this government does not take into account. It does not take into account the individual circumstances of students and the individual circumstances of families. What about a single mother who wants to go back to university and who wants to better her future and the future of her children? How is she supposed to cope? How is she supposed to get by and afford to go to university?


Ignoring all the evidence of higher fees and crippling debt, Mr Christopher Pyne has claimed that his higher education changes will actually benefit students from low socioeconomic backgrounds because they include the so-called Commonwealth scholarships. This claim is the biggest mistruth of all. The scholarship scheme will receive no Commonwealth funding—no money at all from this government. It is to be funded entirely by other students. It is shameful. Shame on those opposite for bringing in the most detrimental changes to universities in Australia's history. A university education is a path to opportunity for individuals. It allows individuals, families and the community more broadly to benefit from individuals who would like the opportunity to better themselves through higher education. This opportunity has been recklessly ripped away from students.


I want to reflect briefly on Labor's record when it comes to higher education. We have a proud record. We are the party that understands that if someone wants to pull themselves up through higher education, then they should have the opportunity to do so. It should not matter where you live or what family come from. If you are an Australian, then you should be entitled to go to university at a cost that will not burden your future. Labor boosted universities' real revenue per student, including government and student contributions, by 10 per cent. This represented an extra $1,700 for universities to spend on quality teaching for every student. Labor lifted government investment in universities from $8 billion in 2007 to $14 billion in 2013.


We are committed to proper indexation for university funds. If we kept the funding model introduced by the Howard government, universities would today be worse off to the tune of $3 billion. If our funding model were to be maintained, Commonwealth investment in universities would be $17 billion a year by 2017. Labor made it easier for young people to study with the students start-up scholarships, which helped more than 427,000 Australians with the cost of study. We also introduced a relocation scholarship, helping 76,000 people leave home to obtain their degree.


Labor boosted funding for regional universities by 56 per cent. There are 750,000 students at Australian universities today and one in every four of them is there because of Labor. We put 190,000 more students on campus, we boosted Indigenous student numbers by 26 per cent, we boosted regional student numbers by 30 per cent and we had more than 36,000 extra students from low-income families in universities compared to 2007. Labor also invested $4.35 billion in world-class research and teaching facilities through the Education Investment Fund. That includes $500 million earmarked for regional Australia, so that country kids would have the same access to quality courses in universities and regional universities would be able to attract and retain world-class researchers.


That is what we did. We are not like those on the other side, who come into this place and purport to be here representing rural and regional Australia. We actually deliver to rural and regional Australia. We did all of this not because it was a vote winner but because it is the right thing to do. We did this because we understand what university means in a way that the coalition never has and never will. It is an opportunity for every Australian, but I do not think that those opposite will ever understand it. It really is a shame.


Now I will talk a little bit about my home state of Tasmania and the University of Tasmania. We in Tasmania only have one university and it is a great university. It is already feeling under pressure from this government, because there will be in excess of $30 million ripped away from that university. There is not necessarily other opportunities for Tasmanians to be able to choose to go to another university. They may not have the means to be able to move interstate and to study at other universities. There will not be any competition that is going to make their opportunities any better in my home state.


I can tell you about a visit that I made recently to the university at the Hobart campus; it was to the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre. I discussed with those students there their passion for what they are doing. This centre is providing opportunities for individuals to obtain to degrees which will help people suffering from dementia and help people overcome this debilitating disease. This is a real and pressing concern in my home state of Tasmania. That is, that the University of Tasmania will be forced to cut staff, cut courses and condense what they are able to offer to the community.


It has recently been reported that the Newnham campus in Launceston will be forced to condense its campus. Downgrading the university's northern campus will force students to think about whether they attend university at all, whether they are able to attend the University of Tasmania in Hobart and whether they would be forced to try to access an interstate university. There is real doubt about the future of the university in northern Tasmania, because of those opposite. That is because of their decision to cut $30 million from the University of Tasmania's funding.


Senator McKenzie made reference to the fact that we have a low retention rate of young Tasmanians going on to higher education. That is exactly right. But instead of trying to ensure that those young people have the opportunity to attend the University of Tasmania, they are going to make it more and more difficult. I have been informed that there are currently discussions occurring about restructuring and downsizing the staff, so there will be staff cuts if this goes through. Unfortunately, it seems that the member for Bass, Andrew Nikolic, is in favour of the university downsizing and potentially relocating to Inveresk. I cannot fathom why Mr Nikolic would have this view. This was how he was quoted in the newspaper yesterday. He knows that a cut to the University of Tasmania to the tune of $30 million means that it will be forced into an undesirable position—one for which this government will bear the consequences. 


Those opposite fail to understand the importance of education. Every time those opposite get into federal government they do exactly the same thing: they cut education. They would rather see people from low-socioeconomic backgrounds not go to university, because they do not agree with the option of there being higher education for all. That is really sad. Every time there is a change of government and Labor come back in, we build up the education system in this country. We give greater opportunities for all students to go onto university, to have the best education they can, because we know the value of education. Sometimes people just need a helping hand. They need a hand-up; they do not want a hand-out. But the government—as we know from the budget measures that they are trying to get through this place—are abandoning the most vulnerable people in our community. They are making it more and more difficult for young people to access higher education. 


The then Leader of the Opposition said before the election that there will be no cuts to education. And what happened? Those opposite are proposing cuts to education that will have an enormous impact on all the universities in this country. Those opposite said that there will be no cuts to the pension; there will be no change to the pension. That was clearly wrong, because the way they intend to index the age pension will affect those who rely on it in this country. 


Those opposite said that there will be no cuts to health, and now they want to introduce a $7 co-payment for GPs. Every time you have a pathology test, it will cost another $7. Some people have to have blood tests on a regular basis. People will be trying to decide: 'Should I really have the blood test this month or not? Do I have that extra $7?' For those people on the other side, $7 probably does not seem like very much to you. However, as I have had to live on a very limited income and be reliant on the government for part of the time in raising my children, I can tell you that at the end of your fortnight $7 is a lot of money when you just do not have it—not because you have wasted your money but because you are on a limited income. But those people on that side of the chamber clearly do not understand those circumstances. 


So I say again to those opposite that they fail to understand the importance of education. They fail to understand the importance of providing the young people and the mature-age people of this country with the opportunity of attending university to either further their education or take undertake study for the first time because they were not able to do so before. Unfortunately, people on that side of the chamber fail to realise that. They do not realise that every Australian has the right to improve their lot in life. They deserve the opportunity to go to university. They do not deserve to be saddled with a huge debt when they leave university and are trying to establish themselves in the workforce or providing for a family. 


The proper funding of universities is an investment in Australia's future. This government should not be let off the hook when it comes to university funding. This rushed package of broken promises must be scrapped. We on this side will not rest, and I know that there are those in the community who will also not rest, until this package of bills is defeated. The government should go back to the drawing board and consult with the sector and the community before it announces policy changes that will create greater inequality in this country. 


The failings of this government are in a whole range of areas, not just in health, not just in education and not just in my area of responsibility of aged care. This government does not know how to go out and consult with the community or with the sectors. They do not understand that. As I said earlier today in the chamber: the minister responsible for aged care in this country has taken his eye off the ball. He has not taken advice from his department. He has not consulted with his sector. And here we have yet another example of an arrogant, out-of-touch government that has failed to consult the education sector. (Time expired)

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-10-02,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (17:50):  I make this contribution as a former academic at a university in Western Australia—in fact, it was a regional university—of some 11 years experience. I have also been a visiting academic—on two occasions at the University of California, which is probably one of the greatest university systems in the world, and at the University of Kentucky. For Senator Polley's information, I also make this contribution as a person who went through university without any financial support from my parents. I was from a low-socioeconomic background. I went to the University of Queensland and I paid the cost of my university education. So I will not stand here and be lectured to by Senator Polley or by anybody else about what people apparently on our side are about. 


I say this and I say it in all seriousness to the Labor Party and to the Greens: come on board with these reforms, come on board with this new legislation, or be left out in the dark. You will be left out where you should not be, because you do have a proud record associated with university education. But understand this—and I say this to Senator Carr in his absence—if he thinks by obfuscating in the way in which he has been that he is in some way going to force this government to a double dissolution election and if he thinks he is going to trash the opportunities of tens of thousands of young and middle-age Australians in their attainment of a university education or a higher education simply because of some cheap political means then I say he will be damned, and so will his party be damned. Be part of the solution. 


Let us all be very, very clear on why the university sector finds itself where it is now. It is because the Labor government at the time lifted the cap on the number of students available to go to universities but did nothing to actually deregulate the industry—the higher education sector. So they found themselves in a circumstance where the universities simply could not pay for the increased costs of the students. The only way forward are the initiatives of Mr Pyne, and for this legislation, with amendment—and I accept that—to be passed.


We just heard Senator Polley talking about funding. She omitted to say in her contribution that the Labor Party, before it left government, was intending to cut some $6.6 billion out of higher education research. I give credit to Senator Rhiannon. She said that of that $6.6 billion, $2.8 billion was removed by the Labor government in April 2013. So do not come into this place on your high horse and talk about activities that the Labor government would have done. Senator Polley also spoke about the start-up scholarship scheme. But she did not say that it was being turned by the then Labor government into—you would not believe it!—a loan. What hypocrisy for them to be standing in the road of a loan scheme when they themselves were going to introduce it. We should always in these circumstances not take advice from ourselves; we should take it from the leaders of the institutions who are responsible for the delivery of the services. I look at the excellent work undertaken by the universities. There are policy notes on higher education reforms and on modelling the impact of higher education reforms; the policy notes Paying off HELP debts: case studies; Tuition fees at Australian universities and Understanding graduate earnings; and the speech, 'Micro-economic reform of the Australian higher education system'. This is the sort of quality of data that is available to us all, which I would hope the Labor Party and the Greens will avail themselves of.


Let us turn to what the leaders of Australia's tertiary institutions are saying. Ms Belinda Robinson, CEO of Universities Australia, said, 'failure of the package will condemn the university sector to inevitable decline.' Is that what Senator Carr wants? Is that what Senator Polley wants? Is that what the Labor Party and the Greens want? I hope not, as a proud university graduate myself and past academic. Either the status quo of ongoing inadequate investment or further cuts without deregulation will condemn Australia's great university system to inevitable decline, threaten our international reputation and make it increasingly difficult for universities to meet the quality expectations of our students. I quote from the Chair of Regional Universities Network and Vice-Chancellor of Southern Cross University, Professor Peter Lee:


… deregulation of student fees was the only way that the sector could maintain quality and access and remain internationally competitive, as significant, additional government funding is unlikely, irrespective of political party composition


This is what the leaders of the universities are saying. The Executive Director of the Australian Technology Network:


To reject the legislation out of hand … would be to sign the death warrant on a globally respected higher education system. The demise wouldn't be overnight of course; it will be slow and painful …


There are many statements from all of the leaders of the university sector. That is what we are faced with in this country.


What is the government proposing to do? It is ground-breaking and legendary. It is an opportunity for students throughout the socioeconomic scheme to be involved. It is an opportunity for a further 80,000 students to benefit across the sectors of higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas, associate degrees and going on to study undergraduate courses. I say, as a regional university person, that this is the very value to the regional universities of this scheme. I had the privilege of giving the occasional address at Curtin University's graduation ceremony the other day with the vice-chancellor. She has been quoted as saying that the opportunities that this will provide, for example, for the WA School of Mines, will be valuable. I have said so also for the Muresk Institute, of which I was an academic for some time. It is by coincidence, at this very moment, that the Premier of Western Australia, the Hon. Colin Barnett, is the fourth premier to be delivering the Muresk lecture, which he is doing at this very time. I have no doubt that he will be talking about the opportunity to expand the academic availability of courses at such an institution.


We talk about the loan schemes: the HELP scheme and the HECS scheme. Any student from a low-, middle- or high-socioeconomic family has the opportunity to engage in a higher diploma or degree without paying a cent. It is only when they have reached $50,000—CPI linked—that they will be required to repay anything at all. Even then it is capped at some four per cent of their salary. When that person gets up to a $200,000 income, it is capped at eight per cent. In comparison to other countries around the world, this is a very good deal. Comment has been made about the Commonwealth scholarship scheme, which will be made available to students of lower socioeconomic families, particularly those in regional areas. They can apply for the HELP scheme as well as the Commonwealth scholarship.


Let us dismiss some of these lies and myths about $100,000 courses. The University of Western Australia, one of the Group of Eight, has said that it will charge $16,000 a year for its undergraduate courses, which, after three to four years, is about $50,000. The fees for students entering through La Trobe University's Aspire program in 2015 will not increase by more than 10 per cent. If anybody is in any doubt about what is likely to happen to fees, we need look no further than international students. As we have brought international students into Australia, they contribute richly not only to the economy of our country but also to tourism, especially when their families and others visit. Have we seen international student costs absolutely burgeon? No, we have not. Why? Because of that word that Senator Carr will never understand: competition. There is competition within the sector and between the universities. How wonderful it is that, in Mr Pyne's proposed legislation, we have non-university providers. Can you imagine a course run—for example, in economics or commerce—by Harvard University and one of the big four accounting firms being able to be offered in this country? Not only the university sector but the private sector and the non-university sector can get involved. This is good stuff. I say to Senator Carr again, 'Come on board or be lost in the dust.'

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



AUTOMOTIVE TRANSFORMATION SCHEME AMENDMENT BILL 2014


The Automotive Transformation Scheme (ATS) is a legislated entitlement scheme that provides assistance to registered participants for the production of motor vehicles and engines, and for investment in allowable research and development, and allowable plant and equipment. The ATS provides two types of assistance: capped assistance via a special appropriation; and uncapped assistance via annual appropriation.


This amendment Bill is made to give effect to the Government's 2013-14 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) and Budget decisions in respect of the ATS. This Bill reduces the period of the ATS by three years and the total amount of capped assistance available by $900 million.


The Coalition announced it would reduce the ATS by $500 million in February 2011 and took this commitment to the election. The ATS saving measure in the MYEFO set out how we would achieve this. 


In light of the decisions by the local car makers to cease manufacturing in Australia by the end of 2017, the Government determined that it was appropriate to terminate the ATS on 1 January 2018, which was announced in the May 2014 Budget. The three local car manufacturers, Ford, Holden and Toyota, have made it clear that the level of Government support was not the reason for their decision to cease manufacturing cars in Australia.


As set out in this Bill, the total amount of capped assistance for stage 1 will be reduced by $200 million to $1.3 billion (2011-2015) and stage 2 by $700 million to $300 million (2016-2018). 


Despite these reductions, funding of approximately $700 million remains available under the ATS to support vehicle manufacturing and supply chain companies over four financial years from 2014-15.


As the Regulations provide that payment of assistance is made one quarter in arrears, the inclusion of the first quarter of calendar year 2018 in stage 2 allows for the final payment of assistance to be made for allowable investment and production undertaken during the final quarter of calendar year 2017.


This Bill will give effect to the Government's MYEFO and Budget decisions on the appropriate amount of assistance available under the ATS.


Passage of this Bill provides certainty for ATS participants about the level of assistance available for the final three years of the Scheme, which will assist their future business planning and decision-making.


Debate adjourned.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (18:23):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


I hope the minister will take particular attention to this because I am sure that he will, no doubt, be persuaded by the remarks that I have to make. This is the Senate Select Committee on School Funding's report Equity and excellence in Australian schools.


I am particularly concerned that the government has sought to essentially walk away from the funding of state schools. It has left state and territory systems to wither as a result of their failure to meet the commitments that they made during the last federal election. 


What we see here is where the government's plans would have the opportunity to unite and improve all Australian schools. But what they have done by their particularly unpleasant approach to school education is to pit parent against parent, to pit school against school and to have state fight with state in their capacity to try to divvy-up Commonwealth funding, which is dwindling in real terms. The government has locked in behind the concept of CPI indexation from schools from 2018. It is a recommitment to the government's $80 billion in cuts to schools and hospitals—cuts that will leave every school in this country worse off, on an average across the system, by $3.2 million for every school. Seven teachers could be funded by that. There will be $1,000 less support for every student, every year, as a result of the government's initiatives in terms of cutting back on school education. This is very significant in real terms with the education price index currently running at 5.1 per cent.


We know that, behind closed doors, the Minister for Education has been telling schools that the CPI indexation rates in the budget will be re-negotiated. But what we have seen here today and what was tabled earlier in the parliament highlighted that that is not the approach that the government is taking through this budget. It is a crystal clear fact that funding will go down in real terms. School education funding from 2018 will increase based on student enrolment growth and the government wide indexation rate on the consumer price index. The distribution of funding envelopes from 2018 will be:


… subject to formal negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories—


and non-government school providers. The government is pursuing a divide-and-conquer strategy, which means that our schools will never reach the student resource standard, and which will entrench and amplify the inequality across the system. The tragedy of this process is that it will actually put a handbrake on the economy.


According to PISA 2012, there is up to three years difference in the school results between the most advantaged and disadvantaged students in this country. This is a gap that will never be closed while a government like this continues down the path of breaking its promises on school funding and affirms its rejection of the Gonski reform proposals. This is a government that has cut all the additional funding for the fifth and sixth years of the Gonski reform program. It has cut $80 billion from schools and hospitals, which is the biggest ever cut in Commonwealth-state relations. It has cut a $100 million a year from the More Support for Students with Disabilities program and it has failed in its promise for more funding from 2015. This means that the state governments will be let off the hook because the coalition government has promised not to enforce their funding obligations under the original contract arrangements made with the former government. 


They are locking school funding in at CPI from 2018, with the budget papers assuming CPI will be just 2.5 per cent. The ABS education price index is currently at 5.1 per cent. That is a huge difference and the people that pay that price are the students of this nation. The reality of the difference between 2.5 per cent and 5.1 per cent means that increasing number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds will miss out.


This government is trying to walk away from the fundamental commitment that it made in the last election that it had a unity ticket with the Labor Party on schools. Before the election, on 4 August 2013, the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, said at a press conference:


Kevin Rudd and I are on an absolute unity ticket when it comes to school funding.


On 29 August 2013, the current Minister for Education, Mr Pyne, said:


… you can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school …


Before the election, the minister was also crystal clear about what the coalition's commitment to Gonski meant—that it was to needs based funding—and he was telling voters: 'We have agreed to the government's school funding model.' That was on 29 August last year. He was talking there about the Labor government's model. He also said, on RNBreakfast on 30 August, the next day: 'We are committed to the student resource standard. Of course we are,' he said. 'We are committed to this new school funding model'—so he repeated it. And, finally, as Australians entered the polling booths on election day, they were faced with signs, right across the country: 'Liberals will match Labor's school funding dollar for dollar'.


So the most galling of all these claims is that the government has met its election commitments and it is clear that it supports students with disabilities, their families and carers—which of course is the proposition that has been advanced by this government on a daily basis. This is just patently untrue. You only have to ask any disability organisation, any of the people who actually know something about this, or anyone who is a student, parent or teacher, just how much they have been misled—they know. Before the election, the government promised:


If elected to Government the Coalition will continue the data collection work that has commenced, which will be used to deliver more funding for people with disability through the 'disability loading' in 2015.


That was a press release by the now minister, Mr Pyne, on 23 August last year. So the full implementation of the loadings for students with disabilities was of course expected to be delivered on schedule in 2015. This was to allow time for the data collection and for further collaborations with states and school systems and to ensure that the final disability loadings would give students the resources they needed. What we know is that Labor funded the $100 million per year More Support for Students with Disabilities program to make sure that students who needed the most assistance got the assistance they needed, while we were working to fully develop the Gonski disability loading in 2015. And, before the election, this process, just like the Gonski reform programs, had bipartisan support. The current government's promises were clear. They were straightforward. Students with disabilities had a right to rely upon them. But, in this budget, the government cut $100 million from the More Support for Students with Disabilities program, and failed to replace it with any additional funds.


So what we have here is a clear and unequivocal example of what this government actually does when it gets into office: it promises one thing before the election and repudiates it after the election. The government has been absolutely shameless in pretending that black is white, in rewriting history, and in sliding away from its clear commitments to the students and families of this country. And the most heartless of all its broken promises in education is undoubtedly the broken promise to fund the full Gonski disability loading from 2015. The government made promises to get itself elected and then it cut support for students with disabilities in the budget. What we know is that this government can never be trusted on education ever again. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2014-10-02,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (18:34):  It is with disappointment that I rise to speak to the issue that shamed this Senate yesterday, and that was a grubby deal done by the Palmer United Party, the Labor Party and the Greens, and the victim of it has been, or will be, the government's fantastic initiative to have a one-stop-shop for environmental approvals. It is interesting to reflect that we are actually all sent here from our states and our territories, and this was an initiative of the government that actually had universal support of the very people, the states and the territories, that send us to this place.


But what is so disappointing—particularly in the climate that we are looking at now, with the Australian dollar declining; with the iron ore prices going down, from up around $120 to now less than $80 or $78 a tonne—is that we are seeing a circumstance in which basically every entity that is an employer group in this country or associated with the wellbeing of people in this country is protesting loudly about this ridiculous decision, taken to appease the Greens political party, with the compliance of the Labor Party. So, once again, these groups have shown to us that they do not care about employment in this country. They certainly do not care about agriculture in this country.


What are going to be the costs? BAEconomics have, in the first year of this initiative not being implemented, suggested that some $160 billion of economic benefit will be lost to the nation, with some 70,000 jobs; in the second year, leading up to the cumulation between the first and the second year: $220 billion, with no less than 108,000 jobs lost. In what states are they? My own state of Western Australia—$25.6 billion, at a time when our minerals royalties are dropping dramatically. Why is that important to the rest of Australia? Because for the last six or eight years Australia has ridden on the back of royalties from the iron ore industry which our state has provided to the other states and territories through some $20 billion a year of GST distribution. 


In Victoria: $35.5 billion and 15,000 jobs in the first year, leading accumulatively in the second year to nearly $50 billion and 24,000 jobs. In Queensland, where Senator Lazarus comes from—the person who initiated this shameful motion in the first place: $30.5 billion, 13,000 jobs in the first year, leading up to $42 billion and 20,000 jobs. As a Western Australian, I would say to Senator Lazarus that I would not mind the time when Queensland starts sharing its own burden again and stops taking money out of the pockets of Western Australians in the GST distribution. Senator Lambie, always of course very keen to promote Tasmania, as indeed are the Tasmanian senators: $2.5 billion and 1,100 jobs in the first year, cumulatively after two years, $3½ billion dollars. This is a disgrace; it is shameful. 


I do want to draw attention to commentary particularly from the Property Council objecting, as they have along with so many others—the Business Council of Australia, APIA, the Productivity Commission and the Urban Development Institute of Australia. What really struck me was the Property Council, which provides for over 200 residential and 100 commercial property developments which have been referred to the Commonwealth in the past 12 months and as a result of the ridiculous environmental legislation that we have at the moment where state is followed eventually by federal government intervention in the process, there is a shortfall of some 230,000 homes around this country at the moment waiting to be built—low socioeconomic, middle socioeconomic, social housing et cetera. The Property Council say that this move is going to be at the expense of tens of thousands of homes that otherwise would have been built. The National Farmers Federation is talking about the added costs and the confusion in farming. The Australian tourism Alliance is talking about what this cost is going to be. As we all know, there can be the difficulty of getting any project approved between local government and various state government departments, and then right towards the end we have the state environmental agencies, only then to be followed by the Commonwealth. This has got to stop. (Time expired)
