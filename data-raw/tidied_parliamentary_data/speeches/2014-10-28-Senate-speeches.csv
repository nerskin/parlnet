Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:32):  The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 is bill is the second national security bill brought forward by the government in this parliament; the first, the National Security Legislation Amendment (No. 1) Bill, was passed through the parliament on 1 October. Labor insisted on a full review of that bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security; and we supported the bill, subject to the government implementing each of the committee's recommendations. This bill is of a very different nature to the first bill. Labor's shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, said of that bill in his second reading speech in the other place:


Many of the measures in the bill are largely uncontroversial, though worthy, adjustments to intelligence legislation, including updating ASIO's employment framework, improving ASIO's ability to work and share information with other organisations, enabling ASIS to better cooperate with ASIO, improving ASIS's protective security capability while operating in dangerous environments and renaming our defence agencies to better reflect their roles. Though it is perhaps impossible to separate this legislation from current events in public debate, we should be clear that these are reforms intended to endure well after current threats have faded. We should debate their content on that basis.


The foreign fighters bill contains a very different set of amendments. The first bill updated and adjusted the architecture of our national security organisations in a broad way so that they will be better able to meet present and future demands. The foreign fighters bill, by contrast, directly addresses the threats to Australian security which have arisen out of present circumstances in Iraq and Syria. Where the first bill focused on the structure of our national security institutions in the long view, this bill focuses on the discrete powers most relevant to addressing the immediate threat of foreign fighters.


Labor offered the government its constructive bipartisan support for the first bill and we have offered constructive bipartisan support for this bill. As the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, has said on many occasions, Labor believes that our security agencies and national institutions should have the powers and resources they need to keep Australians safe from the threat of terrorism and we will support the government in providing those powers and resources. However, our bipartisan assistance to the government on matters of national security is never a blank cheque and we have also sought serious changes to this bill. Labor foreshadowed during debate on the first bill that subsequent bills 'may merit a different approach', and this has proven to be the case with regard to the foreign fighters bill. We have sought much broader changes to the foreign fighters bill than we sought to the first bill—arising as it did out of a lengthy bipartisan process begun by a Labor government.


Labor has fought hard over the past weeks to improve this bill by making sure it actually assists our agencies in addressing the foreign threat and by insisting on necessary safeguards for the fundamental democratic freedoms which characterise our society and our way of life in Australia. We pursued these improvements in the intelligence committee, where Labor members and senators closely scrutinised the bill and tested the case for each new measure. In cooperation with the government members of the committee we achieved 36 substantive recommendations. We pursued these improvements in negotiations with the government in which we have achieved agreement on not just the full implementation of the intelligence committee's recommendations but also yet further amendments to the bill. Now, not satisfied with the government's position on two outstanding matters in this bill, Labor will pursue improvements to this bill through further amendments that we will move in the Senate.


To give context to the improvements to this bill that have been achieved by Labor, it is useful to consider the scope of the bill and the original form in which the bill was first introduced into the Senate. The bill was introduced into the parliament on 24 September. It contains a broad range of measures designed to address the foreign fighter threat and amends more than 20 Commonwealth acts. Much of the bill implements recommendations of the March 2013 COAG review and the second, third and fourth reports of the former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Bret Walker SC. These measures include: a new power for interim suspension of passports; merging the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act into the Criminal Code, and harmonisation with code antiterror provisions; changes to the law of evidence to facilitate the use of overseas evidence in prosecutions of foreign fighters; a new evidence-tampering offence; lowering the legal threshold for arrest without warrant for terrorism offences; new power to seize bogus travel documents; providing for information sharing between AUSTRAC and AGD to help combat terrorism financing; and the introduction of delayed notification search warrants for terrorism offences.


The bill also includes other proposals which have attracted more controversy: a new offence for advocacy of terrorism, and the introduction of 'advocacy of terrorism' as a ground for prescription of a terrorist organisation; a new offence for entering or remaining in an area declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs; and an expansion of power to collect biometric information on Australian citizens at airports. Further, in its original form, the bill provided for the extension by 10 years without review of the sunset clauses for legislation empowering the AFP control orders due to expire in December 2015, the ASIO questioning and detention powers due to expire in July 2016 and the AFP preventative detention orders due to expire in December 2015.


Let us look at the committee recommendations. The bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, where it was thoroughly scrutinised and debated. The committee sought public submissions and held several public hearings. Labor members worked tirelessly with their government counterparts to apply the level of scrutiny and oversight Australians expect their representatives to bring to bear on legislation of such consequence. The process culminated in the intelligence committee's production of a substantial report making 36 recommendations, many of them calling for significant changes or clarifications. For completeness, and to illustrate to the Senate and to the Australian people the breadth and depth of the changes to this bill that have been achieved, I will set out those recommendations of the committee which call for amendment to the bill. I note that in each and every case Labor has insisted that the intelligence committee's recommendations be accepted and necessary amendments brought forward by the government.


In relation to sunset provisions, in its original form, the bill provided—extraordinarily, as I said—for the extension by 10 years, and without review, of the sunset clauses for legislation empowering control orders, ASIO questioning and detention powers, and preventative detention orders. Incredibly, in fact, there were reports in the press that the government initially wanted to remove any sunsetting arrangements for these powers, and confirm them as a permanent part of our law. Control orders, preventative detention orders, and the ASIO powers are each extraordinary and unprecedented powers introduced in the mid-2000s in response to the September 11 attacks and the Bali and London bombings. Their extraordinary nature is reflected in the fact that the Howard government saw fit to subject those powers to review and have them lapse after 10 years of operation if no legislation was passed to extend them. I note that the then Labor opposition sought amendments limiting this sunset period to five years—amendments which, unfortunately, at the time were unsuccessful.


The intelligence committee, after robust debate, concluded that these powers should sunset two years after the next federal election. It is right and proper that the next parliament be obliged to grapple with these powers again, and to decide on its own account whether their continuation is justified. Labor was not satisfied that the case had been made for such a lengthy extension. It is not acceptable that these extraordinary powers could operate for two decades without being properly reviewed by the parliament. As I said, this bill is aimed at a present threat; Labor will resource our agencies appropriately to deal with that threat, but we will not abandon scrutiny of agency powers properly considered special or emergency measures.


Moving onto the reviews, importantly, Labor has ensured that these sunset provisions are accompanied by mandatory reviews ahead of time. As was noted in evidence given to the committee, the whole purpose of sunsetting provisions is undermined if appropriate reviews are not conducted. The intelligence committee recommended that its review of the preventative detention order, control order, and ASIO powers be mandated by statute. What is more, it recommended amendment of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act to mandate reviews of the powers by that body also. It is worth remembering that it was only due to pressure from Labor that this body was retained. Earlier in the year, the Abbott government described this critical oversight office as 'red tape' and sought to repeal it. We vocally opposed that short-sighted cut, and the bipartisan support the committee expressed for the position in its report on the first bill was vindicated by Labor's consistent support for proper oversight mechanisms.


Speaking on the first bill, I pointed out that the position of monitor had been vacant since April. At a time of substantial change to our national security laws, that office is still vacant. This is simply unacceptable. Labor calls on the government to appoint an appropriate, credentialled and experienced monitor immediately. This is critical. By insisting on dramatically shortened sunset periods and on statutory reviews, both by the monitor and by the intelligence committee, Labor has ensured that, no matter the attitude of the Australian government in the next parliamentary term, there will be a sober and considered review of these powers ahead of their scheduled sunset.


We move onto foreign evidence. Labor has improved key human rights protections in the bill's provisions for the use of overseas evidence in terrorism prosecutions in Australian courts. As we did in regard to the first bill, we have demanded amendments to clarify that torture can never be accepted in any way under our law. As originally presented to the parliament, this bill excluded foreign evidence obtained as a result of torture only where that torture was carried out by public officials. There is no reason why the exclusion should be constrained in this way, especially when we are particularly concerned with regions which may have no readily recognisable state authorities.


The committee recommended the exclusion be expanded to cover torture by anyone. It also recommended the expansion of the definition of evidence obtained under duress to cover situations where evidence is obtained from a person by dint of threats to their person, their family, their associates or their property. In its original form, the bill had only covered circumstances where a person or their family was threatened. Though we strongly support making foreign evidence easier to use, as it is a critical part of enabling successful prosecutions under foreign incursions offences, Labor also wants appropriate safeguards for the accused. The committee recommended that judges be obliged to warn juries about the potential unreliability of foreign evidence; this is an important way of making sure that trials are fair.


On biometric collection, the foreign fighters bill includes provisions for the expanded collection of biometric data on Australian travellers. While the legislation expressly provides only for the collection of photographs, the bill as originally drafted allowed the government to expand this to other forms of biometric data, such as fingerprints or iris scans, by mere regulation and without seeking parliamentary approval.


Labor voiced its objection to this during the committee process. It is not acceptable that such an expansion of power with serious consequences for the privacy of ordinary citizens could be achieved without new legislation. Indeed, it is worrying that this aspect of the bill only became apparent during the Intelligence Committee's scrutiny. It is a vindication of that scrutiny process that did occur. We welcome the committee's recommendation to remove the ability of the government to prescribe further biometric collection by regulation. We also welcome the recommendation that the privacy commissioner oversee both the biometric database that is provided for in this bill and any future legislative proposals to expand it to other forms of data.


On foreign incursions, the bill makes a number of changes to Australia's existing foreign incursions legislation which were recommended by the National Security Legislation Monitor. Appropriately, the bill will roll the Foreign Incursions and Recruitment Act into the Criminal Code and update its provisions to specifically deal with the foreign fighter threat. We welcome those changes along with the improved ability to use foreign evidence and we hope that these improved provisions will allow for successful prosecutions of Australians who engage in lawless conduct in conflict zones abroad.


However, the bill as originally presented was drafted in a confused way. It did not simply implement the monitor's recommendation that the definition of 'engaging in hostile activities' overseas be updated to include terrorist activity as currently defined under Australian law. Rather, it included a new concept: 'subverting society'. As was pointed out in evidence to the committee, this expanded the operation of the foreign incursions provisions well beyond what the foreign incursions provisions were meant to address. It could have seen those provisions address private disputes or petty criminal activity.


Labor welcomes the committee's further recommendation that the definition of 'engage in hostile activity' be amended so that it only captures conduct which would be a serious offence under Australian law. The strange legislative language of 'subverting society' was likely to mislead or confuse the public as to what was intended. As the former monitor Bret Walker pointed out during the intelligence committee process, there is no need for this sort of florid language in Commonwealth statutes, which should be drafted in clear and calm terms. A loaded legislative term like 'subverting society' would cause completely unnecessary community agitation when the substance of the provision is aimed simply at terrorist conduct. Labor welcomes both the substantive changes which faithfully implements the monitor's recommendation and the removal of this poor drafting technique. We are pleased to see the government agree to produce a more tightly constrained provision that is drafted in clear language.


On enhanced oversight, across all parts of the bill Labor has sought improved oversight and accountability mechanisms. We believe that our security agencies can only continue to do their important work if Australia's political leaders are willing and able to reassure the community—and I refer here to every part of our diverse, multicultural community—that our security agencies are not only appropriate empowered but also appropriately accountable. Of key importance is that the committee recommended that it have the power to oversee not just the Australian Intelligence Community agencies but also the AFP in its counter-terrorist capacity. Labor supports this, as it is right and appropriate for the intelligence committee to be able to hold all agencies involved in counter-terrorism activities to public account. This is especially so given the extension in this bill of AFP powers, including to preventative detention orders and control orders.


With respect to the more controversial parts of the bill, particularly the declared areas and advocating terrorism, I will cover those issues during my contribution to the committee stage and in moving the amendments that have been circulated. In conclusion, I will say that Labor has approached this legislation as a responsible opposition should. We have offered the government our bipartisan support for measures to ensure our national security and that is constructive, bipartisan support. Labor did not, and never would, offer the government a blank cheque on this or any piece of legislation. We have worked hard to improve this bill. We want to make sure that it operates as intended, actually serves to protect our security and is subject to limits and accountability appropriate to the sort of free society that Australia is and must remain.


Our committee members have worked hard in pursuit of these ends in the intelligence committee process. We have worked hard in pursuit of these ends in negotiating with the government. And when our concerns have not been satisfactorily resolved, we have moved amendments in this place, which we urge the government to consider and to adopt.


Labor is proud of its record on national security and we are happy to assist the government in getting this bill right. We thank the government for its willingness to accept so many of the changes that we have asked for, and we hope that in that same spirit of constructive bipartisanship they might accept the two further changes we seek in the Senate today.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-28,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:52):  I rise to speak with a heavy heart about this bill, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. This is a significant and complex piece of legislation which, if enacted, will have long-term impacts on how ordinary Australians go about their lives. These impacts will include whether and where people travel; the circumstances in which people can be detained and questioned by ASIO, Customs officials or the police; and what kind of public commentary on controversial issues is allowed to occur in Australia. The reality is that once this legislation is enacted—once it is on the books—it is very likely, on the basis of the lessons of history, that it will be very hard to shift. 


I want to make one thing clear in this speech, and it is this: this legislation does not target only those with a criminal or terrorist intent. Nor does it carefully pinpoint gaps in the existing counter-terrorism legal framework and then fill them in neatly. This is a bill that will affect many everyday Australians and how they go about their lives. It contains widely drafted, sweeping reforms and makes changes to over 20 existing acts. It introduces a range of new, very serious criminal offences. It extends the scope of many other existing criminal offences, and it significantly expands the range and scope of powers available to law enforcement and intelligence-gathering agencies.


Interestingly enough, I received a tweet when I was talking about the need for the scrutiny of legislation. Someone tweeted to me, 'Why do you Greens want to protect terrorists?' I think that is one of the fundamental issues that we need to come to terms with in debating this legislation, because it is not the guilty I am interested in protecting here, it is the innocent. It is actually the Australians going about their lives who will be affected by this wide-ranging, unprecedented change to our laws. Tomorrow these laws may affect me or my child or my neighbour, or someone listening to this speech or reading my remarks. 


In response to some of the commentary that I have been putting out in relation to this national security legislation I received a letter from an Australian working abroad, who thanked me for the Greens' work in opposing this legislation, in particular the 'declared zones' offence. This person said:


While some people are having theoretical debates about what such provisions might mean, it is all too real for people like me. I am an Australian living and working in the Middle East, many of my friends are aid workers and journalists, and this bill will have serious repercussions for us. If this bill becomes law in its current form, on our return to Australia, we will all be criminals; unless and until we can prove we are not.


While in the Middle East I have worked with and volunteered for INGOs … One has to ask how exactly restricting or criminalising the movements of people like me will make Australia a safer place?


I urge people who might be listening to this, or reading these remarks, to remember that every time, in Australia, we lose rights and freedoms that are precious—every time we allow fear to divide us and hurt people who are innocent—terrorism is actually winning. The Australian Greens have consistently said that there must be proper parliamentary scrutiny of this legislation, including a robust inquiry which offers legal experts and relevant stakeholders a genuine opportunity to come to terms with this complex legislation, to analyse it and to provide comment on the bill. 


In the face of fear about terrorism the first failure of this government, in carrying out its duty to protect the population of Australia, is in not providing an adequate opportunity for this parliament and the Australian community to even begin to understand some of the most significant counter-terrorism changes in our lifetimes. This has not happened. This is a failure to uphold and protect some of the most dearly held tenets of the democracy that we cherish—in a sense, that we are fighting for here. This is irresponsible and antidemocratic. Already, by playing the national security trump card, by rushing these laws through parliament in the space of two days in the Senate, with inadequate time to consider them and before they have been properly scrutinised by the very committee of this parliament established to safeguard our human rights—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights—it is possible to say that this government is already allowing terrorism to win, or to start to win.


The government is pursuing these changes without adequate consideration of the broad range of existing offence provisions and powers that are currently available to such agencies to protect the Australian community against threats to national security, and without a careful analysis of whether each individual reform proposed is a necessary and proportionate response to genuine and legitimate national security concerns.


As it is for every other senator in this place, keeping the Australian community safe from harm is my unwavering priority. Of course it is. I live in the community. My family is in this community. My children are here and so are my neighbours and my friends. But I will not pretend that the only way we can keep our community safe is to undermine the rights and processes that make us a vibrant parliamentary democracy.


I will not agree to amending laws on the run, without allowing the parliament or the community to really understand what they will mean for ordinary Australians. I will not agree that doing that is the best way to guard Australia against national security risks. The Australian Greens support careful lawmaking, particularly when people's lives, rights and liberties are at stake. This means ensuring that the agencies we rely upon to protect us from harm have the tools they need to investigate crime and gather intelligence. But it also means looking at what laws we already have in place, whether they are working properly or need to be improved, and when they should be limited to the most exceptional circumstances. 


In short, it means listening to those with experience and expertise. Sadly, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 has been introduced in flagrant disregard of these principles. As a result, this bill risks being at least an ineffective reaction to the national security threat which is faced by Australia, duplicating existing laws, and at worst it risks being a disproportionate intrusion on the rights and liberties of Australians.


Let's look at the lack of scrutiny first. I was really interested to hear Senator Collins' comments. It will be interesting to see how Labor votes this afternoon when there is an hour's motion to gag debate on this bill. If that motion is successful, this Senate will have fewer than eight hours to consider the most significant counter-terrorism laws in my lifetime. The unwarranted haste with which this bill is being pushed through parliament has meant government agencies and Australia's foremost legal experts have not had enough time to provide a comprehensive analysis of the full bill. The communities who were apparently consulted in relation to the draft bill remain deeply concerned with its content and continue to feel sidelined and ignored. Even the government's own expert—the position established for the specific purpose of monitoring our national security laws—the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, has remained vacant since April, leaving Australia without the source of independent expert advice it needs most.


The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am a member, forewent its capacity to inquire into the bill, although the Senate referred it to that committee. The unrepresentative Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, comprised only of the club, coalition and Labor politicians, with no input from crossbenchers or Independents or the Australian Greens, has had too little time to identify and address the potential implications of these changes on the lives of ordinary Australians.


As a lawyer, I remain deeply concerned about the devil yet to be revealed in the detail of this bill. The Australian Greens have a number of concerns about this bill, many of which I will not have time to address during the time allocated. However, I will start with the no-go zone offence. The Australian Greens will seek to abolish the so-called no-go zone provision in this bill which will make it a criminal offence, punishable by 10 years imprisonment, for a person to travel to a declared area. In an extraordinary departure from the type of traditional rule-of-law principles the Attorney-General in this place claims to hold dear, the offence does not include a fault element; it does not include a mental intention element; it does not require the person to be travelling with any kind of criminal or wrongful intent. It effectively allows the executive arm of our government to draw red circles on the world map and put anyone who goes there at risk of criminal prosecution.


There is a narrow list of exemptions for 'legitimate purposes', but this will not protect the many Australians who travel abroad every year. A person who has travelled to a declared zone will be subject to a criminal charge and can only effectively defend themselves if they can bring evidence to show that they were in the area solely for one of the listed legitimate purposes. Legally, to start with, that will be extremely hard to do. As the law stands, visiting friends will not suffice. Travelling to give legal advice or for a religious pilgrimage or ceremony is not covered. And, while visiting a family member will be considered a legitimate purpose, being invited to a wedding in another town while you are there and attending would breach the requirement for the purpose to be a sole reason for the travel.


This law will have a chilling effect on the freedom of movement of every Australian with relatives or friends in areas that are experiencing, or may in the future experience, violence or conflict. Would anyone here with young children take the risk of visiting a sick mother or father in a declared area if they knew they would have to face a criminal court to prove the legitimate reasons for their travel on their return? It is also worth noting that travelling for business purposes is currently not listed as a legitimate purpose in the bill. This offence has the serious potential to isolate and divide family members, dislocate migrant communities and stifle business transactions with developing nations. The risk is that this will further entrench feelings of isolation and alienation in the very communities we rely upon most in building a safer, more cohesive Australian society. And all this when this offence is considered by legal experts to be completely unnecessary.


Australia's criminal laws already well and truly cover circumstances where a person leaves Australia to participate in hostile or terrorist activities overseas, as well as circumstances where a person encourages or urges another person to engage in such activities or a person who financially or otherwise supports terrorist or criminal organisations.


Let's turn to control orders and preventative detention orders. The second area for concern is indeed the extension of sunset clauses—the built-in expiration provisions for various existing powers: control orders, preventative detention orders, ASIO's questioning and detention warrant powers, and certain stop, search and seizure powers relating to terrorism offences available to the police under the Crimes Act. Despite the fact that we are told that this legislation is so urgent that we must consider it within a period of hours in the Senate and get it through the parliament with unwarranted haste, these powers are not due to expire until December 2015 and July 2016. But this bill seeks to extend them further. These powers are exceptional. They allow authorities to operate outside the traditional criminal justice process, because they restrict the liberty of people not charged with, or even suspected of, engaging in a criminal offence.


A number of independent bodies, including the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the 2012 COAG review of counter-terrorism measures, have carefully reviewed these existing powers. Both the INSLM and the COAG reviews recommended that the preventative detention order regime be repealed, describing it as being 'at odds with our normal approach to even the most reprehensible crimes', and said that it may be thought to be 'unacceptable in a liberal democracy'—but maybe that is not what we are living in anymore. The INSLM also stated that 'control orders in their present form are not effective, not appropriate and not necessary'. Inexplicably, this bill ignores expert evidence in relation to these provisions and precludes the opportunity for further review of these powers by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is required to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of ASIO's questioning and detention warrant powers by January 2016.


As well as extending the time frame for these powers, this bill extends their reach by making it easier, for example, for the police to obtain and enforce control orders. I cannot say strongly enough: we must not normalise powers that will allow ASIO or the police to detain someone without charge; limit whom they can speak to, where they can go and whether and where they can work; and impact on the lives of their families. We must remember that we are not only talking about Prime Minister Abbott's 'baddies' here; it could very well be a 'goodie'—a person getting on with their everyday life in Australia—who gets caught up in this. If a mistake is made, a suspicion is wrong and someone happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time—and we have historical examples of that in Australia—lives can be destroyed, people can be crushed and our democracy is poorer.


Let me turn to biometric material. This bill contains biometric data provisions that usher in an unprecedented change to the data collected about travellers at Australian airports. I will be moving amendments to remove these sections. No-one has had the time to carefully consider what this change might mean and what impact it will have on the privacy rights of all Australians leaving on international departures, including those who pose no risk to Australia's national security. As presently drafted, these changes could result in giving the green light for the collection and inter-agency sharing of biometric material, which currently includes photographs and face recognition, but could potentially include iris scanning and fingerprints. We just do not know precisely what forms of biometric material will or can be collected, used and shared under these changes and under what circumstances and with whom this material can be shared. Due to lack of time, many experts were unable to provide comprehensive submissions on the impacts of these changes. For these reasons, the Australian Greens will move that the reforms proposed in schedules 5 and 6, relating to the expanded use of biometric material for passenger processing at Australia's border, be removed from the bill.


I will also introduce amendments in relation to the new offence of advocating terrorism. Many experts have suggested this offence duplicates and unnecessarily expands existing offences while using broadly defined terms that may have unintended consequences. This offence risks capturing legitimate commentary on issues like Australia's foreign policy or political satire whilst at the same time driving those with nefarious intentions underground, making it harder to monitor and investigate real terrorism offences such as supporting a terrorist organisation. To remain one of the world's strongest democracies, we must remain free to strongly criticise the actions of our government, particularly on those matters directly relevant to our nation's place in the world, such as whether we should engage in combat activities overseas or whether Australia should publicly condemn or praise a certain political or violent struggle. Not everyone thinks carefully about their public contributions on matters that invoke passionate responses. It is chilling to think of those among us, from our teenage sons and daughters to favourite online bloggers, who, because of impetuous or thoughtless action with no real malice involved, could be at risk of very serious punishment under an offence like this, which does not specifically define the limits of criminal liability.


We also have significant concerns about new powers for the suspension of travel documents and visa cancellations. These clauses give the minister very broad powers with limited oversight and narrow appeal rights. The Australian Human Rights Commission, among others, has pointed out that the cancellation of family and sponsored visas risks violating a range of human rights.


We have other concerns about the expansion of powers of customs officials to detain people without charge, the delayed notification search warrants and provisions governing the use of foreign evidence in Australian criminal proceedings—and we will be speaking further about those in our committee stage amendments.


The issues raised in this speech merely skim the surface of the Australian Greens' grave concerns with this bill. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has not yet even finished its consideration of this bill and is still waiting for responses from the Attorney-General to deal with deficiencies in the mandated statement of compatibility provided with the bill. But it is fair to say that Australia has a proud history of protections and freedoms that it has inherited from hard-fought reforms in British democracy. When the government seeks to take away freedoms including freedom of movement, freedom of expression, right to freedom and freedom from arbitrary detention, it is essential that the legislation is subject to rigorous scrutiny.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2014-10-28,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:13):  I rise to make a short contribution in the five minutes I have available to the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I can assure Senator Wright and other senators in this place that there has, in fact, been robust and deep scrutiny of this bill. The committee listened to a wide range of witnesses and, importantly, also to the evidence provided by the security agencies, who work tirelessly on behalf of the people of Australia to ensure our security and also to ensure that we meet our security obligations to the broader global community.


To put it into context, on 24 September this year the United Nations Security Council met and passed a unanimous motion. The resolution requires all 193 UN member states to prosecute and penalise people who travel or attempt to travel abroad for terrorism training or to help finance such efforts; to deny entry to anyone they have reasonable grounds to believe could be supporting or participating in terror related activities; and to share airline passenger information records and other personal details with international databases to help track and prevent the movement of suspected foreign fighters. It is only the sixth time in 70 years that the Security Council has met with heads of nations. It met in those times to address the most urgent threats to peace and security. We see here that whilst there are urgent threats—and we are seeing those play out both on the global stage, particularly with the events in northern Iraq and Syria, and in Australia, as we have seen just recently in Melbourne, as well as in Canada and the United States—there are emerging and changing threats from people who support the ideology of Daesh or the Islamic state.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security scrutinised these bills and made 36 recommendations. As Senator Collins pointed out before, it was a bipartisan effort whereby members from both the government and the opposition looked at the bill and made suggestions as to how to improve it so that we could capture the operational effect that the agencies need to ensure the safety of Australians but at the same time increase the balance to make sure that essential freedoms are preserved and that there are checks, such as sunset clauses, so that these do not without due cause become a permanent feature of our legislation.


I would like to quickly address some of the key points that have raised concern. One is the issue of advocacy. One of the problems in the past has been that people who had been seeking to inculcate in young, impressionable minds the mindset that this is something that is not only permissible but required by their ideology had been very smart and very clever to walk a fine line to avoid the current law which would capture them. We are seeing that we have a generation of people who have been inculcated to a point where the process from that inculcation to action—to that radicalisation—is very short. And it is quite important that we have the ability to circumvent and to prevent those enabling conditions such that we do not have this body of young people—or, in some cases, older people—who have been radicalised to the point where they can decide to act and very quickly move forward.


We have seen a number of cases in which the so-called hate preachers have walked that fine line, they have inculcated into minds the willingness to act, and this legislation is a way of preventing that. Importantly, they commit an offence if they 'intentionally counsel, promote, encourage or urge the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence' and the person is reckless as to whether another person will engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence. There are a number of things in there, particularly the 'reckless' element, that are important and that provide protections from a free-speech perspective. Importantly also, there is a safeguard in that there is an existing defence for acts that are done in good faith, such as political communication or publishing a report or commentary about a matter of public interest.


The sunset clauses, as we talked about, are important measures, and we have reduced the time frames on those to make sure they do not become a continuing feature of our law. But the arrest thresholds are an important part, as we have seen, with increasingly the change from large groups with complex plans seeking to have mass casualty events. We have had a very good record in Australia of our existing laws enabling our security forces to have things like Operation Pendennis, in which we defeated the threat against the MCG in Melbourne. Now we are seeing people operating as small groups or individuals very quickly, with no great planning required in terms of their equipment. It is important to change the threshold to enable our security officers to act in a timely manner so that they can apprehend people and prevent those occurrences. So the threshold is being changed to require that an officer of the law has reasonable grounds to suspect, rather than the threshold of reasonable grounds for belief. This is not arbitrary. Some factual basis for the submission must be shown. It is also important to recognise that this is not a new concept in Australia, with many states and territories already having an arrest threshold that is based on suspicion.


On the issue of biometric measures, we have seen a case in which somebody left Australia, with manual checking at an airport, and went and joined terrorist fighters overseas. We already use biometric measures for people coming into Australia. Many would be familiar with eGate. This legislation provides the ability to use that same technology outbound. It meets the obligations that we have signed up to through the United Nations. It means that we can use existing technology, existing privacy safeguards, on outgoing as well as incoming passengers to prevent the kind of occurrence we saw in Australia before.


I will make one final comment, on declared areas. This is not an offence of strict liability. The DPP still has discretion as to when to actually bring a case against an individual. So, if there is a range of background factors and other information that is in the brief and the DPP cannot for whatever reason use another law, this measure provides an opportunity to bring a case against an individual who has travelled to a declared area. But for a declared area—somewhere like Mosul—witnesses were questioning, during the public hearings on this, why somebody would not be free for example to go and do language training. As I put to those witnesses, in the case of an area like Mosul, where every reasonable person has either fled or has been executed through decapitation or crucifixion, what reasonable person would seek to travel there to do education training? It just does not make sense. And because this is not a strict liability offence, all the people who were talked about in terms of journalism and foreign aid workers would not automatically be captured when they came back, because whole regions are unlikely to be declared areas. In fact, specifically, countries are not going to be able to be declared areas. So this offence is not the dire restriction on freedom of movement that has been claimed. Because it is not strict liability, the DPP has a discretion to include it as part of a brief of evidence.


My time is about to expire, but I commend this bill to the house. It has had good scrutiny by the process that has been set up by this parliament, which has worked well for many years through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2014-10-28,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:21):  I rise to speak against the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. I do so because I do not believe that the bill is urgent or even necessary and also because it contains measures that, like the previous national security legislation, erode our rights and freedoms. It is somehow fitting that this chamber is close to empty because it reminds us of Edmund Burke's observation that bad things happen when good people do nothing.


Last week, the government snapped to attention in response to video threats made by a 17-year-old jihadist from Bankstown. I then attracted some attention when I used some mildly unparliamentary language to describe him. I stand by that description. And, for that and other reasons, I do not believe there is any reason to give security agencies additional powers to prevent those like him from causing harm.


We have heard constant claims that we are now operating in a changed security environment where Australia is under threat. Because Daesh is enjoying success in Iraq and Syria, and a sympathiser has perpetrated an atrocity in Canada, the argument goes, we should all be hiding under the doona and giving ASIO and the AFP additional powers to protect us. I say that is not so. This bill has nothing to do with defeating Daesh in Syria or Iraq, and it will not keep us safer here in Australia.


The Attorney-General says that the number of Australians presently involved in the conflict in Syria and Iraq is unparalleled. According to his figures, 160 Australians are currently supporting or fighting with extremist groups. And yet 66 Australians fought in the Spanish Civil War. As a percentage of the Australian population in 1936, more Australians thought helping communists or fascists was a good thing than are currently supporting jihadists. Young men with a thirst for action and too much time on their hands have long joined gangs and become entangled with organised crime. These days—at least for a few—it seems violent religion provides an alternative outlet.


Then there is the basic reality that the government already has substantial powers on the books to deal with any terrorist threat. Apart from the fact—as Bret Walker SC often points out—that violence and conspiracy to commit violence have always been crimes, Australia's security agencies have extensive surveillance capacities. They can, for example, obtain data preservation orders that ensure metadata is retained and an individual's activities on the internet can be examined. They can obtain warrants to intercept phone calls. People can be held and compelled to answer questions. Preventive detention orders and control orders, without any crime having been committed, stop people leaving their homes if it is suspected that they might commit a crime in the future. Passports can be cancelled. Some of these powers are so over the top they are already incompatible with a liberal democracy. No case has been made for the need to add to them. In Australia, lightning kills five to 10 people each year; this does not mean our security agencies should have the right to enter our houses to check on us or imprison those who would walk around during storms.


People have pointed out that Daesh makes sophisticated use of social media and videos deliberately aimed at the young. 'Wouldn't it be better,' I have been asked, 'if watching those videos were made illegal? Wouldn't it be good if we could legislate Hizb ut-Tahrir out of existence?' I have formed the view that the new offence of advocating terrorism, which can be committed by both individuals and organisations, is present in this bill purely to get at Hizb ut-Tahrir and any others like it. It does this in two ways. First, it defines advocacy so as to include the promotion of terrorism. This is broad enough to take in a general statement endorsing revolutionary violence with no particular audience in mind. Second, the offence is drafted in such a way that it requires only that the individual or organisation be reckless as to whether the words in question will cause another person to engage in terrorism. At common law, incitement has always required the element of intent, whereas promotion goes beyond the requirement—also present in incitement—that words ought to act directly on their intended audience.


Last week, I looked at Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia's website. Of course, ASIO probably already know what we do on our parliamentary computers, but I am letting senators know because it was actually an enlightening experience. Hizb ut-Tahrir, like Daesh, supports a global Islamic caliphate. It seeks the imposition of sharia, including the hudud ordinances. These take in nasties such as stoning people to death for apostasy and adultery. It is difficult to avoid the imputation that, given a choice, Hizb ut-Tahrir would prefer Daesh to the Commonwealth of Australia. The issue, of course, is that making Hizb ut-Tahrir illegal will not stop Daesh's videos being made or distributed or watched. In fact, they are likely to acquire a sort of weird cachet from their very illegality. Lots of youngsters, when adults in authority tell them not to do something, immediately go out and do the opposite. This phenomenon is not confined to Muslims. What proscription and listing as a terrorist organisation will achieve when it comes to Hizb ut-Tahrir is to drive the organisation underground.


I like the fact that I can read Hizb ut-Tahrir's website. I like the fact that one of their obnoxious spokesmen turned up on Lateline and revealed to all and sundry just how uncomfortable he is around independent, educated women. I also like the fact that their public presence exposes them to ongoing scrutiny and forces them to speak, not fight. Sunlight is indeed the best disinfectant. It may be possible to legislate bodies like Hizb ut-Tahrir out of existence but not the sentiments it represents.


Thanks to the alleged urgency and necessity of this bill, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security was forced to come up with something approaching a review in a fortnight. Labor, of course, is being its usual supine self on national security—although, to be fair, the recommendations made by the committee are all sound. There is only one problem: they are like putting a bandaid on cancer. Yes, it would be nice to have words like 'encourage', 'promote' and 'advocate' defined with clarity—or at all. It would also be good if the foreign minister could not simply declare entire countries off limits. I agree that the idea of 'subverting society' needs work. But it clearly has not occurred to the Attorney-General that some countries and societies actually make good candidates for subverting: Zimbabwe, for example, or North Korea. I am happy to say that I support the overthrow of Kim Jong-un and Robert Mugabe, and I would not mind if there was a bit of advocating terrorism to achieve that. What does that make me? Even better are the proposals to reel in the lengthy sunset clauses for PDOs and control orders. Instead of 2025 or 2026, they will stay on the books for a mere two years after the next federal election—about four years, then, give or take. Mind you, that is still a long time for bad law to hang around.


Then there is the recommendation, when it comes to unauthorised disclosure of delayed notification search warrants, to take the public interest into account. However, as with the previous national security legislation, this safeguard will only go into the explanatory memorandum, not the bill itself. I may have slept through some of my lectures in law school but I remember enough to know that a court only takes the explanatory memorandum into account when the words of the statute are unclear. And the words in this bill are perfectly clear.


These kinds of laws will effectively turn our security agencies into various versions of secret police. Last week, News Corp's Lachlan Murdoch criticised the attack on freedom of speech that sailed through this place with the support of both major parties in relation to special intelligence operations—laws that could see journalists jailed up to 10 years if they disclose information about them. This bill seeks to prevent so-called 'delayed notification warrants' from being disclosed. We are talking about a warrant. One assumes that Lachlan Murdoch will one day be at News Corp's helm. The way things are going, there will be nothing for his journalists to report aside from the colour of Kim Kardashian's knickers.


Even with the acceptance of all the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, we are still left with a bill that enables the foreign minister to declare large swathes of territory no-go areas, allows the AFP to conduct searches without telling anyone about them for up to 12 months, places further constraints on the ability of Australians to speak freely, engages in extraterritorial overreach, and tells journalists they must go to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security if they come across misconduct rather than reporting to the wider public in the normal way.


Mr Abbott tells us that the 'delicate balance' between freedom and security will have to shift 'for some time to come' in light of the heightened terror risk. What he fails to realise in enacting laws like this one and the national security legislation is that he is curtailing the very liberties that distinguish free countries like Australia. Australia has the rule of law, procedural fairness, the presumption of innocence, free speech and a free media. It is simply not acceptable to give those good things away, surrendering freedom for safety, in response to windy threats from the 'ginger jihadi' of Bankstown. We can do better than that. Giving away freedom for security is like giving your possessions to a thief so you will not be robbed. At the risk of repeating a worn phrase, it would be tempting to call Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten the girly men of personal freedom, but I do not know of any girls who would be intimidated by threats from a spotty youth on YouTube.


Young men with limited skills and an aggressive cast of mind have always been attracted to violence and have often committed crimes That those crimes are now sometimes committed in the name of Islam does not make them different from crimes committed in the name of communism or fascism, or even just testosterone. There is nothing unprecedented, urgent or super risky about any of this. The internet has changed many things about the modern world, often for the better, but communists and fascists alike were able to convince Australians to fight in Spain in 1936 without it.


When I came to write this speech, there were lots of words and phrases I could have used at the outset to describe the foreign fighters bill. I could have called it Orwellian in its desire to put the Australian people under surveillance. When discussing Hizb ut-Tahrir, I could have pointed out that the best response to speech is more speech. I could also have suggested that the government was in the process of tearing up the Magna Carta and depositing the bits in Lake Burley Griffin. I did not use that language at the outset precisely because it has become stereotyped. However, that does not make it any less true. Look at what you are doing to Australia's democratic heritage; and then, in the name of all that is decent, do better.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2014-10-28,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (13:35):  I also rise to talk this afternoon on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. I do not have the advantage of having the sunlight shining on me, as Senator Leyonhjelm did throughout his speech, which was indeed pleasant to look at and certainly was a perfect photo opportunity. Senator Leyonhjelm, I will be at some variance with your views in my contribution today, perhaps particularly on the acts of terrorism on dictatorial people in other countries. We share a similar view on many things, as you well know, but today I think we might diverge.


The first responsibility of government is to the security of its citizens. To deliver on this, the Commonwealth relies on a team of thousands: the military, the state and federal police, and the government agencies and organisations whose people we never see—those amongst us who run towards the bomb blast when everybody else is running away. We owe Australians all reasonable protections, and we owe these people all reasonable tools to keep the odds in our favour.


The national security space requires flexibility and adaptability from all those involved, including from legislators. This bill in effect represents the law adapting in response to the ways in which our enemies have adapted in their fight against us. Outlawing the advocacy of terrorism at home is a sensible and necessary measure in a battle where the key recruiting mechanism has been the rhetorical flourishes of charismatic jihad salesmen. We are banning the jihad salesmen.


Restricting travel to declared regions is both an investment in our own security and an act of a responsible global citizen. It is an investment in our security because those who travel to fight may bring their war home with them and it is an act of a responsible neighbour because we would otherwise be exporting our national security liabilities to other countries. Removing the passports of those with ill will may be enough to stop them from reaching their intended battlefields, but is it enough to ensure they do not take up the battle here instead?


The cancellation of welfare payments for individuals of security concern hardly needs a supporting argument. It will remove the possibility of taxpayers' money being used to fund the very terrorism the same taxpayers' money is being used to combat. That is certainly a sound principle but it is also of great practical importance, because terrorism on the scale of that committed by Islamic State is not cheap. They need money; they need lots of it; and that money has to come from somewhere. Let it not come from here.


The government has cancelled a number of passports to date in order to halt those aspiring to join the terrorism tourism trail. That is the right course of action for Australia's security interests and it is the action of a responsible global citizen. But what happens next? What about the individual who is committed to terror and who is stopped from reaching the battlefield by effective border security but whose aspiration to fight may be far from extinguished? At the very least this leaves our security people with a considerable burden, but a far worse outcome would be one akin to what happened in Ottawa last week. It is reported Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's passport application was declined by Canadian police, who believed he intended to travel abroad to fight, before he attacked the National War Memorial and the parliament of Canada instead. The need for the provisions within this bill is evident.


It is also evident that we should start debating whether we must be much more prepared to imprison those amongst us who want to fight our armed forces overseas, those amongst us with the self-declared intention of overthrowing government and imposing an Islamic caliphate, but who simply cannot reach the battlefield to participate in that fight? What if they seek to conduct the fight here? The evidentiary burden for a passport cancellation is appropriately different to the threshold for arrest and imprisonment, but the risk of jihadists participating in the fight at home is very real. So I suggest that, in addition to the very appropriate provisions of this bill, the time has come for us to debate the appropriateness of being much more inclined to jail the enemy amongst us. I know that this bill has been through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security that Senator Fawcett chairs and that he made a contribution earlier. This process has been scrutinised by both sides of government and the minority parties in this house. I commend the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 to the house on those grounds.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (13:44):  I am delighted that there are so many senators in the chamber to listen to my contribution on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014, which of course contains a broad range of measures designed to enhance the capability of Australia's law enforcement, intelligence and broader protection agencies to protect the Australian community from the threat posed by returning foreign fighters and individuals in Australia supporting foreign conflicts.


This bill was introduced into the Senate on 24 September. It was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, both of which reported on the 17th of this month. Even with the short and, I believe, inadequate time available to it, I must say that the PJCIS has worked very hard to examine and scrutinise the bill, and it has done so effectively and closely. The committee made 36 recommendations—many of them calling for quite substantial changes or clarifications. I understand that the government has now agreed to all the recommendations made by the PJCIS. As a result, the federal parliamentary Labor Party determined at its meeting this morning that it will support this bill—but it will, however, propose a number of amendments in the committee stage.


With more and more legislative changes boosting the powers of security agencies, the requirement for effective external oversight is now critical to maintaining an essential level of trust in the community about agency operations. Today I want to use the opportunity of this speech in the second reading debate on the bill to speak about this issue and to state very clearly the importance of this issue of oversight of our intelligence and security agencies. I believe that the time is right for a comprehensive review of the oversight of Australian intelligence agencies as further security measures are brought into the parliament for consideration.


I think that there are a number of steps that not only are worthy of debate, both inside and outside this chamber, but also could be readily adopted to enhance our current system. Last Friday, in fact, I posted a paper on my website, which was also posted by the Lowy Institute and published by the Australian Financial Review. That paper recommended eight measures to improve the oversight and scrutiny of our intelligence and security agencies. I do commend these proposals to the Senate and, as I said, I intend to take the opportunity of this second reading debate to outline some of these proposals to the Senate.


It is the parliament to which the intelligence agencies are accountable, and it is the parliament's responsibility to oversight their priorities and effectiveness. The Australian parliament has no better or more authoritative forum than the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Joint Security, the PJCIS, to do this job. The PJCIS is established under part 4 of the Intelligence Services Act—the ISA. Schedule 1 of the act contains detailed provisions about the committee's operations and appointment processes. But the provision of the ISA regarding a prescribed balance of PJCIS members between the Houses has, I think, been an unnecessary impediment to ensuring that the best-qualified eligible parliamentarians serve on this committee. I believe this should change to ensure that the PJCIS has the capacity to draw on those parliamentarians with the greatest expertise and experience in this area.


I also want to talk about the role of the Australian Federal Police, which now of course is absolutely central in Australia's counter-terrorism framework. In its report on this legislation the PJCIS, in recommendation 14, proposed that the committee's functions be extended to encompass the counter-terrorism activities of the Australian Federal Police, including, but not necessarily limited to, anything involving classified material. I have been arguing the merits of this proposition for a number of years, and I am pleased that the committee has again proposed that the government move in this direction—as it did in its report in 2010 on the review, administration and expenditure of intelligence agencies.


To ensure comprehensive and consistent oversight arrangements, it is critical that the AFP's counterterrorism elements be added to the list of organisations reviewable by the PJCIS and to achieve this section 29(1) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 should be amended accordingly. Also, currently the Intelligence Services Act stipulates the functions of the committee as review of the administration and expenditure of agencies, including their annual financial statements and in addition, of course, any other matter referred by a minister or resolved by either house of the parliament. I argue that the powers and the access of the PJCIS should be enhanced to include access to more classified information and material, including reports and the classified annual reviews of intelligence agencies so that it can do its job more effectively. Of course, in considering the provision of such additional material, the critical issue arises of where to draw the line. It is clear that some types of information are so sensitive that they should not be provided to the PJCIS, even if the committee were given a broader remit. 


I have outlined in my paper some examples of such sensitive information such as revealing the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source; current or planned operations but not necessarily past operations; revealing the identities of agency staff past and present, unless that requirement was waived by the agency head; technical details of nonhuman intelligence sources including cryptology; data or information provided by another country, unless that other country consents; current vulnerabilities of ICT systems, installations or infrastructures relating to national security; and, technical capabilities which are subject to protection beyond the top-secret level. 


The PJCIS in that report of 2007 proposed that a small working group drawn from relevant departments, agencies and the committee be set up to recommend the types of material which the PJCIS could access, material which should remain off limits and amendments to the ISA enabling any proposed changes for consideration by government. I think this proposal has real merit and I hope to see it implemented.


In addition, currently the PJCIS can only request a matter be referred to it by a responsible minister. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the equivalent parliamentary committees set their own agenda and work programs. It is time for the PJCIS in Australia to be given the power to generate its own inquiries if it believes, following consultation with relevant agencies, that such action is necessary and appropriate. Also, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who provides detailed scrutiny of the legality and propriety of intelligence agencies' operations, must have her office adequately resourced. The government and the parliament must ensure that the resources and level of staffing provided to the IGIS continue to meet the growing demands and responsibilities placed on them by the expansion of the Australian intelligence community and its powers. 


It is critical that the government and the PJCIS regularly review or audit these resources, including the level of staffing and their expertise, within the office of the IGIS. There has been an enhancement recently. That is a good thing but I would argue that the IGIS's annual report should be required to provide a detailed assessment of the adequacy of resources provided to that office and the consequences of any shortfalls if they occur. The government and the PJCIS should provide a response to any such annual assessment. In addition to that, there should be more formalised liaison between the PJCIS and other oversight bodies, of course including the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security but also the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. For example, each IGIS formal inquiry report should be provided to the PJCIS no more than three months after it is presented to the Prime Minister or relevant ministers. It would also be good practice for the committee to receive regular briefings from the IGIS and the security monitor and, where appropriate, from the National Security Adviser, who is based in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.


In addition to these proposals, I believe there should be strong support for mandatory sunset clauses for controversial legislation. In recent years, in some instances the parliament has used sunset clauses when intelligence agencies have been granted unprecedented powers. These unprecedented powers include AFP detention orders, AFP control orders and ASIO questioning and detention powers. The lifespan of too many such sunset clauses has been far too long and it is simply not possible to predict the nature and extent of terrorist threats over such a long period.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (12:32):  The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 is bill is the second national security bill brought forward by the government in this parliament; the first, the National Security Legislation Amendment (No. 1) Bill, was passed through the parliament on 1 October. Labor insisted on a full review of that bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security; and we supported the bill, subject to the government implementing each of the committee's recommendations. This bill is of a very different nature to the first bill. Labor's shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, said of that bill in his second reading speech in the other place:


Many of the measures in the bill are largely uncontroversial, though worthy, adjustments to intelligence legislation, including updating ASIO's employment framework, improving ASIO's ability to work and share information with other organisations, enabling ASIS to better cooperate with ASIO, improving ASIS's protective security capability while operating in dangerous environments and renaming our defence agencies to better reflect their roles. Though it is perhaps impossible to separate this legislation from current events in public debate, we should be clear that these are reforms intended to endure well after current threats have faded. We should debate their content on that basis.


The foreign fighters bill contains a very different set of amendments. The first bill updated and adjusted the architecture of our national security organisations in a broad way so that they will be better able to meet present and future demands. The foreign fighters bill, by contrast, directly addresses the threats to Australian security which have arisen out of present circumstances in Iraq and Syria. Where the first bill focused on the structure of our national security institutions in the long view, this bill focuses on the discrete powers most relevant to addressing the immediate threat of foreign fighters.


Labor offered the government its constructive bipartisan support for the first bill and we have offered constructive bipartisan support for this bill. As the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, has said on many occasions, Labor believes that our security agencies and national institutions should have the powers and resources they need to keep Australians safe from the threat of terrorism and we will support the government in providing those powers and resources. However, our bipartisan assistance to the government on matters of national security is never a blank cheque and we have also sought serious changes to this bill. Labor foreshadowed during debate on the first bill that subsequent bills 'may merit a different approach', and this has proven to be the case with regard to the foreign fighters bill. We have sought much broader changes to the foreign fighters bill than we sought to the first bill—arising as it did out of a lengthy bipartisan process begun by a Labor government.


Labor has fought hard over the past weeks to improve this bill by making sure it actually assists our agencies in addressing the foreign threat and by insisting on necessary safeguards for the fundamental democratic freedoms which characterise our society and our way of life in Australia. We pursued these improvements in the intelligence committee, where Labor members and senators closely scrutinised the bill and tested the case for each new measure. In cooperation with the government members of the committee we achieved 36 substantive recommendations. We pursued these improvements in negotiations with the government in which we have achieved agreement on not just the full implementation of the intelligence committee's recommendations but also yet further amendments to the bill. Now, not satisfied with the government's position on two outstanding matters in this bill, Labor will pursue improvements to this bill through further amendments that we will move in the Senate.


To give context to the improvements to this bill that have been achieved by Labor, it is useful to consider the scope of the bill and the original form in which the bill was first introduced into the Senate. The bill was introduced into the parliament on 24 September. It contains a broad range of measures designed to address the foreign fighter threat and amends more than 20 Commonwealth acts. Much of the bill implements recommendations of the March 2013 COAG review and the second, third and fourth reports of the former Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, Bret Walker SC. These measures include: a new power for interim suspension of passports; merging the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act into the Criminal Code, and harmonisation with code antiterror provisions; changes to the law of evidence to facilitate the use of overseas evidence in prosecutions of foreign fighters; a new evidence-tampering offence; lowering the legal threshold for arrest without warrant for terrorism offences; new power to seize bogus travel documents; providing for information sharing between AUSTRAC and AGD to help combat terrorism financing; and the introduction of delayed notification search warrants for terrorism offences.


The bill also includes other proposals which have attracted more controversy: a new offence for advocacy of terrorism, and the introduction of 'advocacy of terrorism' as a ground for prescription of a terrorist organisation; a new offence for entering or remaining in an area declared by the Minister for Foreign Affairs; and an expansion of power to collect biometric information on Australian citizens at airports. Further, in its original form, the bill provided for the extension by 10 years without review of the sunset clauses for legislation empowering the AFP control orders due to expire in December 2015, the ASIO questioning and detention powers due to expire in July 2016 and the AFP preventative detention orders due to expire in December 2015.


Let us look at the committee recommendations. The bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, where it was thoroughly scrutinised and debated. The committee sought public submissions and held several public hearings. Labor members worked tirelessly with their government counterparts to apply the level of scrutiny and oversight Australians expect their representatives to bring to bear on legislation of such consequence. The process culminated in the intelligence committee's production of a substantial report making 36 recommendations, many of them calling for significant changes or clarifications. For completeness, and to illustrate to the Senate and to the Australian people the breadth and depth of the changes to this bill that have been achieved, I will set out those recommendations of the committee which call for amendment to the bill. I note that in each and every case Labor has insisted that the intelligence committee's recommendations be accepted and necessary amendments brought forward by the government.


In relation to sunset provisions, in its original form, the bill provided—extraordinarily, as I said—for the extension by 10 years, and without review, of the sunset clauses for legislation empowering control orders, ASIO questioning and detention powers, and preventative detention orders. Incredibly, in fact, there were reports in the press that the government initially wanted to remove any sunsetting arrangements for these powers, and confirm them as a permanent part of our law. Control orders, preventative detention orders, and the ASIO powers are each extraordinary and unprecedented powers introduced in the mid-2000s in response to the September 11 attacks and the Bali and London bombings. Their extraordinary nature is reflected in the fact that the Howard government saw fit to subject those powers to review and have them lapse after 10 years of operation if no legislation was passed to extend them. I note that the then Labor opposition sought amendments limiting this sunset period to five years—amendments which, unfortunately, at the time were unsuccessful.


The intelligence committee, after robust debate, concluded that these powers should sunset two years after the next federal election. It is right and proper that the next parliament be obliged to grapple with these powers again, and to decide on its own account whether their continuation is justified. Labor was not satisfied that the case had been made for such a lengthy extension. It is not acceptable that these extraordinary powers could operate for two decades without being properly reviewed by the parliament. As I said, this bill is aimed at a present threat; Labor will resource our agencies appropriately to deal with that threat, but we will not abandon scrutiny of agency powers properly considered special or emergency measures.


Moving onto the reviews, importantly, Labor has ensured that these sunset provisions are accompanied by mandatory reviews ahead of time. As was noted in evidence given to the committee, the whole purpose of sunsetting provisions is undermined if appropriate reviews are not conducted. The intelligence committee recommended that its review of the preventative detention order, control order, and ASIO powers be mandated by statute. What is more, it recommended amendment of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor Act to mandate reviews of the powers by that body also. It is worth remembering that it was only due to pressure from Labor that this body was retained. Earlier in the year, the Abbott government described this critical oversight office as 'red tape' and sought to repeal it. We vocally opposed that short-sighted cut, and the bipartisan support the committee expressed for the position in its report on the first bill was vindicated by Labor's consistent support for proper oversight mechanisms.


Speaking on the first bill, I pointed out that the position of monitor had been vacant since April. At a time of substantial change to our national security laws, that office is still vacant. This is simply unacceptable. Labor calls on the government to appoint an appropriate, credentialled and experienced monitor immediately. This is critical. By insisting on dramatically shortened sunset periods and on statutory reviews, both by the monitor and by the intelligence committee, Labor has ensured that, no matter the attitude of the Australian government in the next parliamentary term, there will be a sober and considered review of these powers ahead of their scheduled sunset.


We move onto foreign evidence. Labor has improved key human rights protections in the bill's provisions for the use of overseas evidence in terrorism prosecutions in Australian courts. As we did in regard to the first bill, we have demanded amendments to clarify that torture can never be accepted in any way under our law. As originally presented to the parliament, this bill excluded foreign evidence obtained as a result of torture only where that torture was carried out by public officials. There is no reason why the exclusion should be constrained in this way, especially when we are particularly concerned with regions which may have no readily recognisable state authorities.


The committee recommended the exclusion be expanded to cover torture by anyone. It also recommended the expansion of the definition of evidence obtained under duress to cover situations where evidence is obtained from a person by dint of threats to their person, their family, their associates or their property. In its original form, the bill had only covered circumstances where a person or their family was threatened. Though we strongly support making foreign evidence easier to use, as it is a critical part of enabling successful prosecutions under foreign incursions offences, Labor also wants appropriate safeguards for the accused. The committee recommended that judges be obliged to warn juries about the potential unreliability of foreign evidence; this is an important way of making sure that trials are fair.


On biometric collection, the foreign fighters bill includes provisions for the expanded collection of biometric data on Australian travellers. While the legislation expressly provides only for the collection of photographs, the bill as originally drafted allowed the government to expand this to other forms of biometric data, such as fingerprints or iris scans, by mere regulation and without seeking parliamentary approval.


Labor voiced its objection to this during the committee process. It is not acceptable that such an expansion of power with serious consequences for the privacy of ordinary citizens could be achieved without new legislation. Indeed, it is worrying that this aspect of the bill only became apparent during the Intelligence Committee's scrutiny. It is a vindication of that scrutiny process that did occur. We welcome the committee's recommendation to remove the ability of the government to prescribe further biometric collection by regulation. We also welcome the recommendation that the privacy commissioner oversee both the biometric database that is provided for in this bill and any future legislative proposals to expand it to other forms of data.


On foreign incursions, the bill makes a number of changes to Australia's existing foreign incursions legislation which were recommended by the National Security Legislation Monitor. Appropriately, the bill will roll the Foreign Incursions and Recruitment Act into the Criminal Code and update its provisions to specifically deal with the foreign fighter threat. We welcome those changes along with the improved ability to use foreign evidence and we hope that these improved provisions will allow for successful prosecutions of Australians who engage in lawless conduct in conflict zones abroad.


However, the bill as originally presented was drafted in a confused way. It did not simply implement the monitor's recommendation that the definition of 'engaging in hostile activities' overseas be updated to include terrorist activity as currently defined under Australian law. Rather, it included a new concept: 'subverting society'. As was pointed out in evidence to the committee, this expanded the operation of the foreign incursions provisions well beyond what the foreign incursions provisions were meant to address. It could have seen those provisions address private disputes or petty criminal activity.


Labor welcomes the committee's further recommendation that the definition of 'engage in hostile activity' be amended so that it only captures conduct which would be a serious offence under Australian law. The strange legislative language of 'subverting society' was likely to mislead or confuse the public as to what was intended. As the former monitor Bret Walker pointed out during the intelligence committee process, there is no need for this sort of florid language in Commonwealth statutes, which should be drafted in clear and calm terms. A loaded legislative term like 'subverting society' would cause completely unnecessary community agitation when the substance of the provision is aimed simply at terrorist conduct. Labor welcomes both the substantive changes which faithfully implements the monitor's recommendation and the removal of this poor drafting technique. We are pleased to see the government agree to produce a more tightly constrained provision that is drafted in clear language.


On enhanced oversight, across all parts of the bill Labor has sought improved oversight and accountability mechanisms. We believe that our security agencies can only continue to do their important work if Australia's political leaders are willing and able to reassure the community—and I refer here to every part of our diverse, multicultural community—that our security agencies are not only appropriate empowered but also appropriately accountable. Of key importance is that the committee recommended that it have the power to oversee not just the Australian Intelligence Community agencies but also the AFP in its counter-terrorist capacity. Labor supports this, as it is right and appropriate for the intelligence committee to be able to hold all agencies involved in counter-terrorism activities to public account. This is especially so given the extension in this bill of AFP powers, including to preventative detention orders and control orders.


With respect to the more controversial parts of the bill, particularly the declared areas and advocating terrorism, I will cover those issues during my contribution to the committee stage and in moving the amendments that have been circulated. In conclusion, I will say that Labor has approached this legislation as a responsible opposition should. We have offered the government our bipartisan support for measures to ensure our national security and that is constructive, bipartisan support. Labor did not, and never would, offer the government a blank cheque on this or any piece of legislation. We have worked hard to improve this bill. We want to make sure that it operates as intended, actually serves to protect our security and is subject to limits and accountability appropriate to the sort of free society that Australia is and must remain.


Our committee members have worked hard in pursuit of these ends in the intelligence committee process. We have worked hard in pursuit of these ends in negotiating with the government. And when our concerns have not been satisfactorily resolved, we have moved amendments in this place, which we urge the government to consider and to adopt.


Labor is proud of its record on national security and we are happy to assist the government in getting this bill right. We thank the government for its willingness to accept so many of the changes that we have asked for, and we hope that in that same spirit of constructive bipartisanship they might accept the two further changes we seek in the Senate today.

"Wright, Sen Penny",AG,2014-10-28,"



Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (12:52):  I rise to speak with a heavy heart about this bill, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. This is a significant and complex piece of legislation which, if enacted, will have long-term impacts on how ordinary Australians go about their lives. These impacts will include whether and where people travel; the circumstances in which people can be detained and questioned by ASIO, Customs officials or the police; and what kind of public commentary on controversial issues is allowed to occur in Australia. The reality is that once this legislation is enacted—once it is on the books—it is very likely, on the basis of the lessons of history, that it will be very hard to shift. 


I want to make one thing clear in this speech, and it is this: this legislation does not target only those with a criminal or terrorist intent. Nor does it carefully pinpoint gaps in the existing counter-terrorism legal framework and then fill them in neatly. This is a bill that will affect many everyday Australians and how they go about their lives. It contains widely drafted, sweeping reforms and makes changes to over 20 existing acts. It introduces a range of new, very serious criminal offences. It extends the scope of many other existing criminal offences, and it significantly expands the range and scope of powers available to law enforcement and intelligence-gathering agencies.


Interestingly enough, I received a tweet when I was talking about the need for the scrutiny of legislation. Someone tweeted to me, 'Why do you Greens want to protect terrorists?' I think that is one of the fundamental issues that we need to come to terms with in debating this legislation, because it is not the guilty I am interested in protecting here, it is the innocent. It is actually the Australians going about their lives who will be affected by this wide-ranging, unprecedented change to our laws. Tomorrow these laws may affect me or my child or my neighbour, or someone listening to this speech or reading my remarks. 


In response to some of the commentary that I have been putting out in relation to this national security legislation I received a letter from an Australian working abroad, who thanked me for the Greens' work in opposing this legislation, in particular the 'declared zones' offence. This person said:


While some people are having theoretical debates about what such provisions might mean, it is all too real for people like me. I am an Australian living and working in the Middle East, many of my friends are aid workers and journalists, and this bill will have serious repercussions for us. If this bill becomes law in its current form, on our return to Australia, we will all be criminals; unless and until we can prove we are not.


While in the Middle East I have worked with and volunteered for INGOs … One has to ask how exactly restricting or criminalising the movements of people like me will make Australia a safer place?


I urge people who might be listening to this, or reading these remarks, to remember that every time, in Australia, we lose rights and freedoms that are precious—every time we allow fear to divide us and hurt people who are innocent—terrorism is actually winning. The Australian Greens have consistently said that there must be proper parliamentary scrutiny of this legislation, including a robust inquiry which offers legal experts and relevant stakeholders a genuine opportunity to come to terms with this complex legislation, to analyse it and to provide comment on the bill. 


In the face of fear about terrorism the first failure of this government, in carrying out its duty to protect the population of Australia, is in not providing an adequate opportunity for this parliament and the Australian community to even begin to understand some of the most significant counter-terrorism changes in our lifetimes. This has not happened. This is a failure to uphold and protect some of the most dearly held tenets of the democracy that we cherish—in a sense, that we are fighting for here. This is irresponsible and antidemocratic. Already, by playing the national security trump card, by rushing these laws through parliament in the space of two days in the Senate, with inadequate time to consider them and before they have been properly scrutinised by the very committee of this parliament established to safeguard our human rights—the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights—it is possible to say that this government is already allowing terrorism to win, or to start to win.


The government is pursuing these changes without adequate consideration of the broad range of existing offence provisions and powers that are currently available to such agencies to protect the Australian community against threats to national security, and without a careful analysis of whether each individual reform proposed is a necessary and proportionate response to genuine and legitimate national security concerns.


As it is for every other senator in this place, keeping the Australian community safe from harm is my unwavering priority. Of course it is. I live in the community. My family is in this community. My children are here and so are my neighbours and my friends. But I will not pretend that the only way we can keep our community safe is to undermine the rights and processes that make us a vibrant parliamentary democracy.


I will not agree to amending laws on the run, without allowing the parliament or the community to really understand what they will mean for ordinary Australians. I will not agree that doing that is the best way to guard Australia against national security risks. The Australian Greens support careful lawmaking, particularly when people's lives, rights and liberties are at stake. This means ensuring that the agencies we rely upon to protect us from harm have the tools they need to investigate crime and gather intelligence. But it also means looking at what laws we already have in place, whether they are working properly or need to be improved, and when they should be limited to the most exceptional circumstances. 


In short, it means listening to those with experience and expertise. Sadly, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 has been introduced in flagrant disregard of these principles. As a result, this bill risks being at least an ineffective reaction to the national security threat which is faced by Australia, duplicating existing laws, and at worst it risks being a disproportionate intrusion on the rights and liberties of Australians.


Let's look at the lack of scrutiny first. I was really interested to hear Senator Collins' comments. It will be interesting to see how Labor votes this afternoon when there is an hour's motion to gag debate on this bill. If that motion is successful, this Senate will have fewer than eight hours to consider the most significant counter-terrorism laws in my lifetime. The unwarranted haste with which this bill is being pushed through parliament has meant government agencies and Australia's foremost legal experts have not had enough time to provide a comprehensive analysis of the full bill. The communities who were apparently consulted in relation to the draft bill remain deeply concerned with its content and continue to feel sidelined and ignored. Even the government's own expert—the position established for the specific purpose of monitoring our national security laws—the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the INSLM, has remained vacant since April, leaving Australia without the source of independent expert advice it needs most.


The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am a member, forewent its capacity to inquire into the bill, although the Senate referred it to that committee. The unrepresentative Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, comprised only of the club, coalition and Labor politicians, with no input from crossbenchers or Independents or the Australian Greens, has had too little time to identify and address the potential implications of these changes on the lives of ordinary Australians.


As a lawyer, I remain deeply concerned about the devil yet to be revealed in the detail of this bill. The Australian Greens have a number of concerns about this bill, many of which I will not have time to address during the time allocated. However, I will start with the no-go zone offence. The Australian Greens will seek to abolish the so-called no-go zone provision in this bill which will make it a criminal offence, punishable by 10 years imprisonment, for a person to travel to a declared area. In an extraordinary departure from the type of traditional rule-of-law principles the Attorney-General in this place claims to hold dear, the offence does not include a fault element; it does not include a mental intention element; it does not require the person to be travelling with any kind of criminal or wrongful intent. It effectively allows the executive arm of our government to draw red circles on the world map and put anyone who goes there at risk of criminal prosecution.


There is a narrow list of exemptions for 'legitimate purposes', but this will not protect the many Australians who travel abroad every year. A person who has travelled to a declared zone will be subject to a criminal charge and can only effectively defend themselves if they can bring evidence to show that they were in the area solely for one of the listed legitimate purposes. Legally, to start with, that will be extremely hard to do. As the law stands, visiting friends will not suffice. Travelling to give legal advice or for a religious pilgrimage or ceremony is not covered. And, while visiting a family member will be considered a legitimate purpose, being invited to a wedding in another town while you are there and attending would breach the requirement for the purpose to be a sole reason for the travel.


This law will have a chilling effect on the freedom of movement of every Australian with relatives or friends in areas that are experiencing, or may in the future experience, violence or conflict. Would anyone here with young children take the risk of visiting a sick mother or father in a declared area if they knew they would have to face a criminal court to prove the legitimate reasons for their travel on their return? It is also worth noting that travelling for business purposes is currently not listed as a legitimate purpose in the bill. This offence has the serious potential to isolate and divide family members, dislocate migrant communities and stifle business transactions with developing nations. The risk is that this will further entrench feelings of isolation and alienation in the very communities we rely upon most in building a safer, more cohesive Australian society. And all this when this offence is considered by legal experts to be completely unnecessary.


Australia's criminal laws already well and truly cover circumstances where a person leaves Australia to participate in hostile or terrorist activities overseas, as well as circumstances where a person encourages or urges another person to engage in such activities or a person who financially or otherwise supports terrorist or criminal organisations.


Let's turn to control orders and preventative detention orders. The second area for concern is indeed the extension of sunset clauses—the built-in expiration provisions for various existing powers: control orders, preventative detention orders, ASIO's questioning and detention warrant powers, and certain stop, search and seizure powers relating to terrorism offences available to the police under the Crimes Act. Despite the fact that we are told that this legislation is so urgent that we must consider it within a period of hours in the Senate and get it through the parliament with unwarranted haste, these powers are not due to expire until December 2015 and July 2016. But this bill seeks to extend them further. These powers are exceptional. They allow authorities to operate outside the traditional criminal justice process, because they restrict the liberty of people not charged with, or even suspected of, engaging in a criminal offence.


A number of independent bodies, including the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and the 2012 COAG review of counter-terrorism measures, have carefully reviewed these existing powers. Both the INSLM and the COAG reviews recommended that the preventative detention order regime be repealed, describing it as being 'at odds with our normal approach to even the most reprehensible crimes', and said that it may be thought to be 'unacceptable in a liberal democracy'—but maybe that is not what we are living in anymore. The INSLM also stated that 'control orders in their present form are not effective, not appropriate and not necessary'. Inexplicably, this bill ignores expert evidence in relation to these provisions and precludes the opportunity for further review of these powers by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which is required to review the operation, effectiveness and implications of ASIO's questioning and detention warrant powers by January 2016.


As well as extending the time frame for these powers, this bill extends their reach by making it easier, for example, for the police to obtain and enforce control orders. I cannot say strongly enough: we must not normalise powers that will allow ASIO or the police to detain someone without charge; limit whom they can speak to, where they can go and whether and where they can work; and impact on the lives of their families. We must remember that we are not only talking about Prime Minister Abbott's 'baddies' here; it could very well be a 'goodie'—a person getting on with their everyday life in Australia—who gets caught up in this. If a mistake is made, a suspicion is wrong and someone happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time—and we have historical examples of that in Australia—lives can be destroyed, people can be crushed and our democracy is poorer.


Let me turn to biometric material. This bill contains biometric data provisions that usher in an unprecedented change to the data collected about travellers at Australian airports. I will be moving amendments to remove these sections. No-one has had the time to carefully consider what this change might mean and what impact it will have on the privacy rights of all Australians leaving on international departures, including those who pose no risk to Australia's national security. As presently drafted, these changes could result in giving the green light for the collection and inter-agency sharing of biometric material, which currently includes photographs and face recognition, but could potentially include iris scanning and fingerprints. We just do not know precisely what forms of biometric material will or can be collected, used and shared under these changes and under what circumstances and with whom this material can be shared. Due to lack of time, many experts were unable to provide comprehensive submissions on the impacts of these changes. For these reasons, the Australian Greens will move that the reforms proposed in schedules 5 and 6, relating to the expanded use of biometric material for passenger processing at Australia's border, be removed from the bill.


I will also introduce amendments in relation to the new offence of advocating terrorism. Many experts have suggested this offence duplicates and unnecessarily expands existing offences while using broadly defined terms that may have unintended consequences. This offence risks capturing legitimate commentary on issues like Australia's foreign policy or political satire whilst at the same time driving those with nefarious intentions underground, making it harder to monitor and investigate real terrorism offences such as supporting a terrorist organisation. To remain one of the world's strongest democracies, we must remain free to strongly criticise the actions of our government, particularly on those matters directly relevant to our nation's place in the world, such as whether we should engage in combat activities overseas or whether Australia should publicly condemn or praise a certain political or violent struggle. Not everyone thinks carefully about their public contributions on matters that invoke passionate responses. It is chilling to think of those among us, from our teenage sons and daughters to favourite online bloggers, who, because of impetuous or thoughtless action with no real malice involved, could be at risk of very serious punishment under an offence like this, which does not specifically define the limits of criminal liability.


We also have significant concerns about new powers for the suspension of travel documents and visa cancellations. These clauses give the minister very broad powers with limited oversight and narrow appeal rights. The Australian Human Rights Commission, among others, has pointed out that the cancellation of family and sponsored visas risks violating a range of human rights.


We have other concerns about the expansion of powers of customs officials to detain people without charge, the delayed notification search warrants and provisions governing the use of foreign evidence in Australian criminal proceedings—and we will be speaking further about those in our committee stage amendments.


The issues raised in this speech merely skim the surface of the Australian Greens' grave concerns with this bill. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has not yet even finished its consideration of this bill and is still waiting for responses from the Attorney-General to deal with deficiencies in the mandated statement of compatibility provided with the bill. But it is fair to say that Australia has a proud history of protections and freedoms that it has inherited from hard-fought reforms in British democracy. When the government seeks to take away freedoms including freedom of movement, freedom of expression, right to freedom and freedom from arbitrary detention, it is essential that the legislation is subject to rigorous scrutiny.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2014-10-28,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:13):  I rise to make a short contribution in the five minutes I have available to the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I can assure Senator Wright and other senators in this place that there has, in fact, been robust and deep scrutiny of this bill. The committee listened to a wide range of witnesses and, importantly, also to the evidence provided by the security agencies, who work tirelessly on behalf of the people of Australia to ensure our security and also to ensure that we meet our security obligations to the broader global community.


To put it into context, on 24 September this year the United Nations Security Council met and passed a unanimous motion. The resolution requires all 193 UN member states to prosecute and penalise people who travel or attempt to travel abroad for terrorism training or to help finance such efforts; to deny entry to anyone they have reasonable grounds to believe could be supporting or participating in terror related activities; and to share airline passenger information records and other personal details with international databases to help track and prevent the movement of suspected foreign fighters. It is only the sixth time in 70 years that the Security Council has met with heads of nations. It met in those times to address the most urgent threats to peace and security. We see here that whilst there are urgent threats—and we are seeing those play out both on the global stage, particularly with the events in northern Iraq and Syria, and in Australia, as we have seen just recently in Melbourne, as well as in Canada and the United States—there are emerging and changing threats from people who support the ideology of Daesh or the Islamic state.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security scrutinised these bills and made 36 recommendations. As Senator Collins pointed out before, it was a bipartisan effort whereby members from both the government and the opposition looked at the bill and made suggestions as to how to improve it so that we could capture the operational effect that the agencies need to ensure the safety of Australians but at the same time increase the balance to make sure that essential freedoms are preserved and that there are checks, such as sunset clauses, so that these do not without due cause become a permanent feature of our legislation.


I would like to quickly address some of the key points that have raised concern. One is the issue of advocacy. One of the problems in the past has been that people who had been seeking to inculcate in young, impressionable minds the mindset that this is something that is not only permissible but required by their ideology had been very smart and very clever to walk a fine line to avoid the current law which would capture them. We are seeing that we have a generation of people who have been inculcated to a point where the process from that inculcation to action—to that radicalisation—is very short. And it is quite important that we have the ability to circumvent and to prevent those enabling conditions such that we do not have this body of young people—or, in some cases, older people—who have been radicalised to the point where they can decide to act and very quickly move forward.


We have seen a number of cases in which the so-called hate preachers have walked that fine line, they have inculcated into minds the willingness to act, and this legislation is a way of preventing that. Importantly, they commit an offence if they 'intentionally counsel, promote, encourage or urge the doing of a terrorist act or the commission of a terrorism offence' and the person is reckless as to whether another person will engage in a terrorist act or commit a terrorist offence. There are a number of things in there, particularly the 'reckless' element, that are important and that provide protections from a free-speech perspective. Importantly also, there is a safeguard in that there is an existing defence for acts that are done in good faith, such as political communication or publishing a report or commentary about a matter of public interest.


The sunset clauses, as we talked about, are important measures, and we have reduced the time frames on those to make sure they do not become a continuing feature of our law. But the arrest thresholds are an important part, as we have seen, with increasingly the change from large groups with complex plans seeking to have mass casualty events. We have had a very good record in Australia of our existing laws enabling our security forces to have things like Operation Pendennis, in which we defeated the threat against the MCG in Melbourne. Now we are seeing people operating as small groups or individuals very quickly, with no great planning required in terms of their equipment. It is important to change the threshold to enable our security officers to act in a timely manner so that they can apprehend people and prevent those occurrences. So the threshold is being changed to require that an officer of the law has reasonable grounds to suspect, rather than the threshold of reasonable grounds for belief. This is not arbitrary. Some factual basis for the submission must be shown. It is also important to recognise that this is not a new concept in Australia, with many states and territories already having an arrest threshold that is based on suspicion.


On the issue of biometric measures, we have seen a case in which somebody left Australia, with manual checking at an airport, and went and joined terrorist fighters overseas. We already use biometric measures for people coming into Australia. Many would be familiar with eGate. This legislation provides the ability to use that same technology outbound. It meets the obligations that we have signed up to through the United Nations. It means that we can use existing technology, existing privacy safeguards, on outgoing as well as incoming passengers to prevent the kind of occurrence we saw in Australia before.


I will make one final comment, on declared areas. This is not an offence of strict liability. The DPP still has discretion as to when to actually bring a case against an individual. So, if there is a range of background factors and other information that is in the brief and the DPP cannot for whatever reason use another law, this measure provides an opportunity to bring a case against an individual who has travelled to a declared area. But for a declared area—somewhere like Mosul—witnesses were questioning, during the public hearings on this, why somebody would not be free for example to go and do language training. As I put to those witnesses, in the case of an area like Mosul, where every reasonable person has either fled or has been executed through decapitation or crucifixion, what reasonable person would seek to travel there to do education training? It just does not make sense. And because this is not a strict liability offence, all the people who were talked about in terms of journalism and foreign aid workers would not automatically be captured when they came back, because whole regions are unlikely to be declared areas. In fact, specifically, countries are not going to be able to be declared areas. So this offence is not the dire restriction on freedom of movement that has been claimed. Because it is not strict liability, the DPP has a discretion to include it as part of a brief of evidence.


My time is about to expire, but I commend this bill to the house. It has had good scrutiny by the process that has been set up by this parliament, which has worked well for many years through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, and I commend it to the Senate.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2,speech
"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2014-10-28,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:21):  I rise to speak against the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. I do so because I do not believe that the bill is urgent or even necessary and also because it contains measures that, like the previous national security legislation, erode our rights and freedoms. It is somehow fitting that this chamber is close to empty because it reminds us of Edmund Burke's observation that bad things happen when good people do nothing.


Last week, the government snapped to attention in response to video threats made by a 17-year-old jihadist from Bankstown. I then attracted some attention when I used some mildly unparliamentary language to describe him. I stand by that description. And, for that and other reasons, I do not believe there is any reason to give security agencies additional powers to prevent those like him from causing harm.


We have heard constant claims that we are now operating in a changed security environment where Australia is under threat. Because Daesh is enjoying success in Iraq and Syria, and a sympathiser has perpetrated an atrocity in Canada, the argument goes, we should all be hiding under the doona and giving ASIO and the AFP additional powers to protect us. I say that is not so. This bill has nothing to do with defeating Daesh in Syria or Iraq, and it will not keep us safer here in Australia.


The Attorney-General says that the number of Australians presently involved in the conflict in Syria and Iraq is unparalleled. According to his figures, 160 Australians are currently supporting or fighting with extremist groups. And yet 66 Australians fought in the Spanish Civil War. As a percentage of the Australian population in 1936, more Australians thought helping communists or fascists was a good thing than are currently supporting jihadists. Young men with a thirst for action and too much time on their hands have long joined gangs and become entangled with organised crime. These days—at least for a few—it seems violent religion provides an alternative outlet.


Then there is the basic reality that the government already has substantial powers on the books to deal with any terrorist threat. Apart from the fact—as Bret Walker SC often points out—that violence and conspiracy to commit violence have always been crimes, Australia's security agencies have extensive surveillance capacities. They can, for example, obtain data preservation orders that ensure metadata is retained and an individual's activities on the internet can be examined. They can obtain warrants to intercept phone calls. People can be held and compelled to answer questions. Preventive detention orders and control orders, without any crime having been committed, stop people leaving their homes if it is suspected that they might commit a crime in the future. Passports can be cancelled. Some of these powers are so over the top they are already incompatible with a liberal democracy. No case has been made for the need to add to them. In Australia, lightning kills five to 10 people each year; this does not mean our security agencies should have the right to enter our houses to check on us or imprison those who would walk around during storms.


People have pointed out that Daesh makes sophisticated use of social media and videos deliberately aimed at the young. 'Wouldn't it be better,' I have been asked, 'if watching those videos were made illegal? Wouldn't it be good if we could legislate Hizb ut-Tahrir out of existence?' I have formed the view that the new offence of advocating terrorism, which can be committed by both individuals and organisations, is present in this bill purely to get at Hizb ut-Tahrir and any others like it. It does this in two ways. First, it defines advocacy so as to include the promotion of terrorism. This is broad enough to take in a general statement endorsing revolutionary violence with no particular audience in mind. Second, the offence is drafted in such a way that it requires only that the individual or organisation be reckless as to whether the words in question will cause another person to engage in terrorism. At common law, incitement has always required the element of intent, whereas promotion goes beyond the requirement—also present in incitement—that words ought to act directly on their intended audience.


Last week, I looked at Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia's website. Of course, ASIO probably already know what we do on our parliamentary computers, but I am letting senators know because it was actually an enlightening experience. Hizb ut-Tahrir, like Daesh, supports a global Islamic caliphate. It seeks the imposition of sharia, including the hudud ordinances. These take in nasties such as stoning people to death for apostasy and adultery. It is difficult to avoid the imputation that, given a choice, Hizb ut-Tahrir would prefer Daesh to the Commonwealth of Australia. The issue, of course, is that making Hizb ut-Tahrir illegal will not stop Daesh's videos being made or distributed or watched. In fact, they are likely to acquire a sort of weird cachet from their very illegality. Lots of youngsters, when adults in authority tell them not to do something, immediately go out and do the opposite. This phenomenon is not confined to Muslims. What proscription and listing as a terrorist organisation will achieve when it comes to Hizb ut-Tahrir is to drive the organisation underground.


I like the fact that I can read Hizb ut-Tahrir's website. I like the fact that one of their obnoxious spokesmen turned up on Lateline and revealed to all and sundry just how uncomfortable he is around independent, educated women. I also like the fact that their public presence exposes them to ongoing scrutiny and forces them to speak, not fight. Sunlight is indeed the best disinfectant. It may be possible to legislate bodies like Hizb ut-Tahrir out of existence but not the sentiments it represents.


Thanks to the alleged urgency and necessity of this bill, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security was forced to come up with something approaching a review in a fortnight. Labor, of course, is being its usual supine self on national security—although, to be fair, the recommendations made by the committee are all sound. There is only one problem: they are like putting a bandaid on cancer. Yes, it would be nice to have words like 'encourage', 'promote' and 'advocate' defined with clarity—or at all. It would also be good if the foreign minister could not simply declare entire countries off limits. I agree that the idea of 'subverting society' needs work. But it clearly has not occurred to the Attorney-General that some countries and societies actually make good candidates for subverting: Zimbabwe, for example, or North Korea. I am happy to say that I support the overthrow of Kim Jong-un and Robert Mugabe, and I would not mind if there was a bit of advocating terrorism to achieve that. What does that make me? Even better are the proposals to reel in the lengthy sunset clauses for PDOs and control orders. Instead of 2025 or 2026, they will stay on the books for a mere two years after the next federal election—about four years, then, give or take. Mind you, that is still a long time for bad law to hang around.


Then there is the recommendation, when it comes to unauthorised disclosure of delayed notification search warrants, to take the public interest into account. However, as with the previous national security legislation, this safeguard will only go into the explanatory memorandum, not the bill itself. I may have slept through some of my lectures in law school but I remember enough to know that a court only takes the explanatory memorandum into account when the words of the statute are unclear. And the words in this bill are perfectly clear.


These kinds of laws will effectively turn our security agencies into various versions of secret police. Last week, News Corp's Lachlan Murdoch criticised the attack on freedom of speech that sailed through this place with the support of both major parties in relation to special intelligence operations—laws that could see journalists jailed up to 10 years if they disclose information about them. This bill seeks to prevent so-called 'delayed notification warrants' from being disclosed. We are talking about a warrant. One assumes that Lachlan Murdoch will one day be at News Corp's helm. The way things are going, there will be nothing for his journalists to report aside from the colour of Kim Kardashian's knickers.


Even with the acceptance of all the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, we are still left with a bill that enables the foreign minister to declare large swathes of territory no-go areas, allows the AFP to conduct searches without telling anyone about them for up to 12 months, places further constraints on the ability of Australians to speak freely, engages in extraterritorial overreach, and tells journalists they must go to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security if they come across misconduct rather than reporting to the wider public in the normal way.


Mr Abbott tells us that the 'delicate balance' between freedom and security will have to shift 'for some time to come' in light of the heightened terror risk. What he fails to realise in enacting laws like this one and the national security legislation is that he is curtailing the very liberties that distinguish free countries like Australia. Australia has the rule of law, procedural fairness, the presumption of innocence, free speech and a free media. It is simply not acceptable to give those good things away, surrendering freedom for safety, in response to windy threats from the 'ginger jihadi' of Bankstown. We can do better than that. Giving away freedom for security is like giving your possessions to a thief so you will not be robbed. At the risk of repeating a worn phrase, it would be tempting to call Mr Abbott and Mr Shorten the girly men of personal freedom, but I do not know of any girls who would be intimidated by threats from a spotty youth on YouTube.


Young men with limited skills and an aggressive cast of mind have always been attracted to violence and have often committed crimes That those crimes are now sometimes committed in the name of Islam does not make them different from crimes committed in the name of communism or fascism, or even just testosterone. There is nothing unprecedented, urgent or super risky about any of this. The internet has changed many things about the modern world, often for the better, but communists and fascists alike were able to convince Australians to fight in Spain in 1936 without it.


When I came to write this speech, there were lots of words and phrases I could have used at the outset to describe the foreign fighters bill. I could have called it Orwellian in its desire to put the Australian people under surveillance. When discussing Hizb ut-Tahrir, I could have pointed out that the best response to speech is more speech. I could also have suggested that the government was in the process of tearing up the Magna Carta and depositing the bits in Lake Burley Griffin. I did not use that language at the outset precisely because it has become stereotyped. However, that does not make it any less true. Look at what you are doing to Australia's democratic heritage; and then, in the name of all that is decent, do better.

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2014-10-28,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (13:35):  I also rise to talk this afternoon on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014. I do not have the advantage of having the sunlight shining on me, as Senator Leyonhjelm did throughout his speech, which was indeed pleasant to look at and certainly was a perfect photo opportunity. Senator Leyonhjelm, I will be at some variance with your views in my contribution today, perhaps particularly on the acts of terrorism on dictatorial people in other countries. We share a similar view on many things, as you well know, but today I think we might diverge.


The first responsibility of government is to the security of its citizens. To deliver on this, the Commonwealth relies on a team of thousands: the military, the state and federal police, and the government agencies and organisations whose people we never see—those amongst us who run towards the bomb blast when everybody else is running away. We owe Australians all reasonable protections, and we owe these people all reasonable tools to keep the odds in our favour.


The national security space requires flexibility and adaptability from all those involved, including from legislators. This bill in effect represents the law adapting in response to the ways in which our enemies have adapted in their fight against us. Outlawing the advocacy of terrorism at home is a sensible and necessary measure in a battle where the key recruiting mechanism has been the rhetorical flourishes of charismatic jihad salesmen. We are banning the jihad salesmen.


Restricting travel to declared regions is both an investment in our own security and an act of a responsible global citizen. It is an investment in our security because those who travel to fight may bring their war home with them and it is an act of a responsible neighbour because we would otherwise be exporting our national security liabilities to other countries. Removing the passports of those with ill will may be enough to stop them from reaching their intended battlefields, but is it enough to ensure they do not take up the battle here instead?


The cancellation of welfare payments for individuals of security concern hardly needs a supporting argument. It will remove the possibility of taxpayers' money being used to fund the very terrorism the same taxpayers' money is being used to combat. That is certainly a sound principle but it is also of great practical importance, because terrorism on the scale of that committed by Islamic State is not cheap. They need money; they need lots of it; and that money has to come from somewhere. Let it not come from here.


The government has cancelled a number of passports to date in order to halt those aspiring to join the terrorism tourism trail. That is the right course of action for Australia's security interests and it is the action of a responsible global citizen. But what happens next? What about the individual who is committed to terror and who is stopped from reaching the battlefield by effective border security but whose aspiration to fight may be far from extinguished? At the very least this leaves our security people with a considerable burden, but a far worse outcome would be one akin to what happened in Ottawa last week. It is reported Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's passport application was declined by Canadian police, who believed he intended to travel abroad to fight, before he attacked the National War Memorial and the parliament of Canada instead. The need for the provisions within this bill is evident.


It is also evident that we should start debating whether we must be much more prepared to imprison those amongst us who want to fight our armed forces overseas, those amongst us with the self-declared intention of overthrowing government and imposing an Islamic caliphate, but who simply cannot reach the battlefield to participate in that fight? What if they seek to conduct the fight here? The evidentiary burden for a passport cancellation is appropriately different to the threshold for arrest and imprisonment, but the risk of jihadists participating in the fight at home is very real. So I suggest that, in addition to the very appropriate provisions of this bill, the time has come for us to debate the appropriateness of being much more inclined to jail the enemy amongst us. I know that this bill has been through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security that Senator Fawcett chairs and that he made a contribution earlier. This process has been scrutinised by both sides of government and the minority parties in this house. I commend the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014 to the house on those grounds.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (13:44):  I am delighted that there are so many senators in the chamber to listen to my contribution on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Foreign Fighters) Bill 2014, which of course contains a broad range of measures designed to enhance the capability of Australia's law enforcement, intelligence and broader protection agencies to protect the Australian community from the threat posed by returning foreign fighters and individuals in Australia supporting foreign conflicts.


This bill was introduced into the Senate on 24 September. It was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, both of which reported on the 17th of this month. Even with the short and, I believe, inadequate time available to it, I must say that the PJCIS has worked very hard to examine and scrutinise the bill, and it has done so effectively and closely. The committee made 36 recommendations—many of them calling for quite substantial changes or clarifications. I understand that the government has now agreed to all the recommendations made by the PJCIS. As a result, the federal parliamentary Labor Party determined at its meeting this morning that it will support this bill—but it will, however, propose a number of amendments in the committee stage.


With more and more legislative changes boosting the powers of security agencies, the requirement for effective external oversight is now critical to maintaining an essential level of trust in the community about agency operations. Today I want to use the opportunity of this speech in the second reading debate on the bill to speak about this issue and to state very clearly the importance of this issue of oversight of our intelligence and security agencies. I believe that the time is right for a comprehensive review of the oversight of Australian intelligence agencies as further security measures are brought into the parliament for consideration.


I think that there are a number of steps that not only are worthy of debate, both inside and outside this chamber, but also could be readily adopted to enhance our current system. Last Friday, in fact, I posted a paper on my website, which was also posted by the Lowy Institute and published by the Australian Financial Review. That paper recommended eight measures to improve the oversight and scrutiny of our intelligence and security agencies. I do commend these proposals to the Senate and, as I said, I intend to take the opportunity of this second reading debate to outline some of these proposals to the Senate.


It is the parliament to which the intelligence agencies are accountable, and it is the parliament's responsibility to oversight their priorities and effectiveness. The Australian parliament has no better or more authoritative forum than the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Joint Security, the PJCIS, to do this job. The PJCIS is established under part 4 of the Intelligence Services Act—the ISA. Schedule 1 of the act contains detailed provisions about the committee's operations and appointment processes. But the provision of the ISA regarding a prescribed balance of PJCIS members between the Houses has, I think, been an unnecessary impediment to ensuring that the best-qualified eligible parliamentarians serve on this committee. I believe this should change to ensure that the PJCIS has the capacity to draw on those parliamentarians with the greatest expertise and experience in this area.


I also want to talk about the role of the Australian Federal Police, which now of course is absolutely central in Australia's counter-terrorism framework. In its report on this legislation the PJCIS, in recommendation 14, proposed that the committee's functions be extended to encompass the counter-terrorism activities of the Australian Federal Police, including, but not necessarily limited to, anything involving classified material. I have been arguing the merits of this proposition for a number of years, and I am pleased that the committee has again proposed that the government move in this direction—as it did in its report in 2010 on the review, administration and expenditure of intelligence agencies.


To ensure comprehensive and consistent oversight arrangements, it is critical that the AFP's counterterrorism elements be added to the list of organisations reviewable by the PJCIS and to achieve this section 29(1) of the Intelligence Services Act 2001 should be amended accordingly. Also, currently the Intelligence Services Act stipulates the functions of the committee as review of the administration and expenditure of agencies, including their annual financial statements and in addition, of course, any other matter referred by a minister or resolved by either house of the parliament. I argue that the powers and the access of the PJCIS should be enhanced to include access to more classified information and material, including reports and the classified annual reviews of intelligence agencies so that it can do its job more effectively. Of course, in considering the provision of such additional material, the critical issue arises of where to draw the line. It is clear that some types of information are so sensitive that they should not be provided to the PJCIS, even if the committee were given a broader remit. 


I have outlined in my paper some examples of such sensitive information such as revealing the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source; current or planned operations but not necessarily past operations; revealing the identities of agency staff past and present, unless that requirement was waived by the agency head; technical details of nonhuman intelligence sources including cryptology; data or information provided by another country, unless that other country consents; current vulnerabilities of ICT systems, installations or infrastructures relating to national security; and, technical capabilities which are subject to protection beyond the top-secret level. 


The PJCIS in that report of 2007 proposed that a small working group drawn from relevant departments, agencies and the committee be set up to recommend the types of material which the PJCIS could access, material which should remain off limits and amendments to the ISA enabling any proposed changes for consideration by government. I think this proposal has real merit and I hope to see it implemented.


In addition, currently the PJCIS can only request a matter be referred to it by a responsible minister. In the United States and the United Kingdom, the equivalent parliamentary committees set their own agenda and work programs. It is time for the PJCIS in Australia to be given the power to generate its own inquiries if it believes, following consultation with relevant agencies, that such action is necessary and appropriate. Also, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, who provides detailed scrutiny of the legality and propriety of intelligence agencies' operations, must have her office adequately resourced. The government and the parliament must ensure that the resources and level of staffing provided to the IGIS continue to meet the growing demands and responsibilities placed on them by the expansion of the Australian intelligence community and its powers. 


It is critical that the government and the PJCIS regularly review or audit these resources, including the level of staffing and their expertise, within the office of the IGIS. There has been an enhancement recently. That is a good thing but I would argue that the IGIS's annual report should be required to provide a detailed assessment of the adequacy of resources provided to that office and the consequences of any shortfalls if they occur. The government and the PJCIS should provide a response to any such annual assessment. In addition to that, there should be more formalised liaison between the PJCIS and other oversight bodies, of course including the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security but also the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. For example, each IGIS formal inquiry report should be provided to the PJCIS no more than three months after it is presented to the Prime Minister or relevant ministers. It would also be good practice for the committee to receive regular briefings from the IGIS and the security monitor and, where appropriate, from the National Security Adviser, who is based in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.


In addition to these proposals, I believe there should be strong support for mandatory sunset clauses for controversial legislation. In recent years, in some instances the parliament has used sunset clauses when intelligence agencies have been granted unprecedented powers. These unprecedented powers include AFP detention orders, AFP control orders and ASIO questioning and detention powers. The lifespan of too many such sunset clauses has been far too long and it is simply not possible to predict the nature and extent of terrorist threats over such a long period.

Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia—Minister for Defence) (14:00):  That is a very good question. I have an enormous amount of respect for Dr White. Indeed, we used him to do a report into the mess that was left to us by the former Labor government with respect to frigates being several hundred million dollars over budget and several years late. The only real authority in Australia as to where we are at with submarines is inside the defence department. If the Labor Party had done its homework and read and studied what Admiral Moffitt, who was in charge of the program, has been saying for the last several years, it would know the timing is crystal clear. For six years, Labor had done nothing. Indeed, I said this on 8 May 2013. I said this in a number of statements. I said that if the two options left behind by Minister Smith, the son of Collins option and the bespoke Australian design, were real and not fantasies then we would accept the minister at his word. But I have a copy of Labor's submarine design here.




Senator Moore:
  Mr President, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance to the question. The question relates to a statement made by Dr John White. The question was about that statement and also the claims about the reasons why the Australian submarines cannot be built here.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Johnston) to questions without notice asked by Senators Wong and Conroy today relating to the manufacture of the next fleet of Australian submarines.


What we see here today in the chamber is that this government and this minister are not content with lying to the Australian people and in particular to South Australians before the election; they are continuing to lie about that broken promise after the election.




Senator Abetz:
  Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: the honourable Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has made the direct allegation that the Minister Johnston has lied and that needs to be withdrawn, as she well knows.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong?




Senator WONG:
  I will withdraw 'lie' and replace it with 'mislead'. That is because before the election this member told South Australians that this government, were they to be elected, would build the submarines in Adelaide. Yet today and every day we see him confecting excuses to walk away from that promise. The important point for today is as this, as I said: they are not content with misleading South Australians before the election, because this government, this Prime Minister and this minister are intent upon confecting excuse after excuse to try to justify a broken promise.


Let us go through some of the excuses which this government has put forward for their broken promise. First, they said that an off-the-shelf submarine would be better and cheaper. The evidence to the Senate committee—which is not from Labor Party people and not from the South Australian government, but from experts in the field—has said very clearly that an off-the-shelf submarine does not have the capability, does not have the range and cannot do the job that the Australian Navy needs. One excuse hits the wall.


Second, the government says that we do not have the skills here in Australia to build the submarines. Again, there is evidence before the Senate committee. Also, we know that we have great shipbuilders here in Australia and a great and highly skilled workforce, who have been denigrated consistently by this government. But important evidence before the Senate committee said very clearly that we do have the skills to build the submarines here in Australia.


The third confected excuse to try to justify Prime Minister Tony Abbott walking away from the promise to South Australians is cost. What we have is the government softening people up by backgrounding the media with inflated costs for an onshore build. At the Senate inquiry I attended in Adelaide, Mr Hamilton-Smith got it right when he said that people were being softened up for a broken promise. We had figures such as $50 to $80 billion been quietly backgrounded to the media by the government in an attempt to suggest that an onshore build would be too expensive. That excuse has been demolished as well by public statements by shipbuilders, including the shipbuilder TKMSA in Australia, about whom Senator Conroy spoke in his question. They stated they could deliver 12 submarines that met Australian requirements for $20 billion with the price including all the programmatic aspects to deliver the submarines in Australia.


That the final excuse that they have returned to is in fact on a capability gap in terms of the timing of the delivery of submarines. The minister has been trying to suggest that is actually the reason. It is not a broken promise and it is not all the other reasons which have been demolished. Actually, it is the timing reason. Let us remember who has said that the minister is wrong: Dr John White, naval shipbuilding expert and co-author of the Winter review that the minister commissioned. He said:


There is still sufficient time available, with adequate contingency, for the competitive project design study to be carried out and to build the future submarines in Australia.


Commodore Paul Greenfield said:


… there does not have to be a capability gap if we get on with it now.


That evidence was given on 30 September. 


Finally, Rear Admiral Peter Briggs, the former submarine commander and head of the new submarine capability team, said:


Our strong recommendation is that we get bids from all four potential contenders and make a sensible, informed choice at that point and that we get on with it …


In other words, we should go to an open tender process—a proper tender process. 


Every excuse that this government has put up for breaking their promise has been demolished by the experts in the Senate committee. And the only thing that South Australians can conclude by observing this minister's answer today and every day is that this is a government confecting excuses—putting up excuses which are flimsy, misleading and untrue—in an attempt to avoid responsibility for yet another broken promise.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-10-28,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (15:08):  If it were all as straightforward and rosy as Senator Wong makes out, you would have to wonder why there was not a defence submarine contract in place when the change of government took place. If it were all as straightforward and rosy as Senator Wong suggests, you would have to wonder why there was not a settled submarine design in place when the change of government took place. If it were all as rosy as Senator Wong and Senator Conroy point out, you would have to wonder why Labor's 2007 promise to build submarines and to start work in 2007 went unactioned for six long years. There were six years of inaction.


I do not like to come into this chamber and give Senator Conroy any credit for anything but—do you know what?—more work went into the design of the national broadband network than went into the design of the next generation of Australian submarines. There was more work on that napkin on the RAAF VIP plane, when the NBN was designed, than there was for Australia's future submarines. 


The Labor Party come into this chamber today and tried to suggest, as they have done consistently, that there has been 12 wasted months—as I think I heard Senator Conroy shout out at during question time—




Senator Conroy:
  Twelve wasted months.




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  There he goes again! There were six wasted years, Senator Conroy—six years in which you did nothing. Not only did you not progress things during those six years, you took them backwards. By 2012-13 you had managed to drop the nation's share of defence spending to its lowest level since 1938. You cut the defence budget by the single largest amount—10.5 per cent—since the end of the Korean War. Following your 2009 white paper you cut or deferred some $16 billion. All up, your decisions led to 119 defence projects being delayed, 43 projects being reduced and eight projects being cancelled. 


But, worst of all, Labor actually took more than $20 billion out of the forward projections for the future submarine program. That is what they did. 




Senator Conroy:
  Dear oh dear! 




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  He can protest all he wants. He can complain all he wants, but the facts speak for themselves. Nothing was done in six years. No contracts were signed. No design was settled upon, and the budget was stripped bare. 


We went to the last election with something the Labor Party did not have—an actual policy for defence. Senator Conroy and Senator Gallacher—if he is going to speak—are welcome to quote from Labor's defence policy if they like. But there was not one for the last election. It was blank—as blank as their actions in the preceding six years. Our policy made it very clear that we will make the decisions necessary to ensure that Australia has no submarine capability gap within 18 months of the election. That is exactly what we will do. 


We will also ensure that the work on the replacement of the current submarine fleet will centre around the South Australian shipyards. That is exactly what we will do. We have made it clear that there will be more jobs in South Australia in future as a result of our government's commitment to follow through on delivering more submarines for the future. 


Labor talked about more submarines for six years, and did absolutely nothing. By the time of the next election we will have settled on designs, we will have progressed under contracts, and we will be in a position where we can identify that there will be more jobs for South Australia. So, rather than the fear campaign that keeps being waged by those opposite—rather than wanting to scare people into believing that doom and gloom is around the corner—our comment is clear: there will be more jobs. There will be more jobs in South Australia. We will make the decisions that Labor failed to make for six years. We will budget to deliver on those decisions, although Labor stripped the budget bare.


We will make sure that we look after the interests of our defence force, the interests of Australian taxpayers, and that we deliver jobs for the future. Unlike those opposite, who have nothing to stand on, I promise you that by the time of the next election there will be clear evidence that South Australia's defence industry is secure in the future—far more than it was under those opposite.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:13):  The tired, old lies being told by this government have not defended the government on the issue of submarines for the last three months, and they certainly will not get them through the next three months. They can keep trotting out the statement that we did nothing, even when, in estimates, it was agreed that $200 million was set aside and $70 million has actually been spent on the design and the whole process—they can go through all of that—but what is at stake here is the honesty of Mr Abbott and Senator Johnston. They stood in front of the gates of the ASC and said that they would build 12 subs in Adelaide. I have stood right there—in exactly the same spot. I have even shown the Senate the video of Senator Johnston making that promise before the last election.


Where did they start? The government backgrounded all of the media, saying that the Japanese submarine was much better than the Australian submarine on what we were thinking of. Unfortunately, every expert in Australia who knows anything about submarines turned up at a Senate committee to say, 'That's just not true.' Rear Admiral Peter Briggs, one of Australia's pre-eminent submariners, said:


Proposing that you go and buy an off the shelf submarine with a 6,000 mile range, it’s worse than a waste of money, it’s an illusion.


The experts told us that the government's fantasy about buying existing Japanese submarines was an illusion. That is what the experts said, so the government said, 'Oh dear. That one has hit the fence. Let's move on. Cost!' The next backgrounding the government did of all the media was to say it would cost between $50 billion and $80 billion to build the subs here in Australia. What did the experts queue up at the Senate committee to tell us? What did the companies say? The experts at TKMS wrote a letter to the government to try to head off this shonky decision to hand the submarine contract to the Japanese. They said that they could build 12 new submarines in Australia for $20 billion—not the $50 billion to $80 billion advanced by the government but $20 billion. So, when it comes to their excuses, just do not believe the government's lies.


Then the government started going around the country saying: 'We've missed out on how good the Japanese subs were and we've missed out on the cost, because none of that's true. Skills! Australia doesn't have the skills to build submarines.' Well, unfortunately, what did the experts say about that? BAE, the shipbuilders involved in the AWD project, who had to listen to the government make claims about 150 gross man hours per tonne as a productivity rate, say that they are achieving a productivity rate of 76 gross man hours per tonne. But today, yet again, the minister stands up and says that Australia, based on the AWD, does not have the skills and cannot get the productivity. Do not let the evidence get in the way of the answers from the Minister for Defence in this chamber!


There is the tender process. Now they are claiming we do not have time because the Collins subs will retire before we will finish building the subs. What does the pre-eminent leading naval shipbuilding expert in this country, Dr John White, say? He is so good that Senator Johnston just received a report that he hired him to write on Australia's shipbuilding industry. What does he say? He says:


There is still sufficient time available, with adequate contingency, for the competitive project design study to be carried out and to build the future submarines in Australia …


Every excuse to break the promise— (Time expired)

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2014-10-28,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland) (15:18):  I want to follow on from the comments that Senator Birmingham made. I think he was onto something when he was comparing the inaction on the submarines while Labor were last in government to what they were doing on the NBN. They did spend billions of dollars on the NBN and we all saw the results of that—not much service to people and nothing rolled out, but lots of money spent. We saw no planning on the NBN. After reflecting on hearing Senator Conroy, who is now in charge of the submarine in a shadow capacity for the Labor Party, I thought, 'What would be more frightening? Having a Labor government do nothing on submarines or having Senator Conroy doing a lot? What would be more frightening for us as a nation?' We all saw the results for the NBN when the Labor Party tried to spend billions of dollars, did nothing and wasted money in convoluted contracts, when they clearly did not have a commercial bone in their body in order to sign something which will protect the interests of this nation.


We just saw an example of that. The shadow defence minister of our nation would like to take, as somehow almost tendered documents, statements made on a radio station by a European submarine builder, which are apparently evidence enough of what the budget should be. If this is how the Labor Party put their budgets together in government, maybe it starts to explain a lot about why our budget is blowing out and why they could never hit a deficit target in their whole period in government.




Senator Gallacher:
  This is about submarines!




Senator CANAVAN:
  Apparently it is okay, Senator Gallacher, for us to say that a company has said something on the radio, so it must be a fact. Because someone has said in a radio interview that they could build something for $20 billion, that is now an established fact. That is not the process we are going to take in government. We are not going to rely on evidence from a radio transcript in a $20 billion decision for this nation. The decision is about the defence interests of our nation and will have decade-long consequences on how we can defend our nation.


The approach that we take when we are going to spend that sort of money, when we make a decision that will be about protecting the interests of our children and grandchildren in this nation, is to take the best evidence from the Department of Defence. They have the experts who are independent and are not working for particular companies—not that there is anything wrong with that, but everybody of course has their own barrow to push. We need to rely on independent evidence, and that is what this government is doing. We will not be cherry-picking evidence provided by particular people. We will be properly testing it through the process that the Labor Party also used on defence decisions when they were in government. It will be a two-pass process: there will be a first-pass process to go to cabinet and a second-pass process when more due diligence is done. That is what will happen and that will lead to better decisions by our government.


I was also listening to Senator Wong. She said that we do have the skills here in this nation to build a submarine. I have been to some of the Senate committee hearings—I am a member of the Senate economics committee—and I cannot think of one witness who thought that we can build a submarine alone in this nation. That cannot happen. It did not happen with the Collins class submarines; it is not happening with the air warfare destroyers. We will have to rely on expertise in other countries. Everyone recognises that. The Collins class was a multicultural submarine. It was made up of Swedish design, a US combat system and French propulsion. We will have to do the same with any decision we make in the future. It cannot all be done here, but there will still be plenty of work done in Australia, particularly in Adelaide, as the minister has outlined.


I want to finish with some evidence that was also presented at one of these Senate committee hearings. It was from Mr Glenn Thompson, who is the Assistant National Secretary of the Australian Workers Union. He put in his submission that the project to replace the HMAS Success, which has just been re-contracted, should have been approved and announced many years ago. I put that to him and said, 'I presume that this means it should have been done more than one year ago.' Mr Thompson replied, 'Absolutely.' So here we have the assistant national secretary of the AWU saying that the Labor Party should have made that decision years ago on that ship, and their own union bodies are damning them for their inaction. The reason that we are in this plot right now is that Labor had six years to do something on this and did nothing.

Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:23):  I rise on the motion to take note of answers by Senator Johnston to questions by Senator Wong and Senator Conroy. It was really pleasing that Senator Birmingham broke his self-imposed exile and contributed to the debate. He has been conspicuously absent in this debate right throughout. But, as normal, his pedigree came to the fore. If you check his resume, Mr Deputy President—I am not sure that you have ever bothered to do that—you will find that his experience in life is restricted to political office as an adviser and the like. Real-world experience is not all that prominent on his resume, so he did what he was expected to do as a professional politician: he put his hand in his pocket, went on the stump, prevaricated and introduced other topics of no relevance to the critical matter at hand.


You cannot move in South Australia without realising this is a widely-held and deeply-felt subject. Of the number of telephone calls over a few short weeks from constituents to my office—I stress these were not from Labor held constituencies—70.5 per cent indicated that they wanted the submarines built in South Australia; 2.1 per cent indicated that they did not want the submarines built in South Australia; and 27.4 per cent had no view. This is a widely-held and deeply-felt important issue. As Senator Wong correctly put it, the minister has ignored the experts, is misleading the public and is breaking a promise.


The first point of misleading was when he introduced the AWD project, which he said was several hundred million dollars over budget, but he ignored the fact that the Audit Office produced a very comprehensive report. Part of the reason for those overruns was:


Immaturity in the detailed design documentation provided by Navantia, predominantly associated with drawing errors or omissions, contract amendments and late Vendor Furnished Information.


This resulted in 'an average of 2.75 revisions per drawing' and led to:


… costly and out-of-sequence rework in cases where construction work already undertaken no longer matched the design.


So I will not cop the workforce there being denigrated by anyone—particularly not this minister saying that they lack productivity. When asked, the Defence Materiel Organisation CEO said that there is 'no lack of productivity' from the workforce. It is 'costly rework' that is driving this loss of productivity on the project. That does not fall within the remit of the people who turn up there every day to do their job—and do it in a damn good way and in a very efficient manner.


As I said, Senator Birmingham has come out of his self-imposed exile, but let us look at what has happened with the other Liberal senators in the recent weeks. One South Australian senator broke ranks. My good colleague Senator Edwards, deputy chair of the economics committee, has said the project should go out to open tender. Locking Australia out of the process was like 'not inviting an uncle to a wedding'. Senator Edwards has stepped up and is backing submarines in South Australia. Senator Fawcett has been eminently on the record right throughout this and has had to correct an erroneous report of his position, but he has been, very clearly, on the case and on the job in South Australia. Now I go to Senator Ruston. Senator Anne Ruston said that the government should consider the evidence from expert witnesses. That is not criticism from Senator Wong or Senator Conroy. That is criticism from Senator Ruston. The government should consider the evidence of expert witnesses. It is a bit of free advice to her own government. Then we have the member for Hindmarsh, a Liberal MP, lobbying the PM for the local submarines bill. It is very clear that widely-held, deeply-felt community sentiment in South Australia says: 'Don't break a promise, build the subs here, make them in Australia, manufacture them in Adelaide and keep people in work.' It is a very clear sentiment that I endorse.

  The Australian Greens support the empowerment of women and girls and we support the International Day of the Girl Child. We will not be opposing this motion, but I would like to place on record that we utterly reject the government's claim that they are committed to improving women's economic empowerment. This government's cruel budget cuts family tax benefits, kicks the vulnerable off welfare, cuts the parenting payment and seeks to impose a GP co-payment. These attacks on women's economic empowerment come after the cuts to the low income super contribution and the plans to water down reporting requirements designed to tackle the gender pay gap. Of course, cutting $7.6 billion out of the foreign aid—the biggest single cut in the federal budget—and claiming to care for the world's most vulnerable is not a new aid paradigm; it is a heartless joke. We will not be opposing this motion, but we have submitted our own motion which commends the International Day of the Girl Child without politicising the issue or falsifying the government's record.

Senator MILNE:
  I table an explanatory memorandum and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



As a democracy that values transparency and accountability, and as a major player in the global extractives market, Australia has a responsibility to ensure that our companies demonstrate best practice revenue transparency. Currently, the legislative framework that governs the conduct of Australian companies overseas is opaque, with many Australian companies the subject of concerning allegations in relation to corruption, bribery, human rights abuses and environmental degradation.


There are many legislative changes that need to occur to deal with this problem in its entirety, but there are important initial steps that we can and must take immediately. This Bill, the Corporations Amendment (Publish What You Pay) Bill 2014, is the first important stage in this process.


This Bill creates mandatory reporting requirements for ASX-listed and Australian based extractive companies—including those involved in oil, gas, mining and native forest logging—on all financial payments they have made, over the previous year, to any government in whose country they operate, on a project-by-project basis. This is a reform that has long been called for by some of Australia's most prominent and respected NGOs who are members of the Publish What You Pay coalition, including Oxfam Australia, the Australian Council for International Development, Transparency International, and World Vision. 


Currently, the extent to which Australian companies self-report this information is very limited. As highlighted by Publish What You Pay Australia's report Australia: An Unlevel Playing Field—Extractive industry transparency on the ASX 200, current levels of voluntary disclosure are very low. Furthermore, in the instances where companies have disclosed information, it is fragmented across country, sub-national and business units. As such, there is a need for far greater clarity, transparency and consistency in the reporting of payments to foreign governments by Australian extractive companies.


The global push for extractive industry transparency


Among our closest allies, Australia is now being left behind in its reticence to introduce this legislation, and we must catch up. Around the world, countries including the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom are all introducing mandatory reporting requirements for extractive companies, coming together to create a global standard. While they hold their extractive companies to higher standards, Australia lags behind. 


In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act was introduced in 2010, with section 1504 of this law requiring all U.S. and foreign companies registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to publicly report how much they pay foreign governments for access to their oil, gas and minerals. 


In the European Union in 2013, EU member states signed 'Publish What You Pay' requirements into law, extending extractive companies to include not only oil, gas and mining companies, but also those involved in logging native forest. The United Kingdom recently completed their consultation on this EU Directive, and is set to have legislation finalised later this year, ready to come into effect in January 2015. Norway has also introduced domestic legislation to activate this EU Directive, with many other member states in the process of developing this legislation.


In July 2013, Canada also committed to development of mandatory standards for payments by extractive companies. Like Australia, Canada is heavily involved in extractive industries, and in this example the Canadian Government, the Canadian Publish What You Pay coalition, and the mining sector—including the Mining Association of Canada, and the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada—all came together to develop draft recommendations for mandatory reporting mechanisms. This is an encouraging example of the resources sector working constructively with Government to commit to transparency, and I am hopeful that Australian extractive companies will show their support for this legislation like their Canadian counterparts.


Led by this example, Australia must commit to Publish What You Pay legislation. Already we are being left behind in the push toward this global standard. Not only have we failed to implement these payment transparency mechanisms, but we are failing to investigate concerning corporate behaviour overseas. We remain one of the few countries that still permit facilitation payments rather than recognising them as bribes. The OECD recently said they were ""seriously concerned"" at the lack of effort regarding foreign bribery. We must do better, and this Bill is a first important stage in achieving greater transparency and accountability for Australian companies.


 This Bill establishes for Australia the same standards that have been set already within foreign jurisdictions, establishing similar requirements and thresholds that are being introduced in the United Kingdom, United States and Canada. As the Publish What You Pay Coalition in Australia has highlighted, the United States, European Union and Canadian legislation will cover 70% of the global extractive market, including companies that are also listed on the ASX. This Bill would substantially contribute to increasing this global effort, capturing an additional 5% of the global extractive market. As the rest of the world moves forward with this important initiative, we must not be left behind.


Investment, costs and business benefits


In addition to improved transparency, this Bill would benefit the investment environment. Both the Financial Services Council and the Australia Council of Superannuation Investors, major players in the Australian investment market, support mandatory disclosure mechanisms like those established in this Bill because they provide more information which members can use to better evaluate risks associated with investments. Similarly, it will enable ASX listed companies to better assess risks associated with pursuing projects in developing countries. This was a key benefit identified by the United Kingdom Government in developing their mandatory reporting legislation. By the same reasoning, as the rest of the world moves toward Publish What You Pay regimes, Australian companies that don't report this data may be viewed as higher risk investments due to their comparatively opaque reporting standards. As the UK Government's Impact Assessment of their Publish What You Pay legislation highlighted, this kind of regime is expected to reap benefits for both business and investors.


Companies already compile and track the data that would need to be disclosed under the legislation, for themselves and their subsidiaries. Furthermore, as other foreign jurisdictions introduce mandatory disclosure laws, many companies will need to comply with mandatory reporting requirements due to their participation in other stock markets. Estimates of the cost associated with the Publish What You Pay legislation for companies in the EU were estimated to be just 0.05% of their annual revenue in the first year of implementation, and then less thereafter. Given the multibillion dollar profits associated with extractive companies (in the financial year 2011-12, Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton made profits of USD 5.8 billion and USD 15.4 billion respectively), and the fact that companies will already have to provide this information under schemes in other jurisdictions, compliance costs are not a barrier to implementation.


Extractives transparency and international development


With Australian firms heavily involved in extractive industries overseas, including in countries where resource extraction is often linked to poverty, instability and corruption, this Bill is an important transparency mechanism. Despite many developing countries having large resource bases, the citizens of these countries often remain in poverty due to corruption and poor governance structures. By improving accountability with this Bill, citizens and civil society groups in these countries will have far greater access to information about payments, and as a result, a far greater capacity to hold their governments to account. For this reason, aid and development organisations around the world including Oxfam, World Vision, Action Aid and many others, back the introduction of mandatory payment disclosure legislation. In their recent report Trillion Dollar Scandal, international NGO ONE identified introduction of mandatory reporting requirements for extractive companies as one of the central ways through which we can stem the billions that flow illicitly out of developing countries every year. This Bill reduces the opportunity for corruption and other illicit activities by requiring the reporting of payments that have previously been in the dark. By promoting better governance through these measures, better social outcomes for citizens of developing nations will follow. 


As the Publish What You Pay Coalition has noted, the amounts of money at stake are ""potentially transformational"" with, for example, ""exports of oil and minerals from Africa [in 2008] were worth roughly $393.9 billion, nearly 9 times the value of international aid to the continent and over 10 times the value of exports of agricultural produce.""


As current chair of the G20, signatory to both the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and the OECD Convention on Combating the Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, Australia must show leadership by implementing this legislation.

Senator CASH:
  The government will not be supporting this motion. A fundamental part of Australia's immigration system is that people found not to engage Australia's protection obligations and to have no lawful basis to remain in Australia are expected to return to their country of origin. Australia does not remove people where this would contravene our obligations under international human rights instruments to which Australia is a party, including the Refugee Convention. Australia is bound by the customary international law principle of non-interference in the international affairs of other sovereign states. Australia's consular obligations and entitlements under international law do not extend to monitoring the welfare of non-national offshore citizens.

  I am aware of the reports of the treatment of Mr Zainullah Naseri by the Taliban. Mr Naseri is a Hazara, who arrived in Australia by boat and spent time in detention before being granted a bridging visa. He was deported after his application for refugee status was rejected. It has been reported that he was abducted by the Taliban while travelling from Kabul to his home district of Jaghori. His kidnappers are reported to have tortured him for two days before he seized an opportunity to escape. This is an extremely distressing story and it is proper that the immigration minister has ordered an investigation. Labor urges the minister not only to ensure that the investigation is conducted in a comprehensive and timely manner but that the findings are made public. We are also concerned that he has made statements that may appear to prejudice the results of the investigation. The minister has been reported as saying— (Time expired)

  I find it extraordinary that the first and only person forcibly returned to Afghanistan under this government has been found to have been tortured upon return, so much so that the minister has, rightly, called for an investigation. Yet we see here today the government refusing to accept that halting the forced returns of others might indeed be a good idea, given they could not guarantee the safety of the only one person whom they have so far sent back. There is an investigation underway. The government know that something happened that should not have happened. They know it is dangerous there and here we have the government blindly wishing to continually dump Hazara refugees back in Afghanistan to face torture by the Taliban. I do not know what the opposition are going to do on this motion. I suspect they did not want this going to a vote in the first place.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:13):  I rise today to speak to the MPI that we have just agreed to in relation to the Abbott government's set of broken promises. What we have seen from this government is broken promise after broken promise. These promises that have been broken go to the heart of the budgets of ordinary Australians—whether they are working Australians, whether they are pensioners, whether they are Australians who rely on benefits, or whether they are families with children. There is hardly a group in our community that the Abbott government's broken promises have not affected. The big end of town seems to be okay, but every other group in Australia has been really hit hard by these broken promises. They are very serious because, prior to the election, Mr Abbott gave absolute—what we thought were cast-iron guaranteed—commitments that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no cuts to pensions, no rise in the GST, no cuts to the ABC and no cuts to SBS.


We have seen quite the contrary on display from the government. Every single one of those allegedly cast-iron promises to the Australian public has now been absolutely broken, slashed and burned, cut up into little pieces and is now lying on the party room floor. It is an absolutely disrespectful way to treat Australians. I want to focus in particular on what the Australian public have to look forward to in the area of public health if Mr Abbott's government's cuts in that area make it through the parliament. What we have seen is an $80 billion cut to Australia's public hospitals and education. In relation to health we have seen the imposition of a GP tax, a tax on being sick, a tax on ordinary Australians when they visit their doctor. That will cost Australian families $3.5 billion a year in out-of-pocket expenses. For every single Australian, regardless of their income—whether they are a pensioner, an average income earner or have got children—that is the hit to their pocket. It is a hit on the most vulnerable in our community. People who should be supported by a safety net have seen that safety net ripped out from under them.


It is also the government's plan to end Medicare. Right back as far as Malcolm Fraser the Liberals and the Nationals have not supported Medicare. Why? I have no idea. Australia's Medicare system is a proven system, it is a good system, it is valued by countries right around the world. But it seems that this government and successive Liberal-National governments want to slash and burn Medicare. As a young parent, as a low-income earner, I absolutely struggled when I was forced to take out health insurance under the Fraser government. What that meant was that I took my children to emergency departments and went without appropriate Medicare for myself because of cost. We should never impose that on Australians. We have had that strategy before. We have seen that it does not work. It is a failed strategy. The GP tax will say that the government decides who does visit a doctor and who does not. That is not right. I have lived through those days and I would not want to put that on anyone else. It is an unfair process. Our Medicare system should be available to every person in the community regardless of personal circumstances. It is not for governments to come between a medical practitioner and their patients.


What is more, there is no evidence in Australia that GP services are being overused by patients—none whatsoever. In fact, we do want people who are vulnerable or have got persistent health problems to be visiting their GP. GPs are at the front line of our health services. They are the gatekeepers of our health services. But the Abbott government's broken promises do not stop there. We know that if you get a referral for an X-ray or to a physio there is likely to be a tax on that. If you get a prescription for pharmaceuticals there will be an additional tax on that. Out-of-pocket expenses for ordinary everyday Australians will just go on and on and on. We will see Australians lining up at emergency departments just as I did when I had young children. We will see pensioners going without the medical services they need because they will be too scared of the cost. This is extremely unfair. It is a complete broken promise. It is time the Abbott government admitted it and turned its back on this unfair tax.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (16:19):  Bravo, Senator Lines, for making it through another repetitive effort from the great strategists opposite. They sit down every morning and say: 'What's the biggest thing on our agenda? What are we really passionate about raising on behalf of the Australian people?' We once again have this very predictable and extremely repetitive effort. Bravo, Senator Lines, for having another swing. To everybody from Labor who is going into bat today, well done! I hope we have not had to recycle too much! Unfortunately, from listening to that, they have no idea.


Minister Johnson today in question time had it right. It is a very predictable MPI because there is no idea on the other side. We have blank space, blank heads, a blank page. It is a classic Labor tactic. It is not about broken promises; it is like a broken record. And the thing with a broken record is that people stop listening to it; they just turn it off; it becomes white noise in the back of everybody's day; nobody is listening. With your own reputation in tatters after six years of broken promises and incompetence, you are trying to tar us with your own brush. Labor is saying: 'We know we were dishonest, we know we were useless, but Tony Abbott and his mob are just as bad.' But the problem is that that claim is absolutely false. It is a classic tactic of Labor to go out with a media release, press conferences, statements in the chamber and questions through an inquiry that actually do not match the facts. In fact the shadow minister for employment released press releases during estimates which completely falsely represented what was happening in the estimates hearing at that particular time. It is a tired old tactic. The Australian people can obviously see through it. Despite your denials about the election results, there is no denying that they were emphatic about getting rid of the rhetoric and false claims of Labor.


Let's talk about broken promises. Labor promised to consult on climate change and instead delivered a carbon tax. Labor imposed the world's biggest carbon tax—a $9 billion a year hit to our economy costing average households over $550 per year. Despite the emphatic result of the election over a year ago, Labor still supports a carbon tax. Labor senators voted to the keep the carbon tax in place last July, although they do not talk about that back in their electorates. They are in denial about the election result—a broken record long after the audience has left the dance floor.


Labor promised a budget surplus—in fact, they did not just promise it once; they promised it 500 times—but Labor have not delivered a budget surplus in over a quarter of a century. In fact, Wyatt Roy, the member for Longman, was not even born when Labor last delivered a budget surplus. Labor promised less debt; Labor government debt blew out to over $320 billion and was projected to reach $667 billion in 10 years. Labor promised more jobs; under Labor, the number of unemployed increased by over 200,000, productivity declined by 0.7 per cent a year, working days lost to strikes doubled and business red tape increased, making it a bit hard to deliver on that promise by Labor of more jobs. Another promise by Labor was to cut company tax; after the election, Labor scrapped the tax cut. Labor promised to give $2.1 billion for a transport link in Western Sydney; it never happened.


Labor promised to build an NBN. It would have cost at least $29 billion more than we were told, and hardly anyone signed up. The government is getting the NBN back on track with more than twice as many homes and businesses now receiving NBN services than a year ago. Under a coalition government, NBN Co met its rollout target for the very first time. That is good management. Labor promised to build 2,650 trades training centres in schools; 2.409 of them have not been built. Labor promised safe and secure borders; over 50,000 illegal arrivals came in more than 800 boats, causing a cost blow-out of over $11 billion. Labor promised to support the Australian Defence Force, and the Defence Force budget fell to the lowest level as a percentage of GDP since 1938.


This MPI goes to education, health, pensions, the GST, and the ABC and SBS. So let us look at the reality versus the string of Labor lies. In relation to education and schools under this government, Commonwealth spending for schools will reach record highs and increase over four years. That is the reality. It is black and white in the budget papers. In the recent budget, the Australian government kept its commitments and is investing record recurrent funding of $64.5 million in government and non-government schools over the next four years. That is an increase of $4.6 billion, or 37 per cent, during this period. They are the facts. There will be no cuts to education funding for schools. I quote ABC Fact Check:


The Government did not cut $30 billion from schools in the May budget … Ms Ellis is spouting rubbery figures.


It is black and white, and it is simple: we did not cut funding to education. No matter how many times you say that we did, no matter how many MPIs you bring before the Senate, and no matter how many times you trot shadow ministers and backbench senators out for press releases and media releases, it does not make it true.


That is only one component of the Education portfolio; let us turn to universities. Labor's campaign on university reform is perhaps the most dishonest yet and I am sure that we are going to have a right royal stoush over the coming weeks about the reality versus Labor lies on that particular campaign. Let us look at Labor's record and at Senator Carr's record. Senator Carr's record on universities is that he proposed cuts to higher education and research of over $6.6 billion, which the department confirmed at a Senate inquiry last week, including $28 billion on one day in April 2013. Labor's current scare campaign on $100,000 degrees is plain wrong. The University of Western Australia has set fees for 2016 which are less than half of what Labor is claiming. No student will need to pay up-front, nor will they be prevented from attending universities for financial reasons. What we do know about the proposed reforms under the government's higher education legislation is that there will be a range of fees charged. To say there will be $100,000 degrees is simply wrong. We are increasing funding to universities, as was confirmed in the Senate inquiry last week.


The story in the Health portfolio is very similar. Again, Labor is spouting rubbery figures. I know that those opposite do not like to hear this, but the budget papers show that the Abbott government is increasing funding to hospitals by $5.3 billion, or 40 per cent, over the next four years. That is the reality; that is the fact. Labor's trickery is that it promised increases beyond the forward estimates which it knew it could never afford, but Labor did not have to worry about that because the promises do not appear in the budget papers. What is in the budget papers, what is projected over the forward estimates and what the government proposes to spend over a given period of time is what we can argue about, because it is the reality; it is not dream time. This is known as Labor's budget time bomb.


The MPI goes to cuts to pensions. For the record, there are no cuts to pensions under this government. Pensions will continue to increase twice a year and the family home will continue to be exempt from the pension's asset test. Older Australians now have lower bills following the abolition of the carbon tax but still get to keep their energy supplement. The income thresholds for the Commonwealth seniors health card were indexed from 20 September 2014, enabling up to 27,000 additional people to qualify for the card. I could go on in relation to this government's arguments around no cuts to pensions, no cuts to health and no cuts to education.


If Labor's claims are about $100,000 degrees are the most dishonest, then Labor's claims about the government's alleged secret plans to raise the GST are the silliest. We said that we would not be making any changes to the GST, and we are not. Again, just because you say that it is so does not make it so. The Australian people are interested in fact, not fiction, as demonstrated by their absolute support of the coalition's agenda at the last election.


We have key achievements. When we look at the promises that we took to the federal election, by any measure, the Abbott government is delivering on its promises. (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-10-28,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:29):  This motion goes to the issue of broken promises, but what it really goes to the issue of trust and integrity. What we seen from this government is an enormous breach of trust. It is an enormous breach of trust because the changes to these commitments that were made during the election campaign and that are now no longer relevant are so significant, so severe and so blatant that there is no hiding from it. Sometimes in politics we find these areas of grey. We see one side saying one thing, another side saying another and the truth is somewhere in the middle. But on this issue there is simply no excuse for what has occurred. There have been a string of broken promises and there has been a breach of trust.


This is a government that campaigned on the issue of trust and was relentless in its prosecution of the lies told about the carbon tax—to use their words. This is a government that promised in opposition that it would be open, honest and accountable and—to use the Prime Minister's words—that they would do what they say and say what they do. How is it that they could effectively reverse position on so many issues of fundamental importance to the Australian community? The answer is straightforward. The changes announced by this government in this budget are so unpopular, they are so brutal and they are so necessary that, had they promised these things in the election campaign, people would never of bought it. The government would not have been voted into office. They simply did not have the courage to put this narrow, brutal and ideological world view to the Australian community. They did not have the courage to do it.


They did not have the courage in education to stand up and say, 'We are going to make it harder for a young kid to get a university education.' They did not have the courage to say, 'If you are unemployed, we are going to kick you off welfare for six months. If you cannot cope, well, that's tough.' They did not have the courage in health care to say to people, 'You know what, we're going to make it harder for you to see a doctor. You might be struggling, but we are going to put a whopping great co-payment for when you go and see the GP; but we are going to add another co-payment on top of the existing co-payment for your medicines. We are going to make it harder for you to go and get a x-ray done because there will be costs associated with that as well.' They did not have the courage to put those issues to the Australian community.


They are based on a lie. In health care, we are told that the health system is unsustainable, that it is out of control and that we have got some sort of emergency or crisis. Let me tell you what a crisis looks like: over the last decade, Commonwealth spending on health care has been stable. It has not changed. If anything, it has decreased. We saw the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report announced a month or two ago for the year 2012-13. There was the lowest growth since 1990 and 1991. I will say that again: we have seen the lowest growth in health spending for over two decades. When it comes to the amount we spent on health care, we are somewhere near the bottom of other OECD countries and half what the US spends on health care. That is what a crisis looks like and that is what unsustainable health spending looks like this government.


It is totally confected and their solution is: 'We are going to whack in a great big co-payment, making it harder for people to see a doctor and particularly for those people who can afford it least.' But just as importantly, there are massive cuts to the way our hospital systems are funded. Over the next decade, we are going to see $50 billion taken out of our hospital system. Anyone who thinks that somehow that is a way of improving the health of the Australian community needs their head read. We have got a situation now where people already struggling through the public hospital system to be seen in a timely way in emergency departments. We have got long waiting lists for elective surgery and we have got people who are unable to get access to life-saving treatment. This government's response is to rip out $50 billion from the Australian hospital system.


When you combine the cuts to education, New South Wales stands to lose $25 billion over the next 10 years when you include those cuts to hospitals and education. In Victoria, over the next three years and this is when we take out that huge figure, we are looking at almost $400 million. This is a great breach of trust to the Australian community and the government did not have the courage to put it to the Australian people. (Time expired)

Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania) (16:34):  I too rise to contribute to the matter of public importance on the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to the pension, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. As we know, Mr Abbott went to the election promising all these things and telling the Australian people that he would not change the pension, there would be no change the GST, there would be no cuts to education and there would be no cuts to health. He told them these things because he wanted to get elected. He wanted the Australian people to trust him.


It did not take long for the trust that the Australian people put in Mr Abbott to be shown to unfortunately be misplaced. What we have seen from this government is a systematic targeting of those that can least afford to be targeted and those with the least amount of money. What we have seen is a substantial cut to pensions. In my home state of Tasmania, where we have around about 98,000 pensioners, they will be worse off and they know they will. The letter that Mr Abbott spent over $1 million on was to tell people that his election commitment was not based on a lie, but they know the truth and they know that they will be worse off. They have seen the work and they have seen some of the modelling produced by ACOSS. They know that they will be worse off. They know the Prime Minister has broken this commitment to them, and they will not forget it. 


Mr Abbott, it appears, will unfortunately say anything to get into government. He has a list of lies and broken promises—and the list of lies unfortunately gets longer by the day. The massive cuts that he wants to inflict on Australians target pensioners, families, students, the poor and the sick. They give little hope for the future and take away so much from Australians.


Labor will continue to fight against these cuts and continue to speak up for those whose voices are not heard by this government. The effects of Mr Abbott's twisted priorities are worrying. They are frightening Australians, particularly, as I have mentioned, in my home state of Tasmania. The cuts to education will be extremely harsh for Tasmania. A good education can lift people out of poverty and give them hope and optimism for the future. We need to lift our students' performance. If Tasmanian students are to achieve in line with national standards Mr Abbott needs to keep his promises.


His first budget failed to fund the vital fifth and sixth years of the Gonski reforms and instead ripped $80 billion from our schools and hospitals. Tasmanian schools will lose $682 million—the biggest ever cut to our schools. But where are the Tasmanian Liberal senators, and where are the federal Liberal members in the House of Representatives when it comes to these cuts? They remain silent.


Every Tasmanian school will suffer. Their funding will be cut although parents, teachers and students were promised improvements by Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne. These are savage cuts. They will leave the average school $3.2 million worse off and rob every student of $1,000 in individual support per year. The quality of education for Tasmanians will suffer. Parents, teachers and students have been betrayed. How can we expect Tasmanian students to improve their results when Mr Abbott is cutting funding for the resources and staff they need to help them? These cuts are the equivalent of sacking one in seven teachers, and they are already having a great impact in our classrooms.


Now I come to the cuts to health. We know that Tasmania has a higher burden of chronic disease. Mr Abbott's $1.1 billion in cuts to public hospitals in Tasmania will seriously affect health outcomes for Tasmania. I am running out of time, but Tasmanians know that Mr Abbott came to this election— (Time expired)

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (16:40):  I feel the need to defend my Tasmanian colleagues in the face of that outburst, which suggested that Tasmanian senators and members of the lower house have not been out there talking up the important aspects of the federal budget and the federal policy positions that are now being implemented, which were promised at the federal election in 2013. I have heard, many times in this place, senators from Tasmania and the three members who represent Tasmanian electorates in the lower house out there talking up the importance of Tasmania. They support their home state. I would just like to put it on the record that unless Senator Brown has a hearing problem she should listen a little harder to her colleagues from Tasmania, even if they are from the other side of the chamber, when they support their home state.


Before I go to the substance of what I would like to say today in relation to the matter of public importance on the Prime Minister's election commitments, I would like to draw the attention of the house to the extraordinary scaremongering that continues to go on. The ABC has a fact check; maybe we need a fact check in this place, because some of the things that were said while I sat here and listened to the contribution of those opposite astounded me. They are actually incorrect. It is not just that they have not heard; they actually made statements that were factually incorrect. 


Those statements, and the scaremongering that is going on, is creating a very negative and uncertain environment out there amongst voters. That is really not fair. If there are hard messages to sell, let's be honest about them and tell the voters the truth; do not beat it up with a whole heap of scaremongering. 


I would like to draw an interesting comparison between the federal coalition government and a current Labor government that is in existence in this country—the state Labor government in South Australia. Labor has been in power in South Australia for the last 12 years. In that time we have seen South Australia become somewhat of a laughing stock for the rest of the country because the environment in that state does not encourage business. It does not support business growth. It is the highest taxed state and it is the state with the highest debt. 


It is really quite interesting to draw a parallel between the state government and what is happening federally—the positive things we are trying to put in place, despite the resistance and blocking that we see in the Senate. We have been trying to get some of the initiatives that we took to the election campaign through this place, but we are blocked, despite the people of Australia having voted for this government on exactly those mandates. 


I draw to the house's attention the fact that the South Australian Labor government is a classic example of what happens when you do extraordinary things with budgets. That is exactly what we inherited when we came into government in 2013. Currently in South Australia the 2012-13 budget deficit is $940 million. That is the highest on record. When you consider the population in South Australia, on a pro rata basis it is an extraordinary amount of money that is owed by every man, woman and child in South Australia to pay for the budget deficit in that state.


The government of South Australia has delivered budget deficits for the past four years. Over the past year, the projected deficit has blown out to $1.2 billion—the largest budget deficit in over 15 years. But the really annoying, dishonest and unscrupulous thing that is going on at the moment is that the Weatherill Labor government in South Australia is trying to con the South Australian public into thinking that this is all the federal government's fault. I just have to put on the record that the $14 billion debt bill that was projected by the Weatherill government out to 2016 was on the books well before we were elected to government in 2013. So it seems a little bit rich that we have a situation at the moment where the Weatherill government is spending millions of dollars of South Australia's taxpayers' money—it is actually not South Australian taxpayers' money because they probably had to borrow it, like they borrow everything else to spend in South Australia—to fund a campaign to blame the federal government for something that, if you look at their budget figures, they acknowledged was already in existence well before the Abbott government was elected to this place.


Worse than the budget deficit in South Australia are the election promises that the South Australian government made to the South Australian public about the creation of 100,000 jobs. In the time that they have been in government and with the creation of their 100,000 jobs policy, we have seen 8,700 more jobs, not 100,000. We need to be very careful that we get the facts on the table. As those opposite have mentioned in relation to particularly education and health, Mr Weatherill is trying to make the suggestion that the federal government are cutting health and education. As we well know—and as you would well know, Madame Acting Deputy President Lines, as you sat on the education hearings in relation to higher education and you sit on the Education and Employment Legislation Committee—education funding has not been cut. I repeat: education funding has not been cut. So, for Mr Weatherill to somehow blame the federal government for cuts in funding that are going to South Australia—when in fact the amount of money that is going to South Australia, not just for education but also for health, is increasing—makes his lie and deceit even worse.


The fact is that the South Australian government have created their own debt and deficit problem. The blame lies firmly with their policies and the implementation of their policies. It seems extraordinarily rich that Mr Weatherill would suggest to blame us and then spend additional money in creating a false campaign. You do not have to entirely take my word for this—




Senator Payne:
  I would take your word for it.




Senator RUSTON:
  Thank you, Senator Payne. She was going to take my word for it. This morning in the paper a letter was revealed from the Essential Services Commission in South Australia, ESCOSA, which is the independent economic regulator in South Australia. The chief executive of this regulator, Dr Paul Kerin, who had been appointed by the previous Labor government to this position, resigned the week following the South Australian election. In his letter, Mr Kerin states:


I have voted Labor most of my life and I chose to join the Commission under a Labor government …


However, having seen that government from the inside, I have no appetite to deal with it for another four years.


In relation to the reforms and his oversight of particular agencies in South Australia—undergoing the water industry's economic reform, the commission's role in driving that reform, the independence of government, government legislation et cetera—Mr Kerin went on to say:


My experience over the past three years has shown that the understanding in relation to those economic activities was incorrect. Instead, the government and its senior bureaucrats have clearly demonstrated that they have no interest in genuine reform, nor in serving the long-term interests of consumers. Indeed, they have stymied all efforts on those fronts at every turn.


Further, he said he had been 'appalled by the behaviours that both ministers and senior bureaucrats had engaged in to stymie' those reform efforts.


You would have to suggest that, if you were going to appoint somebody to be an economic regulator and you are completely convinced of the goodness and wellbeing that you are providing to your state and the economic development you are providing to your state by your policies, you would certainly think that you would give your economic regulator every opportunity to be able to better those policies, keep an eye on them and make sure that they really were delivering the things that you were saying. The comments made by Dr Kerin were revealed only after a freedom of information request, because the bureaucrats within the department refused to release the letter of resignation from Dr Kerin, citing that it was contrary to the public interest. I thought that was quite an interesting reason for not releasing the fact that somebody was being critical of the operation of the government. You would think that the South Australian government would have wanted a level of transparency around its economic regulator because, surely, if everything they are saying about the economic prosperity and all the great things that they are doing in South Australia are true, they would want the independent verification of their independent regulator. That is a very sad indictment of one of Australia's Labor governments. The federal government may be an indication of what the Liberal Party in South Australia is likely to inherit if and when they should win government in South Australia.


In standing here today and talking on this matter of public interest, I would like to put on the record that I think it is abhorrent that we are conducting scaremongering without any real facts around the information that we are putting into the public domain. (Time expired)

Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (16:50):  I do not normally speak to MPIs because they can, as some senators have observed, be fairly predictable. I could not let this one go past. It is premised on the rather now famous quotation, and I thank our colleagues in the Labor Party for bringing it forward—the PM's election promise, right on the eve of the last federal election, and it could not have been clearer: 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.' It is a measure of the despair with which many people hold politicians, that you would get a comment as bold-faced and as black and white as that, and it is immediately doubled back on at the earliest opportunity. That is the nature of someone who lied his way into office. There is no way of being more polite about it than that. It is as though the Prime Minister exists in his own eternal political present, where words just come out of his mouth to suit a particular moment or a particular sound grab, and the next day it is as though it was never said and we are all meant to just forget that it ever happened. The GST was the last piece of that puzzle until fairly recently, and, of course, that has been put into the public domain as well. The catalogue of deliberate deceptions that the GST has set running is now complete.


Everything, as far as this government's budget repair proposals are concerned, is on the table except that which might offend powerful donors or interests. That has been very safely quarantined away as you have been marching around the landscape abolishing taxes for the last 12 months. Some economic interests—many of them very used to exercising their political clout—are coming in a hard-line and strategic way after our national broadcasters, the ABC and the SBS. It is that element of this trashed promise to the Australian public before the election that I want to focus on.


Cuts of somewhere between $120 million and $200 million to our national broadcaster, the ABC, are described by the minister as a 'down payment'. It is quite creepy behaviour when you think about it—'That's a nice national broadcaster you've got there; it would be a shame if anything were to happen to it.' There are threats to editorial independence, threats to funding and now direct threats to programming. Maybe the ABC will be forced to take advertising. Maybe it will be forced to curtail its online presence. You can see why some of the ideologues who are coming after the ABC and SBS are so terrified of how well our national broadcasters are performing online. They are doing some of the most innovative stuff, I would say, not just in the country but in the world in taking a publicly funded national broadcaster and putting that presence online in a way that enlarges its audience to a new generation of people who are not necessarily watching mainstream free-to-air TV or, for that matter, reading newspapers.


I have come to realise that the ABC and SBS are not being attacked because they are failing; they are being attacked because they are succeeding a little too well. That is something that is really worth considering. These broadcasters are loved. They are national institutions that are loved by people right across the political spectrum and right across this continent—from downtown in the big cities all the way out to the most remote and regional areas where you can get an ABC radio broadcast. That is one of the elements of why this government is in such trouble. The government was asked about the prospect of whether this could lead to job losses and, at this stage, we are looking at 500 or 600 job cuts. It may be less than that or it may be more. We do not know the scale of the cuts that are proposed. Mr Turnbull has said, 'It would depend on which staff are cut. The ABC is not a workers' collective.' What contempt! As though anybody proposed that it was a workers' collective; it is a much loved national broadcaster. That is why we have already seen the beginning of the damage being done: 80 staff have been let go from ABC International, the Australian Network has been trashed, the payments from DFAT to wind up its operations fell short by $5 million and the broadcaster is facing serious and significant cuts. That is why we will fight it.


As we put the government on notice, do not be surprised if the tiny handful of ideologues who loathe the very existence of public broadcasters come to heel when they need it. Do not be too surprised if that tiny handful of people are completely overmatched by the breadth and depth of passion with which Australian people from right across the country and right across the political spectrum will stand up and fight for their national broadcasters, both the ABC and the SBS. You are put on notice now. The Prime Minister may have forgotten that commitment that he made to the rest of the country right before the election, but we have not.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:55):  I wish to speak on this matter of public importance regarding the Prime Minister's pre-election promise on 6 September last year, one day before the election, that there would be:


No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


I listened to the contribution from Senator McKenzie earlier in the debate, and I sensed the exasperation in her contribution about this issue being continuously raised by Labor. All I can say to Senator McKenzie and her colleagues is that they had better get used to this because this is accountability. This government needs to be held accountable for the litany of broken promises and its twisted priorities.


With the Prime Minister's comments yesterday regarding the GST, surely we are now seeing the full set of broken promises completed. This government will soon be running out of promises to break, having systematically smashed every commitment it gave to the electorate. Proper reform means bringing the community with you, challenging vested interests and making a case for changing the status quo; proper reform means not doing a dump and run with this budget of broken promises; and proper reform means not just bumping up the nearest regressive tax that you can get your hands on.


We have heard today from both Senator Ruston and Senator McKenzie that what the Labor Party is saying in this regard is somewhat factually lacking—that is how I would categorise what they said—but let us look at what this government is saying about taxation. That we have a government now looking earnestly at a regressive tax which affects the poor is a great concern to us. One of the great mythologies that exists out there is that Labor is always responsible for a higher level of taxation than the coalition. When we look at the ABC Fact Check, we find that, under the Labor period of government from 2007 to 2013, the average proportion of taxation as a proportion of GDP was 21.4 per cent, whereas in the previous Howard government there was a tax take of 23.5 per cent as a proportion of GDP. So, when we are talking about mythology, let us get our facts right and let us look at who is really responsible for higher taxes in this country.


To return to the broken promises, I quote again: 'There will be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, no changes to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.' All of these promises were made in one sentence that Mr Abbott uttered in an interview on SBS on the eve of the 2013 election. It was during a live interview when the then opposition leader was at one of the sports stadiums.


We know that his promises have been completely smashed. On education, what has essentially happened is that they have scrapped the fifth and sixth year of funding that was previously part of the bipartisan Gonski reforms. In the area of health, $50 billion has been cut from public hospitals, and in the area of pensions, the pension age has been raised to 70, with indexation slashed and concessions cut. In respect of the GST, comments were made yesterday about wanting to broaden and raise the tax. On the issue of no cuts to the ABC, we have seen that there will be $35 million in cuts over four years. And in respect of SBS, the carrier that broadcast the opposition leader's promises, there will be $8 million in cuts over four years. These cuts will hit Queensland hard. In Australia's most decentralised state, those regions of Queensland outside the capital will be hit especially hard.


Recently we have also seen government senators justifying cuts to rural and regional health care on the basis that what they said before the election were merely National Party commitments and not coalition commitments. I asked Senator Nash, in her capacity of representing the Minister for Health, on 3 September about the fact that the Nationals election platform talked about increased financial support for doctors in regional and remote areas but that what actually came out in the budget was that the rebate for most GP and out-of-hospital pathology and diagnostic imaging services were to be reduced by $5. Senator Nash's response to that question was that if those opposite paid a little more attention they would realise that it is National Party policy and that they would go on to form coalition policy for the election campaign, and that immediately addresses the issue. That was the response from the National Party, the party that is supposed to be standing up for regional Australia and regional Queensland. They are nowhere to be found.


On top of these broken promises we have plans for $100,000 degrees as a further kick in the guts for regional Queenslanders. The Queensland Times, a newspaper based in Ipswich, reported:


Universities in regional Queensland and New South Wales fear the Abbott Government's education reforms could hit hard, with the poor discouraged by new charges and the bright poached by whatever school has the most money.


Local councils have also been asked to get by on less grant money from the federal government, and do not even get me started on what Queenslanders think about this out-of-touch Treasurer's view that poor people do not drive cars. Despite the Senate comprehensively rejecting a new fuel tax, they have snuck it in the back door: an increased tax for Queenslanders every time they fill up at the bowser, thanks to this government.


Australia remains gobsmacked at the conduct and deceitfulness of this government and their astonishing record to date. (Time expired)

"McGrath, Sen James",LP,2014-10-28,"



Senator McGRATH
 (Queensland) (17:03):  This MPI is not a story of cuts; it is a story of Labor's record on debt, tax and deficits. It is a horrible history of Labor mismanagement and horrid economic planning. So, mums and dads watching at home, send your children out of the room now, because you are about to hear some figures and I do not want you swearing in front of your children, and neither do I want your children realising the full extent of the debt they are going to inherit from Labor and what that means in terms of the work they are going to have to do to pay off Labor's debt. I do not want the toddlers and teenagers of Australia having nightmares because of Labor's debt and all the work they are going to have to do.


So, let us have a discussion about the figures—the truth about the inheritance Labor gave to us in September last year, when they were finally booted out of office. Labor initially forecast a surplus of $5.4 billion for the 2013-14 financial year and kept this forecast surplus for eight successive budget updates. The final figure was $48.5 billion in deficit. From 2008-09 to 2013-14, Labor delivered six successive deficits, totalling $240 billion, and we have many more to come, because of their mismanagement. If we include 2013-14, Labor left the government with future deficits of $123 billion up to the forward estimates for 30 June 2017. If no policy action was taken by Tony Abbott and the coalition to repair the budget position that the government inherited from Labor—and the Greens; I will give them a mention here too—gross debt would have spiralled to $667 billion over the medium term and would have continued to grow. That is the equivalent of $25,000 for every Australian.


This is Labor's legacy of debt for all Australians. But Labor do not want to talk about this. They do not want to talk about their six years in power. It is almost like the forgotten history of Australia in terms of the textbooks that Labor want to write. It costs $1 billion a month to pay the interest on Labor's record debt. This will be $2.8 billion a month in 10 years if nothing changes.


The independent budget office stated that 'without action Australia's debt will grow at one of the fastest rates in the developed world'. We have to make savings. If we do not make savings, this country will be in real trouble. So we want to make savings that should see us save money that could construct 15 new teaching hospitals every year—savings of $16 billion over 10 years. That is more than the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and higher education spending.



On the eve of the 2013-14 federal election, then Treasurer Chris Bowen had to go even further in his 2013 economic statement by writing down receipts a further $7.8 billion for 2013-14 and over $33 billion across the then forward estimates. This government—Tony Abbott's government, Joe Hockey's government, Julie Bishop's government, Warren Truss's government—inherited a shambles of a budget, a weakening economy and rising unemployment. This government had to take immediate action to address a number of unresolved issues inherited from Labor. This includes injecting $8.8 billion to restore the Reserve Bank of Australia's capital buffer after Labor ripped out $5.2 billion in dividends; providing $571 million in 2013-14 and $2 billion over the forward estimates to fix Labor's funding shortfall for offshore processing of illegal maritime arrivals; funding Public Service agencies to meet the cost of Labor's unfunded redundancies arising from their hidden job cuts; and clearing 96 announced but unlegislated tax and superannuation measures that included measures announced to boost the budget bottom line, even though these measures could never be delivered or would damage the economy. Labor left Australia with no plan to fund the future and address their unsustainable spending trajectory over the medium term.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2014-10-28,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:08):  On the eve of the 2013 federal election, Tony Abbott, the now Prime Minister, made six solemn promises to the Australian people. He said on SBS in an interview in September 2013 that there would be, and I quote:


No cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS.


And we have heard this repetitively during this debate.


After the election, we have seen a very different story emerge as the Abbott government has systematically set out to break each and every one of these commitments. The ABC and SBS have had their budgets cut. The government is planning a devastating $80 billion worth of cuts to health and education. They are trying to slash pensions by $80 a week over the next 10 years and make all Australians work until they are 70 before they can qualify for the pension. And now the Abbott government is heading for a 100 per cent perfectly shameful record of broken promises, as they turn their sights to breaking their pre-election promise not to change or increase the GST.


Currently, the GST is distributed on a needs basis. It takes into account each state's ability to raise revenue and balances it with each state's funding needs to determine the fairest way to distribute the funds. A fundamental principle of the GST is that all states must have the revenue they need to provide their citizens with basic services like health, education, transport and security. No state should be left behind, and states that are benefiting from times of greater prosperity should contribute a bit more to help the states that are doing it a bit tougher. If the GST were changed, it would be devastating for Tasmania. Seven hundred million dollars in revenue and the vital public services that this money supports would be in peril. But it is not just Tasmania that could lose out if the rate base or distribution formula for the GST is changed. Let us not forget that it was not so long ago that Western Australia was a net beneficiary of the GST. And there is nothing to guarantee that that situation will not turn again.


Before the election, Labor was very concerned that the Abbott government had its sights set on changing the GST. This was a reasonable concern, given the Western Australian Liberal Premier Colin Barnett let the cat out of the bag about Mr Abbott's talks with the Liberal premiers on plans to change the GST once he got into government. But, remarkably, as the 2013 election drew closer, the story from those opposite changed dramatically. With his eyes keenly on the prime ministerial prize, Mr Abbott set about hiding his plans, saying:


Let me be as categoric as I can, the GST won't change, full stop, end of story …


…      …   …


Let me repeat it—the GST won't change, full stop, end of story.


On 11 May last year, he reinforced the message to Launceston's The Examiner newspaper, saying:


The Coalition fully supports the existing GST arrangements. We will not change them.


But now the Prime Minister must be getting giddy, because the past week has seen him perform another dramatic backflip. And this one shows that Labor's pre-election concerns about his plans for the GST were entirely justified. Gone are Mr Abbott's sincere promises about not meddling with the GST. Now, the Prime Minister is saying that the GST is certainly:


… something which ought to be looked at as part of the federation reform process and as part of the tax reform process.


He also talked of the need to look at spending responsibilities and revenue capacities while, at the same time, saying:


It should be possible to make these arrangements more equitable between the larger states with the smaller states no worse off.


This idea that more money can go to one state without disadvantaging any other states or increasing the amount of GST that is taken up is little more than 'magic pudding' economics. It does not add up.


Make no mistake: the threat to Tasmanian public services of Tony Abbott and the Liberals making changes to the GST is very real. Now, more than ever, we need a strong response from the Tasmanian Liberals in this place. In Launceston's The Examiner this week, the Liberal member for Bass and the Liberal member for Lyons both voiced their support for the current system. But the member for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley, failed to provide a comment. The most fundamental duty of a member of parliament is to fight for the interests of the people that elected them. At a time when north-west Tasmanians need a strong representative in Canberra to fight these regressive GST changes, Mr Whiteley has gone missing in action. It is time that he came out of hiding and fought against a move that could strip the Tasmanian economy of $700 million a year.


Interestingly, in a speech on 24 March this year, Mr Whiteley was quite willing to talk about the GST when he accused the Palmer United Party of:


… announcing a policy to rip hundreds of millions of dollars of GST payments out of the Tasmanian economy in a desperate attempt to win a seat at the upcoming Senate election in Western Australia.


He went further, saying that Senator Lambie is:


… faced with the challenge of standing up for the people of Tasmania or backing her party leader in ripping hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Tasmanian economy.


It is now time for Mr Whiteley to step up and back his electorate against his party leader's plans that could rip hundreds of millions of dollars out of the Tasmanian economy. For Tasmania's sake, Mr Whiteley needs to demand that the Prime Minister keeps his pre-election promise not to make any changes to the GST.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Special Minister of State) (17:46):  I table a ministerial statement on the research into the effects of military service on veterans and their families. At the same time, three research reports—the Vietnam veterans families study, the peacekeeper health study and the Rwandan deployment health study—will be released. I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


At the last election, the government announced a comprehensive policy agenda to meet the needs of veterans and their families. We announced our four-pillar approach to veterans’ affairs:


Recognising the unique nature of military service;


Retaining a stand-alone Department of Veterans’ Affairs;


Tackling the mental health challenges for veterans and their families; and


Supporting veterans through adequate advocacy and welfare services.


To meet these commitments, the government has:


Delivered its election commitment to change the indexation of Defence Forces Retirement Benefit (DFRB) and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefit (DFRDB) military superannuation pensions, for superannuants aged 55 and over from 1 July 2014;


Restored $1 million in advocacy and welfare support funding under the Building Excellence in Support and Training (BEST) program, funding which was slashed by the former Labor government;


Expanded access to counselling services through the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service;


Ensured that more veterans and ex-service people can get treatment for certain mental health conditions without the need to lodge a claim for compensation through DVA, or to prove that the condition is service related—and I acknowledge that was a process commended under the former government;


Cut red-tape for veterans lodging claims through the acceptance of Defence ID when making a claim for compensation;


Reduced the time taken to process compensation claims across all three compensation acts, and acknowledge that more work must be done to get these down even further.


Since becoming the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, and in the three years prior as the shadow minister, I made it clear that I was not prepared to see the mistakes of the past repeated when it came to the nation’s treatment of its veterans, ex-service personnel and their families. The treatment of Vietnam veterans on their return remains a dark stain on this nation’s history. It is something that must never be repeated. This philosophy underpins everything the government seeks to achieve.


Proper and robust research will help us to plan for the future. The research studies released today give us an enhanced understanding of the long-term effects of military service from a range of wartime and peacekeeping missions on the health of veterans and their families, and their access to health services. These three studies represent a significant investment in the future health and wellbeing of veterans, peacekeepers and their families, with the government providing funding of around $12.25 million to support their completion.


Prior to the election, the government committed itself to release of the Vietnam Veterans Family Study at the earliest opportunity. We also promised extensive consultation. Today, this report to government is released.


The Vietnam Veterans’ Family Study, with over 27,000 participants, is one of the most significant government-funded research projects commissioned about veterans and their families. I would like to first and foremost thank those veterans and their families who participated in the study, and acknowledge the hard work of the various researchers involved, including the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the Australian Institute of Family Studies and Colmar Brunton Social Research.  


I particularly acknowledge the Consultative Forum for the Study, made up of veterans, partners and children, which also made a significant investment of their time and expertise, for which I am very grateful. My thanks go to Professor Bryan Rodgers, Chair of the study’s scientific advisory committee, and its members who ensured the rigour and validity of this large study.


The study compared the physical, mental and social wellbeing of two groups of Australian veterans: 10,000 randomly selected Army Vietnam veterans and their families, with 10,000 randomly selected Defence personnel who served in the Army during the Vietnam War era but did not deploy to Vietnam, along with their families. 


The research findings indicate that although the majority of sons and daughters of Vietnam veterans are leading healthy and productive lives, the family members of deployed Vietnam veterans were more likely to have emotional, physical and social problems than other comparable military families. 



The peacekeeper's health study focuses on seven peacekeeping missions from 1989 to 2002: Namibia, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Rwanda, Somalia and the two East Timor deployments. More than 14,000 Australian personnel were deployed as part of these operations. The vast majority participated in the East Timor operations, with over 10,000 personnel deployed between 1999 and 2002. A random sample of over 2,000 peacekeepers were invited to participate, with more than 1,000 contributing.


The final study released today is the Rwanda Deployment Health Study. This study, conducted by the then Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health, investigated the health outcomes of the 680 veterans from Operation TAMAR in Rwanda.


The studies released today have relied on the firsthand, quantitative evidence provided by veterans and their families. Their contributions, frank answers to questions and willingness to participate have provided the evidence for the findings contained.


The government’s investment in research does not end with the release of these studies. In July this year, I launched the Transition and Wellbeing Research Program, the most comprehensive research program of its type undertaken in Australia. This $5 million research project, jointly funded by DVA and Defence, will examine the impact of military service on the mental, physical and social health of serving and ex-serving personnel who have deployed to contemporary conflicts.



For the first time, this will include a picture of the mental and physical health of service personnel after discharge and how mental health symptoms change over time. It will also investigate how individuals previously diagnosed with a mental health condition access care, as well as examining the experiences and needs of families of serving and ex-serving members. This is an important and tangible way to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.




Families



Of the three studies being launched today, the Vietnam Veterans Family Study focuses on the intergenerational effects of war service—specifically Vietnam War service. This government places great store on the capacity and importance of families, as shown by our pre-election policy commitment to ‘veterans and their families’. We know that families play a central role in shaping the health and wellbeing of its members. The study confirms the importance of families and the need to connect them to support and programs. The study also shows that for this group of Vietnam veterans, there are some intergenerational effects for some children. 


There are now a wide range of family supports available for all Australians, including resources for building better relationships through to dispute resolution. There are specific supports available for families with children who are at risk of separation, or who have separated. These mainstream supports are also complemented by veterans support for families, particularly through the VVCS. Family members can be affected by a loved one’s military service and are fundamental to the veteran’s successful transition following deployments and separation from military service. It is extremely important to acknowledge that sons and daughters of Vietnam veterans of any age are eligible to access, and be supported by, the VVCS services. 




Mental health



A major theme in common across the three studies is mental health, and how veterans and families are dealing with the mental health effects of war and peacekeeping. The Australian Defence Force has invested significant resources on mental health, with a focus on building the resilience and achieving capability through mental fitness. For instance, ADF personnel now receive psycho-educational training about the risks they will face before deployment and a range of post-deployment screenings to assess their coping and to determine whether they would benefit from additional support. In 2012-13, the government spent almost $179 million on meeting the mental health needs of the veteran and ex-service community. Funding for veteran mental health treatment is demand driven and it is not capped.


The key to good mental health is to take action early. The government has therefore invested considerably in providing veterans with more streamlined access to mental health treatment. The government can pay for treatment for diagnosed PTSD, depression, anxiety, and alcohol and substance use disorders—whatever the cause. The condition does not have to be related to service. These arrangements are available to anyone who has deployed on operations overseas, and many who have served for more than three years at home. For instance, any of those who served in the Vietnam War or in peacekeeping operations are eligible for these arrangements. (Time expired)

Senator WRIGHT
 (South Australia) (17:57):  On behalf of the Australian Greens, I would like to speak to the reports that have been tabled by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and reiterate the importance of having good research into the effects of service on Australia's military personnel, including peacekeepers, and also into the effects of that service on their families and dependents. My experience in meeting both veterans and their partners and children has confirmed for me what the research has indicated and what was referred to by Senator Ronaldson—that is, that there is substantial evidence to suggest that for those who serve on our behalf war has not only many physical costs but also costs from the dislocation of their lives and the necessity for them to reintegrate into the civilian workforce when they demobilise from their service. There are also the ongoing effects, sometimes psychological and in relation to stress. Those costs transfer to those who support them. The role of partners and families is absolutely crucial. It is incumbent upon us as a community that, when we ask people to serve on our behalf and put themselves in the frontline, at risk of physical and psychological injury, we support those who support them.


I will look forward to reading the reports that have been tabled today. We need to see important, reliable research translated into sensible and reliable policy that acknowledges the contribution that our veterans and their families make on our behalf. That is the big, really important question.


I think that Australian society needs to be particularly grateful for not only the families, partners and children of veterans but also some of the organisations that work tirelessly to try to highlight the importance of having good research and good policy, including the Partners of Veterans Association of Australia and also their state counterparts and many small and large organisations that work for the welfare of partners and veterans throughout Australia. A matter that I have raised with the minister is that some of the partners associations, or many of them, do not actually have any real funding to keep them going, and I think it is important that we ensure that they can carry out that important advocacy and caring role, particularly in terms of reaching out to partners and families in rural and more isolated areas of Australia who often do not have the support networks that people in urban areas have. It can be very expensive to try to get out there to meet them. I know from the partners that I have spoken to how absolutely valuable that contact can be in keeping people going in their important work, in holding families together and in supporting their veterans.


I look forward, on behalf of the Australian Greens, to having a closer look at those reports.

MIGRATION AMENDMENT (CHARACTER AND GENERAL VISA CANCELLATION) BILL 2014


The purpose of this Bill is to strengthen the character and general visa cancellation provisions in the Migration Act to ensure that non-citizens who commit crimes in Australia, pose a risk to the Australian community or represent an integrity concern are appropriately considered for visa refusal or cancellation. The Bill also introduces a mandatory cancellation power for non-citizens who objectively do not pass the character test and are in prison. 


The current legislative framework for the character and general visa cancellation provisions has been in place for some time. The general visa cancellation framework has been in place, without significant change, since the Migration Reform Act came into effect in 1994. Similarly, the character framework has been in place since 1999 without significant change.


Since that time, the environment in relation to the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens has changed dramatically, with higher volumes of temporary visa holders in Australia and streamlined processes facilitating entry of temporary residents for economic and other purposes.


It is clear that facilitation of entry at the visa application stage needs to be complemented with strong visa cancellation grounds and processes at the post visa grant stage to ensure the integrity of the Migration Programme. This includes having appropriate responses available where non-citizens in Australia do not abide by the law, including by breaching visa conditions, or engaging in criminal activity or migration fraud.


Consistent with community views and expectations, the Australian Government has a low tolerance for criminal, non-compliant or fraudulent behaviour by non-citizens. Entry and stay in Australia by non-citizens is a privilege, not a right, and the Australian community expects that the Australian Government can and should refuse entry to non-citizens, or cancel their visas, if they do not abide by Australian laws. Those who choose to break the law, fail to uphold the standards of behaviour expected by the Australian community or try to intentionally mislead or defraud the Australian government should expect to have that privilege removed.


To meet this expectation the Government must not only have the ability to act decisively and effectively, wherever necessary, to deal with unlawful, fraudulent or criminal behaviour by non-citizens, but also have the legislative basis to effect a visa cancellation or refusal for those non-citizens. This Bill seeks to enhance the Government's ability to do so in three key ways: 


First, by amending section 501 of the Act to: 


broaden the existing grounds for not passing the character test; and 


allow the Minister to require the head of an agency of a State or Territory to disclose to the Minister personal information that is relevant to whether the person passes the character test, and the possible refusal or cancellation of their visa under section 501.


The amendments proposed in this Bill give the Government the necessary capabilities to identify non-citizens who are liable for visa cancellation under the character provisions, or refusal under the character provisions and deal with them appropriately. 


By introducing a power to obtain personal information which assists with the identification and consideration of non-citizens potentially liable for visa cancellation or refusal under section 501, the Government will be able to deliver greater surety in its commitment to protecting the Australian community from harm as a result of criminal activity or other serious conduct by non-citizens including those who pose an integrity risk to the Migration Programme.


Similarly, the broadened grounds for not passing the character test, the increased capability to deal with fraud and integrity issues, and the introduction of a lower threshold for cancellation of temporary visas will provide the Government with the necessary tools to ensure that such people are subject to visa cancellation or refusal consideration under the appropriate provision of the Act.


The proposed measures will amend the character test within section 501 of the Act to prescribe certain cohorts of non-citizens, such as those who have a charge proven for a sexual offence against a child, and persons involved in criminal conduct or activities such as people smuggling or war crimes, as not passing the character test. Additionally, amendments will be made to ensure that any non-citizen convicted of a crime or crimes, who receives a sentence totalling twelve months, regardless of how that total is reached, will fall within the definition of having a substantial criminal record and will not pass the character test. 


Changes will be made to extend the character test to include non-citizens who commit crimes, but do not receive a sentence on the basis of issues surrounding their mental health. This cohort of people is often responsible for very serious offences, but under the current provisions, ensuring they are prevented from posing a further risk to the Australian community is difficult. The measures proposed will rectify that problem. 


The second key measure is to amend the general visa cancellation provisions within the Act to:


enhance measures for dealing with non-citizens who present an integrity, identity or fraud risk;


introduce lower thresholds for cancelling temporary visas, reflective of the lower tolerance for behavioural concerns in the temporary visa context; and


introduce stronger personal Ministerial decision making powers in relation to the general visa cancellation provisions, consistent with those in the character provisions. 


Amendments proposed to section 116 of the Act will provide the necessary balance between the protection of the Australian community and the facilitation of entry for temporary visa holders. This cohort of non-citizens has until now been considered against thresholds similar to those applied in section 501, which are set at a high level to reflect the potential impact of removing a person's permanent visa. The amended provision will provide that non-citizens on temporary visas, who pose even a low level of risk, will be eligible for visa cancellation. Measures will also be introduced to better manage the cancellation of visas where the circumstances applicable to the grant of the visa never existed or no longer exist.


The Act will also be amended to provide that a visa may be cancelled where incorrect information was provided by or on behalf of a non-citizen either as part of a statutory process, or outside of such a process, and was relevant to the person making a valid application for a visa or a decision to grant a visa to the person. 


The Act will also be amended to provide the Minister with the power to cancel a visa if he or she is not satisfied as to the visa holder's identity.


The measures proposed will ensure that the Government can move quickly to take action against non-citizens who pose a risk to the Australian community by delivering consistency in personal Ministerial decision making powers across both the character and general visa cancellation powers. This will involve the introduction of personal Ministerial powers to set aside and substitute decisions of delegates and tribunals, and to cancel a visa personally on the grounds under section 109 or section 116 with or without natural justice where it is in the public interest to do so. The latter of these amendments ensures that where a real and immediate risk is posed by a non-citizen, the Government can act quickly and decisively to remove that person from the Australian community before that risk can be realised. As with the existing personal Ministerial decision making powers under the character provisions, such decisions would not be subject to merits review processes.


The third key measure this Bill seeks to introduce is mandatory visa cancellation under section 501 of the Act where a non-citizen is serving a full-time sentence of imprisonment in a custodial institution and they are found to objectively not pass the character test on the basis of, for example, having been convicted of an offence or offences and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 12 months or more, or having been convicted of, or found to have been guilty of, or had a charge proved against them for a sexually based offence involving a child. Under this process, a non-citizen will have their visa mandatorily cancelled without prior notice of an intention to cancel a visa, with a notification of the cancellation decision provided after the fact. Upon notification, the non-citizen will be provided with the opportunity to seek revocation of the cancellation decision. Where a decision is taken by a delegate to not revoke the decision, the former visa holder will have access to merits review. This will be a streamlined process which will deliver the key benefit of providing a greater opportunity to ensure non-citizens who pose a risk to the community will remain in either criminal or immigration detention until they are removed or their immigration status is otherwise resolved.


These amendments are designed to strengthen and build upon the existing character and general visa cancellation framework and are consistent with the original intent of the provisions; to provide the Government with sufficient capability to address character and integrity concerns. This Bill addresses the significant changes in the environment relating to the entry and stay of non-citizens in Australia since mid to late 1990s and reflects this Government's and the Australian community's low tolerance for criminal, non-compliant or fraudulent behaviour by those who are given the privilege of holding a visa to enter and stay in Australia. The Bill demonstrates this Government's clear commitment to ensuring that non-citizens do not pose a risk to the Australian community. I commend the Bill to the Chamber.


 


RURAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2014


Australia's rural industries are among the most innovative and productive in the world. The Australian Government is committed to ensuring their profitability and competitiveness, now and into the future.


The Australian Government supports rural industries in a variety of ways. To help primary producers increase their output and improve their profit margins, we support rural research and development. Much of this support is channelled through the 15 rural research and development corporations. In addition, to keep our rural industries engaged and influential on the world stage, the government is a member of international commodity organisations and regional fisheries management organisations.


This Bill implements a 2014 Budget measure to change the way that the government pays for its membership to these organisations. The Bill also reduces the red tape burden currently imposed on some of the rural research and development corporations.


Australia is a member of the international wine, grains, sugar and cotton commodity organisations. These organisations work to improve the trading environment for agricultural products. They fund research and development on global issues affecting these industries, and provide useful information and statistics for our producers, scientists and research and development organisations.


Australia's membership to these organisations provides benefits to our primary producers. For example, the International Cotton Advisory Council sponsors research on the cost of cotton production and production methods to inform the cotton research community and primary producers. It has direct links with our Cotton Research and Development Corporation as part of its Research Associate Program.


Other roles of the international commodity organisations include setting international standards to improve production and product marketing, improving food safety and security. Just as our rural research and development corporations foster partnerships at home, the international commodity organisations promote global partnerships. If we do not engage with these organisations, they could develop standards that are not appropriate for Australian conditions and practices.


Australia is a member of six regional fisheries management organisations. Our commercial fishing and aquaculture industry is worth over $2 billion annually and employs around twelve thousand people. These organisations manage migratory fish species to ensure the optimal use of fish stocks to the benefit of our fishing industries. Through our membership of these organisations, we ensure that regional management measures are compatible with domestic arrangements, and secure access for the Australian fishing industry.


Australian research and development operates within a global system, and must take into account international issues. The change to the legislation reflects this, and also acknowledges that the ultimate beneficiaries of the activities of these international organisations are farmers, fishing industries and rural communities.


The Bill amends three Acts to allow the government to recover the cost of the memberships from the Commonwealth funding provided to relevant rural research and development corporations. This will provide a funding mechanism for memberships to these organisations that is sustainable in a time of increasing budget pressures.


The amendments will result in a saving to government of about $7 million over the next four years. This saving will be redirected by the government to help repair the Budget.


The Bill also reduces red tape for some of the research and development corporations. For consistency across all rural research and development corporations, and to reduce regulatory burden, the Bill drops the requirements to table certain documents in the Parliament.


The funding contract and variations to the funding contract will no longer need to be tabled for Dairy Australia, Forest and Wood Products Australia, the Australian Livestock Export Corporation and Sugar Research Australia. In addition, Dairy Australia and the Australian Livestock Export Corporation will no longer table the annual report and other compliance reports. In the interests of good governance, the corporations will still produce these reports and make them available to the public or to members as required.


An annual co-ordination meeting for the chairs of the statutory research and development corporations will be dropped. Today, only five of the 15 research and development corporations remain as statutory bodies. There are more effective ways that the corporations can — and do — coordinate their activities, and the government decided that a legislated coordination meeting is no longer required.


Debate adjourned.


Ordered that the bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (22:00):  Tonight I rise to speak on a matter of extraordinary concern to many of my fellow citizens in South Australia, and that is the extraordinary increase in the emergency services levy that came out in the South Australian state budget. By way of background, in 1999 the South Australian Liberal government introduced a levy specifically to replace an insurance premium levy with a broader emergency services levy to cover the cost of looking after the issues of our emergency services. When they introduced the levy, they made a decision that they would exempt a large number of organisations from the full impact of that levy, recognising the contribution that they made.


In the 2014-15 budget, the government sought to remove the remission of this levy from a number of properties, except for the principal place of residence for pensioners and concession card holders. At the time they introduced this particular piece of legislation they forgot to realise that people who lived in retirement villages were not actually property owners and would be exposed to the removal of the remission of the emergency services levy. I am pleased to say that they have seen the error of their ways subsequently. It probably just goes to show how ill-informed this particular levy was. They subsequently tried to find blame for the change in the levy structure that was specifically for assisting emergency services personnel and operations in South Australia.


I thought it would be interesting to put on the record that, in 2010, the Henry tax review came out and said that a land tax on the family home as part of state taxation reform was a good idea. At the time, the then Treasurer, Kevin Foley, made this comment:




A broad-based land tax would be a punitive tax on families and households and won’t be supported by this government


… we have no intention of adopting any of the land tax 
recommendations in the report.





A broad-based land tax, be it on commercial or industrial, will be levying taxes on people who have not previously paid them and we don’t think that
’s the right way to go forward.



That is really quite interesting, given that the government that he is part of and is now in government has chosen to do exactly the opposite. You would be excused for being a little confused because the now Treasurer in South Australia, Tom Koutsantonis, on ABC morning radio the other day, when questioned about whether a tax on a $400,000 property would increase by 163 three per cent, said no, it would not increase by 163 per cent, but his very own Treasury figures, as are witnessed by his Treasury document, show that if you have a property with a capital value of $400,000 you will indeed have an increase in your emergency services levy by 163 per cent.


Probably the most concerning of the impacts that this proposed increase in the emergency services levy has had in South Australia was shown very recently when there were two grassfires on the west coast, at a place near Ceduna. The CFS volunteers for the first time in history that I can remember refused to attend those fires. They had a reason for refusing to attend those fires. Since they have to pay this extraordinary increase in their emergency services levy—and some of them are paying 400, 500, 800 or 1,500 times as much as they paid last year for their emergency services levy—they said, 'Why would we go and fight a bushfire if they are collecting that much money to assist us in our emergency services activities? Why wouldn't the government be able to afford to pay full tote odds for every person who turns up to a fire? They don't need to worry about volunteers anymore because the government is taking this much money.' Farmers and business people cannot afford to let their employees go to fight these fires on a voluntary basis and accept the responsibility of continuing to pay these employees if they have to pay the exorbitant emergency service levy costs. It is an absolute disgrace and the South Australian government should be condemned for what they have done.
