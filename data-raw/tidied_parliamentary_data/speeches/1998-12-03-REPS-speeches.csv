This motion and the following motions relate to the government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure entitled Ten years on: A review of the House of Representatives committee system .
The changes being made today to the standing orders are a continuation of the government's excellent record, which we have forged since coming to government, in relation to responding to suggested improvements 
 to House standing orders. This general approach of the government started when we were elected back in March 1996. At that time, we dusted off all the outstanding reports of the Procedure Committee, asked them to update those responses and provided substantial responses to the work of the Procedure Committee. It is an important committee. We acknowledge the work that it does.
Unlike our predecessors, we believe it is important that due time, attention and appropriate responses be provided to the Procedure Committee. When Labor was in government, the committee's reports used to gather dust on the shelves. Under this government, we have acted to improve procedures, and we appreciate the advice of that committee. For example, in the last couple of years we abolished the Keating ministerial roster system, which was infamous for preventing the accountability of ministers. We were able to make changes to the timing of question time so that the parliament question time could be televised, which is very important in order for people to have a better understanding of government and information about government. It improves the accountability of government.
We established a right of reply to allow persons aggrieved by adverse mentions in the House to make a submission in writing to the Speaker to seek a right of reply. We established a more streamlined procedure for the conduct of divisions, which now operates on a permanent basis. We introduced constituency statements and a half-hour adjournment in the Main Committee on Thursdays. As would be appreciated, during question time the Prime Minister requires ministers to answer questions. We have been running at 20 questions or thereabouts at question time. That is a marked improvement from the shambles that used to preside when question time was run by our predecessors in the Labor Party.
These changes have been made to enhance the standing of the parliament and to improve the opportunities for members, backbench members particularly, to raise issues of concern to their constituents in the parliament. This has been part of an ongoing process by the government to effect genuine improve 
 ments in the standards and running of the parliament.
The report that we have before us now contains a series of recommendations, many of which we adopt. In some cases we have not adopted them; they represent, however, the standard practice of government, and we will continue the practices that have evolved. It is acknowledged that many of the changes being proposed by the report are not of a radical nature, but I suppose that really indicates that we have addressed a lot of the difficult issues that we inherited back in March 1996 and that the parliamentary committee system has worked quite well. In fairness, it has worked quite well for the past 10 years and is a tribute to those who put forward changes at that time.
The government endorses much of the committee's report and supports the committee's objectives of improving the operation of the House committees and rationalising the number of committees on which members are required to serve. The government agrees with the committee's recommendation to reduce the number of members on general purpose standing committees. A composition of 10 members, with provision for the appointment of up to two supplementary members, would reduce members' workloads without preventing members from participating as the committee deems appropriate. It has been agreed between the whips that the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services will, however, have 12 members.
The proposed reduction of the Standing Committee on Procedure is also a sensible measure which we support. The proposed balance in the committee—namely, six members from the government and four from the opposition—reflects the composition of the new House. It is not intended that this measure, as envisaged by the committee, operate as a permanent rule for later parliaments. By definition, a government will have the most backbenchers available to perform committee work and should have a corresponding proportion of committee positions. In addition, the government considers that the standing orders should expressly provide that the 
 proposed two supplementary members include one government member and one non-government member, and the new proposed standing orders differ from the committee's recommendation in that respect.
In relation to recommendation 11, that the balance between committee and delegation business and private members business be a judgment for the selection committee, I must say that I am not entirely convinced that trading private members' time for committee business will address members' concerns. However, we accept that some flexibility to maximise time for business—depending on demand—could permit more efficient use of House time. The hour after question time will, however, be preserved for private members business. On this basis, recommendation 11 will be supported, subject to a review, for a trial period of 12 months.
With regard to recommendations 25 and 26, relating to the treatment of in camera evidence and, in particular, the requirement that wherever evidence is given in camera it not be released by the committee without the agreement of the witness, given that this imposes new requirements on the committees we propose that this measure should also be subject to a trial period.
Whilst the government agrees, to some extent, to the committee's proposals to expand House committees' scope to initiate inquiries, we will not be supporting recommendations 6 and 10, which relate to committees being given the power to determine their own references and to a provision for petitions to stand referred to general purpose standing committees for any inquiry the committee may make. I point out that the committees already have a standing reference of annual reports and that that should provide ample opportunity for committees to pursue matters which they believe should be pursued.
The government supports recommendations 7, 8 and 9 and will agree to the changes—which allows for reports of the Auditor-General to stand referred to general purpose standing committees for any inquiry they wish to make. In this case, a committee must notify in writing the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts and Audit when an inquiry 
 is intended. That joint committee is to develop procedures to ensure that the views of general purpose standing committees are sought prior to the determination of parliament's audit priorities.
As a general rule, bills should only be referred to the House committees; or, if necessary, the House may refer a bill specifically to a committee consisting of House members of a joint committee rather than refer it to the joint committee as a whole. This recommendation will clarify the procedure by which bills being examined by joint committees will only be dealt with by House members and will operate in accordance with House procedures.
In relation to the committee's proposal in recommendations 13 to 18 for the treatment of government responses to committee reports, the government will not be supporting the recommendation. The government already maintains its three-month target for responses to reports and provides a six-monthly schedule of government responses to reports in the House of Representatives and joint committees and also of the reports presented to which responses are outstanding. In my view that is perfectly adequate, and we therefore do not propose to pick up this recommendation.
We do not propose any changes to the arrangements for the presentation and debate of government responses as also proposed by the Procedure Committee. In essence, the timing of debate of government responses should, in my view, be a matter for the government. It is a political decision. It has always been that way, and it is perfectly reasonable for the government to adopt that approach.
Recommendations 19 to 23 will also be supported by the government. We support recommendation 24 in principle, but fixing those guidelines in a resolution may attract issues of arguments and interpretation over committee procedure, adding to the time and cost of inquiries and distracting from the business of the committee.
Other minor changes which are being made today include some minor housekeeping changes which have been suggested informally by the Clerk. Specifically, these include, 
 when a situation arises such that a position on a committee becomes vacant and the House is not expected to sit for a further period of at least two weeks, that the relevant whip or whips, depending on whether the position was vacated by a government member or a non-government member, may nominate by writing to the Speaker the appointment or discharge of a member of a committee.
In conclusion, I thank the members of the Procedure Committee for the work which they undertook in this review. I particularly mention the work of the member for Aston, the former chairman of the committee, who is in the chamber. He has always taken a close interest in these matters and has worked hard to provide relevant reports over the past few years which this government has been willing to implement.
I also thank the Manager of Opposition Business for his calm and considered response to these proposals and, in particular, for the discussions that we have had on the report. I must say that I welcome the discussions that we have had; I think that is appropriate. Many of these things can be blown up out of all proportion to become major political events, but the reality is that most of these issues simply go to the processes of the House—
—You are sounding very statesmanlike.
—Let that interjection be recorded in Hansard ! I put it to the Manager of Opposition Business that, if he and I can have a reasonable conversation about these matters, perhaps a slightly different attitude to the management of opposition business in the chamber would also be appreciated.
For example, we offered more time for the address-in-reply so that speakers could have an opportunity to raise matters which they probably have been wanting to raise since the election. That is fair enough, and I think we should provide additional time for members, particularly given this is a very short parliamentary session after the election and there are issues that people properly want to raise in the parliament. Unfortunately, the opposition refused that proposal. We said, `Why don't we give people more time?' and they said no. Then, of course, on ABC AM they 
 said that the government is gagging debate. We offered a further opportunity, more time, and they refused it.
Last night we had a vote on the referral of the address-in-reply to the Main Committee. The opposition had agreed to the referral of the address-in-reply to the Main Committee, and so what happened? They came in here and voted against it. What does that do? With great respect, it is just a complete nonsense. It is just playing games for the sake of playing games.
On the question of the tax legislation, the opposition is complaining about the time that will be provided for the debate on the government's new tax system. We said that we intended this legislation to go through the parliament and across to the Senate by Christmas time. We are sitting an extra week, which will give people ample opportunity to put their point of view. The Labor Party does not need a lot of time because it is opposed to it. In fact, it is opposed to virtually everything. It is certainly opposed to the government's tax reform proposals.
I said to the Manager of Opposition Business, `We've got a week. Can we have discussions about properly managing that week so that, instead of spending the whole week having divisions, people can have the opportunity provided in that week to debate the issues?' What was the response? `No, we don't want to discuss how we manage the business. We want you to put in a guillotine motion.' That was the response. I have been in opposition, I have been in that position, and there are lots of people on your backbenches saying, `Give it to the government. Make their life impossible.' With great respect, that is just juvenile. It is just stupid.
Mr Cadman interjecting—
—I know you will never believe this, and it will be impossible for me to convince you, but we as an opposition did not take division after division after division. For example, last night the shadow minister for small business wanted to move an amendment. I was quite happy for him to move an amendment, so I said to him, `Are you going to divide on one of the procedural issues? If you do not divide on that, instead of our 
 having a division, why don't you have five minutes having your say?' He asked the brains trust on the tactics committee on the opposition side, `Do I get to speak or do I have a division?' What did they decide? They decided to have a division. Quite frankly, I am sorry, but that is just plain stupid. If he has something worth saying, he ought to be given the opportunity to say it.
How many divisions did we have on the Workplace Relations Bill? Was it seven, eight or nine? I do not know. We were here for about an hour having divisions. Why? It beats me why. You are opposed to it. You voted against it three times in the last parliament. You are still against it. You are always going to be against it. So what is the point of having people sitting around in divisions? As I said to the Manager of Opposition Business, `Do we want to discuss how we are going to have this debate or are we just going to have a whole lot of divisions?' What was the answer? `We'll have a whole lot of divisions.' I do not think the public is impressed by that. In fact, I do not think the public could give two hoots about it. It is just silly games, as far as I am concerned.
We are more than happy to facilitate the proper management of issues. Sure, there will be times when, from the government's perspective, there will be some haste or some requirement to get on with things and push things through. That has been the way of governments since the federal parliament first met. We are more than happy to sit down and negotiate and have sensible arrangements, but in the first few days of this new parliament we have had a repeat of the juvenile tactics that we had last time. I do not think you get anything for it. You get absolutely nothing for it. Saying on AM that the government is gagging you on the GST is, quite frankly, a joke. It just turns people off. It is the sort of thing that encourages people to vote for Pauline Hanson because they do not think much of the way we run the House.
You can make all the political points that you want to make. You can hit us as hard as you like when making political points, and good luck to you for doing so. In some ways you are obliged to take political points against 
 the government of the day. Hold us accountable, that is fine, we are happy to be held accountable, and so we should be; but why prevent your own people from speaking just for the sake of having a division?
With those words, the response of the government to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure is to accept many of the proposals. It is a good report. It continues the good traditions of this committee, certainly in the time that we have been in, to produce quality reports. I thank all members for their work on the committee.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Standing Orders</title>,Committees,28,1
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The opposition will be supporting the motion. It is a great pity, however, that we had matters about which we had substantial agreement adorned by such sanctimonious humbug at the end of that particular speech. We already had an agreement that we would only go for an hour in this session, and the hope was that a number of backbenchers would have the opportunity to speak. I had indicated that I would speak briefly, and I will speak briefly, about the motion, although there are some things that need to be said.
Notwithstanding the fact that we agree with what is in it, our concern is about the things from the Standing Committee on Procedure report that are not accepted, and we will make some comments about those. Of course, I will be obliged to respond to those remarks. To the extent that that might interfere with anyone's opportunity to speak on this matter, I regret it. But it was gratuitous sanctimonious humbug so I will have to respond.
The matters with which the government has agreed from the Procedure Committee report are matters with which we also agree. This is not surprising. All those recommendations were bipartisan recommendations from the committee, and the two recommendations from the Procedure Committee about which there was a minority report the government is not adopting. I think it is correct in not adopting those two, so we welcome that.
I am not absolutely convinced that every one of the changes in detail is exactly what I would personally have preferred, but it is the 
 unanimous recommendation of an experienced and competent committee. I welcome the fact that the government is adopting it. So we will support it. I think what you would say is, `This is okay, but it is not enough.' It is not part of creating a 21st century parliamentary institution, but it is a useful, modest attempt at improving the operation of the committee system that we now have. The one thing I do agree with the Leader of the House about is that the committee did a good job in its deliberations and in its report. It is a considered and thoughtful report. Even the bits I do not agree with have been thought through and the recommendations are not lightly made. They are based on the argument of the people who proposed them, even where there is disagreement. So I think it has done a good job.
There is also some restructuring of the standing orders in terms of presentation and reformatting and some minor changes, as the Leader of the House implies, recommended by the Clerk. Those are also things which we support. I am not convinced, personally, that reducing the size of the committees to 10 is a good idea, but that is the majority position. It was the agreed position. I accept it, and I welcome the fact that the government has agreed to increase the rural committee to 12, in effect, as we all know, to accommodate the interests of the Independent member. I think that is an appropriate thing to do, and we welcome and support that also.
The one place where the government has varied the committee's recommendation in a way that we will support—and it is not necessarily a contradiction of the committee's position; it is simply making a more specific indication, but we have some reservations about how it will work—is the committee's suggestion that there should be the potential to add two members to a committee for particular references. The government has made it specific that that should be one plus one from government and opposition to maintain the balance. We have no interest in that operating otherwise. I am sure no-one ever envisaged it would operate otherwise, but there is some concern as to how that selection will be made. I raised this with the Leader of 
 the House in our discussions but we did not actually get anywhere. The nature of those negotiations is something I would not have raised but, as he has raised it, I will happily discuss it.
Our concern is that the way the standing orders are written now, in particular and in effect because of the numbers in the House, the government has a veto over the circumstances in which the opposition may seek to have an extra person on a committee. It is obvious that on any occasion when the opposition would want to have that extra member the government would want to exercise its right to have that extra one as well—not that it is necessary, because the government would still have a majority without it. But we understand they would always wish to do that and nobody would suggest that you would allow this one plus one extra members mechanism to be a backdoor device to change the balance on the committee.
But where either whip or leader indicates that this is a circumstance in which the right to an extra member is going to be exercised—it should automatically trigger, of course, the right of the government to exercise its right also—the power of initiative should come from the opposition, and not have a right of veto resting with the government. I regret that the government could not accept that suggestion, but they did not accept any of our suggestions, so why should we be surprised they didn't accept that? I think in the drafting of standing orders 324 and 333 there is a potential for this to operate a little awkwardly. I am not convinced that we have got that absolutely right. I think our proposal was better, but we are not going to vote against it. It is simply a concern we have, and if it operates as we fear on some occasion then we will have something to say. I simply flag it now.
It is a pity the government did not accept recommendation 6 with regard to references. I think that is a change which we in government did not make. In the Senate, in which I was a minister during the time of the government, that power does exist and, I have to say, for all the apprehension that House of Representatives members always had about 
 the crisis that this would cause, it never caused one. I understand, and we understand, the way governments react to that. We have had the same experience. I think it is time we all changed, but I accept it. I cannot be too profound in our criticism. We had the chance to do it and did not do it. So, while noting my regret, I do not want to take it any further than that.
The failure I am concerned about—which I did raise with the Leader of the House, but it is not one that in this instance I think there is any chance that he would accept; so, while I will have something to say about the general question of negotiating with this Leader of the House in a moment in response to his remarks, I do not apply it to this matter because this is a matter of principle, not just a matter of process—relates to the question of petitions. I think we all have to accept that the way the once very important petitioning of parliament process is handled is a farce and a scandal. If the people who put the time and effort into gathering petitions knew what happened to them, they would be appalled. A very important part of the petitioning of the parliamentary process is the gathering process, out in the community gathering the signatures. Nothing that we do interferes with that, and that is good.
The second benefit which this does not interfere with is the political impact, when there is a major petition, of its presentation to a member and the media events surrounding that. Those two things will continue and nothing in the government's failure to act will in any way impede that. But I think we have to refine the way we deal with petitions to take that power of the citizen and reflect it more effectively in what happens in the parliament.
My preferred position on this is not the committee's preferred position, but the committee's position is a significant improvement. If the government had supported it we would have supported it. But we will give some consideration perhaps to alternative mechanisms. We may not come back when we put forward our point of view with that which the committee has recommended. Personally, if it were me I would not; I would 
 do it slightly differently. But I welcome the fact that it has addressed it. I welcome the fact that the committee has suggested these petitions should be taken more seriously. I hope that the government will do something about that. So we will support the motion because those things which are being done are things which we support. We welcome that. We are disappointed there is not more and we look forward to better in the future.
I will make some quick comments in response to the other statements that the Leader of the House made. I will not take long. I guess it is all very predictable but disappointing that we hear all this sanctimonious stuff. I had the same experience in the last session when we shadowed each other in a different capacity. Discussions, laughingly called negotiations, with the Leader of the House are what I describe to the caucus as amiably useless. You walk in and he smiles and keeps smiling, but at the end of the day when he runs out of arguments against your position, he says, `I'm sorry, we're the government.' Nothing ever changes.
Dr Wooldridge interjecting—
—You have no idea what it used to be like.
—I have a very good idea. My only concern is that you are being so sanctimonious in pretending that it was otherwise. Am I shocked that it is so? No, I am not. Am I concerned that you come in here and pretend that it is otherwise? That is what leads me to respond. I prefer things to be amiably useless than useless with acrimony, so I suppose it is a mild compliment. But let us not pretend that you negotiate. You come in, have a discussion—
Mr Reith interjecting—
—Exactly. If it is called damning with faint praise, it might be closer. We have a situation where discussions can be held, but if you pretend that anything is going to come out of it, you are headed for sad and imminent disillusionment. I was not disillusioned because I had no expectations.
—We could have started the GST today. We decided to start it on Monday at your request. That's amiably useful.
—In relation to the proposal to start it today, for the shadow Treasurer to be expected to respond to what is supposed to be the greatest tax reform since Federation without having a chance to go to caucus or the parliamentary party and having had the bills for 24 hours is an insult. You offer up something that nobody could reasonably accept and then say, `We offered you something and you knocked it back.' You could have said, `We offered you a drink. Here's a glass of arsenic. You were very uncharitable and you didn't accept it.' It was an entirely unacceptable, unreasonable and impossible proposition and nobody was in the slightest bit surprised.
Mr Reith interjecting—
—I never agreed to that. I accept that you may believe I did. I do not mean that you are deliberately misleading. I certainly did not. That was something which I took back to my show and told them about it—
Mr Reith interjecting—
—Thank you very much. `Gratuitous' is your middle name. Let us not worry about the chief whip. He is doing all right.
The address-in-reply procedure has significantly outraged the backbench of the opposition. Views are very strongly held about it. They are extremely concerned. We did not agree with it being referred. We have indicated that we think it reduces the significance of the contributions which people have to make in that debate, which is one of the important opportunities for the backbench. We have indicated today that we will participate in the Main Committee deliberations. We are not happy about it. We are doing it under sufferance, but we will do it so that our colleagues can speak. But we are most unhappy about it.
Mr Reith interjecting—
—I do not know what you are talking about with regard to that because what you are saying does not reflect the reports I have received about the discussion, but that is a matter for another day. I am very happy to say that what you have said is 
 not an accurate representation of my understanding, but I am not surprised.
With regard to the Workplace Relations Bill, it is not surprising that some of our colleagues were a little concerned. There were 23 speakers listed and almost none of them got a chance to speak. They did not think that was a reasonable way of handling something which they thought was important on behalf of their constituents and about which they are correct. Last night when asked, `Can we have a discussion about this?' the shadow minister's response was, `If we can have a few speakers,' and you said, `No', and so we said, `There is no point in having a discussion.' And that was the end of that. You are quite right—there was no point in having a discussion. I was not in the mood for `amiably useless' at that time.
Let us not pretend that you are other than absolutely unchangeable in all these matters and that any negotiation has ever achieved any useful outcome, either when you were shadow minister and I dealt with you or in your capacity as Leader of the House. I will continue to participate in those discussions because it is my obligation and, you never know, one day I might break my duck, but it is highly unlikely. I do not mind that; just do not come in here and be sanctimonious about it. It is sickening.
Unfortunately, there were matters where I felt we could have been in agreement in the House because the motion the government is moving is one which we support. We are somewhat disappointed that it is not stronger, but, to the extent that it goes in the direction which we agree with, we support it. With those remarks and that response to the unnecessary, sanctimonious humbug which we had to endure during his remarks, I support the motion.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Standing Orders</title>,Committees,28,1
"Nugent, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—In response to the member for Fraser's comments about discussions being amiably useless, I spent six years on the other side and in our dealings with the then government the exchanges were certainly not amiable and they were certainly useless most of the time and pretty vitriolic. I welcome the opportunity to make a few comments on the government's 
 response to this report as I was the chair of the committee that brought the report down. Clearly, I welcome the fact that the government has accepted a number of our recommendations. I am also disappointed that it has not picked up all of those recommendations because we felt that most of them were pretty valid.
It is perhaps worth making the point that the timing of the report was relevant in two senses. One was that the review took place 10 years after the inception of the committee system in this place and therefore it was an appropriate time to take a long-term look at how the committee system had developed, how it operated, what was done in practice and what was recorded in the procedures as being allowed to be done so that we could modernise and bring the system up to date. Also, we would see whether the committees were achieving the purpose for which they were set up and whether there was a need to look at some restructuring.
Secondly, we were conscious that it was important this inquiry was completed well before the end of the last parliament. Whilst those of us on our side expected that the incoming government would be us, those on the other side clearly thought it might be them. All of us agreed it was important that the incoming government had the benefit of the report before this parliament started so that the government could look at how it wanted to go about setting up committees and what the rules might be and so on at the beginning of the parliament. It seemed to me that that was a practical approach. I am pleased that the government has taken up a number of the recommendations in that sense.
There are two things the government has not taken up that many of us on the committee were disappointed about. We felt that there were just too many committees and that the committees were too large in size. The most constant refrain we heard from just about everybody who gave evidence was that people were stretched too thin. They were having to be on too many committees, they were having to go to too many meetings, and they were really not doing justice, in many 
 cases, to their commitments on those committees because they did not have the time.
It was felt that reducing the number as well as the size of the committees would enable members to perform more effectively. Therefore, the majority of the committee felt that reducing the number of committees was an ideal thing to do. The way to do that was to cut out some of the joint committees that already had their equivalents or that could have their subject matter dealt with by other committees that exist either here or in the Senate. But the government has obviously chosen not to proceed with that recommendation, and we will accept that.
Another issue I am particularly disappointed about is the fact that the committees will not be allowed to initiate their own references. There was overwhelming support in the committee and in all the evidence we took for that to happen. Certainly we were very keen that, as the gentleman from Fraser mentioned, petitions be treated in a more serious way than they are at the moment. We put forward a particular proposal, which the government has not accepted. I nevertheless urge the Leader of the House to perhaps look at another way of making sure that this chamber does deal with petitions more seriously in the future.
In terms of reducing the size of committees, as I have mentioned, we went for a particular formula for size. One accepts that from time to time it may be necessary to change that depending on the composition of the House. Again, it was very much a question of trying to make sure that members have the capacity to contribute seriously on the committees on which they serve. This involves not overstretching them so that their contribution is lip-service, if you like, but enabling them to make a proper contribution.
It is also about recognising that there are occasions when, if you cut down on the size of committees, you may want some extra people for a particular task or you may want some particular expertise which is not necessarily on that committee on an ongoing basis. Hence, there was the suggestion of having additional members. I am very pleased to see 
 that the government is going to go down that road.
The restructuring of the standing orders was, it seemed to me, a long overdue and important piece of housekeeping, if you like. At present, the standing orders in relation to committees are, frankly, scattered throughout the document. Drawing them together, restructuring them, rewriting them and bringing them together in one place seems to me a sensible idea. We have also put forward recommendations, which the government has accepted, in some cases on a trial basis, to deal with the real situations that committees deal with when they meet and which are not covered properly in the standing orders. An example is the handling of in camera evidence. Those things will be very useful from the point of view of future committees. It will enable the committees to work much more successfully.
There was a minority report, which I was disappointed about. Some of those who contributed to the minority report had not been active participants in the committee's activities. They produced that minority report very much at the death knock. Nevertheless, the issues about which they were concerned have not been proceeded with. I can understand why the government would do that.
I am pleased that the government has accepted so many of our recommendations. I also say to the Leader of the House that there is very great concern about the ability of this chamber, as the parliament, to debate the reports that the parliamentary committees produce and the government responses. I ask that he treat that issue empathetically and sympathetically in the future. I am generally pleased that the government is introducing the motion that it is. I urge the House to support it.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Standing Orders</title>,Committees,28,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I would certainly like to make a few remarks. I do not want to rehash the report on procedure. I will make a couple of points about it, though. Obviously, the review did a useful job. The chairman and the committee limited themselves very dramatically when they failed to take into account expenditure. I know they said that this was outside the terms of reference. However, given that in the last parlia 
 ment $10 million was slashed out of the committees and their staffing was reduced, it seemed to me a real limitation in reviewing their progress over 10 years. In particular, I was looking forward to looking at what the role of committees might be in the future.
I happen to agree with the honourable former chairman of the Procedure Committee on the recommendation about too many committees, although I do so from a different point of view. The different point of view is this: without in any way wanting to be disrespectful to those honourable members who serve on committees, it is the quality and amount of resources that underpin committees that will have a significant impact on the quality of their work. At the end of the day, the committees need to stand and fall on the quality of the reports that they deliver into the parliament.
For example, I have long held the view that, to try to get extra resources into the parliamentary committees, we need to offer internships to university students so they could be placed on a contract for 12 to 18 months. We would get the benefit of their enthusiasm and minds, and they would get the benefit of being able to put on their CV that they worked for a parliamentary committee.
Given that parliamentarians and the institution itself are suffering somewhat from low public esteem, parliamentary committees are one way in which the people of Australia can have a sense that their voices and their views are being heard and taken into account by the parliamentary process. As members of parliament, I think we ought to be very concerned about our parliamentary committees and nurture their ongoing development. I for one would be very disappointed if the next 10 years of parliamentary committees merely replicated the first 10 years, yet I would be the first to concede that the first 10 years have made a very profound impact on them.
On the issue of petitions, it is a very ancient right of a citizen to present petitions. I have put a standing order on the Notice Paper that would allow people who had taken the time and effort to gather a petition about a subject matter which they wanted to have presented to the parliament and who were able to travel 
 to the parliament to come to the bar of the parliament and read out the prayer of the petition. And, in the event they could not do that, it would allow the honourable member in whose electorate they resided to at least read the prayer of the petition. Some may say that is not a big deal, but I think there is a great deal of symbolism in allowing an ordinary citizen of our country to come to the bar of the parliament and read the petition. I am a great one for thinking about the need to keep on making parliamentarians and parliamentary processes accessible to the people of Australia.
It is true that not only the previous Labor government but also this government has extended the forms of this House, and they are to be congratulated. I have a particular interest in the three-minute members' statements and note that that now has been permanently incorporated in standing orders. I would sincerely hope that the Leader of the House might consider extending the six per Thursday to 20 or 10 a side, as was originally proposed.
I should not have got off committees so quickly because, as in the last parliament, I believe that the House should have a staffing and appropriations committee so that Mr Speaker can be assisted by members of parliament in the discharge of his responsibilities. It needs to be said that, in an era of openness and accountability, it is only the expenditure of the Department of the House of Representatives which receives no scrutiny whatsoever. The Senate—and it was a Liberal member setting up the Staffing and Appropriations Committee—always envisaged that the House would have a staffing and appropriations committee and that, on appropriate occasions, the two houses could meet jointly. I certainly hope that we may be able to do this.
The other thing is having an estimates committee. There is no doubt that estimates are troublesome things to all governments, Labor and Liberal. But, from a backbencher's point of view, the omission of an estimates committee for the House means that you have a much lesser opportunity to get across the 
 operations and impacts of different departments.
The executives, whether they are coalition executives or Labor executives, are always going to want to resist estimates committees. But, in terms of the committee system and particularly the development of backbenchers' knowledge, skills and ability to more than adequately represent their constituents, I think House of Representatives estimates committees are worthy of consideration. Should they be implemented, there would then be the pressure on the Senate to see whether or not it would be appropriate to then have joint estimates committees. I suggest that there would be some advantages to the government of the day in having joint estimates committees.
There was one other standing order that I thought I should draw to your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, because both sides in the past when dissent from Speaker's rulings are moved have gagged debate on the dissent motion. Given that the more recent practice of Speakers is not to defend their rulings but to leave it up to the Leader of the House, there must be nothing more demeaning than to make a ruling, have dissent moved on it and then have the whole matter gagged through. I would have thought at the very least, given the importance of a dissent motion, that that motion should be debated.
As the Manager of Opposition Business has indicated, the opposition are not opposing this motion and are welcoming some of the changes. I sincerely hope that the government will be prepared to consider further changes to the standing orders in the life of this parliament.
Question resolved in the affirmative.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Standing Orders</title>,Committees,28,1
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 1 and 2:
(1)	 Schedule 1, item 8, page 3 (line 27), omit ""100 penalty units"", substitute ""1000 penalty units"".
(2)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 4 (line 2), omit ""100 penalty units"", substitute ""1000 penalty units"".
Amendments 1 and 2 relate to increasing penalty units for the misuse of electoral roll information. They actually amend items 8 and 9 in the amendment bill. The government's proposal is to increase the penalty to 100 units, which is $11,000. The opposition thinks that this is a step in the right direction. However, the opposition believes that a more severe penalty should be imposed, given the increased access to electors' information and the sensitivity and value of that information.
The opposition's amendments propose to increase the number of penalty units to 1,000 for disclosure of or using for a commercial purpose electoral roll information. If our 
 amendments were accepted, this would currently attract a fine of $110,000, a sum which would more accurately reflect the value of the information provided to politicians. The opposition's view is that the disclosure of this information to marketing companies could offer enormous commercial advantage. It is essential that a penalty exist to act as a serious deterrent to such commercial advantage.
It is the opposition's view that 100 penalty units or $11,000 does not do that but that we hope that $110,000 would. What this is about, pure and simple, is deterrence. In the modern society in which we live, there is more and more information that is being accessed. There is more and more information that is valuable to be traded as commercial information. In the opposition's view, this is the only way—or at least a better way—to ensure a deterrence effect and that there is not a trade in this information for commercial advantage. It is a small penalty for companies to pay if they have access to this information. So the opposition would implore the government to consider these amendments.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,31,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—This is a stunt by the opposition. We certainly do not support the misuse of information. There is no evidence out there in the community of widespread misuse of this information. If the government were to detect evidence that the information was going to be inappropriately used and that it was a widespread practice in the community, then we certainly would be happy to revisit this matter. But, at the present time and in the absence of any other compelling reason, we believe that the increase to 100 penalty units is appropriate and reasonable in all the circumstances. The increase proposed by the Labor Party is inappropriate. It is a stunt. The government's increase is adequate, given the circumstances, but were we to detect widespread abuse then obviously the government would be happy to look at this matter again. But we do reject the opposition amendments.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I move opposition amendment No. 3:
(3)	 Schedule 1, item 10, page 4 (lines 3 to 4), omit the item, substitute:
10  After paragraph 93(8)(b)
Insert:
	 (ba)	 is serving a sentence of imprisonment which:
		 (i)	 commenced on or before the return of the writs for an election for the House of Representatives or the Senate; and
		 (ii)	 continues at the issuing of the writs for any succeeding election for the House of Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be; or
The amendment relates to a prisoner's five-year voting rule, and it amends item 10 in the amendment bill.	 The opposition is of the view that the provision currently in the amendment bill will deny all prisoners a vote. Hence, a person sentenced to eight weeks in gaol coinciding with an election period could not vote, yet another prisoner sentenced to two years in gaol coinciding with a favourable electoral cycle would be able to vote.
Parliament has previously accepted that certain classes of prisoners should not be able to vote, and we do not oppose that view. It is possible, however, to distinguish between major and minor crimes, as the parliament has previously done. The opposition strongly believes that the five-year rule should remain. Our amendments are designed to ensure also that if any prisoner has been continually imprisoned during the period from the return of the writs of one election to the issuing of the writs for the next election, their vote will not be admitted to the count. We believe that this provides greater consistency to the five-year rule.
We will have some shrill response from the government, saying that we are soft on crime—`What are we doing allowing those prisoners to vote?' There is already a penalty attaching to these people. I think it is worthwhile comparing what is happening in other jurisdictions that do not necessarily have Labor governments. In the ACT there are no restrictions as there is no gaol in the ACT. If people are imprisoned outside the territory, they are disqualified as they would not be 
 residing in the territory. In the Northern Territory it is as per the Commonwealth Electoral Act—that is, a sentence of five years or more disqualifies prisoners from having a right to vote in the territory. This is a fairly conservative regime that has had a continuous conservative government. In Western Australia there is a disqualification if the sentence is for one year or longer.
In New South Wales there are no restrictions. There are postal votes and polling booths in prisons. In Victoria there are no restrictions. In South Australia there are no restrictions. The legislation gives special mail provisions to prisoners—that is, mail that is sent to returning officers by a prisoner cannot be opened. In Queensland, it is as per the Commonwealth Electoral Act—that is, disqualification in the case of a sentence of five years or longer. There is also provision for them to be entitled to enrol if they were not eligible under the Commonwealth act but they were entitled to be enrolled under the Elections Act 1983 on 31 December 1991. That earlier act allows British subjects and certain defence members, et cetera to be enrolled but disqualifies prisoners with sentences of six months or longer. This relates more to British subjects than to prisoners.
What we have here really is the government purely seeking political advantage, feeding into the prejudice in the community. We on this side say that the principle of disqualification for prisoners with gaol terms of five years or longer has been around for a long while, and we have got the situation in the states, which I have just read out, where there are governments of all political persuasions—and in recent times there have been conservative governments in most of those jurisdictions—who have made no attempt to water down the right of prisoners to vote. I think that the hangers and floggers in the government are trying to push this amendment without due regard to civil liberties and without due regard to our rights under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. If this government keeps going the way it has, not only in this area but in other areas as well, Australia is going to be seen to be a pariah in the interna 
 tional community as we further and further strip away the basic rights that people currently enjoy.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,31,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—I have to say that the suggestion that this provision is a concession to the so-called hangers and floggers in the government is nothing short of pathetic. The amendment proposed by the ALP would be extremely impractical to implement. Even with the current seven-day close of rolls period, it would be difficult for the AEC to determine the eligibility of prisoners, as this can be resolved only when the date of the issue of the writ is known. The AEC would also be reliant on timely advice from the prison authorities following the issue of the writ, and the AEC has already highlighted that there are inconsistencies among the various states and territories in relation to the notification received from prison authorities. The government notes that there was no proposed ALP amendment to section 109 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act relating to the forwarding of conviction details to the AEC in this regard.
It also appears that the ALP amendment would be inconsistent in its application to electors imprisoned for a period of less than five years. A person's eligibility may well depend on the date of his or her incarceration in relation to the timing of an election rather than the length of his or her sentence. Further, while the House of Representatives writs are returned together, the various state Senate writs may not all be returned on the same day. The period between elections also varies.
The government believes very strongly that in our society people certainly have rights but accompanying those rights they have responsibilities. If one goes into any shopping centre in the nation and asks people one meets there, `Should prisoners have the right to vote?' then people would simply say no.
Mr Melham interjecting—
—It is important to make sure that the parliament represents the collective will of the Australian people. The honourable member for Banks ought to appreciate that people have had an absolute gutful of the 
 ALP being soft on crime. He said that we would say that the ALP is soft on crime.
Mr Laurie Ferguson interjecting—
—The honourable member for Reid ought not to interject. The fact that the ALP is opposing these amendments is proof positive that it does not take the view that accompanying the rights of Australian citizens are also responsibilities.
I am pleased to refer to the situation in other places. The honourable member for Banks referred to certain state jurisdictions. I would like to take a more global point of view and emphasise that the amendments proposed by the government, if carried by the parliament, would certainly bring the law in Australia in line with that in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Belgium and a number of states in the United States of America. This legislation is consistent with community practice around the world. It is fair and reasonable. I believe that the Australian people will strongly reject what the ALP is seeking to do.
I am privileged to quote the view of the government as stated by my good friend and parliamentary colleague Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin. Earlier this year he said:
The right to vote is one of the privileges of living in a democracy. If you have committed an offence against society so serious that you are actually incarcerated in a prison cell for a period of time, then you entirely lose your rights, privileges and freedom as an ordinary citizen for the period of the imprisonment. It is quite an extraordinary anomaly that, despite all that, a prisoner actually retains the right to vote, so that a prisoner's vote is worth as much as the most law abiding of all our citizens.
That sums it up. That says it all. Quite understandably, the government completely rejects the proposals put forward by the honourable member for Banks.

As outlined earlier, we do believe that prisoners should be entitled to be enrolled and that the current five-year rule should remain. These amendments are consequential to ensure that this remains the case. We have just had a dissertation from the parliamentary secretary at the table which confirms that this is purely just a low-grade exercise in politics on the part of the government trying to feed into those elements in the community. What we need to do is step back here. There are many people who are imprisoned, but not for serious crimes. There are many people in the indigenous community who are imprisoned in relation to offences of drunkenness and offences that carry very small penalties. What this would seek to do is disenfranchise them.
For instance, someone may be penalised for their involvement in a drink driving offence where someone dies or suffers grievous bodily harm. Such people might have short prison sentences as a result of those drink driving offences, but they are still being penalised. These are not offences that necessarily involve criminality where people set out deliberately to do things, but an accident may occur, and they might be drunk. There is a whole range of other things. There are instances where there are a number of people who are, in our view, entitled to continue to participate and have their legitimate right to vote accepted. It seems to me that in abandoning the five-year rule this government is just playing low-grade politics.
I repeat what I said earlier in relation to what is happening in state jurisdictions and the penalties there that disqualify people from voting. Those state jurisdictions had conservative governments for many years, including the Bjelke-Petersen government, yet even they did not attempt to do this.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,31,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—I will not revisit all of the truths and obvious corrections to the misleading statements made by the opposition in relation to these amendments. The simple fact of the matter is that, in our society, people have rights, privileges and responsibilities. When the courts of this land determine that a person should be subjected to a term of imprisonment, the government takes the view that the right to vote ought to be suspended for the period that a person is incarcerated.
The honourable member for Banks referred to certain people who are imprisoned for short periods and suggested that it was inappropriate that those people should lose their right to vote while they are imprisoned. The government takes the view that people who are in prison for short periods should have their right to vote lost for those short periods. When people re-enter general society, then the right to vote would be resuscitated. The government opposes, quite understandably, the amendments moved by the honourable member for Banks.

These items would close off rolls three working days after the issue of the writ and set up a postponement period during which new names could not be added to or deleted from the roll as a result of enrolment practices. That is what this government wants to do. We 
 are seeking to delete items 30, 31, 11, 12, 14, 28, 53 and 54 from the amendment bill.
The postponement period for new electors commences at 6 p.m. on the date of the issue of the writ until the close of polling. This means that no new electors can get on the roll once the election has been called. The rationale is that the new proof of identity and other crosschecks for new electors will take too long to carry out and will not make the three-day limit. About 80,000 new enrolments occur once an election is called. Closing the rolls so quickly would disenfranchise a large number of first time voters, most of whom would be young people.
Even worse, the postponement period for new electors would see those 80,000 people who apply to get on the electoral roll when an election is called disenfranchised. As for everyone else, at each election we know there is a rush of people who either apply to get on the roll or who need to update their address. It is often not until an election is called that many people consider their election enrolment.
Evidence given by the Australian Electoral Commission to the joint committee shows that a majority of the 320,000 people who notified a change of address did so at the last available opportunity. I repeat: a majority of the 320,000 people who notified a change of address did so at the last available opportunity. To restrict the period in which to change your address prior to an election to three days is massively distorting. It could lead to more than 200,000 people voting still listed at their previous address, which would be completely contrary to the intention of the Electoral Act. That is why our amendments omit these items.
We should be ensuring the integrity of the roll. That is why we have this period. To contract it the way the government wants to will disqualify voters. These limits are also going to come in with provisional voting and they will try to bring in subdivisional voting. Why? Because there is paranoia on the other side. Each and every one of their amendments is aimed at sections or groups in the community whom they regard as predominantly Labor voters.
We say that the system is working well. There is no evidence that fraud is occurring in relation to these enrolments. The onus is on the government to put up or shut up. They have not satisfied the opposition that this change is necessary. If anything, this change will disenfranchise people. That is what this is about—disenfranchisement. Instead of encouraging people to get on the roll, we are setting up barriers to stop them from getting on the roll. That is what this is about. This will not add one new elector to the electoral roll at election time. This will disqualify a whole range of electors.
The Electoral Commission statistics show that many 18-year-olds are reluctant to vote but the older people get the more they enrol. About 95 per cent of those people eligible to be on the roll get on the roll by the time they are 25. The government amendments are a disenfranchisement provision. The opposition's amendments are aimed at restoring the status quo. It is about time this government tried to help people get a vote, not try to disenfranchise them.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,31,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—We are absolutely determined to make sure that everyone who is entitled to have a vote has a vote. We want to make sure that only those people who are entitled to be on the electoral roll in fact go on the electoral roll. These amendments go to the heart of the integrity of our electoral system. In Australia we are privileged to have a democracy. We have a way of life, we have freedom, that is the envy of people throughout the world. But at the heart of our democracy is the integrity of the electoral system. As I said last night, it is very important that when the result of an election is declared following a poll the result represents what the Australian people wanted to do on polling day.
—Then you should be in opposition.
—The ALP, by opposing the amendments put forward by the government, have exposed themselves as people who support rorts and fraud in the Australian electoral system. These changes are reasonable. They are designed to ensure integrity of 
 the electoral roll. They are designed to keep people off the electoral roll who ought not be on the electoral roll, people who are not entitled under the law of Australia to be on the electoral roll.
It also should be recognised that the AEC has previously stated that it is not possible to check the validity of all new enrolments received during the close of rolls rush period. These amendments address the increasing community concerns regarding fraudulent enrolments. It is a fact of life that at the moment we have an honour system as far as enrolment under the Australian Electoral Act is concerned. Any person is able to fill out thousands of enrolment cards. They can send the cards back, using the reply paid envelopes supplied by the Australian Electoral Commission, and these people will automatically go on the electoral roll.
Noms de plume can get on the electoral roll. If this happens on a widespread basis throughout the nation, then it is obvious that the election result can be skewed and stolen, and there can be gross amounts of electoral fraud. The government believes that we ought not to have merely an honour system. We ought not to have a system that simply depends on the honesty of individual people. We need checks, balances and safeguards. The proposals contained in the amendments before the chamber put forward by the government will ensure the integrity of our electoral roll. That is very important.
I believe that it is eminently regrettable that my colleague the member for Banks has imputed incorrect motives to the government. We are all about making sure that our system is open, accountable and fair, and that those people who are not entitled to be on the electoral roll are not included on the electoral roll prior to a vote.
It is important to ensure that people are not disenfranchised, and resources will be devoted to encourage electors to update their enrolment outside of election periods. It is true that numbers of people have sought to enrol or change their address after an election has been called, but it is important to create a culture in Australia where people will apply to get on the electoral roll when they turn 18 or become 
 otherwise entitled and, if they change their address, will fill in the change of enrolment card and send that to the Electoral Commission, so that we do not have this last minute rush.
The Australian Electoral Commission is currently moving towards a process of continuous roll update. Any concerns put forward by the opposition should be allayed by the fact that we will have a continuous roll update. The AEC will liaise with electricity authorities and the like to update electors as they move, rather than relying on electoral roll reviews conducted once every two years or when an election is called to prompt electors to update their electoral details. So it is important that people recognise that they have an obligation to fill in the card to change their enrolment or to get on the roll as soon as they are entitled to do so. The government stands by its position, and I commend it to the chamber.

These amendments are to do with re-enrolment within a month of moving and they omit items 13, 15 to 17, 21 to 23 and 25 to 27 of the government's amendments. What we now have is a government that legislates the 
 exception rather than the rule. The government is paranoid about some exceptional circumstances that might occur or an odd person here or there doing the wrong thing, but that is leading to the disenfranchisement of many others.
If the bill goes through in its present form—our amendments would stop this from happening—these items would disenfranchise a number of voters, particularly itinerant electors, by requiring electors to re-enrol within one month of moving. Previously, people were required to reside in their new electorate for a period of one month before being eligible for enrolment in that electorate. They then had 21 days to notify the AEC of their change of enrolment. These items cut that time back to only four weeks.
However, from the opposition's point of view, a much greater concern exists for itinerant electors. Item 17 seems to actually eliminate the entire category of itinerant electors. Item 17 provides that:
Subject to subsection (9), a person ceases to be eligible to be treated as an itinerant elector under this section as soon as the person becomes entitled to be enrolled for a Subdivision.
However, the other items in this group of amendments provide that a person becomes entitled to be enrolled in the subdivision immediately with no one-month waiting period. Therefore, an elector would cease to be treated as an itinerant elector as soon as they moved somewhere. That is the import of what these government amendments say to us on our reading of them and it shows that some amendments have been constructed in haste.
We say that there is an anomaly here and the government should look to rectify that. Really, they only discovered this anomaly—and I am interested to hear what the parliamentary secretary has to say for himself—in response to some research and discovery. The whole import of a lot of these amendments is that there are a whole range of paranoias on the conservative side about the integrity of the roll. I concede that there are individual members in this House who can come forward and point to some individual circumstances where some things have happened that should not 
 have happened. I concede that. I was on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in my first six years in the parliament, but our whole approach was that we did not legislate for the exception which would then create problems for the vast majority of other people.
We are about improving the integrity of the roll—the opposition wants to improve the integrity of the roll—but we do not want to create the wrong structure or legislation, especially after the Snowdon v. Dondas case and the McGinty case in the High Court. They basically said that—in terms of the states, not the territories—your constitutional right to vote has now vanished; your rights to vote now are referenced to the Electoral Act.
That is why we as a parliament need to be much more careful in the amendments that we move in this place because we have the power now to enfranchise or to disenfranchise. Our concern is that a lot of these provisions that are now being moved on the part of the government will create greater disenfranchisement. What we say is, `Yes. We know why it is happening.' It is not the government worrying about the integrity of the roll. They are doing little things to try to disenfranchise voters who they think will not support them. It is like their first budget when they took away funding that was aimed at getting indigenous people on the electoral rolls. The Australian Electoral Commission were forced to cut workers in the field who were out there helping indigenous people understand what the system was about and getting them on the roll. In that first budget, whack, out went those people. So we encourage the government to reconsider.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,Bills,31,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—The shadow minister was somewhat inconsistent in what he said. Initially, he claimed that members of the coalition are paranoid about the integrity of the electoral roll, and then he went on to suggest that we were not interested in the electoral roll but we were interested in disenfranchising certain people. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Mr Melham interjecting—
—I am pleased that you agree that you have been inconsistent. The government will not apologise for these amendments. We believe that they are appropriate and we have introduced them to the parliament only after due consideration. There is no suggestion that this is legislation on the run. Much of this legislation emanates from the report into the 1996 poll and there has been consideration of the items to be included. The government has been very careful to ensure that the bill includes provisions which continue to improve the integrity of the electoral system.
I for one do not really believe it is a crime to be paranoid about the integrity of the electoral system. Each and every one of us in this place should be paranoid about making sure that only those people entitled to be on the roll are on the roll. So we are determined to pursue in an ongoing way the integrity of the electoral roll, and the amendments currently before the chamber help this process.
There is no deliberate intention on the part of the government to remove the itinerant elector status. The AEC has advised that, while the proposed amendments would appear to severely limit an elector's ability to claim itinerant status in the application of the current provisions, the AEC has based the determination of eligibility not solely on the length of residency at a particular address but on whether that address is considered to be a permanent address of the elector—that is, one to which the elector has a fixed intention of returning to live on a permanent basis rather than just a temporary abode for a fixed period of time. The AEC advises that it will continue to adopt this approach in considering applications if the proposed amendments are passed into law.
Current provisions provide for a one-month qualifying period before a person can enrol in a new division and then a 21-day period by which time a person is required to have notified a change of address. However, if a person changes address within the same division, he or she only has the 21-day period in which to notify that change. As many electors are unaware of divisional boundaries, this requirement is unnecessarily confusing 
 and the amendments we are making here aim to reduce confusion for electors.

(17)	 Schedule 1, item 24, page 6 (line 21) to page 7 (line 3), omit the item.
These amendments will omit items 19, 20 and 24. They relate to enrolment reform and prescribed persons and regulations. From the opposition's point of view, the critical problem with these items is that their success is dependent on regulations that the parliament is yet to see. We have said since May this year, when this was first introduced, that we are not able to support these provisions until we are satisfied that the draft regulations are acceptable. We have had platitudes from the government that we will be consulted in their drafting and that draft regulations will be made available to us. Yet over seven months since the legislation was first introduced, we still have not sighted the draft regulations, nor have approaches been made by the government to consult us on their make-up.
We are concerned that the witnessing, proof of identity and citizenship and hand lodgment of enrolment application provisions and requirements will prove so laborious and unreasonable that people are disfranchised or deterred from pursuing their eligibility. The government's motives behind these provisions are driven more than by unfounded paranoia that there is widespread electoral fraud. They are also motivated by a real desire, we know, to improve the integrity of the electoral rolls. But this is just a sledgehammer to crack a walnut at this stage. The provisions will lead to an enormous rise in bureaucratic procedures, and will cost $3.9 million annually. We believe that such funds would be better spent on habitation reviews. Cut the paranoia: what you need to do is put up or shut up; you have not produced substantial material or information to impugn the integrity of the current system. It is a paranoid and delusional fear. 
 It is really interesting that the parliament secretary cited Senator Minchin and quoted him—
—He is a very good minister.
—There is no doubt on my part that he is a very good minister and one of the few competent ministers that this government has. But the fact is that he is a party apparatchik and that is what these amendments are being driven by—party apparatchiks, and seeking gain for the Liberal Party. Government members are clothed in the `integrity of the roll' and `we're worried about this and that.' As I have said before, let us have the material; let us see the widespread fraud. Let us see the material from the Electoral Commission to show that there is systemic, systematic and widespread fraud and abuse of the electoral system. There is not. We concede that the odd individual is manipulating the system, but not to the extent that these sorts of provisions should be brought in.
 The government talk about red tape in small business and say they are not the government for red tape—but they are producing red tape everywhere. Our concern is that this will result in the disfranchising of genuine electors. Those electors might be a bit sloppy, but what are we going to have now? Are we going to get to the stage where Aboriginal people—indigenous people—have to go to the police station and have their enrolment form witnessed by a police officer? That is not an inducement for them to get on the electoral rolls.

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—If I correctly heard the shadow minister, he conceded that these amendments were directed towards improving the integrity of the electoral roll. He seemed to suggest that there was no widespread evidence of fraud or abuse of the system and that, because he claims that there is no evidence of such widespread abuse or fraud, the government ought not to proceed with these amendments which dot i's and cross t's and improve the integrity of the 
 electoral roll. There is nothing in the amendments being proposed—
Mr Melham interjecting—
—I will come to that. There is nothing in the proposed amendments about which the opposition or anyone should be concerned. They are designed to make sure that people who get on the roll are people who are entitled to be on the electoral roll. I outlined before that we have an honour system and that people are able to fill in any number of enrolment cards and automatically get placed on the electoral roll. All we are saying is that, with respect to new electors, they ought to produce an item of identification to prove that they do in fact exist—to prove that they are not a nom de plume, to prove that they are persons eligible to be on the electoral roll. What is wrong with that?
The member for Banks seems to be suggesting that this amendment is not in fact necessary, because he is claiming that there is no widespread evidence of abuse. But the fact is that this is a further mechanism to enhance the correctness of the electoral roll. Why does he object to the need for people to show some item of identification when seeking to take the very important step of becoming an elector of the Commonwealth of Australia?
These days people have to provide 100 credit points to open an account with the Commonwealth Bank. They have to provide all sorts of evidence to get an Australian passport and, as they go through life, they have to produce evidence of the fact that they are a real person, that they do exist and that they are not a nom de plume. How much more important is getting on the electoral roll than simply opening an account with the Commonwealth Bank or getting a passport or applying for a social security pension?
The fact is that getting on the electoral roll is one of the most important actions which any Australian can take at any time in his or her life.
—Next you'll want voluntary voting.
—I do support the principle of voluntary voting, as the shadow minister 
 knows, but that is not included in this bill and it is another issue.
The shadow minister also drew to my attention the matter of regulations. It is obvious that, under our parliamentary system, regulations can be disallowed if indeed they are not approved of by the parliament, so the regulations will be available when we are good and ready. The honourable member for Banks and his colleagues, along with everyone else, will have the opportunity of looking at them, and there are certain courses of action that they can take if they are not in fact happy with what is being proposed by the government.
Included in these amendments are everyday changes that will enhance the integrity of the electoral roll. I know I repeat that over and over again, but it is important to stress to the Australian people that this government is all about ensuring that our electoral roll has integrity and that those people who are on it are in fact entitled to be electors of Australia. For those reasons—very compelling reasons, I am sure you will agree—we oppose the amendments being put forward by the honourable member for Banks.

These amendments omit items 44 and 45 and relate to funding disclosure and thresholds. Isn't it interesting that what we need from the government in their paranoia is proof positive on a whole range of things? They are putting up all these barriers and saying that we should have all these regulations, most of which are about disfranchising, before we can get on the roll. But when it comes to transparency and disclosures as to who are behind it, who are disclosing and who are funding, it is a different ball game, a different set of rules. There is obfuscation, the setting up of freedom funds and a whole range of other things. We are not ever really to know who is funding the members of the coalition, because they 
 come up with every loophole in the book and resist every amendment in the book in terms of full disclosure.
What we are doing is trying to stop the coalition, because under items 44 and 45 they are basically attempting to weaken disclosure. That is a policy that they have consistently pursued for the past 15 years. The ALP is of the view that these increases in electoral funding disclosure thresholds would allow for significant sums of money to go without disclosure. Even the Australian Electoral Commission does not support these measures; they have been driven by the Liberal Party federal secretariat. In their submission to the Senate inquiry into this legislation, the AEC, in regard to thresholds for reporting of donations, said:
The AEC advised against such changes in a submission to the JSCEM inquiry into the conduct of the 1996 federal election.
During the Senate inquiry into this legislation, the head of funding and disclosure at the AEC conceded the following:
The way that a donor can make such a large donation without being disclosed is by donating up to the threshold to each state and territory branch of a political party. So, for a party that is organised nationally in every state and territory plus with a national secretariat, you are looking at nine separate identified parties, in effect, for disclosure purposes.
A donor can make separate donations to each of those parties. Because they are not aggregated across the party across Australia, only within each state and territory, they will not be disclosed. So . . . they could donate $4,999 a year to each state and territory branch of a political party and go undisclosed. That would add up to just short of $45,000.
The AEC has also conceded there are a number of other ways in which donors could split their donations so they would not be disclosed—for example, by each member of a family or a company donating up to the disclosure limit. The coalition's tacit approval of the Greenfields Foundation rort does nothing to inspire confidence in the arguments they have brought to bear in the case of these clauses.
The Labor Party will be pursuing further amendments in the Senate to close, once and for all, the Greenfields rort. The Labor Party 
 has always advocated very tight and transparent funding and disclosure provisions, and we will oppose these items, driven by the Liberal Party national secretariat, to undermine the integrity of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.
We do not want the best politicians that money can buy. That is what these provisions are about. They are about having the carpetbaggers and the bagmen in corporate Australia and other sections being able to disclose without being exposed. We want transparency, honesty and openness in the electoral process. These are very dangerous amendments. They are aimed at hiding the donors to the conservatives.
Frankly, in modern Australia I think more disclosure and more transparency are required, not these tricks that the government come up with to hide their donors, their $1,000 a head lunches where they get a whole range of people together—a bit of openness, a bit of honesty and a bit of integrity.
You talk about the integrity of the roll. What about the integrity of disclosing the puppeteers, the people who pull the strings behind the Liberal and National parties? If there is nothing wrong, then you should not be frightened as to who is funding. If they are not getting favours in return, then you should not have a problem in disclosing who they are. Or are they the same people that are getting the contracts when they are outsourced? Is that what you are frightened of, that your donors are the ones that are taking the government jobs?

"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—I want to immediately rebut any suggestion that donors to the Liberal Party are in some way receiving outsourcing contracts because they are donors to the Liberal Party. We are a party that has always supported openness, honesty and integrity in politics.
I believe there is a general understanding across the political spectrum that there ought to be disclosure and that the community is entitled to know who is funding political parties. The difference between the government and the opposition with respect to these amendments is really a matter of degree. We 
 both now accept the firmly entrenched idea in the Australian community that, indeed, there ought to be openness and disclosure.
The thresholds included in the  Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  are simply updating the thresholds to more realistic values as we approach the turn of the century and the new millennium. They also seek to relieve the unnecessary administrative burden placed on often voluntary party officials.
I also think it is a bit rich for the honourable member for Banks to refer to `the carpetbaggers and the bagmen' when one looks at the way the Labor Party over the years has been funded through huge donations from the union movement. It is interesting that many members of the unions included in that union movement do not support the Labor Party; yet, despite that, the unions send their members' contributions, against their will, across to the Australian Labor Party.
There was some reference made to the attitude of the Australian Electoral Commission to these amendments. I think it is widely recognised in the Australian community that the Australian Electoral Commission is a highly professional, very competent body which has a world-class capacity to run elections. Indeed, when the South African elections were held following the settlement in that country, I was pleased to hear that the Australian Electoral Commission had a role to play in assisting South African citizens in this country to cast a vote in the South African elections.
It is also undeniable that the Australian Electoral Commission is not the government of this country and that it was the government of this country which was given a mandate by the Australian people to govern Australia for the next three years. The Electoral Commission may well have had views on certain aspects of the legislation, but at the end of the day it is the government which brings legislation forward to the parliament. This legislation is fair and reasonable. It updates the thresholds to more realistic values and it relieves the unnecessary administrative burden placed on political parties and, indeed, in 
 many cases on the voluntary officials of those political parties.
Also, there was a suggestion that, because we have state and territory branches, one is able to aggregate the amounts and that somehow this would mean those figures which were not disclosed would be substantially higher than would apparently be the case. But, even if you did that, that is not going to buy an election, that is not going to provide for fraud, because in the overall scheme of things we are still talking about relatively small amounts of money. I also want to place on record that the Liberal Party and the National Party have always scrupulously observed the law of disclosure and have always scrupulously observed the law of this land.
These amendments make an important change by updating thresholds to realistic values, and the legislation before the chamber improves the integrity of the electoral system. The ALP will pay a heavy price at the next election for refusing to support the ongoing moves of the government to make sure that the result of an election, as declared following a poll, is what the Australian people want.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I am pleased that in the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  the government has taken up a number of Labor's suggestions, in particular our suggestion to include fringe benefits in the assessment of income of entitled carers and liable parents. This will help to ensure that both parents are assessed more fairly in accordance with their respective need and capacity to pay. On the other hand, the government's refusal to support Labor's amendment to increase the maintenance income test threshold in the Social Security Act is far from pleasing.
This bill will have the effect of reducing the child support income of some carers. There will be some compensation in the form of an 
 increase in the level of family allowance, but this will not provide full compensation. Our amendment sought to provide some further compensation, particularly for carers at the lower end of the income scale. It would have gone some way towards ameliorating the effect of the bill on children whose families will receive less child support.
However, the government declined to support our amendment, claiming that it had achieved the right balance between payers, payees and the social welfare contribution. It seems to me that this is just another way of saying that the government was simply not prepared to take responsibility for ensuring that the measures contained in this bill did not hurt carers and their children.
The Labor Party absolutely supports the need to make the child support system as fair as possible, as a responsible government should never act with anything but the welfare of our nation's children uppermost in its mind. We believe also that there remains room for further improvement in this scheme.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,32,1

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I want to make the point that the passage of the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  has taken an extraordinarily long time.
—That point was made in your speech on the second reading.
—I just want to emphasise the point. It was a tad disappointing that, when the bill was reintroduced, we were allowed only one opposition speaker prior to its going to the Senate. I think I need to make the point also that the bill and the Senate amendments are hardly going to stir the hearts of those who are caught up in the child support scheme. 
I noticed that during the debate in the Senate, particularly in relation to the proposed changes to the family allowance, the responsible minister bemoaned the fact that it was going to cost consolidated revenue an additional $8 million. I find this quite derisory, given that the bill itself makes consolidated revenue the overwhelming winner. This bill reduces Commonwealth expenditure; in fact, consolidated revenue wins between $30 million and $40 million through this bill.
There is a great deal of dishonesty in the way the government has proposed some of its changes; for example, in proposing that the paying parent's exempt income be increased by 10 per cent. At no time has the government been prepared to share with the people of Australia the modelling information which presumably would underpin such a change and would allow the government to argue that this is a superior approach to the 20 per cent recommended by the joint committee. I am not trying to stand on my dignity and say that we should always be locked in by the 20 per cent recommendation, but at the very least you would have thought we could have seen some of what must have underpinned, presumably, the government's thinking on this matter. There is no way that that has been done. The very best that has been done is to model a couple of family instances to show what the impact of the changes will be. They are going to be very minimal, I have got to tell you.
With regard to the amendments that the Senate has moved, I congratulate the Senate not on the fringe benefits amendment but on that relating to the making of reckless and misleading statements—
—Your congratulating the Senate would be a first, wouldn't it?
—I am always prepared to give credit where credit is due. I am prepared to give credit to the government for making some changes. Along with all those involved in child support, I am really disappointed at the timorous nature of these changes and the lack of explanation. I want to make the point that one of the most consistent complaints you hear is about the ability of either party to make reckless and misleading statements to 
 the Child Support Agency. Of course, that was the subject of a recommendation by the committee. I am very pleased to see it being taken up. It will have some immediate and significant benefit. I will reserve my remarks on fringe benefits for when we come to that section.
Again, the committee recommended that the residential parent should have the exempt income reduced to the pension cut-off level, not as a maximum but as a minimum, but the government has decided to take another level. This may very well be the most appropriate thing to do, but the real tragedy is that neither the opposition nor the people of Australia have been given any indication as to why that should be so.

Part 1—Amendment of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989
1  Section 5
	 Insert:
 reportable fringe benefits total  has the meaning given by subsection 158A(3).
2  At the end of subsection 38A(1)
	 Add: 

	 ; and (c)	 the liable parent's reportable fringe benefits total (if any) for the year of income.
3  After section 158
	 Insert:
158A  Disclosure of reportable fringe benefits total
	 (1)	 This section applies if one or more fringe benefits are provided in relation to a year of tax in respect of the employment by an employer of an employee who is a liable parent.
	 (2)	 The liable parent must notify the Registrar, in accordance with the regulations, of the reportable fringe benefits total of the liable parent for the year of income ending on the first 30 June after the end of the year of tax.
	 (3)	 The  reportable fringe benefits total  of the liable parent for the year of income is the amount worked out in accordance with the regulations, taking account of the value (worked out in accordance with the regulations) of the fringe benefit or fringe benefits (other than a fringe benefit of a kind that is prescribed by the regulations).
	 (4)	 An expression used in this section and in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986  has the same meaning in this section as it has in that Act.
	 (5)	 This section applies in relation to a liable parent who is an employee of the Commonwealth, or of an authority of the Commonwealth described in paragraph (e) of the definition of  employer  in subsection 136(1) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 , as if the Commonwealth or the authority were an employer for the purposes of that Act.
	 (6)	 This section applies in relation to a benefit that is an exempt benefit because of section 57A or 58 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986  and would be a fringe benefit apart from those sections as if it were a fringe benefit for the purposes of that Act.
	 (7)	 This section does not require notification of a reportable fringe benefits total for a year of income before the 1999-2000 year of income.
158B  Penalty for failure to notify reportable fringe benefits total accurately
	 (1)	 A person must pay the Registrar a penalty of the amount worked out under subsection (2) if: 

		 (a)	 section 158A requires the person to notify the Registrar of the person's reportable fringe benefits total for a year of income; and
		 (b)	 the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income is at least 10% greater than the amount that the person notified the Registrar under section 158A was the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income.
	 (2)	 The amount of the penalty is 10% of the difference between:
		 (a)	 the administrative assessment of child support based on the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income; and
		 (b)	 the amount that was or would have been the administrative assessment of child support based on the amount that the person notified the Registrar under section 158A was the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income.
	 (3)	 If a person is required by section 158A to notify the Registrar of the person's reportable fringe benefits total for a year of income and does not do so as required by that section, this section operates as if the person had notified the Registrar under that section that the person's reportable fringe benefits total for the year of income was a nil amount.
	 (4)	 The penalty is a debt due to the Commonwealth, payable when the administrative assessment mentioned in paragraph (2)(a) is made.
	 (5)	 The Registrar may make an administrative assessment of child support for the purposes of this section at any time.
	 (6)	 The Registrar may remit penalty payable under this section if he or she thinks it is fair and reasonable to do so.

Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989
4  Section 5 (definition of  reportable fringe benefits total )
	 Repeal the definition, substitute:
 reportable fringe benefits total  for a year of income for a person who is an employee (for the purposes of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 , whether it applies of its own force or because of the Fringe Benefits Tax (Application to the Commonwealth) Act 1986 ) means the employee's 
 reportable fringe benefits total (as defined in the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 ) for the year of income.
5  Section 158A
	 Repeal the section.
Explaining it very briefly, this is the fringe benefits tax submission. When this amendment was mooted in the House, when the bill was originally debated, the minister indicated to the House:
The government supports the principle of counting fringe benefits in assessing child support payments, but we are not anxious to deal with this matter in isolation. The government proposes to address this issue as part of the wider reform of the fringe benefits tax arrangements. The tax reform package will provide for fringe benefits to be included on group certificates and therefore to be included in income for child support purposes.
Since then the tax reform package has been introduced into the House. In the interest of getting this bill passed, we have agreed to amend the bill in this way. The provision will take effect from 1 July 2000 at the same time as other elements of the tax reform package.
The member for Chifley made reference in an earlier intervention to the time allowed for debate of this bill. It has, of course, been around a long time. It was in the previous parliament earlier this year and because of the dissolution of parliament has had to be reintroduced and debated and voted on. We are now anxious to get the bill in place so that its provisions can start to operate. For these reasons we have decided to go quietly, as it were, on the fringe benefits tax provision which was one that we were taking into account anyway and support in principle.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,32,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—This is an amendment to the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998  that was moved by the opposition in the Senate and came in a form unacceptable to the House. I would like to thank the government for picking up this initiative. However, I need to just place on record a few observations. In terms of repairing the income base, of their own volition they have picked up negative gearing. At the urging of the opposition they are now looking at fringe benefits. But there was a 
 whole raft of other proposals in the report to repair the income base.
The point that I would also like to make, of course, is that using taxable income is becoming increasingly less appropriate in terms of trying to determine people's capacity to pay. As we see the phenomenon of salary sacrifice really taking off, unless we are able to have these things adequately quantified then, of course, people will be able to obviate their payment.
I would like to point out to the parliamentary secretary that the abuse of trusts, the transfer of property, and a whole raft of other proposals that were in the original report have yet to be adequately addressed. The report, of course, was always a balanced one but I would point out that the failure of the government to act in repairing the income base in terms of child support in a much more breathtaking way really affects those people who have residency—that is, the parent who has the residency of the children.
I just want to say that I agree with the parliamentary secretary that it did take a long time to go through the House. I want to place on record that it is now some four years since the report was originally delivered. The recommendations in terms of changes to the formula were on the basis of the barest minimum necessary to restore some fairness and equity. Quite frankly, now some four years after the report, I think we need to seriously move on in relation to child support and try to develop approaches which are fair and equitable to children and parents.
I want to place it on record that, prior to the last election within my party, I sought to seek a provision in reviews which would have allowed a departure on the basis of discrimination against children. If that departure were sought, it would allow the household income of both parents to be examined. Then if it were, on reasonable balance, clear that a child or group of children in one household were able to be less supported than in another, we would allow a departure. If we are looking at all the anomalies in child support, it is this area of second, third and fourth families that is the most contentious and, indeed, the most urgent. 
I would hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in closing the debate in this House—I do not propose to speak again—would indicate to the House what might be the timetable for further changes to the Child Support Scheme and, indeed, what might be the process of reform to the Child Support Scheme. She might indicate those things to the House, because I can assure her of one thing: whilst I am happy to concede that there are some improvements in this bill, we are not going to be able to satisfy either ourselves or people caught up in the Child Support Scheme that all the reforms that need to be undertaken are undertaken.
I have one regret, and that is that the processes of this House really do not permit a more bipartisan approach. Just as there are quite a number of opposition members wanting to see further reform of the Child Support Scheme, it is equally true that there are government backbenchers that want to see further reform. We will be derelict in our duty if we do not take that challenge up in this parliament.",REPS,<title>CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,32,1
"Sullivan, Kathryn, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—I will break my own golden rule and debate the issue after all, having objected earlier to the debate being broadened. I will just respond very briefly; I am not in the position that the minister would be to respond to the specifics raised by the member for Chifley.
One of my very earliest experiences in parliament was to debate the Family Law Bill in the Senate in 1975. I remember very well that there was a Senate report that was very germane to that debate. The then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, had brought in a couple of versions of the bill and the version that came in post the 1974 election rejected a very large number of the Senate committee's recommendations. Members of the committee moved amendments in line with all that committee's recommendations, and on every occasion the recommendations in the Senate committee's report actually prevailed in a free vote in the Senate. It is a little bit different, of course, when you get 
 into Child Support Agency arrangements. It is not the same as actually voting on the substance of the Family Law Bill itself.
I acknowledge the great sincerity with which the member for Chifley approaches this matter and his very long experience. I mentioned my experience of having been one of those who actually debated and voted on the Family Law Bill, as it was in 1975. I just say that I too have been around this subject for a very long time—from the institution of the Family Law Bill to the institution of the Child Support Agency and so on. I know it is an area that is absolutely fraught.
When you get into the matter of personal relationships between husband and wife, or ex-husband and ex-wife, where children are involved the passions run very deep. I think it is a very good example of how inadequate any legislative system is to address some very real human problems.
It is first and foremost our responsibility, as legislators in the national parliament, to make sure that we provide a good framework for marriage and families, whether that be formal marriage or not, I suppose, in these days. But I believe that always the number one concern of this parliament has been the welfare of children and to protect them appropriately when passions run rather strongly, as they do in the breakdown of relationships, particularly if a parent is going to be substantially separated from a child—parent-child attachments being what they are.
I have always had a great deal of sympathy for parents in that position. I do have a lot of sympathy for a lot of male parents who tend to not be the custodial parents. I am not saying that I have more sympathy for them than I do for the mothers, but I do have sympathy for them because they find themselves in situations they had not anticipated. The situations become extraordinarily difficult, emotionally and financially, on both sides.
We must do the best we can. I do not think anybody in the parliament has an axe to grind on this issue. We must approach it as fair-mindedly as we can and do the best we can for all parties, particularly with the welfare of children in mind.
I take on board the contribution yet again of the member for Chifley. It is, as always, a valuable contribution. I take on board also the contribution made by the committee in undertaking the inquiry and in taking evidence from a lot of people who I am sure were in significant pain when they appeared before the committee. I thank the committee for bringing together all that information in an orderly way before the parliament. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to do all the things that a parliamentary committee recommends.
The government has honestly addressed the issue. The passage of this bill will be a further step in refining what I well recall the minister at the time—Minister Howe—saying. He said that he knew it was an imperfect attempt to address the issue of child support and that that first attempt would undoubtedly be revisited on a number of occasions in the future as we attempted to improve it. It will probably be revisited yet again in the not too distant future. We all must strive in this terribly important area, as I have already said, to do our very best.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1998  amends the 1992 act following the signing of a new ANTA agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories to apply for the period 1998-2000. It also clarifies the exemption of ANTA from state and territory taxes to which the Commonwealth is not subject.
On the issue of tax, I note that the government intends to make some, but not all, vocational education and training courses GST-free. In keeping with its narrow view of education and its lack of understanding about the need for lifelong learning, this government 
 intends to tax so-called hobby courses. This approach ignores the fact that the needs and capacities of adult learners vary enormously and the most recreational of courses may be the only way back into formal education for some.
On top of that is the issue of the costs that institutions will face in administering the new tax. This matter was raised in the Vos committee's report, which recommended that the education sector share in the funds earmarked for the business sector to assist with compliance costs.
The education sector will face significantly increased costs through the GST. The sector, generally, is not subject to wholesale sales taxes. Unlike in the business sector, the GST will not relieve educational institutions of other taxes. It will instead impose an entirely new layer of administration which will further diminish their capacity to provide education and training on top of the direct cuts to funding already inflicted by the Howard government.
There is also the fact that students will face increased costs in terms of books, computer software, Internet use and other study requisites. Nothing could sum up this government's backward looking attitude better than the fact that it is prepared to put a tax on learning.
This bill also amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 to supplement the 1998 and 1999 amounts for price movements and to add to the general pool of funding the amount previously separately identified for off-the-job training for traineeships.
Vocational education and training is important to Australia. It enrols far more students than higher education. It is a major access point for adult education and life-long learning. Significant numbers of university graduates enrol in TAFE courses to finetune their skills for employment. Enrolments in vocational education and training have grown from 952,000 in 1988 to almost 1.5 million last year. In 1997, VET catered for 48,200 students with a disability, 38,500 indigenous students and 252,000 students who were born outside Australia. But education and training are not valued by the Howard government or 
 recognised for their contribution to Australia's prosperity.
The attack on vocational education by the coalition began early, in its first budget, in 1996, when the government announced $160 million in funding cuts, including the abolition of growth funding, which had been provided by the previous Labor government. For good measure, the Howard government also cut nearly $13 million from ANTA's operating expenses. This was followed, in 1997, by a further $72 million cut labelled as `benchmarking efficiencies'. God save us from benchmarking efficiencies!
The government has been keen to put in place a new ANTA agreement because the agreement negotiated by the former Labor government, as part of its major overhaul of vocational education and training in the early part of this decade, committed the Commonwealth to providing growth funding on a continuing basis. The Howard government recognised that it had to scrap Labor's agreement and replace it with one which reflected the coalition's narrow, mean-spirited and short-sighted approach to skilling Australia.
The prospect of a new ANTA agreement was first raised by the current Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs in a media release on 8 June 1997. In that release the minister claimed that TAFE places would increase by 500,000 over five years. He also said that the new agreement would lead to a major upgrade of the TAFE system. Needless to say, these claims have not come to fruition. They turned out to be another typical example of this minister's mix of extravagant rhetoric and bodgie statistics.
The minister for education's media release was titled `$4.5 billion TAFE deals for states and territories'. It did not take the states and territories long to work out that there was not much in this new deal. In fact, on 28 August 1997—
Mr Barresi interjecting—
—Look, if you do not believe what I say about Dr Kemp, just have a listen to what Victoria's minister for training, Phil Honeywood, had to say about your favourite minister for education. He called the proposed 
 agreement with the Commonwealth `the biggest cost shift to the states since Federation'. That was your own Victorian minister, a state Liberal minister.
This cost shift involved the Commonwealth withdrawing from growth funding for vocational education and training at a time when unmet demand for TAFE places was some 35,000 a year. All future growth was to be funded by so-called efficiencies made by the states and territories. Discussions continued acrimoniously for months and, on 22 August, the state and territory training ministers issued a joint communique expressing their concern that the Commonwealth's declining one-third share of VET funding was inadequate to meet the demands of a truly national system which was internationally competitive.
Memorable contributions were made to the debate about the minister for education's performance by a number of state Liberal colleagues which I am sure will be of great interest to members on the government side of the House. Comments were made by people such as the Victorian minister, Minister Honeywood, who said—just as the minister walks into the chamber; I am sure he is keen to be reminded about Minister Honeywood's remarks about him—and this is a Liberal minister:
Kemp, just to get headlines, goes out after each ministers meeting and hits us with another bombshell that we have not agreed on.
He also said:
I feel that this is a betrayal of trust.
That is what his own Liberal colleagues say about the minister for education—a betrayal of trust and the greatest cost shift since Federation from the Commonwealth to the states. The comments seem to sum up the tone of the meetings and the negotiations as they unfolded, month after month.
The new agreement was eventually finalised in April this year. The first thing to note about it is that it covers only a three-year period, not the five as originally trumpeted by the minister in his typical press releases.
Labor believed that ANTA was the way to make sure that additional federal funding was placed into our TAFE colleges to lift the level 
 of training for young Australians, to make sure that they got the training that they needed to ensure that Australia was better positioned to develop sustainable jobs and growth in years to come. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I scarcely feel like making a speech that is part of the normal parliamentary process after we have had all our endeavours put into perspective by the motion which has just been passed. Nevertheless the business of the House must proceed, and therefore I have raised this matter of public importance.
There is a strange, almost schizophrenic disjunction between the two propositions of the Treasurer's handling of his tax legislation yesterday and his noting of the fact that, after 
 three years in office, the government has finally caught up with the growth rates that they had inherited. He understands thoroughly, and so does the Prime Minister, that the relative strength of the Australian economy in relation to the region around us is, in very large measure, a product of the changes put in place by the previous government during the 1980s.
Take the removal of managed currency: can you imagine the crises that would have afflicted this government and this country over the course of the past 18 months if we had left the arrangements associated with the Australian currency where we had inherited them from John Howard? Can you imagine the crises which this country would have confronted over the past 18 months if we had left the financial sector in the shape it had been in when we inherited it from John Howard? Can you imagine the crisis which would have confronted this country if we had had the narrow base for our exports—in terms both of the location to which they went and their character—that we inherited from the previous government when we came into office? Can you imagine what our growth rates would now be, were that to have been the case?
Further, can you imagine what those growth rates would have been if we had managed to sustain, during the course of the first two years of the Howard government, the level of growth that we had had? That growth was reduced entirely as a result of completely unnecessary fiscal manoeuvres by them—fiscal manoeuvres directed not so much at the proper management of the economy as directly at the prejudices of the Liberal party.
Given all of that, we find some other oddities in this curious disjunction as the Treasurer boasts of finally achieving the Labor government's level of growth after three years. He also had, in the remarks he made in question time today, words of praise for the Chinese. He might have added to that the Americans. What makes Australia, China and the United States unique among APEC powers? What makes them unique in contemporary Asian circumstances, apart from the fact that they are the only powers enjoying 
 good growth? What makes us unique is that all of us fail to have a goods and services tax.
The country that we look to now to pull much of Asia—and itself, at the same time—out of the crisis that it is in is Japan. What did we find yesterday but the leader of a Japanese political party now formally joining the governing coalition of Japan—a leader whose principal argument for the recovery of the Japanese economy is that they should remove the Japanese goods and services tax left at five per cent. He says, `There will never be recovery in Japan until we remove the goods and services tax.' He has just joined the Japanese government. Why should this be so? The simple reason is this: we have enjoyed a comparative advantage in the fact that our service industries are not taxed. Our great growth industry of tourism is not taxed.
We have enjoyed enormous growth extending from the fact that small business and, in particular, microbusiness have been great generators of employment in this country over the last decade or so. They have done that, in part at least, because they are not tax agents of the government, and now they will be. Now they will be tax agents of this government, to their very great detriment. The coalition have discovered one or two things. You can have a bit of triumphalism when you first put down your legislation, but that is your best day, because what starts to happen from that point on is the cold realisation of what it means.
It was interesting to hear those accountancy firms coming out today saying, `This tax is a bit more complex than we thought. This tax is going to be a little harder to implement than we thought. This tax is in fact not as simple as the New Zealand tax in its administration'—though we would question whether or not that was all that simple—`and this is going to impose considerable burdens upon those in business, particularly those who do not have well catered-for accountancy arrangements. This is going to impose some very substantial burdens upon them.'
So the first set of families who are going to be impacted upon by this tax are those hundreds of thousands of families who operate those microbusinesses which make up about 
 50 per cent of small business in this country, where the accountant of the business is effectively mum or dad who are working at night to put the processes of that business together. Most of them are working in their businesses 14 or 15 hours a day anyway. They have received a new title, an unpaid title, a new role, a new job in Australian society—that is, tax collector of this government. They will receive new impositions in relation to it because one thing that the Treasury of this nation understands is this: a goods and services tax breeds non-compliance.
In Europe, for example, at the present time, the black economy, which is largely an economy determined as being black by virtue of its evasion of the goods and services tax, has already reached a level of the size of the entire British gross domestic product. That is what the level of tax evasion is in Europe as far as that is concerned. The British Treasury came out recently and said that, invariably, governments overestimate receipts from a goods and services tax because, over the last 10 years, non-compliance has become rife and it is an extraordinarily difficult tax to enforce. This will now be the experience of small business in this country: firstly, a great imposition and, secondly, an extraordinarily intrusive mechanism of enforcement as the Australian Treasury grapples desperately, as the hired agent now of the states, to ensure that those very inflated dollars in the government's propositions will be met.
That is the problem for the families in small business. What about the problems for the rest of our families and our pensioners? Contemplate this: the government boasts that its tax package, on balance, benefits families. That is based on a number of assumptions, which I do not think a commonsense approach to any aspect of family life in this country would accept. When it says that families are compensated more via changes in the income tax system and changes in family benefits—family payments; and when it says they are benefited more and can cope with this; it is based on this assumption, this fundamental calculation, that each kid in your family costs 
 you 30c a week additional as a result of these taxes.
In other words, somehow or other a tax which for the first time is going to come on all the fresh food that you buy, a tax which is for the first time going to come on all the services which are essential for you—the services when you fix up your plumbing, when you bring in an electrician, when you bring in somebody to affect your water supply in your house, that you obtain when you send your kids down to the corner to get their hair cut—along with food, clothing, school uniforms and shoes for the kids, will cost a family 30c a week per child. If that calculation is wrong, families in this community are going to have their living standards devastated by this tax which has been put on top of them.
This is a lifestyle tax. This is a tax which goes to the heart of every aspiration of every family for their children and themselves. What does a good parent do these days? A good parent these days seeks to engage their young folk in sporting and cultural endeavours in their community. They do it for many reasons—sometimes it is disciplinary, sometimes it goes with that dreadful phrase of `keeping them off the streets' and sometimes it goes with the concern that they have for their educational advance, for their physical attainment. For the first time in their lives, if they happen to be administering those affairs, they will experience the obligation of becoming a tax collector for the government and, whether or not they are responsible for the administration of those clubs and those other cultural activities, having to pay a goods and services tax on it. The lifestyle of parents is going to change dramatically.
The Treasurer is very proud when he gets up and says that there are anomalies in the wholesale sales tax—a tax which, whatever its faults, is actually universally collected; a tax which nobody seeks to avoid—but he is very proud when he gets up and says, `There are no anomalies in that.' Then, as we sit here in this place and stand to ask him questions on precisely the anomalies that he is creating, all he does is brush it off.
So, if you happen to be amongst the small group of families who send their kids to greater public schools—which provide truly excellent education for the people in this country who can afford it—you will find that, on the extra tuition that you get when you need remedial attention, on the sporting endeavours that are associated with those schools which can afford to run them effectively in-house, when you go and get your music lessons which you can get off the back of those school operations, when you get the musical instruments and the other things that you can borrow from those operations, there will be no tax.
On the other hand, if you happen to be a parent in the majority of Australian families and you seek private tuition, as many do, particularly in those run-ups to the crucial exams when there might be a weakness in mathematics or science or English or whatever, you are taxed. When you seek, because your school cannot provide it, the opportunity for music lessons out of school, you are taxed. When you seek an arrangement that is associated with some sporting endeavour out there because the school does not run after-hour tennis clinics or cricket clinics or whatever, you are taxed. This is a lifestyle changing tax when you look at those dimensions of it.
It is no wonder that there is still a growing dissent out there, a growing recognition and understanding that what we all really mean by education, what we are all concerned about in relation to education, is not exempt in the way the government has attempted to portray it, but a raft of anomalies have been created. If you fall on either side of the anomaly, you will find it most likely that if you have the least capacity to afford it you will fall on the side that is paying. If you have the most capacity to afford it, you will fall on the side that benefits most from the tax cuts. This is a scandalous situation for the ordinary Australian family.
Then we come to the issue of health. No claim of a government's has been more bogus than the claim that they have exempted health from this tax. The fact is that the vast bulk of health products that parents acquire for 
 themselves, currently totally untaxed, not caught up with the wholesale sales tax arrangements, will now for the first time be taxed in the pharmacies and sometimes in the supermarkets where these products are acquired. By a huge proportion, the bulk of those products which are now being acquired by parents are acquired not on prescription.
Parents will find that healthy living, healthy eating and healthy operations for their families are all now going to attract taxes for the very first time. And the government assumes that these new taxes are going to cost families 30c a week for every child in those families! The government assumes that the coverage which just meets it is going to be adequate to deal with the problems that Australian families confront. This government is going to find its triumphalism very much misplaced when the people of Australia have a chance to understand the impact of this tax on family life.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NP,1998-12-03,"—I can understand that the Leader of the Opposition would want to extend his time because he hasn't said anything in the first 15 minutes. It was a very lacklustre, disappointing performance from the Leader of the Opposition before a tired and demoralised backbench. He failed to fire up an even more lacklustre frontbench, most of whom are on the record in the past as being supporters of a GST.
The Leader of the Opposition scurries out of the House, not anxious to have his own record in this area exposed. It is clear that the Leader of the Opposition, a former supporter of the goods and services tax model, along with many of those who sit alongside him, are embarrassed now that they have to come into this place and try to present a different view.
The opposition leader's empty rhetoric is an attempt to hide some of his personal embarrassment at the outstanding economic performance of this government—the fact that this government has delivered real economic growth to Australia in spite of the difficult environment that surrounds us and the fact that this government has provided real taxation relief, real reductions in interest rates, a real chance for Australian industry through 
 better industrial relations reform and the like to deliver a much better Australia for us all to live in and enjoy. The opposition exposes its own policy vacuum with a whole pile of lacklustre, empty rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition.
It is perhaps extraordinary that Australia's economy has done so well considering the way in which it has been burdened by an old-fashioned taxation system. When you look around at the other countries that we share a wholesale sales tax with, countries like Botswana, Swaziland, the Solomon Islands and Ghana, they are not exactly the leading economies that one would imagine any progressive Australian political party would want to set up as models for a tax system for Australia. Of course, when I talk about progressive political parties one has to always exclude the ALP, which has very little in its bones that could be described as progressive. The coalition is proposing a radical reform of our tax system, something that will help provide the sort of incentive that Australian business needs to grow but also provide the sort of support Australian families need to build a better future for themselves and the children of this country.
Perhaps one of the great features of the coalition's new tax system is the way it lifts the burden of taxation from productive industry. It takes, for instance, $4½ billion off the cost of producing exports in Australia. Labor seems happy to impose these penalties upon those who earn the real wealth of our nation, those people who sell to other parts of the world the products of our farms, our factories, our mines and our educational institutions. These people ought to be encouraged because they produce the wealth that delivers the standard of living that all Australians want for our country. Yet Labor is happy to continuously impose a heavy burden of taxation on these people so they are taxed on these goods before they go overseas.
One of the remarkable things about the way we treat the exports of Australia is that we penalise them, under Labor's old tax system, to the tune of about $4½ billion by way of indirect taxes, but as soon as they go overseas, in almost every market in the world that 
 they enter, the first thing that happens is that a goods and services tax is imposed upon them. So they get taxed twice—two burdens, two levels of indirect tax.
On the other hand, goods coming into Australia come produced without the burden of indirect taxes in their own country, but when they get here, unless there is a tariff, duty or a wholesale sales tax imposed upon them, they are largely let in duty free. So we have a double penalty on Australian industry: we penalise their exports and we allow the imports in at an advantage.
These are the sorts of tax arrangements that ought to be swept aside by any progressive country and by any progressive party. That is why this government is putting before the parliament at the present time a reform of the tax system which will give our country a new chance, give our exporters a new chance, give our industry a new chance and give our families and the people of Australia a real chance.
One remarkable feature of this tax package, which is good for industry, good for business and good for exporters, is that it is also good for families. It is good for Australians. The income tax cuts that are being offered will benefit all families. The welfare benefit increases that are proposed will benefit all people receiving benefits. So there will be a great deal of confidence when the government says that every Australian will be better off under these new arrangements—every Australian who is paying their fair share of tax now will be better off under these new arrangements. This system ought to be warmly welcomed by all in this House, just as it was by the people of Australia at the recent election.
I will now look at some of the benefits that are included in the new tax system. There are income tax cuts by way of an increased tax-free threshold from $5,400 to $6,000 and significant cuts in all marginal rates except the top rate. So all Australian income tax payers will get a tax cut. A significant number of people will no longer pay tax because of the rise in the income tax-free threshold. In addition to that, all of the tax rates are re 
 duced, except the top rate—and you have to be earning $75,000 to pay any tax at that rate.
The remarkable feature of these new tax scales for Australian families is that, under the new arrangements, 81 per cent of Australians will not pay more than 30c in the dollar on any of the income that they earn. That is great for Australian families because Australian families will fall into the lower tax paying categories. They will all get significant tax cuts. All will be paying less tax than they have ever paid previously.
The other tremendous benefit of these new tax scales is that people will be able to earn extra money—they will be able to spend a little bit of extra time in their work earning a bit of extra overtime—without moving into a punitive new tax bracket. They will be able to keep more of the extra income that they earn. That provides an important incentive to earn more, to be more productive and to do the sorts of things that will help improve the quality of life of their family and their community.
So the cutting of the income tax rates benefits all families. In addition to that, families with dependent children will also get a new range of additional benefits. This government provided $1 billion worth of tax cuts for families at the beginning of last year. Now that $1 billion worth of tax cuts will be doubled—double the benefits for families and double the incentives and rewards for Australian families who earn some extra dollars to assist them with the cost of raising a family. We will be doubling the $1,000 tax-free threshold for each dependent child under the family tax initiative to $2,000—that is equivalent to $140 per year per child and a 70 per cent increase in assistance. We are doubling the extra $2,500 tax-free threshold for one-income families with a dependent child under the age of five to $5,000. That is equivalent to $350 per year per family, a 70 per cent increase in assistance—a dramatic improvement in the circumstances of families.
In addition, we are increasing the maximum assistance for child care for lower income families by $7.50 a week. We are removing some of the poverty traps in the current tax system that were left for us by Labor. These 
 circumstances include where the breadwinner is better off refusing a pay rise because the subsequent increased taxes, loss of social security benefits and the like can mean a lower take-home pay. That is the sort of system that Labor is arguing we should retain. That is what we are sweeping aside with these new tax reform arrangements.
One significant measure we are taking to remove these poverty traps is increasing the level of income at which family allowance begins to be income tested from $24,350 to $28,200 and easing the withdrawal rate from 50 per cent to 30 per cent. So families will get more family allowance and some families will get assistance where currently they get none. We will also be simplifying the complicated 12 separate family assistance payments into three payments and having them delivered through a single families office. Two of them will be tax related measures and the third a child-care benefit linked through Centrelink. These increased benefits will certainly help families.
Opposition members have from time to time shed crocodile tears expressing concern about the plight of the elderly, those on pensions and those with disabilities. This package is good news for all people receiving pensions and benefits because it contains two rock-solid guarantees from the government—rock-solid guarantees which are reflected in the legislation that has been brought into this House. The first is that up-front on 1 July pensions and benefits will be increased by four per cent. That is above the anticipated CPI increase as a result of the new tax system.
There will be a four per cent up-front increase in pensions. However, if perchance the government has its estimates wrong and the increase in the CPI is greater than Treasury and all the experts predict, there is a second guarantee—namely, that pensions and benefits will be kept at 1.5 per cent above the actual CPI rise associated with the new tax system. So pensioners and welfare beneficiaries can be absolutely assured about this double guarantee coming from the government. 
Again, let me contrast this guarantee from the coalition of a real increase in pensions and benefits that we took to the last election with what Labor offered. It is the party that on many occasions in government over 13 years ruthlessly increased taxes. On many occasions, it increased indirect taxes. Never did it offer any up-front compensation; there were never any compensation packages from Labor. The pensioners, the aged and the infirm all had to bear the cost of these increases in taxes.
In the recent election campaign, the story was exactly the same. There was no promise of pension rises from Labor. The only parties in the election campaign that offered real, guaranteed improvements in the standard of living for pensioners and welfare beneficiaries were the Liberal and National parties. We guaranteed a real pension increase. Families are better off under this new taxation package. So are those receiving welfare benefits, particularly the aged.
For the aged and retired, there is also the aged person saving bonus and the self-funded retiree supplementary bonus, which can offer benefits of up to $3,000 for people who are above retirement age or, in some instances, are dependent upon their own income for their day-to-day survival. A major reform that will benefit many self-funded retirees or those who live on a part pension is an easing of the taper in the pension test for the age pension. It will mean that thousands of Australians will become eligible for a pension for the first time and that all part-pensioners will receive more support. There will also be an increase in the pensioner tax-free rebate and low income aged persons rebate. They will be able to earn additional income without losing any of their benefits.
Another major measure that will benefit families in Australia—it is being proposed by the coalition and resisted by Labor—is the 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance. If ever there were a group in the Australian society that needed this 30 per cent rebate it is families and the aged. They are the ones who want the private health cover. They have been struggling and doing without so that they can maintain their premiums.
I would have thought that all these proposals would be unambiguously great news for families. However, Labor opposes them. Labor opposes these reforms because it has no vision for families. It has no concern about the need to improve their living standards; it has no desire to help Australian families in the important national task of raising the future generation and ensuring that it has a great start in life. This matter of public importance fails because of Labor's poor record in the past, its lack of policies for the future and its lack of concern for Australian families and those receiving benefits.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Families and Pensioners</title>,Matters of Public Importance,41,1
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—We have just heard from the Minister for Community Services some words that really have my sense of humour going. Captain Courageous Costello is leading us all on the boat to Utopia. For heaven's sake, what do you expect the community to think when everything, by your words, is just so absolutely perfect? You say, `Trust us, and we'll deliver you a world full of roses and butterflies.' That is not the reality. I can remember how in my childhood my dear old mum used to give me cod liver oil or castor oil and say to me, `C'mon Annette, this is good for you.' It is not good enough to say, `It's good for you.' You really have to get down to the facts.
This GST hits so many Australian families at a time when they are least able to pay higher prices on the basic necessities of life. Families spend more on food, clothing and housing than other groups in our community. Families with children spend up to 60 per cent of their income on food, clothing and housing. Couples without children spend about 30 per cent on those same items.
When children are very young, families are often relying on one income and have less ability to pay the higher costs that will be inevitably associated with a GST. The coalition's tax package estimates that the GST will add a measly little 30c per week to the cost of living for a family with one child and with an income between $30,000 and $65,000, yet it has the gall to stand here today and try to convince us and others that the compensation packages it talks about so bravely are adequate.
As the Leader of the Opposition said earlier in this debate today, it is 30c per week, and there is a list of items that that needs to cover. That 30c per week is supposed to cover all those extra costs that a GST will place on the raising of children. That 30c per week is to cover the extra costs of food, nappies, clothing, shoes, sporting activities, videos, haircuts, books, school uniforms and music lessons and so on. The amount is already well over 30c when I tally it up in my head. Does anyone really believe that 30c per week will be enough to cover the additional costs of the GST on raising a child?
The coalition's tax package underestimates that GST impact on raising children. It is not telling families the full story about how much extra a GST will cost them. I am not going to accuse it of perhaps telling a mistruth, but I am certainly going to say that it is not telling the full story.
Around 70 per cent of people over 65 rely on either a full or part age pension. Many of the remaining 30 per cent of non-pensioners are on low incomes compared with the rest of the community. These people are very sensitive to policy changes that affect their finances. They ask that the compensation for a GST be fair and adequate. I will quote briefly from a paper put together by the Council on the Ageing—an initial reaction it made in relation to the GST. This comment actually still stands very strongly:
One of COTA's concerns is that little attention has been paid in the tax package to government expenditure in important social programs and infrastructure. On the contrary, the package is based on the vast expenditure cuts which are included in forward estimates into the next century.
We are really talking about two edges of this sword that are going to affect those older people in our community. For those in receipt of a full age pension, the bottom line is that their pension should be increased to adequately cover the price effect of the GST. We also have to be especially mindful that the compensation is adequate for those people living in rural and remote areas. Food, transport, household services, repairs and energy are often far more expensive in those rural and remote areas.
 The Council on the Ageing, COTA, has serious concerns about the adequacy of the compensation package for older people on fixed incomes. The government has assumed a population wide consumer price index effect of 1.9 per cent from the GST, but COTA believes that this average CPI measure does not reflect the expenditure patterns of older people. Older people tend to spend more on food, health related items, and electricity and gas as a proportion of their income than the rest of us in the community.
Food and energy, as we know, are so far still going to be subject to the GST. Older people on low incomes spend around 28 per cent of their income on food compared with wage and salary earners spending around 18 per cent. The government's package, unfortunately, provides for only a four per cent increase in the maximum rate of age pension and all other social security payments. The coalition's pension increases are simply not enough to compensate the older people in our community for the cost of this GST.
I want to talk for a couple of moments about two specific areas about which I have special concern when we talk about those older members of our community. One of them is taxi fares. Many older people in their later years rely on taxis to get around. In some cases, when they become more frail, it is their only way of getting around in a secure and safe fashion. In some states and territories they have access to taxi vouchers. What is really worrying me is to what level will those voucher systems be eroded and what compensation packages have been put together—if any—to make sure that the true value of those voucher systems actually holds water as far as older people are concerned.
The other area which I am really very worried about is public housing and the level of rent that will be paid by those who receive pensions and who happen to be tenants of public housing. This matter was discussed in question time earlier this week and was also discussed in an MPI earlier this week, but I think we will need to continue to bring it up until those opposite take us seriously on this issue. We all know that state and territory housing authorities in general terms charge 25 
 per cent of income for pensioners for their rent, and the rest is rebated or is concessional rent by the state or territory authority concerned. Every time the pensioner's income goes up through that pension, they automatically lose a part of that to rent.
 In answer to a question earlier this week, the Prime Minister confessed that there was no plan—as far as I can ascertain from his answer—to address this particular instance. So, if those pensioners get this highly heralded four per cent increase as a compensation for the GST, a portion of it is going to immediately walk out of their wallets and into the bank accounts of state and territory housing authorities.
 I would like to take this opportunity to very strongly urge the federal government to take a bit of leadership on this: to go to COAG or to some other organisation between all of the governments and see what they can do about coming to some legislative arrangement where that will not happen, where the component of support received by the pensioners from the state and territory housing authorities stays as it is—because, believe you me, these pensioners are going to have enough trouble as it is to survive financially on this miserly four per cent, let alone having some of it walk right across the board and go straight off to the state and territory housing authorities. I cannot urge strongly enough the suggestion that COAG or some other mechanism ought to be used to examine it very carefully.
The saddest thing that I have heard in this place today, which affects families in every respect—at birth and at death—was the Treasurer saying that, unless you do burials, cremations or naming services in a religious fashion, you are going to pay GST. I think this is pathetic. It is discriminatory. It is the most appalling piece of policy admission that I have heard from the government to date.
I will be warning my constituents out there quick smart that, if they plan to die and they are going to be buried or cremated, they had better tell their families to bring in a priest or a minister straight away, otherwise they are going to incur a GST. If they have a baby and they decide not to christen it but to have a 
 naming service, then they had better change their mind because they are going to incur a GST. This is manic. I do not understand the logic behind it, and I do not understand how a government can proudly prance around in this chamber touting the fairness to families and pensioners when we use that as an example. It is an absolute outrage.
 I say in finishing that there is no way at all that any sane person in this country is going to understand any equity or fairness in this proposal from the government. It is outrageous. It is an assault on the financial independence of pensioners, of families and of those less well-off. It is an unfair and inappropriate move of the tax burden onto those who cannot afford to pay it. I do not care how often the Treasurer arrogantly comes into this chamber and pretends that he is that Captain Courageous leading us all onto the boat to Utopia. He is leading us to the boat of financial destruction on the part of our families and pensioners.

"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—About five minutes through the Leader of the Opposition's speech, I had to get the Notice Paper  and read what the MPI was, because I thought perhaps I had prepared myself for the wrong debate. For the first five minutes, the Leader of the Opposition took a tour around the world: we had economic crisis, we had currency issues, we had financial sectors, we had APEC. Indeed, it seemed like a five-minute apologia for something that had twigged him during question time rather than addressing the terms of the matter of public importance. He took seven minutes to get to families and, given my high regard for the Leader of the Opposition, I must say that I do not think I heard him mention pensioners very often at all during his speech.
—I did. We're a team.
—You are a team. You are the pensioner part. From the terms of the MPI, which I will endeavour to address, one would assume that the government was just introducing a goods and services tax—nothing more, nothing less. That has been the whole tenor of the assault that the Labor Party has attempted to mount on the government's platform. 
Far from being just a GST, what is actually being proposed is a complete overhaul of Australia's outdated, inefficient and unfair tax system. The Labor Party wants to overlook this fact for what I think are populist political reasons but also because it does not have the courage itself to undertake such reforms, even though it once knew, and possibly still in its heart of hearts knows, that it is necessary.
Yesterday the Treasurer introduced into this House, amongst a number of other bills,  A New Tax System (End of Sales Tax) Bill 1998 . I understand that it is a bill the Labor Party will probably vote against. This bill will abolish Australia's wholesale sales tax system and at one step remove taxes of 12 per cent, 22 per cent, 32 per cent and 45 per cent  on goods which are in the WST basket.
The government's tax reform plan will also see the abolition of a number of financial institution duties, bank account debits taxes, a range of stamp duties, and also Bob Carr's bed tax. It will end once and for all the ridiculous system where businesses pay tax on their business inputs, only to charge more tax on their business outputs.
The fact is that the government is not introducing a GST by itself. It is not just stacking it on top of the existing indirect tax system, nor is it applying the GST to everything—which is a phrase that flutters in and out of the Labor Party lexicon. A whole range of items are GST-free: health and medical services, pharmaceuticals, education, age care, child care, charitable activities and religious services. In many of these sectors the combination of the abolition of wholesale sales tax and the non-application of the GST will mean price reductions.
The bottom line on all this is that the Treasury's estimate of the overall impact on prices of abolishing the wholesale sales tax, the range of other indirect taxes and imposing a 10 per cent goods and services tax is a 1.9 per cent price increase. That was the Treasury estimate. But not to be daunted, Labor denied this estimate. During the election campaign, Labor took out press advertisements saying that the impact would be five times as much as the Treasury estimated. And Labor tried to use the household expenditure survey model 
 of the price impact, despite the fact that Labor itself back in 1992 had said that the household expenditure survey was not a reliable way of costing tax changes. John Dawkins, the then Treasurer, described the survey as `nothing more than statistical nonsense'.
But it is sometimes worth indulging the Labor Party's statistical nonsense, and the Treasurer has provided information on the HES estimates. Much to the distress and chagrin of the Labor Party, this showed that the effect on the cost of living across 11 different household groups at five different income levels varied between 1.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent, with an average of 1.8 per cent. On the basis of the HES, the impact was less on average than Treasury had estimated. For all that the Labor Party might rant and rave about 10 per cent on everything and impacts of five times what Treasury has estimated, their claims are simply unfounded.
Indirect tax reform is only one part of the comprehensive tax package and a compensation package which will provide significant benefits to all Australians, including families and pensioners. I would just like to address the compensation measures for pensioners. The fact is that even if the worst-case numbers in the HES are accepted, the compensation package still leaves pensioners ahead.
Compensation measures for lower income earners, including pensioners and self-funded retirees, include: the four per cent up-front increase in income support, comprising a 2.5 per cent up-front compensation in advance for the effect of the GST and other elements of the package, plus a 1.5 per cent real increase; a one-off savings bonus of up to $1,000 dollars for pensioners; more generous free areas and thresholds; the reduction of the pension income taper test; and generous increases in assistance for low income families. The fact is that after the four per cent increase it is likely that the single rate of pension will actually exceed 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings at July 2000.
I think it is also worth noting that the services provided to residents of nursing homes, hostels and hospices will be GST-free. Accommodation, medicines, dressings and 
 meals provided to residents in the course of their care will also be GST-free. And community care services provided to the elderly in their own homes will also be GST-free.
Families will benefit substantially through the tax reform package through a reduction in the marginal tax rates, an increase in the tax-free threshold from $5,400 to $6,000. Every family under a $50,000 income will have a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30 per cent, and 81 per cent of all taxpayers in Australia will have a top marginal rate of no more than 30 per cent. The family tax initiative will be doubled, with an increase in the tax-free threshold to $13,000 for families with children under the age of five. I could go on.
The bottom line of all this is that the Labor Party's claims of damage to pensioners and families are invalid, fraudulent, incorrect and a scare campaign. But if one really wants to talk seriously about the damage done to pensioners and families, the damage related to a GST, one has to look at Labor's past. At the 1993 election, the Labor Party campaigned on the basis of opposing a GST, promising a raft of tax cuts and not to put up taxes. Once the election was over, with the GST rejected and Labor returned on the basis of no GST, Labor went on to impose massive, uncompensated revenue measures—uncompensated tax increases—on all Australians. They were tax increases that were in breach of their election commitments, that hurt Australia's families and that hurt pensioners perhaps most of all. Now, on the basis of totally fraudulent claims about the price impact of a GST, on the basis of ignoring the compensation measures and the tax cuts, Labor is complaining about a tax package that will actually benefit pensioners and families.
If we really want to talk about the damage to Australia's families and pensioners, we should actually be focusing not on a whirlwind trip around the international economy, as the Leader of the Opposition did, but on Labor's attempt to deny them the coalition's 30 per cent health care rebate. This will benefit pensioners and families, even if they do not have private health insurance, by reducing the pressure on public hospitals. It will directly benefit 700,000 Australians with 
 private health insurance who have incomes of less than $20,000 a year. It will benefit well over one million families that have private health insurance.
When Labor show concern about low income earners, they should remember that they were the people who were punished by Labor's attack on private health insurance. The bottom line is that Labor's attack on the tax reform package is basically one designed to prevent a government keeping its commitment and meeting its mandate.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—Before question time interrupted debate on the Australian National Training Authority 
 Amendment Bill 1998 , I was mentioning some of the difficulties that the federal Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs had in negotiating the latest agreement on funding for ANTA and for TAFE colleges around the country. Perhaps this might be a convenient time to move the second reading amendment that is being circulated in the chamber now. I move:
That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:
(1)	 notes that Australia's future economic and social prosperity depends on a well resourced, quality education and training system; and
(2)	 condemns the Government for:
(a)	 refusing to provide growth funds to support Australia's vocational education and training needs;
(b)	 failing to meet its commitment to `enhance the role of TAFE' and `reinvigorate the TAFE system'; and
(c)	 imposing a GST which will make education and training more expensive and less accessible"".
Labor established the Australian National Training Authority structure in 1992 to develop and support a national system of vocational education and training which would meet Australia's needs into the next century. The then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, described the establishment of ANTA as a `root and branch change' to Australia's vocational education and training system. He said that the new agreement was `truly historic' and `would change the nature of vocational education in Australia for ever'.
I note that the present minister had a few comments to make at the time that the Keating government was introducing its reforms in vocational education and training. In the Australian of 7 October 1992, Dr Kemp, the member for Goldstein, is reported as having opposed the Labor government's `centralist and bureaucratic plans'. He apparently described the plan for a national competency based training scheme as `highly theoretical'. He is quoted as saying that the process would `create an enormous amount of paperwork and powerful pressures toward 
 uniformity without any coherent planning framework'.
The minister for education has since changed his views. In his second reading speech to this bill, the minister praises the use of nationally linked competency standards developed through training packages and speaks glowingly of `a truly national training system'. We are very pleased that the minister for education has seen the light at last on this issue, if not on many others.
The ANTA agreement was to be reviewed by the end of 1995. The review, conducted by Rae Taylor, found that the Commonwealth growth funding of $100 million in 1992 and subsequent annual increases of $70 million between 1993 and 1996 contributed to recurrent funding growth in real terms of around 20 per cent. The review found that activity increased significantly over that period, productivity improved and progress towards the Finn targets was on track but needed continued improvement and participation in order for the targets to be met by 2001.
Labor's ANTA agreement was a document of vision and purpose, of leadership by the Commonwealth and joint action by all parties. The states and territories signed up to what was effectively an agreement which would operate indefinitely with a commitment of continuing federal growth funding. But, under the new rules set by the Howard government, the states and territories would not consent to a five-year period for the operation of the new agreement, only three. They clearly viewed this new arrangement with something less than thorough enthusiasm. This is not surprising, given the tens of thousands of people who missed out on a TAFE place last year. All responsibility for future growth in places now rests on the shoulders of the states and territories. Growth through efficiencies means larger class sizes and fewer course offerings. It means closed and amalgamated TAFE colleges. It means a more difficult task for TAFE in seeking to fulfil its role as a major provider of adult and community education as well as entry level training.
It is interesting to note that the new National Strategy for Vocational Education and Training, which was agreed to at the 
 ministerial council on 22 May this year, covers a five-year period, yet the ANTA agreement—the formal, legal framework to deliver the strategy—is only for three years. This simply highlights the point that we have been making about the refusal of the states to sign up for five years of coalition conditions—five years of no commitment from the federal government to continuing growth in its funding contribution.
Another significant discrepancy between the agreement and the new national strategy relates to industry's contribution to the cost of training. While the agreement lists as one of its key objectives the need to increase investment in training by industry, the ANTA ministerial council specifically decided to change the wording of this objective in terms of the national strategy so that it became `to increase investment in training'. This can only be read to mean that industry has been absolved of its former responsibility to increase its own investment in training—as clearly spelt out in the previous wording.
TAFE graduates have a high level of labour force participation—71 per cent—which demonstrates their value to industry and the appropriateness of their skills. The Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee reviewed the ANTA agreement and reported in November 1995. One of that committee's recommendations was that the ANTA agreement specify what is meant by the term `industry' and that the agreement make more explicit what was expected of industry with respect to its responsibilities for shaping and contributing to the maintenance of the national training effort.
This has not happened. In fact, the new agreement, unlike its predecessor, does not mention industry's role. Some industries are performing particularly well and delivering training to their employees. I note that my colleague the shadow minister for training has been involved in the hospitality industry for many years and has been involved at various critical stages in making sure—
—Not savouring the product.
—No, not consuming the froth and bubble of the industry but in making sure that 
 there are strong training operations in place at a number of the larger employers, particularly in the hotel and hospitality industry. According to the most recent survey, mining tops the list of industries with high average training hours, with communication, education, personnel and other services also delivering high levels of staff training. A media release from the minister for education of 8 June last year said:
It is vital that Australia expands and improves vocational education if we are to increase our competitiveness.
Yet the new vocational education and training agreement, which sets the direction for the three years to the year 2000, requires growth to be squeezed out of the systems which are already not meeting demand for places. It allows the Commonwealth to turn a blind eye to its national responsibilities and a deaf ear to the needs of local communities. It sets in concrete the narrow view of education and training held by the coalition which is so damaging to Australia's interests.
In August this year the chairman of both Lend Lease and ANTA, Stuart Hornery, told ANTA's annual conference that Australia needed to lift its game in vocational education and training. Mr Hornery said that Australia ranks 16th amongst OECD nations in terms of the percentage of people aged between 25 and 64 with a post-school qualification. What Australia needs is some leadership and substance at the national level, not the smoke and mirrors we continually get from the current minister for education.
For example, the minister originally claimed that his new agreement would deliver 100,000 new places each year—that is, half a million new places over the five years. What we have seen in practice falls far short of that half a million target. In 1998 there were only 55,000 more places than in 1997, all of them funded by the states. In 1999, however, the expected growth figure is only 15,000—not 100,000, as the minister promised; not 55,000 but 15,000: only 15 per cent of the original inflated claims of the minister for education.
We are entitled to ask how the minister defines a place. To talk of places in a TAFE college is to conjure up visions of students 
 participating in full-time courses, or full-time equivalents, similar to the way we discuss places in higher education. In higher educational comparisons are made using equivalent full-time student units, or EFTSUs, but there is no consistency in vocational education and training.
True to form, if there is a way for this minister for education to twist the statistics and use bodgie figures, he will do it. When the minister for education talks about places, he means enrolments. In 1997 about half of all students spent 100 hours or less in training. Sixty-three per cent of students undertook training of less than 200 hours duration. So, under the minister's definition, a place could mean anything—from an enrolment in a year-long course to one lasting 36 hours.
When we make comparisons of other measures of VET performance, we get a better idea about the constraints being imposed by the Commonwealth's refusal to assist with growth funds. For example, the most recent ANTA annual national report shows participation in vocational education and training by 15- to 64-year-olds to be virtually unchanged over the last three years—that is, 9.4 per cent in 1995 and 9.5 per cent in both 1996 and 1997.
As part of the former Labor government's reshaping of vocational education and training, it set targets for participation in VET—the Finn targets. One of these aimed at ensuring that, by 2001, 95 per cent of 19-year-olds would be participating in, or would have completed, some formally recognised post-school qualification. Yet, according to ANTA, if current trends continue, that target is at risk.
Another meaningful measure which the minister for education could have used but has chosen not to is the annual hours curriculum, or contact hours. The November 1997 publication Directions and resource allocations 1998 projected an increase in annual hours curriculum of only 2,600 hours, or just one per cent, between 1997 and 1998.
In the launch of the coalition's 1996 election policy, the member for Bennelong—the current Prime Minister—promised an enhanced role for TAFE as the major provider of technical and vocational education. He also 
 said that his government would `reinvigorate our TAFE system'. But the effect of his government's policies have been just the opposite. Thanks to the Howard government's cost cutting, two of Victoria's largest TAFE institutes are apparently close to insolvency. The Age reported this week that internal documents from the Kangan-Batman TAFE show that the institute will finish 1998 with a cash balance of only $600,000, which would cover less than five days operating costs.
The paper also quoted a budget briefing prepared for the Northern Institute of TAFE which said that the $1.8 billion funding cut being imposed would mean that the college cannot continue to operate for long in its current form. Yesterday's Australian quotes the Director of the Northern Institute as saying that `Victorian TAFE is drastically underfunded, to the point where insolvency will be unavoidable if the situation continues'. The paper also quotes another Victorian TAFE director as saying that the system is `in dire trouble'.
Victoria, of course, is the current minister for education's `model' state—the benchmark state whose so-called `efficiencies' all the other states and territories are required to emulate.
Mrs Stone interjecting—
—The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage at the table interjects, supporting the serious cutbacks that have been made to TAFE education in her own state of Victoria. To the current minister for education, `efficiencies' are interchangeable with lower costs—the lower the costs the better, according to his philosophy. The very things that are pushing the Victorian TAFE system into `dire trouble' are regarded as virtues by the Howard government. Never mind quality, never mind access—just cut budgets to the bone and that will be regarded as highly `efficient'.
Yet the July 1998 report Today's training, tomorrow's skills, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, pointed out that TAFE has roles other than just low cost training delivery. The report in fact devoted 
 an entire chapter to `TAFE's special roles'. I can do no better than quote from this section of the report, which speaks of the importance of TAFE to regional Australia. The report said:
The existence of a vibrant TAFE sector in regional Australia is to be valued by all Australians. TAFE provides a range of services in rural communities which simply would not be readily available were commercial considerations to be the main priority . . . TAFE plays an important role in the education, training and general life of regional communities. In these areas, a TAFE institute is more than just an educational institution. It provides a focal point for current technologies, philosophies and skills, and can contribute significantly to a region's social and economic growth.
The committee's report canvassed the problems facing TAFE through the rapid expansion of competitive tendering for public VET funding, which has almost doubled in terms of expenditure since 1996. Under this minister for education's user choice, TAFE must compete with private providers on a playing field that is far from level.
The impediments to TAFE competing on an equal basis with private vocational education providers outweigh what some regard as the advantage it holds through possession of significant infrastructure. Such infrastructure is not essential to many types of training, and the growth of private provision—from two per cent to six per cent between 1996-97 alone—shows that non-government providers are competing more than successfully with TAFE for students. The question we need to ask is: are they competing too successfully? Certainly, the Today's training, tomorrow's skills report pointed out the need for TAFE to be adequately funded to fulfil all its roles, including second chance education, employment training and education for people with disabilities.
The Howard government's withdrawal of growth funding, cuts to vocational education and its focus on efficiencies demonstrates its lack of interest in any community service obligations which the rest of Australia, especially regional communities, might expect of TAFE. In 1996, the coalition promised to `continue to support a strong and effective TAFE sector' and to `ensure that the network 
 of TAFE institutions, especially in rural areas and regional centres, will not be undermined and that TAFE will continue its traditional role as a provider of further education and second chance educational opportunity, particularly for disadvantaged groups'.
This turned out to be another non-core promise. The Howard government's policy is inflicting major damage on TAFE, just as it is on many other areas and sectors of education and training. It will be damage for which future generations of Australians will pay a heavy price.
—Order! Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1998  was introduced to the House on 12 November. It was originally introduced into the House on 24 June and lapsed when the election was called. The bill's aim is to amend the act to reflect the terms of the revised ANTA agreement and ensure that ANTA is not liable for state or territory taxes—this will apply retrospectively from 21 December 1992—and to amend the act to provide Commonwealth funding to ANTA for 1998 and 1999 allocations.
The Australian National Training Authority was established by a Commonwealth-state-territory agreement in 1992 to link a Commonwealth willing to assume full financial control of vocational education and training with states who still wished to retain direction of VET at the grassroots. This was against the background of Australia's relatively poor investment in vocational education and training and heavy focus on inflexible and traditional apprenticeships and concerns expressed by industry about the vocational education and training system. ANTA was established to maintain these joint resources, for while the states and territories continue to control VET policy they do so within the constraints of a ministerial council. ANTA therefore allocate funding on the basis of guidelines  received  from  the  ministerial council.
The opposition spokesman canvassed the new agreement's development. Negotiations on the agreement spanned 1997 with consensus finally reached in April 1998, when a three-year funding agreement was devised. This bill will make that agreement a reality.
Turning to the merits of the legislation, the new agreement is a real achievement in that it provides stability in vocational education and training for the next three years. Funding in real terms will be maintained over the life of the agreement. Further efficiencies, which will improve the numbers of students accessing the program, will be undertaken by the states and territories. In fact, for 1998, it is anticipated that 55,000 extra student places will be delivered.
Over the next three years, the Commonwealth will contribute over $2.7 billion through the ANTA agreement in addition to $500 million in annual funding provided through other Commonwealth training ventures. This will bring total Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training in 1998-99 to $1.4 billion.
Importantly, the new agreement is not simply a funding agreement, for it sets in train initiatives to improve the relevance and usefulness to students and industry of Australian vocational education and training programs. Industry is allowed a leadership role in the process, and a stronger training culture will be instilled in the community. National recognition of courses and awards is enhanced and, consequently, mobility in the labour market is significantly improved—an important step in addressing unemployment in this country.
The revised agreement also addresses accountability in planning issues, including a national strategy with agreed performance measures, an annual statement of agreed national priorities based on the national strategy, provision of state and territory planning documents and an annual national report to be tabled in parliament. These initiatives are part of a broader reform process in the training sphere that is most clearly seen in the modernisation of the apprenticeship system and the expansion of work-school programs at all levels; it will strengthen 
 burgeoning new developments in industries like information technology and communications—the growth areas of the next century.
In general, this needs to be set in the context of the very good news we have received in the last 24 hours about the economy—that we have had significant growth, a lowering interest rate, stable employment and growing employment, a significant lifting of investment over the last two years, a significant step forwards in industrial relations and responsible management of the economy. So we have a whole new economic climate of which training is a very important part.
When I first came to this place in 1993, I think there was a view out in the community that we were ending up with some of the best trained dole queues in the world. With the passing of the 1996 election and the advent of more appropriate economic policies, I believe that we are actually seeing the real horsepower of this economy, enabling us to take off and get the proper balance—that is, we have a strong economy which allows us to utilise the training. It is no good just being out there training for training's sake. I know that this bill, the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1998, is very much about that whole process.
It is all very well to say, `We must train, we must give more money to TAFE, we must do this, and we must do something else.' But, unless we get the whole lot of the building blocks together, we cannot hope to utilise the great skills that are out there waiting to be harnessed, as well as those existing skills and those which need to be further developed. The basic issue of literacy, of course, is part of this overall program. Of the stepping stones to a stronger economy, we have the whole issue of literacy linking into a stronger literacy program which gives that stronger base in terms of leading into the apprenticeship program, et cetera.
As far as the institutions themselves are concerned, I would simply say that, in my experience, there is great variability around the country in the performance of the TAFE sector. To see the private providers coming in I think is quite encouraging. The previous speaker mentioned the lift in private providers 
 from two per cent to six per cent of the training. I believe that is a healthy thing because, whilst many of the TAFE colleges were doing a fine job, I think those who are doing the best are those who have accepted the need for a dynamic change rather than doing things as they were done in the past.
I have one example that I can remember quite clearly at the Whyalla campus of the virtual campus for nurse training and ancillary services training; that is now spreading all over Australia. So, out of that one community, with the dynamism of a handful of people, predominantly women—one person in particular comes to mind—who have looked for their market right across Australia, it is just quite remarkable what can be done once people have that vision to offer their courses right across the country. That is happening out of a regional city TAFE campus.
As far as the general purposes of the bill are concerned, I have great confidence in the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp. His very considerable commitment to this overall program is no doubt an outstanding contribution. When we look back in years to come, the contribution of the member for Goldstein, the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, will stand like a beacon, I believe, in the overall productivity and development of our wealth creation of this nation.
That is all I want to say today on this bill, the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1998. I have every confidence that this whole process will serve the nation well.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,44,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—At the outset of addressing the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1998  this afternoon, I firstly would pick up the theme of the building blocks addressed by the previous speaker, the member for Grey. On that note, can I suggest that, when you think about nation building, one of the most important building blocks of a modern, forward looking economy is its skills base. It is for that very reason that the member for Dobell and shadow minister for education has moved a second reading 
 amendment expressing major concern about the nature of this bill.
We move the amendment because we believe that the Howard government has, once again, demonstrated through this bill its failure to address Australia's growing skill shortages through revision of the Australian National Training Authority agreement—and I emphasise that. At the moment we have a major emerging skills shortage in a number of key sectors of the Australian economy, and the last thing on which we can afford to go backward as a nation is the question of building our skills base.
Australia is not going to compete on the basis of Asian wages and conditions of employment. Australia is going to compete on the basis of having the best skilled work force in the world. That is why the ANTA agreement is so important to the future development and strengthening of our economic base as a nation. For that very reason, I believe that the decision to further slash funding—and it is a slash in funding, irrespective of what the government would have us believe—from vocational education and training by the Howard government is astounding. It comes at a time when the demand for skills in Australia has never been more apparent.
Instead of seeking innovative ways of addressing Australia's skill shortage, the Howard government will be playing an active role in reducing the supply of skilled people when the demand for skills is at a historic high. When pressed and questioned about this very issue, the only solution this government can point to to resolve immediate skills problems in Australia is not to lift the number of apprentices, especially in the traditional trades, but to rely on skilled migration. Over 740,000 Australians are unemployed, and more than one in three are now classified as long-term unemployed, effectively meaning that they have been unemployed for 12 months or more and basically remain unemployed because they lack the skills to get the jobs that emerge from time to time in the Australian economy. Those figures emphasise the need for this government to regard skills training as not a cost to the Australian econ 
 omy but an investment in the future of Australia's development.
These cuts to vocational education and training are taking place at a time when 32.6 per cent of Australia's labour force or 234,700 Australians have been unemployed for 12 months or more. That is not an insignificant number. Over 234,000 Australians have been unemployed for 12 months or more. We have a situation in Australia whereby this government is going to take away the growth funds for vocational education and training. On top of that, there are huge cuts already in place to expenditure on labour market training, which was about getting the long-term unemployed back to work.
The situation has been worsened by the Job Network and the lack of a requirement on FLEX 3 providers to expend some of the money provided by government on the training of those long-term unemployed people. We could not get a worse situation in Australia. The emerging skill shortages are worsened by the fact that the youth unemployment rate at the moment is 27 per cent—higher than it was at the election in March 1996.
Clearly, a crucial factor in finding these people jobs is to raise the level of skills. That is what it is about. It is about time the government faced up to the fact that a lot of those unemployed people were previously wonderful workers in a variety of industries in Australia. They were terrific workers, many of whom came to Australia from a range of different countries. As of October this year we had 719,800 unemployed Australians. One of the principal reasons they cannot get a job at the moment is that they do not have the necessary skills to make themselves attractive to fill one of those jobs.
Let me break the figures down. Of those 719,800 Australians who are unemployed at the moment, 419,200 are unemployed males and 300,600 are unemployed females. Despite the fact that we have a major problem with youth unemployment, which is currently at 27 per cent, the biggest unemployment problem in Australia at the moment is middle-aged unemployment, especially for middle-aged men from a blue-collar background. That emphasises the requirement for this govern 
 ment to start to accept that, if you want to make serious inroads into reducing unemployment, especially amongst the long-term unemployed, you have to invest in giving them the skills that effectively make them attractive to employers.
The ANTA bill before the House today reinforces the very serious nature of the problem confronting Australia at the moment. It is a crucial factor, because if we are to find these people jobs we have to seek to raise their level of skills. That in many instances is the key to getting a job. These people want a job. In a lot of ways their morale is broken because they have been unemployed for an extended period. But, in order to make them attractive to employers, let us go out of our way as a nation to give them the skills which would effectively mean when they front up for a job interview the employer can make an assessment—`Yes, the government has invested in trying to get you the skills which mean I can give you a job; therefore, I am prepared to give you a start.' That is what it is about: giving people a second start in life in many instances.
The problem is that the Howard government believes it does not have an obligation to increase skill levels in Australia. That is the nub of the problem. This was demonstrated when the Howard government slashed $1.8 billion from the former government's jobs programs in its very first budget after the election of March 1996, destroying no less than 230,000 skilled training positions. The majority of these skilled training positions were in programs which were targeted at the long-term unemployed and young unemployed people to help them get back into the work force. That is what it was about. It was about targeting the nature of the problem—not saying that there is one solution for all but recognising that amongst the massive number of Australia's unemployed different people have different problems and different barriers. Therefore, you come up with a menu of programs which is about trying to assist their individual needs.
All the government has to offer in terms of training the unemployed today is Work for the Dole and the failed Job Network. I want 
 to make it clear that the Labor Party were the ones who initiated the reciprocal obligation. The principle of the reciprocal obligation that underlies Work for the Dole really came under Working Nation which we introduced during our final term of office in 1995. I emphasise again that whatever programs we bring in when returned to government will be based on a continuation of the principle of reciprocal obligation.
In terms of the Job Network's ability to train long-term unemployed people, I also raise this afternoon—because I think it is related to the problems of the ANTA agreement—the fact that the concentration of FLEX 3 in the hands of only four major providers has resulted in inadequate funds being allocated to training. The problem with most of those major providers is that they are driven by the accountants' bottom line, because there is no accountability in requiring them to spend those FLEX 3 payments. Therefore, the amount of training offered to the long-term unemployed has, in actual fact, gone backwards since Job Network was introduced.
The inability of the Howard government to create greater competition in the provision of FLEX 3 has meant that the training, as I have indicated, for the long-term unemployed is worse today than at the time of the March 1996 election. Therefore, any attempts by the Howard government to further cut vocational education and training, as outlined in the ANTA Amendment Bill, should be greeted with much apprehension. The revisions to the agreement will mean that the states receive no additional funding for vocational education and training above 1998 levels up until the year 2000. To prevent criticism of this fact, the Howard government says that it will maintain funding in real terms until 2000.
The amendments also allow for a continuation in the vocational education and training cuts announced in the 1997-98 federal budget, resulting in a cut of $20 million in the 1998 calendar year. The Howard government is using this cut to force the states to lower costs, it says, to the most cost-effective levels. I suggest that the Howard government is therefore accusing any high cost state of 
 being inefficient in the provision of vocational education and training. However, a state with relatively higher costs may simply reflect comparatively higher demands for vocational education and training in that state and, therefore, greater costs in supplying that education and training. This is entirely plausible when the demand for vocational education and training can vary substantially between states. This, I suggest, is another example of the Howard government using the term `best practice' to distract attention from an overall cut in federal government spending.
The amendment to the ANTA agreement involved forcing the states to accept the principle of growth through efficiencies. This will entail the abolition of growth funding, an initiative, I might say, of the former Labor government where increases in demand for vocational education and training were met with a corresponding increase in federal government spending. I suppose it was about leadership. It was about the national government fronting up to its responsibilities to actually invest in training so as to ensure that Australia maintains that competitive edge both domestically and internationally. As a result of these changes, any additional funding can be achieved only through so-called increased efficiencies, which as we all know is nothing more than a euphemism for job losses. That is what it is about—a euphemism for job losses. Clearly, these are not the actions of a government committed to addressing skill shortages in  Australia.
The Howard government has also announced in the revised ANTA agreement that it wants business to increase investment in training and play a leadership role in the provision of training to young people. While the Labor Party welcomes any contributions by industry to vocational education and training, because we believe there is more room to increase training at an industry level, we do not believe this should be at the expense of federal government involvement in vocational education and training, and that is what it is about—pointing the finger at industry. It is about a partnership, not pointing the finger at industry whilst the government walks away from its responsibilities. It 
 is a two-way street. The government has also got to front up to its responsibilities.
Instead of both industry and government having a shared and equal commitment to vocational education and training—an objective, as I have indicated, we strongly support as an opposition—the government has merely sought to shift responsibility for Australia's skill shortage to the private sector. The revised ANTA agreement also outlines the desire by the government to increase competition in the provision of vocational education and training, so public providers such as TAFE will be competing with the private sector for the specific training requirements of employers. This has all the attributes of a repeat, if we are not careful, of the Job Network fiasco pursued by the minister in his former position as minister for employment. That fiasco has done Australia serious damage and resulted in the Prime Minister basically instructing the new Minister for Employment Services, `You'd better fix it by Christmas or else.' We do not want the same to occur with the training of young people in Australia as has occurred with the Job Network debacle.
The Howard government's continued commitment towards slashing vocational education and training, as demonstrated by the ANTA Amendment Bill, shows that it has also chosen to ignore the findings of a recent report by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs into skill shortages in Australia. Using a skilled vacancy index as a proxy for skill shortages, the report discovered substantial skill shortages for computing professionals, accountants, information and organisation professionals, and building and engineering professionals over the five years to April 1998. Vacancies increased by 334 per cent for computing professionals over this period, 140 per cent for accountants and auditors, 136 per cent for information and organisation experts and 93 per cent for building and engineering professionals. However, there is worse.
The strongest growth in skill shortages was found to exist for trades, with vacancy levels rising by 141 per cent since 1993. Vacancies for construction workers over the past five years have increased by over 300 per cent, 
 wood trades persons by 211 per cent, electrical trades persons by 193 per cent and metal trades persons by 146 per cent. These findings were further confirmed in the latest October 1998 skills vacancy survey, and the following statistics illustrate how the Howard government has directly contributed to the skill shortages outlined above.
Since the government began cuts to apprenticeships and traineeships in 1996-97, recommencement levels have fallen by 67 per cent while commencements have declined by 19 per cent. The latest figures for the June 1998 quarter show that the rate of decline barely changed, with recommencements falling Australia-wide by nearly 63 per cent since June last year. The number of people completing apprenticeships and traineeships in Australia fell by nine per cent Australia-wide over the same period.
Since these declines represent Australia-wide statistics, they can also often obscure the substantial differences in commencements and recommencements that exist at a state level. For example, commencements in Tasmania fell by 51 per cent while New South Wales and Queensland recorded declines of 39 and 21 per cent respectively in the year to June. Recommencements in Queensland fell by over 85 per cent, and falls of 68 per cent in New South Wales, 54 per cent in Victoria and 59 per cent in Tasmania were recorded.
I could go on to refer to other facts relating to other states but, in the light of these falls in apprenticeship and traineeship numbers and the resultant growth in skill shortages, it is shameful that the Howard government is revising its legislation to enable a further slashing of vocational education and training in Australia. The Howard government has argued that a greater focus on skills in its migration program, particularly with regard to occupational targeting, has been important in addressing skill shortages in Australia. I err on the side of training and jobs for Australians, not skilled migration as a solution to our skill shortages at a time of chronic unemployment.
While skilled migration can clearly be beneficial to Australia when employers are unable to fill vacancies for specialist jobs, it 
 is not the complete solution to Australia's skill shortages. Skilled migration cannot be seen as a substitute or a quick fix to the Howard government's cuts to vocational education and training investment in Australia. Unfortunately, this appears to be the view taken by the Howard government. Moreover, the objective occupational target in the government's migration policy is based on meeting future projections of job demand rather than addressing current skill shortages in the Australian labour movement.
I simply urge the government to revisit the intent of this bill. Australia, as I have detailed to date, clearly has major emergent skill shortages. We should actually be investing more in trying to get the unemployed back to work rather than making it more difficult for them to get the skills that make them attractive to employers. That is why it is my pleasure to second the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister and member for Dobell, Mr Lee, this afternoon. It is about clearly trying to urge the government to front up to its responsibilities. (Time expired)

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—Following the remarks of the member for Batman, I would certainly urge upon the government changes to its Job Network. The introduction of a new system of employment services has been a farce. The government has made major changes. It is undoubtedly very difficult to establish a new service where the government is the sole buyer of services that are subject to tender.
That difficulty, of course, is compounded if a government decides to make major financial savings at the same time, and that was the great mistake made under Dr Kemp, the great mistake that was made under this government's policy. They are trying to establish a new market, a monopsony market, where the 
 government is the sole buyer. They are also trying to introduce major financial savings. That has led to a crisis in the provision of employment services around this country.
I draw the House's attention to the problems caused for the former SkillShare in my electorate. Campbelltown SkillShare served the people of Campbelltown, particularly the young people who had no other way of obtaining employment services suited to their particular needs, for 25 years—a great service. The organisation, in its new format, trading as Complete Employment Services, has run into a cash flow problem. That problem, hopefully, will be addressed in the next round of tenders. It needs to be addressed in changes we are anticipating via government announcements next week. This government needs to recognise that a new market—a market where the government is the sole buyer of services—should not be accompanied by major cuts to spending. The cuts need to be reversed, and the government needs to improve the cash flow of organisations like Complete Employment Services in my electorate.
There should be no need for the former SkillShare in Campbelltown to wind down. The damage should be repaired by this government, and it should be able to continue its very valuable services throughout the electorate of Werriwa. The truth is, given the very high youth unemployment rate in Campbelltown, if SkillShare is not available to provide those services, very few options are available for the young unemployed. In fact, in the 1996 election campaign, the Prime Minister promised to do something specifically about the unemployment rate of young people in Campbelltown. The rate has gone up under his government, and it is getting worse because of the cash flow problems that are being encountered by employment services in the area.
The truth is that, for young people, the problems are critical. We are talking about people who not only are unemployed but also come from families where very often their parents and grandparents have been unemployed, where their life expectation is not about education, skills and employment but about unemployment. So the pastoral care and 
 the intensive case management needs of those young people are absolutely critical, and SkillShare provided those services in Campbelltown for 25 years. It is now facing a cash flow difficulty caused by this government. It requires remedial assistance. It requires the government to recognise that they made major errors in the introduction of this Job Network program. They should not be pursuing fiscal gains while establishing a new single buyer market in this particular area.
We need to recognise young people have particular needs when they come from families that have been victims of long-term unemployment. Their pastoral care needs are critical. We are talking about young people who not only are lost to the work force but have been lost to society. They are losing the regular habits of work, the regular habits of a normal life, and their needs are absolutely critical.
It is often assumed in the welfare debate that you provide the services and the welfare rights, and citizens have always got the capability to make best use of those services. We need to recognise in the new economic circumstances and with the new welfare needs not everyone has the capability to access the services that are being provided by government. Very often it requires reciprocal obligation; it requires some pressure on people to access the services. But so too it requires intensive case management to give them extra assistance, that extra pastoral care and attention, that will enable them to access services, in this case training, and, one hopes, employment.
I am glad to see that the Minister for Employment Services is here. I thank the minister for seeing the delegation from Complete Employment Services earlier this week. He held out hope for some promising government announcements next week. I hope he is able to prevail in the cabinet and his suggestions actually become government policy. The key thing is to reverse the crisis in cash flow and ensure that organisations that are absolutely critical at a local level, particularly in addressing youth needs, are given their chance to prosper under the next round of tenders 
 because, if they do not, the problem can only worsen. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Employment Services</title>,Adjournment,45,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—You may be aware that since Landcare was established by Labor it has grown to be one of the most successful community based environmental initiatives in the history of this country. We are proud of that fact and I am proud of the fact that so many people in my electorate have volunteered their time and energy to make Landcare the success it is in the state of Tasmania. Yet the goodwill this program has generated over the years is under threat as a result of this government's indifference.
For the second year running, there have been delays in the sending of new project funding cheques to community groups who have been successful in their applications under the Natural Heritage Trust. In some instances, cheques are up to five months late. Five months is a considerable amount of time for volunteer groups. This is a gross administrative incompetence on the part of the government. Successful Landcare groups in my electorate of Lyons were expecting their cheques in October, but they may not now get their funding before Christmas—a disgrace. This will cause delays in project starts and throw planning schedules into chaos. These are people who volunteer their time to do good work in our communities and they should not be held up by total incompetence on the part of this present government.
Community groups in my electorate are becoming fed up with the red tape and the delays associated with the Natural Heritage Trust funding. Some of the funding has been taken from the original projects, from the original pool of money which was Landcare designated, and it has been shifted to the Natural Heritage Trust funding. If the government does not smarten up its act, many of these groups will probably simply give up the great work they are doing. This would be a tragedy not only for the groups concerned but also for the environment.
Work has been done right around my electorate of Lyons. In the south-east, there has been a very active group and great work has been done through to the Apt railway, which is going to be funded. Over the years, programs there have cut back and opened up the track and opened up opportunities. All this has been through the Landcare funding in the past. Now there is a tightening up on paperwork, increasing the paperwork, which is very difficult for volunteers. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage must do something to fix this problem. If he does not, he could well be responsible for the slow demise of one of the most successful government and community partnerships ever in the history of Australia.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Landcare</title>,Statements by Members,47,1
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—I move:
That the bill be now read a second time.
This bill represents the first time an Australian government has sought to set out the legislative framework necessary to facilitate commercial space launches from Australia.
Since the mid 1980s a range of commercial space launch projects have been proposed for Australia. A clear legislative and regulatory framework is essential for any of these projects to proceed.
Potential investors in such projects need to know what government requirements commercial space launch projects in Australia would need to meet.
With the start of work on the Kistler spaceport project in South Australia, Australia's entry into the commercial space launch market is no longer hypothetical. The need to legislate for a regulatory regime is pressing.
In the absence of a legislative regime, the government has entered into an agreement with Kistler detailing the regulatory requirements the project will need to address.
This agreement will be preserved under the proposed legislation. While the terms of that agreement are confidential, we have sought in this bill to achieve a regulatory regime largely consistent with that applied to Kistler.
In addition, key aspects of the legislation, for example those applying to penalty provisions, accident investigation and appeal rights, will also apply to Kistler. This is another reason why passage of the legislation is pressing.
The bill will also give effect to our obligations under a range of international treaties.
International space law is governed by five treaties to which Australia is a signatory. These are set out in the schedules to the bill.
These require Australia to monitor and regulate space activities on its territory or under its control, and to register with the United Nations any space objects for which Australia is a launching state.
They also place responsibility on Australia for any loss or damage caused outside of Australia by objects launched from Australian territory. Australia can also be liable in instances where Australians procure a launch from territory outside of Australia.
This liability is shouldered by the Commonwealth of Australia regardless of who has actually launched the space object and the liability for damage on earth, or in the air, is strict. For example, fault does not have to be shown.
This bill sets out processes for managing our responsibilities under these treaties and a regime to protect the Commonwealth's interests in the area of liability.
Under the bill a space licence is required to operate a specified launch vehicle from a specified launch facility. In addition, each launch must be covered by a launch permit.
The legislation is designed to operate in tandem with other relevant Commonwealth legislation such as that requiring environmental approval for relevant projects.
Importantly from an industry standpoint, the bill specifies the third-party insurance requirement and limits that will apply.
It requires space launch operators to take out third-party insurance cover based on an estimate of maximum probable damage as a result of any launch failure.
This protects the interests of the Commonwealth and the public and ensures that the key financial risks associated with such activities are carried by the launch operators.
The bill also requires that Australians procuring the launch of a space object—most commonly a satellite—from overseas obtain an overseas launch certificate. This gives the 
 government the ability to manage any financial risk to the Commonwealth that may arise from such launches.
While such certificates will be mandatory to authorise an overseas launch, the minister would point out that the minister does have the power under clause 35 to waive insurance requirements where that may be appropriate.
The bill provides for the establishment of a register of space objects in line with our international registration responsibilities. It also sets out the powers and functions of the launch safety officer who would be required for each launch facility.
The legislative framework will be implemented by a Space Licensing and Safety Office. The 1998-99 budget provided for an outlay of $1.3 million for the establishment of this office.
Once it is operational, the ongoing cost of the office is intended to be met by space licence and launch permit fees. For example, it is intended to be operated on a full cost recovery basis.
In many ways this is new and groundbreaking legislation. It has been formulated after careful examination of overseas models, particularly the framework operating in the United States. It represents, however, a unique model adapted to Australia's needs and circumstances.
It has been put together on the basis of consultation with industry and I would like to thank the Australian Space Industry Chamber of Commerce for the constructive role it has played in this process. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The opposition is pleased to support this particular bill. It helps us to regulate and define an industry which could potentially be quite important to Australia in the next century and which certainly could have very substantial and relevant industry policy connotations especially for South Australia—my own home state and, indeed, that of the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources—given the proposed Kistler project at Woomera.
Before turning to the detail of that, it is important to have a look at the history of Australian space activity. Australia has a very strong history of involvement in space activity. Indeed, much of that relates to work done in my own electorate by the Weapons Research Establishment, now known as the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, where a number of members of my own family have worked quite closely over many years.
The WRE projects go back to involvement with the British through projects like Blue Streak and working up to the WRESAT which was the first genuine Australian satellite, if you like, back in 1967, as I remember the date.
You might expect that, given that very strong early involvement in satellite technology and in rocket launching from Woomera, the strong involvement in the British and European space projects and indeed our very significant work with the United States through the Deep Space tracking network over many years, Australia would by now have developed a very significant space based industry. Unfortunately that is not the case and I acknowledge that governments of all political complexions have been to blame for this in previous years. It has not been easy to persuade the bureaucracy, or indeed members of parliament, as to the relevance of space based industry policy, the need for Australia to participate in this kind of industry or the benefits that might flow domestically from that to our own economy as well as the advantages to science in general.
It is important that we understand just why the industry is so important to us. Over the years Australia has certainly developed that expertise. It has also entered into quite a number of 
 contracts for the supply of space type services but almost all of them are with overseas based companies. The majority of our telecommunications satellite work with Telstra and Optus of course is with the international satellite consortia, although Optus have their own satellite which they inherited from the original government project. The majority of that funding of some $500 million to $600 million a year goes to the payment of overseas based corporations, whether they are the international telecommunications satellites or the French SPOT satellite for remote sensing, the American Landsat and Radarsat series. All of that data which we use quite extensively here, we also pay for quite expensively to overseas based sources. You would think that by now, with that kind of investment every year, year after year, we would have done better in developing a domestic industry. Indeed, successive governments have not, I think, paid close enough attention to the economic value of that information and to the domestic value of it. It is easy to overlook that ongoing payment to established industries overseas.
To what kind of use do we put this information? Satellites have had a number of traditional uses which have now become firmly established in our society and in our very mature technologies. The one with which most people are probably familiar is the use of communications satellites. They have been in use for many years now and shoulder much of the broadband work. Many of the international telephone circuits travel between Australia and other countries by satellite. We have the use of television signals, cable TV, pay TV and indeed satellite feeds from overseas events. We all expect to see important overseas events now virtually as they happen or at least very soon thereafter and that demands usually a satellite feed. Who can forget the live television from Baghdad as the American Cruise missiles flew overhead and the CNN reporter pointed them out—with some degree of trepidation and considerable courage, I imagine—with CNN using their own individual satellite uplink from the roof of the hotel to beam those pictures to the world?
We have come to accept that kind of satellite technology as a very casual thing, but it represents a significant capital investment, a significant ongoing cost to Australia and a substantial technological achievement. More recently we have seen the advertisements for the new hand-held phone satellite systems. Iridium, for example, is the one that went into operation in September-October with very expensive handsets at $3,000 or $4,000, and costing anything up to $12 per minute for the call. But you do get the opportunity to call from anywhere in the world and you do have the privilege to say that you are ringing from the jungles of Indonesia, the darkest depths of Africa or Antarctica, for example, and still hold the conversation that you could hold from the lawns of Parliament House.
So it is expensive technology but, with some 60-odd satellites in orbit, a very significant space launch option for the countries who get that kind of business. Obviously, that system is already in orbit and, apart from maintenance satellites which may need to replace those that fail, there is not much more business in that outfit. There are many other proposals of a similar kind which will involve low earth orbiting satellites or even higher placed satellites. Australia is positioned to be part of that industry if we have the appropriate regulatory framework in place to share liability, to ensure the safety of those launches and to protect our domestic environment.
One of the other major uses of satellite technology is remote sensing. Remote sensing is a little-known but very important technology. AGSO—the Australian Geographic Survey Organisation—and many farming organisations, the Bureau of Meteorology, universities and others make extensive use of remote sensing technology. Because Australia has a unique, very 
 large landmass with some unique characteristics, it is essential that the data for use in Australia is properly detected by the satellite, and properly massaged and processed to be useful for Australia. We do get very good service from the American and French satellites at the moment in that area, but for Australia to be independent—or at least partially independent—in this area would give us much greater leverage in the future.
People are now starting to understand the economic value of this data, for instance, if you know in advance the condition of crops such as wheat in other countries. It is very easy with remote sensing to detect some changes in wheat crops, including the quality and projected yield of those crops. That has very vital market-sensitive information contained within it which can tell you what the impact on demand and supply will be in future years and what the potential effect on prices will be. There is very significant economic value for that data as well as important environmental uses for it in terms of vegetation and farm management, moisture content of the water, potential for bushfires and the like. The myriad uses are so many that it is not possible to canvass them all here today.
Australia has considerable expertise in the use of that data, but we do need an independent source of it so that we are not forced to rely on other countries for data, especially as people become aware of the strategic value of information in the information age of the 21st century. Australia needs to be part of that process to understand what is occurring.
The government has made a number of changes to space policy in recent years. For example, they have abolished much of the limited effort which occurred previously and consolidated it in a practical effort through CSIRO to launch FedSat in about the year 2000. There is the residual national space policy unit within the department, but funding is now even tighter than it has ever been, and it has never been generous. The reality is that Australia's effort in space is very much a constrained one, but one which I think we should endeavour to improve in future years on a bipartisan basis.
The legislation before us defines quite a useful regime of regulation and liability definition for the industry. Obviously, we hope and pray that every launch will be successful, but there is always a significant risk that that will not be the case. Therefore, it is essential that appropriate steps are taken in advance to protect public safety, to protect the local environment and to define liability in the unfortunate event that one of these launches goes awry.
As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has said, Australia is a signatory to a number of international treaties in this regard. We have important international obligations, which this bill preserves and protects, to ensure that Australia is able to make an appropriate contribution.
In the Senate, a number of amendments to the bill were accepted by the government on the suggestion of the opposition. These have improved the bill. The bill was quite appropriate beforehand, but some of the areas which the government intended to specify in regulation were more appropriately defined in the bill, and the government accepted that. It has also accepted a suggestion that no fissionable material should be included in any payload without the specific approval of the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources.
Weapons of mass destruction are particularly excluded from any payload by the legislation, but occasionally for scientific reasons and for reasons of satellite payload management, in the case of a deep space payload effort, it is necessary to have fissionable material. That is a matter for regret but it is a matter of scientific necessity on occasion and it is appropriate, with safeguards, if the minister gives his specific and informed consent.
The regime of the bill has been adequately debated in the Senate. This is framework legislation. We will have to look to the specific terms of the regulations and of individual approvals for launch facilities which are already proposed for Woomera and possibly also Christmas Island. Other sites like Cape York and Gladstone are occasionally mentioned, but the Kistler proposal at Woomera is obviously the one which the government is proposing to get off the rank first. The agreement is already there and we certainly hope that that program will be up and running early next year, and that the organisation will be able to take advantage of this legislation to get that important industry in place.
Let us look at this as an industry. One of the things which it is very important that we implement, and which the opposition would strongly support and stress the value of, is a space industry policy. It is critical that this country now begins at last to profit from the industry with which we have been so closely involved in the past and in which I hope we can be more involved in the future.
Australia is a potentially good launching site but that should not mean that all of this equipment can simply be imported for overseas companies to make all of the profit from it, leaving us as just the launching pad. It is essential that an industry policy is developed in conjunction with this to ensure that local industry is able to participate in these programs to the maximum extent possible, and that there is a real and rational technology transfer to local industry.
I look forward to seeing substantive proposals from the government as to how this industry policy can be developed in the future, to ensure that local industry does participate and profit and that there is real technology transfer to Australia in the future so that we not only benefit from the scientific and industrial and commercial applications of space technology but also profit from the activity itself. Also, Australians will then be able to showcase to the world their very real expertise in these areas and we will get the spin-off benefits in many of the other subsidiary industries.
It is not simply the direct benefits which are important but also the spin-off technologies in robotics, in control systems, in the biological sciences. A whole range of those activities is possible, based on the outcome of space technology. While people often do not understand the spin-off benefits, those benefits can be far more substantial than the direct benefits of space technologies themselves. Industry policy is particularly vital in that regard.
Yesterday we saw the introduction of a wide range of new taxation legislation. That is not particularly the topic today. However, it is worthy of note that the government did grant a wholesale sales tax exemption for imported launch material for Kistler in their Woomera venture. The government proposes to abolish wholesale sales tax and to impose a GST. I have not had a chance to peruse the full detail of the bills introduced yesterday, but they do not, so far as I am aware, contain an exemption for Kistler or any related activity.
It could be said that space launches are the ultimate export industry. The material does, hopefully, leave Australia, and potentially it leaves the planet. In light of this being an export industry, if so defined, perhaps the government is implying that the usual GST rebate for export industries will be available.
However, it is quite possible that some of these payloads will return to Australia, in which case can it be said to be an export industry? Indeed, some of the payloads may not leave the launch pad due to some unfortunate accident, in which case they would not be launched. In 
 some cases it may be a test flight which does not include the launch of a payload, but simply a rocket flight and perhaps a return of the launch vehicle to Australia.
In that context, I suggest that there is significant work for Treasury to do in respect of the GST, because we would not want a variable application of this taxation regime for different launches. We need consistency and certainty in this industry. The wholesale sales tax exemption which was previously granted gave that consistency and certainty. I suspect that the GST will cause confusion and uncertainty in this industry—as it will in so many other areas. I look forward to the government's explanation of how that will be overcome.
The final matter I wish to raise before the Main Committee is the Spaceguard project. Just after the government came into office in 1996, one of its early decisions was to cancel Australian participation in the European Southern Observatory. They have since recovered from that somewhat by participating in the Chile telescope project. However, I still very much regret the early decision on the ESO.
Another decision which has not been partially revoked was the decision to pull out of Spaceguard. Spaceguard, for those who do not know, is the international effort to monitor near-earth asteroids and like objects. Anyone who has seen the current movies, Armageddon and the like, will understand the potential for one of these rogue chunks of ice or rock in space to collide with earth.
It has happened many times in the past. It will, undoubtedly, happen again, whether it is within our lifetime or within the lifetimes of the next five generations is a matter exclusively of luck and nothing else. If we do not know where these objects are, we will never know what is going to happen nor will we be able to take any mitigating action in defence of the planet.
Other countries participate in this program. Australia, of course, was a good participant in this program, but the government has cancelled that effort. A full participation in Spaceguard would cost this country something like $600,000 a year. A minimal participation, which would still be acceptable, would cost much less, but we are not contributing at all. The problem for that is that Australia is one of the most obvious detection sites in the Southern Hemisphere and, without Southern Hemisphere detection sites, a very substantial chunk of space goes unwatched.
I say to the government that we should be participating in this international effort, Spaceguard, not only for the sake of our international scientific reputation but also as a matter for the defence of Australia, if not the planet. A very modest contribution would see Australia's reputation restored. While the threat is not a high statistical probability, the very catastrophic nature of the outcome of the threat, even if it is a very low probability, is such as to make Spaceguard a worthwhile activity, given that we do now have, for the first time in human history, the appropriate technology to monitor these objects.
The world is watching. Australia is a black spot in that area. I ask the government to reconsider the very modest funding which would put Australia back on the map in the Spaceguard terminology. This is not a matter of politics; it is a matter of a very simple determination for the planet. Although the probabilities are very low, such events have happened before. The event in 1916 in Siberia was very significant. It occurred in an uninhabited area but, of course, it is of recent origin and serves to remind us all of the impact which these things can have.
On that very futuristic note, the opposition supports this legislation. We are pleased the government accepted the amendments. There are a couple of issues to be cleared up in further 
 debate, if that is possible, but if not, then  subsequently by a statement by the minister. I conclude with my plea to support the Spaceguard international effort.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1
"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—There is clearly something about spacefaring, space travel, exploitation and so forth that does set the imagination on fire. We can all, I am sure, recall the thrill, as small children, of seeing—whether it was on television or at the cinema—some sort of drama or story concerning the exploration of space. Indeed, one could very well begin one's remarks in a debate such as this by saying, `A long, long time ago, in a country far, far away . . . '
The imaginations of many British people must have been set afire by the news of the voyages of people like James Cook and others who set off in vessels to cross the great oceans and, of course, in the course of those activities, discovered Australia. As time passed and it was settled, civil society took place, parliament was established—and here we are in 1998 debating perhaps another frontier of similar exploration.
What is significant about it in 1998 is that it is vastly different from what it must have been, certainly when I was a child. In those days it was very much a case of exploring things that were completely unknown or supposed; whereas, these days, spacefaring and space exploitation are very much about practical applications. Again, 1998 perhaps has extra significance in the sense that we saw an American astronaut go into space for the second time, in the person of John Glenn, one individual who, like all of us here, has put aside much of his career to serve in public life.
But the applications of space and the technology that comes with it are, as the member for Bonython said in the previous speech, really about the diffusion of knowledge that comes from this kind of activity: knowledge—scientific knowledge in particular—in areas such as bioengineering, robotics, optics, materials science and advanced manufacturing processes. As these technologies develop through the use or the exploitation of space, it is important that Australian citizens, corporations, institutions and universities have whatever access we can provide them to such state of the art applications.
The  Space Activities Bill 1998  that we are debating today establishes or codifies Australia's obligations under five United Nations space treaties. It deals broadly with three areas: with licensing of launches, safety issues and liability issues. I will return to the notion of applications before proceeding further and dealing with some of the interesting and more complex legal aspects of space exploration.
The three main applications of space technology that I suppose have immediate interest to Australia are: the remote sensing of earth, given our large land mass and our national interest in exploiting our natural resources; communications systems—for a country whose population is as widely distributed as ours that is something that is very vital not only to the daily needs of some citizens who live in remote parts of Australia but likewise to the national prosperity; and, lastly, scientific exploration—all those areas of specialist knowledge that I enumerated before and that are important for Australia to have a part of.
We already spend a lot of money every year on space systems applications—about $600 million. Much of this is spent, in effect, outside Australia. I understand that the Department of Industry, Science and Resources is to develop a specific space industry policy. This is a fine thing, especially given the enormous potential in returns on investment to Australian pension funds and the like, if we are to have part of this growing industry. But, of course, industry policy must be clear-headed; it must be imbued with limited, sensible ambition and 
 not be the product of dreams that occur to ministers from time to time. It has to deal not with trying to build a new Jerusalem in a space industry here in Australia by the fiat of government, but with removing impediments to the private sector evolving within such commercial activity—reducing, if you like, the need for any excess or needless regulation.
That said, we should not neglect the commercial potential for the exploitation of space. It is interesting to go into the notion of how we are to govern the activities that would occur in outer space. It is something that has been dealt with at an international multilateral level for a few decades. It goes back to the development of the technology in the 1950s and some discussions that took place in international fora, particularly the United Nations.
It was interesting to learn that early on states gave up their right to sovereignty in outer space and on celestial bodies. This was done first in a formal resolution of the United Nations in 1962. Instead of the notion of sovereignty, where a physical piece of land or even sea can be defined and appropriated by occupation of a state, the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 established clear rules regarding the jurisdiction and control of space objects.
Likewise, outer space celestial bodies and, indeed, their natural resources are regarded as the common heritage of mankind. This 1967 treaty is really the basis of modern space law. It contains a set of fundamental principles that set up the basic framework of space exploration and exploitation. In an article in the Journal of Space Law, the 25th volume, a Chinese scholar, Mr He Qizhi, a member of the International Law Commission, sets out very clearly 12 basic principles that govern the exploitation of space. The first principle states:
1) The exploration and the use of outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interest of all countries—
so you have that universal notion.
2) Outer space shall be free for exploration and used by all states on a basis of equality;
3) Outer space shall not be subject to appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation—
the sort of thing I talked about before.
4) Activities in the exploration and use of outer space must be carried out in accordance with international law, including the Charter of the United Nations in the interests of maintaining peace and security;
5) No nuclear weapons or any other kind of weapons of mass destruction shall be placed in orbits of the earth;
6)The Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used by all state parties to the treaty exclusively for peaceful purposes;
Exploitation or exploration of the moon was later governed by a treaty signed in 1979.
7) Astronauts shall be given every possible assistance—
much like the Law of the Sea.
8) State parties bear international responsibility for national activities in outer space;
9) State parties keep jurisdiction control over launched objects—
as opposed to having sovereignty over particular areas of space.
10) State parties shall avoid harmful contamination of outer space—
11) The UN Secretary-General must be informed about space activities and shall disseminate such information to the public—
12) International cooperation and understanding are to be promoted. 

With that in mind as the basis of space law, there followed various other treaties to which Australia is a party. For example, in 1968, there was the Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space. In 1972 we saw a formal Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects. In 1976, there was the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space, and in 1979 there was the Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies. There are other sets of principles formally agreed to, governing things like satellites, TV broadcasting, remote sensing of earth, nuclear power sources in outer space and the needs of developing countries.
The question might arise: what would happen if a state decided to withdraw from all such agreements or, in effect, did not ever become a party to them? Those of you who were fans of the fiction of Ian Fleming might remember some of the stories—Dr No, for example. There you had an evil individual launching a rocket from a state—a third country, perhaps—completely out of the control of the forces of righteousness. How do the activities of such an individual fit with these international rules and laws? The answer is that the rules that are contained in the treaty and indeed embodied in the bill we debate today are actually customary international laws. They bind all members of the international community regardless of whether they ratify these agreements or not. So we are safe from the likes of Dr No in a legal sense.
As for future developments in space law, there is no doubt that the protection of the earth's environment from damage or contamination from space is not perhaps yet as comprehensive as a legal regime could be. That is one aspect of the future development of space law.
The other aspect is further types of space ventures, different sorts of exploration carried out. For example, only last year we saw both on television and via the Internet the Pathfinder vehicle there on the surface of Mars. It landed there on 4 July 1997. That, of course, gives rise to thoughts about where things will go from here. If there is an agreement to govern activities on the moon, what happens on Mars? The answer is that the provisions of that agreement about the moon, the 1979 agreement, can cover other celestial bodies unless there is a specific legal norm enacted to cover them in particular.
Things dealt with in the bill such as the liability and the insurance requirements for private participation in space exploration and in launch vehicles will be increasingly important. These include things such as what rights apply and how you define the scope of the obligations of private participation in space. What happens, for example, if a corporation starts off in such a venture, launches a vehicle, and then goes bankrupt? What would happen if damage were to occur, a third party to suffer, and so forth? Likewise, what would the evidentiary rules be if a dispute arose about damage caused to a third party's object in space by the use of a robot? For example, how would the legal person who launched the vehicle that contained the robot prove that the damage was caused by the negligence of that person or of the party whose object suffered the damage? All these sorts of things remain to be defined in the future.
There are also things such as the law of trespass. There is personal property in space objects. There are differences in the legal definition of objects used for space exploration as opposed to those for aircraft, those that travel within the earth's atmosphere. Differences or disputes could arise on the border, and we are going to need more specific rules in the future.
I welcome this bill. I commend it to all my fellow members and I think that Australia has a lot to gain from an effort in participating in the exploration of space.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1
"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—The Space Activities Bill 1998  is a very important and groundbreaking bill about what we are going to face in the 21st century. The 21st century is going to be the century of space. It is going to be the century in which humanity will venture further and further into space. Much of what we achieve in the 21st century will be tied up either with the immediate space around the earth or with further explorations beyond.
It is remarkable really that we have a situation where so much of the popular imagination is captured by the idea of space, the idea of space travel, the idea of what we can find in space and how we can benefit humanity through what may be activities carried out either in the immediate space around the earth or beyond—on the moon and even on the planets, and people even dream of the stars. Obviously, therefore, in these circumstances, it is important for the government to have a significant role as more and more people become involved in space activities.
From the point of view of the general concept of this bill, it is welcome and I think the parliament ought to approve it in a bipartisan way. The bill really tries to do two things. It tries firstly to reaffirm our commitments to international treaties, especially UN treaties, in relation to space activities. I think it is very important that we do that. As other honourable members have mentioned, we have a number of treaties. Three of the most important are the Treaty on the Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies, the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects and the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space. I think it is important that these treaties are there and that in fact the United Nations and the international community have at least cooperated in this area which potentially could have been an area of fundamental struggle.
Issues such as the question of who can put up objects in space—satellites and the like—especially in the space around the earth and the question of conflict between the objects that are put up by different countries have all been significantly dealt with—not completely, but significantly dealt with—by the international treaties. I think that that bodes very well for at least beginning the 21st century on a positive note in this area of human activity.
Of course, in addition to governments being involved, we have commercial activities. It is in this sense of the commercial activities that we have other aspects of this bill. The other significant part of this bill is the extent to which the government has a role in regulating the commercial activities of companies based in Australia that want to be involved in space activities and companies that are making launches from Australia or are involved in other activities associated with such launches. When we have that situation it is important that there be some controls.
Indeed, the bill was brought in because, in a sense, activities got ahead of the government with the Kistler project in South Australia and its activities. We had a situation where in fact the government had to have a confidential understanding with the company in relation to the arrangements, but I am pleased to see that the minister says in the second reading speech:
While the terms of that agreement are confidential, we have sought in this bill to achieve a regulatory regime largely consistent with that applied to Kistler.
I think it is important that we are now in a position to put into place legislation to deal with these issues in time for other developments that are taking place very quickly in terms of 
 commercial interests in the exploitation of space, in the use of space and indeed in the use of space launches.
I think that all those factors are positive. There will be an insurance requirement to make sure that anyone who carries out commercial launches does not leave the responsibility to the Australian people and the Australian government if something goes wrong with their launch. That would be a bit serious from our point of view. If people want to become involved in commercial activities in relation to space, they have to make sure that they have adequate insurance cover in the event that something does go wrong with their launches and creates accidents or difficulties, either for people in Australia or indeed for people in other nations. We are still learning about space and space exploration and there are still things that can go wrong in these matters. Astronauts are always putting their lives at risk when they go up in space. Even when we are sending up unmanned satellites, they can sometimes go haywire in the process of getting up there or once they are up there.
Having said that, one cannot underestimate the importance of these sorts of efforts in relation to space. The satellites that have been put up around the earth can be used for all sorts of very positive developments in relation to the future of our society and, indeed, the future of the planet. We can use satellites now to gain a much greater understanding of the earth's atmosphere, of the oceans, of ice and land and how all these things interact.
We can use them for the prediction of the weather but also, hopefully, as time goes on, we will be in a position to predict natural catastrophes of various kinds before they occur, or at least give some idea of the direction in which these catastrophes are going to go. One is reminded of the recent catastrophe in Papua New Guinea. It would have been good if our technology had been able to foreshadow that in some way and to warn people and perhaps save lives in the process.
Everyone knows about the importance of satellites in the communications systems of the world. The dramatic development of all of the communications systems has led to the new globalisation phenomenon. We are now becoming very much the global village as a result of the ability of satellites to connect people through telephones, television and all sorts of other modes of communication which are going to be further developed in the 21st century.
The important thing about this, which I am sure you would be particularly interested in, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly, is the way in which we can assist people in the most remote areas, through the uses of these technologies, to contact other human beings from all around the planet. This is very exciting. The fact that you can live in a relatively remote situation but be in contact with people from all over the globe through these satellites and communications systems obviously means that we are already seeing the great benefit of space and space exploration.
That does not mean, however, that we have dealt with the issue of accessibility. It is all very well to have the right and the ability to provide these services to regional areas, but we also have to put in a bit of investment to make sure that it actually happens. In that regard, I believe that this is one of the most important areas for government activity: to ensure that our people who live in the regional and remote areas have access to the latest telecommunications and latest use of the satellite systems, so that they can be in communication and gain knowledge through television and radio services, mobile services, the Internet and a whole range of things. In so doing, we reduce the distance between people. Firstly, we reduce the 
 distance between Australia and other nations and, secondly, we reduce the distance between the people who live in the remote areas and the people who live in the cities.
I believe that this aspect of space exploration will become even more important in the future. Australia is going to be involved in satellite launches to further promote this. I think that is a very positive thing because we have in Australia some of the best scientists and innovators in this area. Often our scientific knowledge and innovation have been taken up by others and we have not benefited from the commercialisation of that scientific knowledge and innovation. I believe we can do that in the future. We need to concentrate more, not only on supporting pure research in this area—and I will come back to that—but also, equally importantly, on supporting the transformation of that pure research into practical products and specific areas of commercial activity that we can get into.
I have mentioned ways in which space industries are going to be very important in the 21st century. Those industries are going to be an important source of employment as well. Australians need to have their skills and knowledge involved and to participate in the global network of space activities through a method which will ensure that our innovations are being produced and developed in Australia and that we are giving employment to Australians in relation to that.
Another aspect of space exploration which captures the popular imagination is that as we get out into space we can discover more about the nature of our galaxy and the nature of the universe around us, and in some ways discover something more about the mystery of human life. From the beginning, human beings have always wanted to discover more about the nature of the physical universe and the role of human beings in that physical universe. We have developed in the last 20 or 30 years very interesting and dramatic theories about the nature of the physical universe; theories in which Australian universities and professors have played an important role. Through our important radio telescope activity we have been able to add very significantly to knowledge of the physical universe.
One of the things that we in Australia are not sufficiently proud of is the work which we do to increase an understanding of the physical universe. Scientists come from all over the world to follow the radio astronomy and radio telescope work that we in Australia can do because we are in the Southern Hemisphere. The number of things that our telescopes have been able to discover or that were theoretically present but have been confirmed through this activity is quite dramatic. Our general contribution towards the total sum of human knowledge is one of the things that we can be proud of as a nation.
In addition to that general idea of the contribution that we can make to the understanding of the universe, there is very important specific scientific work in space. Some of the work that can be done in space, where we can discover things about the reactions of the human body in different circumstances, can actually be used in the pharmaceutical industry, for example, in trying to discover how the body reacts in weightless conditions. There are some exciting studies that suggest that we might even be able to find a solution to the big problem of influenza and viruses by doing research in the weightlessness of space.
There is also the question of how plants would operate in space and whether we can learn something about the development of plants in different environments, as well as many other applications to do with radiation and magnetism. All sorts of things that are potentially of great application to life on the earth can be studied in important experiments in space.
Some people scoffed at the recent idea of the United States and Russia jointly building a space station. Some people think that some of these experiments are really not of great significance. That is not correct. Through the exploitation of space we can discover a lot about all sorts of sciences and all sorts of scientific knowledge. In general terms, therefore, this legislation and the framework which it sets are a very important and exciting development for us as a society, as we go towards the 21st century.
There is one quibble that I have with the bill. Where the minister was able to give permits for launches and the like, I would have liked there to be some further emphasis on Australian industry development as part of the process. I think it is a bit unfair that the minister can virtually give authority for a process where Australians and Australian companies could have participated in the technological development but overseas companies have decided not to do that. It would have been important to say, `If you want to use Australia as a basis or a launching pad and you want to use Australian know-how and technology, how about we also use Australian high technology components. How about we also employ a certain number of Australians in these processes. How about some industry development requirements, which we have in other areas of industry development and which we require in other areas. Why not do this in relation to space activities and space exploration?'
I would be interested in what the minister's response is to that, because we do not just want Australia to be used as some kind of launching pad and nothing more. We want Australia to be used in a more broad way, where there is a contribution from our scientists, our industry, our skills and our technology in these exciting developments into the 21st century.
Besides the employment activity, there is an issue of ensuring that this technology is distributed and available, not just to rich individuals or to the big companies but to the average person. It is a social justice issue about access to the developments of space—a question of accessibility for all human beings and for all Australians. I hope that we will take that up in the future.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—I declare an interest in the Space Activities Bill 1998  because Woomera happens to be in the electorate of Grey. Woomera has seen many variations in its population over the last 20 or 30 years, which is generally a declining population. Everyone would understand the history of the range back through the 1950s and 1960s, when there were literally thousands of people employed in that activity.
Subsequently, the United States Air Force had a base at Nurrungar, which brought its own economic activity and a new lease of life for Woomera through the 1970s. That period is drawing to a close. So to have the Kistler organisation participating in quite an exciting project in that part of the world now is another welcome respite. It will certainly bring an improvement in circumstances once the closure of the Nurrungar base is signalled. On top of that, Woomera is currently a temporary base for the Western Mining Corporation, with the $3 billion mining project up the road a little bit at Roxby Downs. My interest primarily is in the township and in the constituents who reside at Woomera.
The bill has been well defined but it is nevertheless worth repeating that it provides a regulatory framework for space activities carried out from Australia or by Australian nationals outside Australia on the model provided by the US Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984. This framework will accord with international obligations in this area with regard to licensing, safety and liability.
As many speakers have highlighted, but I would like nevertheless to put into the Hansard, the space activities include remote sensing: the remote studies of the atmosphere, the oceans and of the earth's surface generally to provide data on matters as diverse as vegetation patterns, seismology, geology, weather forecasting, mineral prospecting, fisheries mapping, urban planning and environmental monitoring.
Secondly, as the member for Calwell touched on in his speech, there is the issue of communications: facilitating the use of mobile and remote computers and communications tools across broadcasting, transportation, logistics, personal communications, defence monitoring, and remote education and medicine. Satellite communications have helped bring about the communication revolution and will be part of future developments. Thirdly, there is scientific exploration: in the fields of astronomy, cosmology, physics and biology, space based research leads not only to an understanding of space but of the earth.
Australia's space industry at present spends about $600 million annually on satellite communications, mostly overseas. This means there are not only industry but also strategic concerns over our reliance on overseas providers of space services and technology. This is despite the obvious attractions, reflected in commercial interest, of Australia as a site for significant launch and development facilities. I have already touched on the American Kistler Aerospace Corporation. Added to that, the International Resource Corporation Russian Soyuz program and the United Launch Russian Unity rocket program have expressed interest in sites as diverse as Woomera, Christmas Island and Gladstone.
In order to facilitate development and give our operators a level standing in the global market for this industry, we require a regulatory framework that is flexible but secure. This legislation will be of benefit to potential investors in this industry as well as to those communities and firms in Australia that will be able to be part of that investment.
At present, there are no regulatory arrangements for space launch activities in Australia. This legislation will remedy that oversight. The non-statutory Space Licensing and Safety Office has already been established and a wholesale sales tax exemption of 22 per cent has been granted for imported space launch vehicles and satellites, with a $1.3 million budget in 1998. That office will be funded through the issuing of licence and launch permit fees.
While I am on the issue of the wholesale sales tax, on the point made by the member for Bonython, it would be my understanding that, apart from the fact that your average citizen does not go down the street every day and buy a space rocket, those would be part of business inputs. Therefore, I would expect no GST would apply to this project. I will have that checked; nevertheless, I think it shows some misunderstanding of the new tax system that this government is proposing.
Under the bill, a space licence is required to operate a launch vehicle from a site. Each launch will require an individual licence. The bill also specifies third-party insurance arrangements for the industry. Australians intending to procure a launch from overseas will also be required to obtain an overseas launch certificate. The bill also establishes a register of space objects in line with international registration requirements. As has been touched on by my colleague previously, it will be in accordance with international law.
I think it might be worth talking a little more about Kistler and Woomera. It is the development at Woomera at the instigation of the Kistler Aerospace Corporation that has heightened the need for this regulatory framework. No longer is an Australian space industry hypothetical; it is now a commercial reality. The agreement made between the federal 
 government and Kistler will be preserved by this legislation. The legislation will also apply to penalty provisions, accident investigation and appeal rights with regard to the Kistler agreement. That agreement was signed in April and was announced by the Prime Minister during the visit by the federal cabinet to the city of Whyalla.
The Kistler project was formally opened by the former industry and defence ministers, the South Australian Premier and Mr Robert Wang of Spaceport Woomera on 23 July at the Ashton Hill site. It is expected that 125 jobs will be created in Woomera during construction and test flights of the Kistler K1 are anticipated within months. The first commercial payload is expected to be launched next year. The launch vehicle will be reusable up to 100 times, with rocket engines replaced after 20 flights.
The Kistler project is expected to generate $2.9 billion in income for Australia over the next 12 years. It is only the beginning of the possibilities offered by the space industry. Importantly, it offers opportunity for the revitalisation of Woomera, as I mentioned earlier.
As far as comment from senators in the other place goes, I could perhaps reassure Senator Margetts who said on 21 November 1998 in the Senate:
I understand that there is already agreement between the Commonwealth and a private company for the launch site at Woomera—the Kistler project.
She went on:
I wonder what environmental and Aboriginal issues have been addressed, and remain to be addressed, in relation to that project.
I know the member for the Northern Territory would have some understanding of these issues as well, as he was involved in some of the negotiations in a previous life. It is my understanding that there has been significant negotiation with Aboriginal people, that there are potential employment prospects and that that negotiation has been very satisfactory and was, indeed, part of the initial agreement.
Finally, in response to the point that the member for Calwell was making, I would like to say that access to telecommunications for rural and remote communities will be part of the next generation. It will be essential for all commercial, social and other aspects of our lives. For those of us who live in these parts of Australia, this is a very exciting development. In the few years I have been the federal member for Grey, one development I recall very well in the Woomera region was where a digital GSM phone was made  available and was connected for the potential use of space industries.
Then to see an international corporation choose to invest and be part of my electorate and of our economy is very exciting. It offers, as I understand it, the launch facility for low earth orbiting satellites, which will be the new generation satellite, allowing low earth orbiting mobile phone services. Whilst the cost is high relative to the old analog and digital systems, it is expected as the years go on that that cost will be significantly reduced. I have great pleasure in supporting the bill and I wish it well.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—In speaking to the Space Activities Bill 1998 , I wish, firstly, to declare a direct interest in it. Following my loss in the 1996 election I set up a consulting company, Warren Snowdon and Associates Pty Ltd. Currently I remain a director of that company and a consultant to it. I am in the process of resigning as a director.
This company has had a number of contracts. Earlier this year it was retained by Kistler Aerospace to provide advice and assistance on a range of matters. This relationship is an 
 ongoing one. In these circumstances, and in order to ensure that there is no perceived or actual conflict of interests, should there be a division on this bill it is my intention to abstain from the vote. Having said that, I want to endorse this legislation because I think it is very important for Australia.
The member for Grey spoke about the Kistler project in his electorate. I also have another interest that I ought to declare: Christmas Island, which is in my electorate, is a site of another space project—and I will come to that in a moment. I note that the member for Fairfax had a direct interest himself in terms of the policy development issues in relation to the Christmas Island project in the previous parliament.
In talking about these matters it is important that we understand the import of them. There is a vague notion in the wider community about space and all that it entails. People watch sci-fi movies. They see the exploits of the American space program and the Russian space program and it is all quite alien. The reality is that in terms of space technology and Australia's involvement in space programs we are now in a position where we are actively involved. Whilst we have been involved before in terms of our scientific endeavours, we are now involved commercially.
What has happened as a result of the initiative from Kistler Aerospace is that we have an agreement which has been reached between the Commonwealth and Kistler Aerospace—as has been identified by the previous speaker, the member for Grey—which was signed in April of this year and which is encapsulated in terms of this bill before the House.
In that agreement the negotiations were quite lengthy and they have had to address a range of very sophisticated and quite new issues to Australian public policy. It is important that we do not underestimate the effort that has gone into that process by all those people involved—I include here not only the ministers but their staff and particularly those people who are responsible within the bureaucracy, as well as the negotiators for Kistler—because some of the issues have been indeed difficult.
One of the issues which remains a point of contention is the question of indemnification. Kistler and other companies that want to come to Australia will only do so if they can be assured that the terms on which they arrive here are no less favourable than the terms they would otherwise get in other places. The issue of this indemnification is quite important because Kistler, as we are aware, is an American company and it has come to Australia because of the attractions which are provided by Woomera as a site—and very important attractions they are. But, commercially, it is very important also that we do not underestimate the impact of decisions which we might make about the impost of costs upon companies like Kistler and, indeed, those other companies that have expressed an interest in developing space technologies which might be launched from Australia.
The question of technology is also of interest. I noted the contributions of various speakers about the need for us to develop our own space based industries. That is important, but we should not ignore the fact that, whilst these technologies are very sophisticated, as they properly are, and it is very clear that we have the scientific capacity to work with them, there are also security implications for other countries.
It is very clear that the United States government, for example, places heavy restrictions on the export of technology. That is an issue which we have to come to terms with. We must develop a relationship with those countries so that they can be secure in the knowledge that technology which is used in this country as a result of commercial arrangements with 
 organisations that want to launch satellites will not be used by and will not fall into the hands of those people who might have another interest for them.
In terms of the Kistler project, we should bear in mind that the engineers behind this project are the engineers who have been at the forefront of space technology development in the United States. They were responsible primarily for the Apollo program and NASA. They have extensive experience and in terms of leadership in the engineering field are seen as leaders in aerospace technology.
It is not my intention to run a sales pitch for Kistler but I think it is important that we contemplate the fact that, like other companies that come to Australia, they have had to deal with our own administrative structures, our own legal regimes, which are quite different. Many people who come to Australia are mildly surprised at the expedition with which matters can be dealt with. For example, the fact that our bureaucracy is professional, that it has a very good reputation for the way in which it does its business, is very important.
The previous speaker referred to the question of negotiations with Aboriginal people. That is the part of the project that I have been involved in and it is true that Kistler have taken a very positive approach to the question of native title. What they have done in this particular instance is to go into a negotiation, recognising that native title exists, and negotiate as if native title did exist before any determination. That meant a very positive atmosphere, so we were not embroiled in a negotiation about whether or not there was the existence of native title; native title was assumed to exist and negotiations took place on that basis and they have been very positive.
I want for a moment to address the issue of the possibility of other space developments in Australia. We know that Kistler proposes to start commercial flights next year. Certainly trials should start by the end of the first quarter, we hope, but also the International Resource Corporation, the IRC, is proposing to develop a project here in Australia. The Asia-Pacific Space Centre is behind a proposal to launch satellites from Christmas Island by the International Resource Corporation. For those of you who are not aware of Christmas Island, one of its significant aspects is that it is about 3½ hours flying time from Perth and 40 minutes from Jakarta and is a very isolated Australian community in the Indian Ocean. An advantage for a company like the Asia-Pacific Space Centre is the fact that it does not have any land around it; therefore the problem of retrieval which is very real for land based launches, other than the sort which are used by Kistler, does not exist, so the dangers which might emerge from the flight path of a launch vehicle from a place like Cape York—or Woomera for that matter—do not exist. So it has very great advantages.
However, it is a very sensitive environment and one of the key issues which has got to be resolved is the question of the environmental impact of any possible launch site on Christmas Island. Having said that, it is important for the local economy that this development does proceed, because the nature of the local economy is such that it has been reliant, almost solely now for the last few months, on the successful phosphate mining program that exists on the island and which has received an Australian export award earlier this week.
This has the potential, we are told, to create some hundreds of jobs on Christmas Island and that is very important. So we should not underestimate the importance of this project in particular in terms of the creation of jobs and its impact on the local community. That applies also to Kistler because we know, from the projections that Kistler has, that it would create quite a number of jobs in the local region and that there are technological and industrial spin- 
 offs which will emerge very directly in the local community. That includes, clearly, the employment of Aboriginal people who are part of that community and indeed are the native title claimants.
It is not my intention to speak at any great length on this particular bill, but I do think we should not underestimate its importance, and I fear that a lot of people have. This is an entirely new field for us and the development of public policy in terms of space is extremely important as we move into the next millennium. I believe that we will end up having a very successful aerospace industry based in Australia as a result of the interest which has been shown by investors from other countries who have indicated a desire to launch satellites from Australia.
I might just make mention of the innovative technology which Kistler is using and which I think has a great attraction. It is quite new technology. The launch vehicle will be reusable and will come back to earth on parachutes, both the first and second stages, and land within some few kilometres of the launch site.
This will substantially reduce the cost of launching satellites and improve the commercial viability of that operation immensely and make it extremely competitive. If their confidence is well placed, as they believe it is in terms of the commercial viability of the project, then one can only imagine the important economic spin-offs the operation will have for the local economy.
I note that the member for Grey used a figure of $2.5 billion. That is an enormous amount of money. It will have an enormous impact on an economy which needs support, and that is the economy of South Australia. We should not underestimate the impact it will have on the broader Australian economy and industry generally in terms of advancing us into the next century, making sure that we are at the forefront of aerospace industry. I believe we should be there. I am sure we will be there as a result of this bill and as a result of the interest that has been shown in Australia by companies who want to use Australia as a launching pad for vehicles that will take us into that next century.",REPS,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,48,1
"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—in reply—As set out in my second reading speech, the Space Activities Bill 1998  provides for a legislative and regulatory framework for space launch activities in Australia.
In the debate in the Senate, the government accepted a number of amendments to the bill from the Labor opposition, the Democrats and the Greens. These amendments cover environmental safeguards, the launch of materials, reporting requirements and the registration of space objects. In the area of environmental protection, the bill has been amended to specify that the minister must be satisfied that all the environmental approvals necessary under the Australian law have been obtained and that an adequate environmental plan is in place for the construction and operation of a launch facility.
An additional safeguard for the protection of public health and safety has been added by an amendment to provide that a space object launched from or returned to Australia must not contain fissionable material without a prior written approval from the minister. Public accountability provisions of the bill have been strengthened by amendments which provide for the tabling in parliament of any exemption certificate for approvals required under the act and for any instruction given by the minister to a launch safety officer.
The amendments also require publication in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of any variation, revocation, suspension, transfer or reinstatement of a range of authorisations under 
 the act relating to the launch or return. The government accepted these amendments to enhance transparency and public administration. The bill has also been amended to ensure that, under an authorisation provided under the act, every space object launched is entered into an Australian register of space objects established by the bill.
I will now address the comments that have been made by speakers in today's debate. The member for Bonython made a point that the bill provides a good framework for space industry regulation but the opposition will monitor the regulations closely. The government has committed to very thorough consultation with the space industry in developing the regulations. We certainly would welcome any constructive input on the development of an efficient, safe and workable regulation system for the space industry.
I encourage those on the other side to work with us in this because it is something in which we can work towards ensuring that in Australia we get the best possible system in place. Given that we have a lot of support right across the spectrum, this would be a good opportunity to work closely together to reap the end results of this legislation.
The member for Bonython supported the development of an indigenous space industry in Australia. The government strongly supports the development of local capabilities so that Australia can capture the benefits of this industry. We believe that the technology transfer that will occur through projects such as the Kistler project will provide a good basis for the development of a local space industry.
The member for Bonython noted that the government has introduced legislation to exempt imports of launch vehicles and payloads from wholesale sales tax. He questioned what the position would be under the GST regime. In general, the space launch industry is expected to benefit from the rebates for export that will be provided under the GST regime. However, this matter warrants further examination and the government will certainly take it up.
My colleague the member for Wentworth drew attention to the United Nations treaties which underpin international space law and, indeed, this bill. There are, as he suggests, areas of space activities where further development of international law will certainly be required. The government acknowledges this and will closely monitor developments in international space law and, where necessary, participate in relevant international debates.
The member for Calwell, in his contribution, emphasised the importance of ensuring adequate insurance cover for any third-party damage as a result of the space activities. That is a key requirement in this bill and one of the government's primary objectives in introducing it.
The member for Calwell suggested also that the bill could have placed legislative requirements on commercial space operators to develop an Australian space industry. The development of an indigenous space industry is also a key concern for the government but we do not believe that the imposition of legislative requirements is the most effective way to advance this. The Department of Industry, Science and Resources will, however, be working very closely with commercial proponents of space technology to maximise the benefits for Australian industry of space projects in Australia.
The points raised by the member for Grey included the importance of the Kistler project to his electorate and to that of the member for the Northern Territory, and more broadly to the development of the space industry in Australia. I should say to both members that the government sees the Kistler project as a very significant beginning for a viable commercial space industry in Australia and has very strongly supported that project.
The member for the Northern Territory raised the issue of ensuring that Australia has a commercially competitive regime for space regulation. This again is an objective of the bill, and the regulations will also be developed with a view to ensuring an operating environment that is commercially competitive.
Several participants in this debate have raised the issue of space science and research and they have urged the government to support Australia's participation in that. I acknowledge a strong record of achievement by Australia in this area. The government supports those scientific efforts primarily through the CSIRO and within the allowable budget parameters the government will, of course, continue to do so.
This bill sets out a solid foundation for the safe, efficient and cost-effective regulation of space launch and recovery operations in Australia. It provides a stimulus for the growth of a new Australian industry, based on the rapid global expansion of space activities.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.
—If no member wishes to consider the bill in detail, I will put the report question forthwith. The question is that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—Madam Deputy Speaker, if I could have your indulgence for a moment to explain the opposition's participation in this debate, I would appreciate it.

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER  (Mrs De-Anne Kelly) —Indulgence is granted.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The opposition will participate in the address-in-reply debate in the Main Committee today under sufferance. We understand that the government intends to complete this debate by Wednesday of next week. This means this debate will go for an hour or so in the Main Committee today and a few hours on Wednesday. There are still 30 opposition speakers who wish to speak. We understand the government has the same number of speakers. We do not believe the address-in-reply debate should be truncated like this. It gives members coming back from an election the chance to comment both on the election process and the government's program for the rest of the term. It is ridiculous, we believe, for the government to suggest that members should take five or 10 minutes in this debate. That is not enough. It will not allow everybody to speak in the debate, even if people truncate their remarks.
The government has not been full and frank with the opposition in this process. We were originally of the understanding that this may have gone over until next year, and that is now not so. We do not think the address-in-reply debate should be completed so quickly. There are no urgent government legislative matters relying upon the address being completed now or early in the next session.
This is the first time the address-in-reply has been sent to the Main Committee; it has normally been conducted in the House. It was our intention initially to consider sending this back to the House today. I do not think that would assist members on either side. We will only agree to the normal sittings of the Main Committee this week and next week. We think the government's original proposal to allow the address to continue next year would have been far more sensible and would have allowed more members to participate.
As I said, we are participating in this debate under sufferance. We think it should be allowed to go over until next year; we think members should have a right to comment on the government's program for the rest of this term.
There are a number of other things that the government has debated and I imagine we will be discussing these things at a later date in the chamber. We will agree to the address-in-reply debate staying in the Main Committee today and we will agree to it being debated in the Main Committee next Wednesday. If the government had run it over until next year, we would probably have agreed to more debate here this week, next week and in the new year. The member for Canberra will participate from our side with other members. The government should be willing to give more consideration not only to the opposition but also to their own members. There are 30 of them and 30 of us. About six or seven people will get to participate. That is not good enough.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,49,1
"Ronaldson, Michael, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—On indulgence, please?
—Yes, indulgence is granted.
—To respond very briefly to the spirited defence of the Chief Opposition Whip in relation to this program, the government offered both the opposition and the government members an opportunity to participate in this debate next week. We put an offer to the opposition whereby the hours of the Main Committee would be extended. Had that been done, it was our belief that the great majority of members who wished to could speak on the address-in-reply, through the offers made for both Monday and Tuesday of next week.
The government is obviously bitterly disappointed that the opposition, which has a large number of new members, has decided not to give its own members the opportunity to participate in the address-in-reply. If that is the view of the opposition, the government cannot, of course, do anything about that. We are pleased that there will be at least some debate on the address-in-reply.
The opposition is acutely aware that the position was put that it was highly unlikely that we would be able to continue the address-in-reply in the new year. That was a possibility; but, with appropriations and other debate, it was believed that it was unlikely. It was `possible but unlikely' was, I think, the way it was put. The government is pleased that we will at least get some address-in-reply debate. We are disappointed that the opposition has not chosen to extend the sittings of the Main Committee. That offer was made, and I believe that, with a bit of commonsense, we would have been able to give most members the opportunity to speak on the address-in-reply. That will not be so; so be it. I am pleased the opposition at least is prepared to address the address-in-reply today and on Wednesday.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—I would like to take what has now become a very valuable opportunity to respond to the government's mean-spirited agenda for this parliament, as expressed in the Governor-General's speech late last month. The government claims to be committed to enhancing our national economic performance and providing a policy framework in which more jobs are created and the living standards of Australians are improved. That is an objective that I think we would all agree on. However, we have a fundamentally different series of ways of getting to that objective.
Labor believes that good economic policy puts people first, matching competence and efficiency with compassion and care. We believe that the key to achieving both employment growth and rising incomes is strong, sustained and sustainable economic growth. It is bad economic policy to grow the economy faster than can be sustained, but even worse to grow it more slowly than its sustainable potential.
Labor believes that the benefits that flow from economic growth should be available to everyone in the community. A fair and efficient distribution of the benefits of national economic success should be a priority of government. This government has, to date, failed on this score. Some sections of our community are clearly doing much better than the rest under Treasurer Costello. This is set to continue with the government's proposed tax changes. The government believes its new tax system will dramatically reduce the taxation burden on Australians. I say it will dramatically redistribute the taxation burden on Australians.
At the heart of the government's tax reform is the GST—a regressive tax that is fundamentally unfair to low and middle income earners. The GST is being used to fund $13 billion in personal income tax cuts. These income tax cuts are also unfairly distributed. The biggest benefits go to those who are best off: the more you have, the more you get and the more you get to keep. More than half of the total benefit of the $13 billion tax cuts goes to the top 20 per cent of income earners, leaving less than half for the remaining 80 per cent. This is what I would call hardly a fair distribution.
Looking now to the government's industrial relations agenda, the government intends to amend the Workplace Relations Act to maintain the injustice of junior wage rates. The government claims that moving from aged based to competency based wage rates will result in increased youth employment. The available evidence just does not support this argument. Wage rates are not the most significant factor in determining levels of employment. Relative to adults the wages of young full-time workers have been falling but that has not resulted in employers substituting young workers for the mature. On the other hand, wage costs for part-time teen workers have increased relative to adults but so has their part-time employment. Youth wages are lower in manufacturing than in retail, but youth employment has fallen faster in manufacturing. So wage rates are not a significant factor in youth unemployment, but they are a decisive factor in the poverty of young workers.
Youth unemployment in Canberra has been very high for a very long time. It regularly bounces between 30 per cent and 50 per cent. Fortunately—and I am pleased to say this—it has not been up to 50 per cent in the most recent months, but it is still consistently around the 30 to 40 per cent rate. Many young Australians remember the statement from Mr Howard on the eve of the 1996 election regarding youth unemployment when he said:
I will be a very disappointed man if I haven't made a very serious inroad into the level of youth unemployment in this country because I would like to see our performance in that area as being a mark of what we have been able to do as a government.
The mark of this government's first term was increased youth unemployment and reduced opportunities for young Australians. It remains to be seen whether this second term will be any better. However, I fear that they are determined to continue their agenda of cutting youth wages and cutting funding to education and training even though it is not the solution to this problem.
Not only is the government attacking young people in work, they have been equally tough on young people trying to study. The government claims to believe in education and training. They claim that they will work to ensure that all young people have access to a strong basic educational grounding and a quality pathway from school to further training and employment.
But let us look at the record. The first two coalition budgets made education and training its number one target for cuts. University grants were cut by nearly $1 billion, resulting in the abolition of 21,000 student places. TAFE funding was cut by $240 million. $130 million was directly cut from government schools and a further $400 million was cut indirectly from government schools as a result of reduced state grants.
While other nations are increasing their investment in education as a strategic investment in their future, the Howard government has moved, it seems, in the opposite direction. It is the first government in Australia's history to wind back the scale of public education, research and training to this extent. The Howard government has, I believe, failed young people by turning its back on education and training and on fixing the young unemployment problem.
The government states that it is committed to increasing opportunities for families to build on and strengthen their own resources and networks of support. They have created a new Family and Community Services portfolio to assist this process. Yet the first act of the new minister is to cut 5,000 jobs from Centrelink. How does this help families to build on and strengthen their own resources and networks of support?
There seems to have been a total disregard for the client base of Centrelink. The people who rely on Centrelink need those services because of particular circumstances in which they find themselves. I think it is pretty unfair that we expect people who may have difficulties in dealing with the bureaucracy or with legal matters or matters concerning their income and their future viability to patiently hang on a telephone line for hours attempting to get information. The government really should rethink this. This is not the way to deal with clients of Centrelink. You are disregarding them and I urge you to reconsider this process.
Late last month we saw a piece of legislation rammed through this place to try to stem the flow of people leaving private health insurance. This legislation is nothing more than a $1.5 billion finger in the dike. It is all about a continuous subsidy of private health insurance funds. Australians actually want something done about the public health system. They want something done about waiting lists and about people queuing up in corridors of public hospitals on trolleys waiting for attention. Australians actually want more money directed to public hospitals, not a blank cheque for private health insurance companies.
Labor actually believes in maintaining the Medicare system. We believe it is, in fact, the best way to improve the nation's health system overall. We remain committed to universal access to publicly funded health services through the Medicare system, and the Australian community believes that too.
Our position on this issue is backed up by the fact that the Australian community votes for Medicare every time they have the opportunity. The goal of public policy in this area must surely be to make private health insurance better value for the consumer who chooses it. Nobody in this place except those on our side seems to be asking: what is wrong with the product these private insurance companies are selling? That is the question: what is wrong with it?
The simple answer is that it is inequitable and it is not worth the money. Addressing the gap—the difference between what you get from Medicare and your health fund and the total fee—is the crucial issue. Yet government members have voted to oppose redrafting their flawed legislation to include measures to make health insurance more attractive by providing patients with a single hospital bill and insurance to cover the cost of hospital and medical services so that patients do not face large out-of-pocket costs.
By pursuing this legislation, the government is compounding the inadequacies of its first incentive scheme. The government is throwing good money after bad with this 30 per cent rebate, a rebate that is not means tested and is expected to increase fund membership by a paltry 2.7 percentage points.
I would like to refer to the subsidy of ancillary charges as well. As I have said in this place before on a couple of occasions—and I will keep saying it, and I will say it again today—what makes me the angriest is the amount of money that is going out of this $1.5 billion to prop up the costs of ancillary medical insurance.
The general extension of the rebate to the ancillary service area means that privately insured people will get a 30 per cent rebate for, as an example, the dental premium. It means that nearly $200 million will go to subsidising the dental treatment of those who can, in a lot of cases, probably already afford dental care. This comes two years after this government scrapped the $100 million Commonwealth Dental Scheme that gave pensioners and others in need in our community access to dental treatment.
The Minister for Health and Aged Care claims that the minister has no place in providing such a scheme, yet he is happy to sit back and let those in real need suffer while handing out $200 million in subsidies to, in many cases, higher income earners. This is the best example of the meanness and misplaced priorities of this government. It shows why 51 per cent of Australians actually voted against them in the last election.
I would like to spend the time remaining to me looking at the provision of government and welfare services and the government's trend toward outsourcing. In the last parliament I was involved in the House of Representatives Committee on Family and Community Affairs inquiry into competitive tendering of welfare services. There is no doubt that there are some in government who believe there is little we cannot competitively tender out in the area of government service delivery. I do not subscribe to that view. In fact, I believe the time has come for us all to prescribe utmost caution.
There is a great deal of fear and suspicion of competitive tendering amongst community organisations. We heard many examples of where an organisation had gone to the cost of entering more than one tender at a time and then having to wait many months for the outcome while carrying those costs. Also, the experience of the clients of welfare services must be considered to be as important as merely considering the economic arguments for competitive tendering. In fact, it is probably more important.
The bottom line is really pretty simple. When considering the lives of the less advantaged in our society, do we allow consideration of competition to dominate, to let market forces start to take hold sometime in the future? We can set down these paths with the greatest faith and intent and with what we believe may be the highest level of standard and accountability settings applied. These things should be, and already are, in place in the current delivery systems. But they can always be improved and better developed, and evidence to our committee strongly urged that to continue.
You do not have to go down the competitive tendering path to ensure higher standards, accountability, or value for the dollar. I worry that should we at some stage in the future adopt this approach, with profit being a major component in the delivery of these services, we will see an erosion of quality as workers are asked to do more and more with less and less.
Some areas of government service have already adopted the competitive tendering approach. Of course, employment services is probably the most obvious that comes to mind. Nevertheless, I think it is important that government agencies remain accountable for efficient and effective delivery of services irrespective of whether welfare services are provided to clients by government agencies or through a contractor.
Mr Deputy Speaker, what we are really talking about is the sort of society that I believe we want and how we see ourselves in the decades ahead, whether we are a society of community or a society of self. I passionately believe in the society of community, where those of us needing that hand-up receive it, not as an act of benevolence or charity, but as an active participant in that community, promoting self-worth and self-esteem. The Prime Minister has recently called for the corporate sector to be more involved in the welfare of our society. Obviously, none of us would not want to see those who can afford to do so assisting those needing help, but I say, `Please don't take us down the road where the only assistance you can get eventually is dependent upon the charity of others.' We must all be given the ability to feel that self-worth and to be given the chance to contribute on even ground. I know what sort of community I believe in and that Labor believes in. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and this House, that we will be continuing to question this government on all actions and decisions they take, now and in the future, affecting that very community I speak of.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,49,1
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—In the address-in-reply I really regard it as a privilege this morning to rise the day after the Treasurer was able to introduce into the House the legislation for Australia's new tax system, on the same day that we have five per cent growth, a 0.25 per cent cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank and an economy which must be unsurpassed in the Western world. The Governor-General, when he opened the parliament, reminded us that the Australian people re-elected the government on October 3 and gave us the renewed responsibility for managing the nation's affairs in the interests of all Australians. Above all, the government:
. . . is committed to implementing the priorities for its second term on the basis of its unequivocal commitment to the Australian values of decency, openness, tolerance and a fair go for all.
In those few words the Governor-General reminds us of what a fortunate place Australia is. Whilst we will differ, and appropriately so—the member for Canberra has just reminded us of some of those things we would differ on—nevertheless there are always those things which unite us. They should be much more strongly emphasised, I like to think, than those things that divide us.
The economic challenges were very significant when we came into office after 13 years of our opponents being in charge of the Treasury benches. I came from one of the lowest income areas in Australia. We hear a lot about low incomes in Australia but I actually come from one of the lowest income areas of Australia and it has been that way for about two decades. Regional Australia is represented overwhelmingly by coalition members so I had a particular incentive when I came to this place to represent the reality of small business, the reality of inequitable access to education and the reality of interest rates at 20 per cent and ignorance of the real role of employment creation.
One of the most remarkable things that I will always recall is the issue of uranium mining—a very emotive campaign of 20 years or more in this country. When there was an opportunity in my electorate for a place called Roxby Downs to have what has now turned out to be a $3 billion project, all my political opponents, including the Democrats and the Greens, could do was oppose it. Only those in the coalition were prepared to give support to this project.
I remember well in the period in opposition when I was first a member, from 1993 to 1996, the member for Gippsland and I debating a matter of public importance about the abolition of the three mines policy. I think about the courage of one state Labor member, Norman Foster, who crossed the floor and allowed this great project to proceed.
I mention those things in hindsight and because they are part of our history. Nevertheless, this highlights why I stand on this side of the parliament representing the government. The people of Australia have had enough of retraction, enough of negativity and enough of special interest groups. So when the Governor-General mentions that this government is committed on the basis of its unequivocal commitment to the Australian values of decency, openness, tolerance and a fair go for all, it really rings a very strong chord with me.
To touch briefly on a new tax system, much has been said and will be said as each particular political grouping goes through its paces over the next three to six months. Regrettably, we are going to get from our opponents just a repeat of the self-justification with which they went to the election, basically a policy of negativity and no positive future for Australia and, as the Treasurer constantly reminds us and rightly so, one based on a tax system from the 1930s—based on something which really is destined for the ark or for no reasonable progress for an Australia based on a reasonable tax system.
The thing that really gets me about the whole debate from our opponents on the tax system is: why won't they address the issue of the revenue that is needed to be provided for public services, for the health system? We heard about Centrelink this morning again—the reality is 5,000 jobs. I understand we were losing more jobs under Labor over the last decade than this current reform is providing.
How do we pay for those services? How do we pay for Centrelink? How do we pay for the whole range of welfare services? Now 40 per cent of our GDP goes in welfare services. We have to pay for it from revenue, from the people who pay every week or every year or every quarter for it. I wish my opponents would talk about those people who pay the bills at least as much as about those who are here spending it. I include myself in that. I am helping with my salary in spending some of those taxpayers' benefits. But I have come from a background of small business farming, where too often a negative return was the order of the day, particularly with 20 per cent interest rates which drove me to this place to try and right some of those wrongs that Labor inflicted upon my region, which is still suffering some of those 
 negatives from that era. That drove me to this place to try to do something like bring in the new tax system which the Treasurer brought into the House yesterday.
In terms of the health system, I just remind the Main Committee—and I am sure all of us would be aware of it—what an absolute farce the private health insurance debate is. We had 70 per cent private health insurance some 25 years ago. Labor did all it could to destroy it. It took away the incentive. It added to the costs. It added, as I recall, a 12 per cent per annum increase in its time in government. It had the hide to stand up in the House of Representatives and ask whether it would remain tied, whether there would be an increase in the rate and whether it would be this or would it be that. After 20 years of negligence and absolutely solid attack on private health insurance, the Labor Party has the audacity to criticise. I understand the member for Paterson was brave enough to come out and criticise the government in his seat, but he was very quickly reminded by one of the senators that 52 per cent of his constituents have private health insurance, which is quite high by national standards.
This whole issue around private health insurance includes the overall cost and the new Medicare agreement that gives $33 billion or $35 billion to the states, which is a 15 or 16 per cent real increase. Remember, it is public and private—it is not just a matter of private hospitals; it is a matter of the public sector, which is important. The whole idea of private health insurance is to get pressure off the public system. Remember also that the Medicare levy contributes about 15 per cent of the actual health costs of this country. Those who just rely on the Medicare levy, and do not pay private health insurance, are in effect dodging the real issue. For those who have made some genuine attempt to insure themselves, I think it is quite reasonable for a government to give them some incentive. Remembering Labor's record over the last 15 or 20 years, you could say that they blatantly went out to try to destroy that system.
I could go on at great length, because I am enjoying the role on the Treasury bench with the government. I think the government has much to be proud of in its first term. I think the Governor-General's speech summed up what we inherited and what we tidied up in our first term. Now we have a very challenging task. Over the last couple of months the government has been quickly settling into government and getting into its stride, and I am really looking forward to the next three years of very strong government from John Howard and his executive.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,49,1
"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1998-12-03,"—First in the address-in-reply I want to express my gratitude to the people of the electorate of Wills for their support, which came in the shape of 71 per cent in the two-party preferred vote. It means that Labor has now doubled, in primary vote, what it had back in the more difficult days of 1992. Indeed, it is considerably higher than anything we have had since the boundaries for the electorate of Wills were shifted to the west. I am very appreciative of the level of support that I have received.
I share the disappointment of a lot of my constituents that Labor was not successful in the election. We did poll over 51½ per cent in two-party preferred terms but we did not, of course, get them in some of the seats that mattered. I intend to devote some of my time and energy to securing that support where it counts. I hope the majority of my constituents will agree that, increasingly, this is an important task for me in what is, for them, a desperate anxiety and desire that we have a Labor government.
We accept that the government has won the election and is entitled to govern. We do not accept however that it has a mandate for a goods and services tax. Indeed, if the previous 
 election had been a referendum on the GST, they lost, pure and simple. Over 50 per cent on a two-party preferred basis voted for Labor. If you look at the parties in the Senate, the situation was even worse. I think more than 60 per cent of voters voted for parties which expressly stated that they would oppose a goods and service tax, so certainly this government has no mandate for a goods and services tax.
It was a very cynical exercise where the government released the tax package, spent over $15 million of taxpayers' money to promote that package and then went to a cut and run election during the height of sporting finals fever.
—The Commonwealth Games.
—Yes, and the AFL final—which, regrettably, once again went to the Adelaide Crows. That was a time when they anticipated that public scrutiny would be at its lowest possible ebb. That, I think, contributed to some of the disrepute in which politicians are held. I think the government has aggravated that problem of the disrepute in which we are held by saying that they are going to insist that the legislation gets put before the Senate, a Senate that was voted in at the time when this government was saying, `We would never, ever have a GST.' This is not the Senate that people voted for at the last election—which was a vote about the GST. This Senate was elected when the Liberal and National parties went to an election saying that they would never, ever introduce a GST.
Indeed, so great is the government's desire to get this legislation through, and so great its contempt for parliamentary standards, that it is now prepared to accept the vote of Senator Colston in order to achieve passage of the GST legislation. The Prime Minister knows he has no right to that vote. That is precisely why, some time ago, he said that the government was not going to accept the vote of Senator Colston. Now he says, `Well, from here on in, we are prepared to accept the vote of Senator Colston, because we really want it.' All that can do is bring the political process generally into disrepute.
The address-in-reply provides an opportunity for people to respond to things that are said in the Governor-General's speech. Speaking as the representative for Wills, I believe the address provides an opportunity for people to say something back to the government and, indeed, to the Governor-General about the issues that we see as important. I want to spend a few minutes talking about some of the issues that people in Wills have seen as important in the last year or two.
One of our greatest problems has proven to be bank branch closures. We saw the Commonwealth Bank close its branch in Strathmore and there was a great public crusade against that, hundreds of people attending public meetings, thousands of people signing petitions, deputations to the Commonwealth Bank's regional managers and the like. Regrettably, not only was that branch closed but the bank followed up by closing—if I recall correctly—two branches in Brunswick, the Oak Park branch, in Snell Grove, and a branch in Glenroy.
The Commonwealth Bank is not the only sinner in this regard. The National Bank is in the process of closing its branch in Pascoe Vale South, and other banks are closing branches as well. That comes in association with increases in fees and charges. So what the banks are giving us is lower service standards but higher costs in terms of fees and charges. Regrettably, the government has not seen fit to do anything whatsoever about that situation but has shown itself to be very much in cahoots with the banks.
On the theme of closures, we have also had quite a lot of concern about the closure of some road crossings on the Upfield railway line, which passes through the eastern side of my electorate. It was the work of the state government, which decided that the Tinning Street, Brunswick, and Shorts Road, Coburg North, crossings ought to be closed. This was a cavalier action on that government's part, taken in contempt of views of local residents, shops, retailers and industry, who very much valued the access they had across the railway line. It is regretted that the Kennett government saw fit to proceed with these crossing closures notwithstanding community views about that.
Another issue which has been important in the electorate relates to crime and personal security. I get along to as many Neighbourhood Watch groups as I can. They continue to be well supported in my electorate. The more I see of crime reports and the more I become aware that the vast majority of household burglaries, petty crimes and property crimes are drug related, the more it seems to me that we have not solved the problems of drugs in our community. They seem to be getting away from us. Police officers, who ought to know about these things, express to me the view that the situation is not under control. As a result I do think that it is time that we look for some more innovative solutions.
I regret that the Prime Minister saw fit to quash the ACT heroin trial. Although I am far from sympathetic towards drugs, I think that we do need to look for some new solutions which, hopefully, would cut out the price incentive for crime that exists under the present arrangements. It is time that we looked to some changed approaches in that area.
My constituents have expressed to me quite a lot of concern about the impending imposition of tolls on the Tullamarine Freeway, which will be renamed Citylink, after it is completed next year.
Just in the last week, Transurban have released their proposed payment arrangements for paying the toll. They propose three options. Firstly, you can deposit $50 in a Citylink account which will convert to toll credits. If the amount falls below $10, you have got to top up the account by $25. The second option, referred to as a pay as you go option, involves a $20 deposit plus a $2.50 monthly account keeping fee, with monthly deductions from your credit card. Thirdly, you can purchase a day pass with a flat fee of $7 per car per day, but you are only allowed 12 of those a year and, if you travel without a pass, you have got to purchase one by noon the next day for $8.
Accompanying this, Transurban executives have talked about motorists paying an average $1,000 a year. This is 10 of the dreaded state deficit levies for Victorians. It amounts to highway robbery and these account keeping fees, in my view, are quite outrageous. When the idea of tolls on Citylink was first announced, we were told that it would be better than other cities—we would not have to stop and throw $2 in the bucket; it would all be done using the latest in electronic technology. When we see what they are up to with the payment options, we would be much better off, for example, using a system like the toll road in Brisbane where you throw $2 in the bucket on your way through.
It does occur to me that it will substantially disadvantage people from out of town, including the electorates west and north-west of Melbourne. These people might use those approaches into the city from the Calder Highway or the western highway and find themselves wanting to use the Tullamarine Freeway. If they do not have one of those cards, they will be in the most difficult situation of having to purchase a pass somewhere by noon the next day for $8 or be subject to a fine of anything up to $500 for this particular traffic offence. In my view, 
 that may have the effect of deterring interstate and international visitors from using the Citylink and the Tullamarine Freeway, which I think is a great shame.
People are also concerned about the noise walls that have accompanied Citylink. They are third-rate, ugly noise walls. The Berlin Wall has gone down, but the Transurban wall has gone up in its place. It is a depressing sight to travel along and see them. My wife said to me, `All they need is the razor ribbon on the top.' They look for all the world like prison walls.
People in my electorate have also expressed concern about unemployment. With the government abandoning the Working Nation programs, we now find that unemployment in our area has risen. It had come down to the national average by the time of the change of government; it has now crept up beyond the national average. Adding to that, there has been chaos and mayhem in relation to Centrelink and the Job Network and, notwithstanding the protestations of the ministers who have been responsible for this, these have been a comprehensive disaster. A lot of constituents have not been eligible for Job Network assistance. Newly arrived migrants and husbands and wives of people who are working have not been eligible for assistance and they have come to the office with all sorts of problems. Those involved in the Job Network themselves have reported many problems.
We have also seen concern about the introduction and impact of compulsory competitive tendering in the local government area, and that, in turn, has had some adverse impacts on both the quantity and quality of local services.
The address-in-reply provides an opportunity for us to look at what the government is saying, through the Governor-General. To measure a government, I think it is worth while going back to the previous address-in-reply to see how the government has performed against that. I did that and I would like to bring to the attention of the House some of the things the government indicated in its previous address it was going to do and look at how it has performed against that yardstick.
The government indicated that it had the intention to raise national savings. But if we look at what has happened with the household savings ratio in the light of their abandonment of the government co-contribution for superannuation, and even the abandonment now of the savings rebate and the superannuation surcharge and so on, it has fallen from 4.7 per cent in 1996-97 to 3.25 per cent in 1997-98 and now to 2.75 per cent for 1998-99, according to the budget papers. So we have household savings declining in this country, which clearly will have implications for the current account deficit and for our levels of foreign debt.
They also talked about creating a more positive future for our children, and then proceeded to remove the operational subsidy for child care—a mean-spirited action. Although the justification at that stage was reference to the `budget black hole' and the budget deficit, now they have a projected budget surplus, but billions of dollars of that projected surplus are to be used to fund tax cuts. Indeed, the top 20 per cent of income earners in this country are going to get $6.6 billion in tax cuts. That shows—and it is always the Liberal Party's agenda—a redistribution of wealth away from those who have less towards those who are already well off. That is always what the Liberal Party is on about and that is what it is on about through its tax package.
They also said in the Governor-General's previous speech that it was the government's intention to improve the standing of the national parliament. We saw the sad story of the bullying of a previous Speaker, Mr Halverson, and his early resignation. We saw what happened with the ministerial code of conduct: we had the resignations of Brian Gibson and 
 Jim Short on 14 October 1996, the resignation of Bob Woods on 1 March 1997, the resignation of former Minister Prosser in July 1997, the resignations of John Sharp and David Jull on 24 September 1997, the resignation of Peter McGauran on 26 September 1997. They probably could not have afforded to lose any more, so they then decided they had to dig in there and support Senator Parer. As a result, the code of conduct became a joke.
—What's this got to do with the address-in-reply?
—Well, this government said it was `the government's intention to improve the standing of the national parliament'. I would suggest that there has been no parliament which had a lower public standing than the previous parliament.
They also talked about industrial relations legislation which would `promote genuine cooperation between employees and employers'. In fact, their actions did nothing to promote cooperation. They did everything they possibly could to destroy cooperation between workers and employers, and the spectacle of the guard dogs and balaclavas on Australia's wharves was a most un-Australian spectacle which I certainly hope never to see again.
They also talked, in the previous speech by the Governor-General, about reducing red tape, unnecessary paperwork and regulation for small business and about supporting small business. The acid test in relation to small business is bankruptcies. What we have seen since March 1996 is an increase in bankruptcies of the order of 50 per cent. In March 1996, they were 4,413; in the September quarter of this year, they had risen to 6,660. All I can say is: if this government are the friends of small business, they certainly do not need any enemies. And with the GST we will see the introduction of a whole swathe of new red tape for small business.
They talked about, over time, reducing foreign debt. Again, foreign debt in March 1996 was $191 billion; the latest figure—$233 billion. Foreign debt has risen by $42 billion during the life of this government, so where is that debt truck now? The Prime Minister, when he was challenged about this, started talking about debt servicing ratios. We never had any difficulty servicing the foreign debt in the past. What this government said when they were in opposition was that they were going to reduce foreign debt, period.
They also talked about reducing waiting lists, but in the health area they have slashed public hospital funding by $800 million. They said TAFE would be supported, yet they cut $240 million. They expected the TAFE colleges to increase their intake without any extra funds. The result was that 35,000 people were turned away in 1997.
They talked about promoting reconciliation and improving the living standards of Aboriginals, but we had a Prime Minister who would not say sorry to the stolen generations. We had a Prime Minister who slashed ATSIC by $470 million, who cut Abstudy by $38 million and, of course, who sought to override the property rights of Aboriginal people with his Wik legislation.
We had a government which said that they would govern in the interests of all, and not vested interests, and yet we have seen one of their close friends, the banks, allowed to enjoy a massive skyrocketing of fees and charges. We have seen bank branch closures while the government has just sat on their hands. In terms of vested interests, I think the government ought to be coming clean, or the Treasurer certainly ought to be coming clean, about any meetings he may have had with Michael Kroger—who is being paid a retainer by the National Bank—to try and demolish the four pillars and give us instead two pillars of banks, something like a two-airline policy.
I think that the Governor-General ought to go back and have a look at what the government said it would do last time, compared with what it actually did. We certainly hope that the government has a better record during the course of this parliament, in implementing its program in the way it outlined in the previous address, than it had on the occasion of the last parliament when its program of implementation was dismal.
—Order! Before calling the next member, I remind the member for Wills of standing order 80 and I ask that in future he refers to members by their electorate.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,49,1
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,1998-12-03,"—I cannot believe the member for Wills: a perfect example of what Labor will say and do in order to get a vote. May I remind the member for Wills that his community did not vote the Labor Party into government; in fact, they have voted the coalition into government. And may I remind the member for Wills that the things that you have said are absolutely untrue.
I rise, honoured and very humble, in being returned to represent the people of the electorate of Gilmore and in doing so I would like to thank all those who assisted in making our campaign the success it was. In particular, I thank the volunteers, my staff and, most of all, the people of Gilmore for their confidence and faith in me and this government in returning us to office.
In 2½ years the people of Gilmore through their sheer determination and community spirit and with the support of this government have together achieved a great deal—for example, the Work for the Dole pilot. Now there are large programs throughout the region with more than 375 places for local people in Nowra, Ulladulla, Moss Vale and Kiama—even though Kiama Council are philosophically opposed because it is a Labor held council.
There is support for our elderly through community aged care packages. This fantastic measure was enhanced by the Prime Minister's stay at home policy to help older people retain their independence at home. This is a very necessary program in the electorate of Gilmore where so many people want to stay in their homes yet need that special care.
Contrary to what my opponents may have said, we were successful in obtaining the mobile dental health van in the Bay and Basin region, funded by this federal government and staffed by the state government. This government gave $100,000 to our much needed dialysis machines program. It just goes to show what can be achieved when we work together. In addition, there is more than $750,000 in Natural Heritage Trust funding for volunteers working to protect and conserve our environment. These are just a few projects that I need to mention.
As well as those, a number of major developments and infrastructure commitments have been undertaken, providing employment opportunities for many hundreds of local residents with much more to come. We have achieved the University of Wollongong campus and Illawarra TAFE at the West Nowra campus. We have achieved expansion of HMAS Albatross, the Main Road 92, a business incubator, the Albatross Aviation Technology Park, a $2 million ethanol fuel trial plant, and a new Centrelink building worth over $1 million. All in all some $90 million of government funding has come to the electorate of Gilmore.
What is more important about these achievements is the high level of community support received for each, which is essential in ensuring their success. It has always been a case of the community helping themselves, with myself and the government acting as facilitators. For example, 12 months ago Jobs Drive 98 and Jobs Drive 2, a total community and Job Network members' initiative with the local radio identity Barry Mac and Radio 2ST, raised $1.3 million 
 worth of jobs for local people. A second jobs drive held just last month raised $3 million worth of jobs for local people.
Following on from that, the success rate of our local Job Network providers has been enormous. The national statistics comparing the Job Network with the old CES show the network is an overwhelming success for both employers and job seekers. The evidence provided to me by local Job Network members is that the same situation is being repeated in Gilmore. The Job Network is placing more people and more jobs throughout the region including Ulladulla, Kiama, Moss Vale, Huskisson, Sanctuary Point and Nowra.
The Job Network members of Gilmore are to be commended for their initiative and professional approach to helping local people find employment. Keeping wages in the community and building confidence for job seekers shows that there are jobs available. This is of the utmost importance for me in Gilmore. This will all be demolished if the opposition proceeds with its plans to abolish junior wages. This would force more than 5,000 to 6,000 young people in Gilmore out of work and back onto social security. It is Labor, the party which presided over national youth unemployment levels of more than 36 per cent, that now wants to revert to the bad old days by abolishing youth wages.
In Gilmore, many of our young people rely on a retail part-time or full-time job to give them the experience they need to follow their career. Local employers rely on youth wages to enable them to provide such positions for local young people. Labor, once again, wants to deny these young people in Gilmore their opportunity. Too often it is easier to criticise. Frankly, our community is sick and tired of hearing Labor Party members carping on about this issue. They have no real solutions and no policies and the community has called on them to belt up and let us get on with the job of assisting unemployed people.
Let me repeat, we are aiming for our education precinct to be the best in New South Wales. The University of West Nowra campus is a $14 million investment. Add to that the education precinct which includes TAFE and possible tertiary facilities worth a further $10 million to $12 million. We all know that young people study better when they are at home. It is our aim to keep our young people in rural and regional areas, especially in Gilmore.
Another example is the proposed University of Southern Highlands where the federal government has funded a feasibility study into the establishment of such a facility. We are hoping to have another campus of the University of Wollongong in the Southern Highlands area of Moss Vale in my electorate of Gilmore for students to study a range of relevant subjects, and so far suggestions have been as diverse as music, archaeology and bushfire fighting.
I must also express my thanks to the Minister for Finance and Administration, John Fahey, the member for Macarthur, to Peta Seaton, the local state member for Southern Highlands, and to Mayor Sara Murray of Wingecarribee Shire Council, for their continued support in this visionary project. The success of this project so far proves once again that through a three-tier government approach and a supportive community we can help ourselves.
A lot has been said about the Natural Heritage Trust and so far Gilmore has benefited by more than $750,000, an amount which has been spent locally to assist volunteers in projects. Mr Deputy Speaker, colleagues, you would be aware that we have one of the most pristine environments in Australia, a national icon, and the fine line between development and environment is ever present. And yet, from the mountains to the sea, with many places to visit 
 and stay, our local national park, Booderee, attracts more visitors per year than Uluru and Kakadu put together.
It is gratifying to see that this government has actually put its money where its mouth is. The people of Gilmore, neglected by the previous government, have welcomed the much needed attention of the Commonwealth through vital projects such as the Natural Heritage Trust program. As I said, Work for the Dole, or Shoalhaven Earning a Living, has been a resounding success. Many have gone onto other full-time or part-time work or further education with lots stating that it provided the greatest incentive to get out of bed in the morning. In fact, it was so popular that many participants have already received full-time or part-time work.
One local young participant, when he came to Canberra earlier this year, was able to tell the Prime Minister in person that Work for the Dole was one of the most important measures to help our young people become motivated towards work. He said it was the best things that had happened to him since he had left school.
We have a number of very successful Green Corps projects—three projects locally. Again it was a wonderful opportunity for young people to work for the environment and for the community. It was another example of mutual obligation. Many have gone on to further education after 85 per cent graduated from the first program at Bundanon. Their teamwork has been one of their greatest attributes and it is a skill which will stand them in good stead for the rest of their careers. Not only is Green Corps a success for the participants, but also it helps promote a positive image of young people in the community.",REPS,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title>,<title>Address-in-Reply</title>,Address in Reply,49,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1998-12-03,"—I would like to speak in this adjournment today about the township of Mount Morgan, which has joined my electorate of Hinkler as at the last election. It is 679 kilometres north of Brisbane and 38 kilometres west of Rockhampton and 240 metres above sea level, with a population of approximately 3,200. Mount Morgan lays claim to being Australia's most charming mining town. Perching on the hills and nestling in the valleys, Mount Morgan is full of wooden Queenslander houses which echo a rich and vibrant history reaching back to the late 19th century. It is generally a very friendly place and has the feeling of a country town from another era.
Mining began in Mount Morgan in 1882 and has continued over 100 years. The town was named after Frederick, Ned and Thomas Morgan, who on 22 July 1882 pegged out a goldmine lease. Mount Morgan formed a six-man partnership with Rockhampton businessmen to mine the mountain. One of the partners in the syndicate was Thomas Skarrat Hall, whose brother's widow donated some of the Mount Morgan fortune to a fund which established the famous Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne. Another partner was William Knox D'Arcy who, having made an incredible $6 million from his share of the mine, in 1889 went to London and later made another fortune where he financed oil drilling in what was then Persia and now Iran. This venture was later to go on and help the formation of BP. The Mount Morgan syndicate lasted until 1886 when the Mount Morgan Goldmining Company was formed as a public company.
By 1902, gold, silver and copper were being mined. It steadily grew, becoming the largest open-cut mine in the Southern Hemisphere. It is even said that the mine helped prevent the Australian federation breaking up into individual states again by allowing its proceeds from the world's purest gold, 99.8 per cent, to be used to pay off the national debt of 1902. Production peaked before World War I but was in decline after the war, and by 1927 the company was in liquidation. Mount Morgan Ltd bought the mine in 1929 and started open-cut excavation. Peko Wallsend purchased the mine in 1968 and by the 1970s the mine's production of copper was second only to Mount Isa. When it closed in 1981, the mine had produced 225,000 kilograms of gold, 50,000 kilograms of silver and 360,000 tonnes of copper in its 99-year history. Gold today is still extracted from the tailings.
Mr Deputy Speaker, what I wanted very much to speak about was the fact that Mount Morgan, which is a beautiful town, has suffered unemployment as a result of the closure of the mine and the failure of governments of both political colours to find a new focus for the community. The unemployment rate is three times the national average, and services under 13 years of federal Labor and 6½ years of state Labor government wound down considerably. The town has now been further denuded by the loss of banking services. The ANZ Bank pulled out four years ago and the Commonwealth Bank in October. One cannot help thinking that had the Labor Party put community service obligations to the Commonwealth Bank at the time that it put it up for sale, a lot of this might not have happened.
—That is against your philosophy.
—It is against my philosophy but—
—The honourable member will pay no attention to the interjections.
—Being an agrarian socialist, Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept the gibe. The community is understandably angry—especially the business community, which was left without a cash depositing facility, and pensioners who lost the security of a basic banking service. To its credit, the community rallied and channelled its frustration in a positive way through a series of public meetings. I congratulate Kelvin Pill, who chaired two public meetings, after which the Mount Morgan Shire Council recognised the wishes of the community and went on contacting various banking, building society and credit union managements.
I subsequently explored various avenues through contacts with financial institutions. If a full facility does not occupy the current bank building, one bank is prepared to examine a new style of agency. The government's rural transaction centres are another option for the community.
