Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (10:08):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee's report entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2013 (first report), together with minutes of the proceedings.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Ms O'DWYER:
  I now wish to make a statement in relation to that report. I am very pleased to be presenting the first report of the economics committee for the 44th Parliament. The committee holds two public hearings each year with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and this report follows the first of these hearings for the new committee, on 18 December 2013, following the federal election.


The RBA noted in its November 2013 Statement on monetary policy that 'the prospect of a pick-up in conditions in many advanced economies is likely to see growth for the world as a whole improve from a below-average pace in 2013 to around average in 2014'. The RBA also forecast 'a little above average' growth in Australia's major trading partners in 2014.


Australian growth was two to three per cent of GDP in 2013 and the RBA assessment is that inflation will remain consistent with the medium-term target over the next one to two years.


The economies in China, the United States, Japan and Europe are all showing signs of recovery. The governor commented that global financial conditions remain very accommodative, market volatility has abated, and there is ample funding available for creditworthy borrowers.


Despite these initial signs of recovery in developed economies, there is still a lot of work required to avoid further economic instability.


The recent G20 meeting in Sydney has brokered a hugely significant accord to increase global growth by two per cent above the current trajectory over the next five years. Australia has an important role in helping to realise this goal by implementing policies that will achieve workplace reform and boost productivity.


At its December and February meetings, the RBA board judged that it was prudent to hold the cash rate steady at 2½ per cent given the substantial degree of policy stimulus that had been imparted and evidence of its effects. The board indicated in its February statement that market pricing suggests no change to the cash rate is expected for about a year.


In his statement on the board's decision, the governor stated that monetary policy is appropriately configured to foster sustainable growth in demand and inflation outcomes consistent with the target. The governor's view is that the most prudent course in this regard is likely to be a period of stability in interest rates.


The exchange rate has been a significant source of economic uncertainty and the Australian dollar has appreciated significantly over the past decade.


The governor commented that a lower rate is likely to be needed for balanced growth, which would also likely see a sooner than forecast growth increase with some upward pressure on inflation. The governor does not favour intervention in the exchange rate at this stage.


The RBA welcomed the one-off $8.8 billion grant to the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund which will be made by the government before the end of the financial year. The MYEFO states that this grant will ensure that the RBA is adequately resourced to conduct foreign exchange and monetary policy operations. The governor stated that this one-off injection of funds will be important in bringing the fund up to 15 per cent of the bank's assets at risk, the level sought by the RBA, on as early a schedule as possible.


Australia is transitioning to a post-mining-boom era with both the MYEFO and the RBA forecasting declining investment in the resources sector. This may create opportunities to invest in other sectors of the economy, including infrastructure. Such investments will be needed to realise productivity gains and future growth, but the decision making in this regard must be sound. I again note that Australia played a very leading role in hosting the G20 last week, as well as the business working group that is focused on how we can get more productivity-enhancing infrastructure not only in Australia but in those countries that are part of the G20.


Finally, on behalf of the committee I would like to thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Glenn Stevens, and other representatives of the RBA for appearing at the hearing on 18 December 2013. The committee looks forward to its next hearing with the governor this coming Friday in Sydney.


I commend the report to the House.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:13):  On behalf of the opposition I am pleased to speak to the review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2013. I thank the chair of the committee and also acknowledge the presence in the chamber of my colleagues the member for Rankin and the member for Charlton. I echo the sentiments of the chair in expressing gratitude for the time and assistance of the RBA governor and his senior executives who appeared before the committee in December. I also express appreciation for the great work of the committee secretariat.


While the world has managed to avoid the type of collapse feared in the aftermath of the worst economic conditions in nearly eight decades, many countries are still dogged by lower than average growth, stubborn unemployment and, in some cases, having had to cope with double-dip recessions. Since our prosperity can be affected by the health of our trading partners, the RBA's assessment of global economic strength is crucial. Looking to the world stage, the RBA noted in December that there were positive signs emerging from Europe, the US and China. But the tide of perception has started to shift, even since then. In Europe, for instance, anxiety about the future of the European financial system has been replaced by concerns, expressed via the IMF in January, about the signs of potential deflation. In the US, relief surrounding tapering has been muted by concerns—as expressed by new Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen—about soft data appearing over the last six weeks pointing to less favourable numbers on jobs, housing, retail sales and industrial production. In China the economy has defied predictions of contraction, but minds are directed towards a continued growth of its shadow banking system and its possible impact within and beyond China.


In the Australian context, we need to be exceptionally mindful of this—especially considering the RBA take on lower-than-trend growth. While keeping an eye on the soft world economy, we should be concerned about the possible impact on our own economy of confused and contradictory decision making. It is taking a long time for this government to respond in an adult way to the reality plaguing governments the world over—subdued economic conditions, sporadic job growth and revenue refusing to lift in the way it did. In many cases it appears that this government's actions could weaken our economy at a time when the world economy remains weak. We have seen a government unable to respond to job shedding occurring under its watch at the rate of one job every three minutes since its election. Retailers now express concerns about the impact of this on discretionary spending at a time when the RBA has observed subdued growth in private domestic demand.


We have seen a government send conflicting signals about fiscal strategy, contemplating contractionary expenditure cuts while planning to levy business to fund an excessive Paid Parental Leave scheme. We have seen a government block access to crucial foreign investment for firms like GrainCorp while seemingly chasing out of the country firms like Holden, but then seeking foreign capital for Qantas. We have also seen the government not only refuse to consider co-investment in firms that are helping boost economic activity in regional Australia, but then pressure these firms to aggressively cut wages and undermine purchasing power of families within those regions. Disturbingly, the RBA governor warned in December that it was:


… difficult to predict the timing and strength of the expected upturn in non-mining investment.


But in the last week we have seen new figures pointing to a sharp contraction in nonmining business investment at a time when it is needed to offset the anticipated slide in mining sector investment.


On top of this, while repeatedly trying to condition the broader public about expenditure cuts, this government's other spending decisions have been extraordinary, most notably its decision to grant the RBA close to $9 billion in government support, as referred to in this report. Although seeking to suggest the RBA was pushing for the grant, it was obvious from our hearings that the Treasurer himself had not only decided the grant should be paid but it was he and he alone that determined that the $8.8 billion in scarce funds should be paid in one lump sun. And while in claiming this money was urgently needed, the Treasurer avoided mentioning that the funds would not be paid immediately but sometime in first half of 2014 and that the RBA would actually be in a position to provide a dividend to the government in the second half of 2014. Most importantly, what is clear is that this money was not necessarily needed to shore up the RBA but that it was used to score political points by the Treasurer made at the expense of families or communities. You only have to scroll through the cuts contained in MYEFO and this becomes painfully clear. I commend the report to the House, but flag the opposition's concern about the excessively generous and ill-considered decision of the Treasurer to replenish the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund in the way that he determined.

Mr WILLIAMS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:18):  I move the motion relating to the South Australian economy in the terms in which it appears on the Notice Paper:


That this House notes:


(1)   with concern that unemployment in South Australia is higher than the national average;


(2)   that South Australia has a talented workforce that deserves a government determined to:


   (a)   reduce taxes and regulation;


   (b)   grow the state’s economy, and 


   (c)   liberate the people of South Australia to realise their destiny; and


(3)   that the Australian Government has a plan to build a stronger South Australian economy so that everyone can get ahead through abolishing the carbon tax, ending the waste, stopping the boats, and building the roads of the 21st century.


South Australia is my home. I have spent most of my life in South Australia and I am passionate about my state. Colonel William Light and the new settlers built the framework for a wonderful city surrounded by some of the best parklands and gardens. Everything about South Australia had a plan and a purpose. But not now.


In the postwar period South Australia, like pretty much all of Australia, was privileged to have a large influx of migrants—the '£10 Poms', the Greeks, the Italians and others from all over the globe. They came to South Australia to make a new start to escape the ravages of war-torn Europe. They came to our shores to live in an exciting new world that Tom Playford and others were creating. Former Liberal Premier of South Australia Tom Playford had a plan to invest in infrastructure, just as our current Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, has.


Up until the early 1980s, South Australia was larger than Western Australia as an economy. Adelaide was a thriving city that continued to be the home to many creative talents and commerce. We had many and several companies in the ASX 100 that had headquarters in South Australia, but now there are two. So what is the state Labor government doing, or what has it done, to fix the exodus of the South Australian companies or their failure to grow as quickly as other companies around Australia? It has decided that the best thing it can do is to give the businesses in South Australia the highest-taxing jurisdiction in the nation. I see no jobs plan in that.


South Australia needs and deserves a better government, a government that will reduce taxes. We are the highest-taxed state, and the state Labor government has been addicted to payroll tax, levies, the car park tax and high work cover. Just on the weekend, the members opposite would have seen in TheAdvertiser the Australian Industry Group, which looks after the manufacturing sector, say that the cost of doing business in South Australia is a significant issue. It wants to have a lower payroll tax and lower WorkCover levies.


Not surprisingly, since Labor got into power 12 years ago, manufacturing has declined and taxes have increased. There is a direct correlation there, and the members opposite know it. And they know that business creates jobs.


This is something that the state Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, has a great appreciation of, having worked in many businesses in South Australia. He knows how important it is to create an entrepreneurial culture and have a greater focus on exports. Steven Marshall has the drive and the energy to give South Australia a better future. State Liberals will reduce payroll tax. They will remove the car park tax and give businesses a better chance of employing people: more jobs and more incomes for families.


But the state Labor government has no ideas on how to tackle jobs and the jobs crisis engulfing South Australia. Over the last eight months, 25,000 full-time jobs have been lost. South Australia has the highest jobless rate in mainland Australia and the highest unemployment for 12 years. The only thing that Weatherill can do is control debt—or not control debt. And we have record levels of debt: debt, debt and more debt. The Premier and part-time Treasurer, Jay Weatherill, like the member for Lilley and the member for McMahon, has never delivered a surplus. It is just spend, spend, spend. It is the South Australian children who will have to cover the future payments on interest, the $2 million every single day that is going out of our economy—$2 million that could be spent on social infrastructure like schools, education and community projects. At a federal level, $10 billion a year could go to the same causes.


But Labor never consider this in the equation. They just like to spend, increase the interest repayments and get into more debt and more interest repayments. In South Australia, $2 million a day can go a long way to providing infrastructure. I thank the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, who is here, for joining the debate. He knows how important infrastructure is in South Australia to help our growing sectors of mining, resources and agriculture.


South Australia has had some great innovative companies over the years. It has had electronics companies at the high end, like Redarc and Codan, and food companies like San Remo pasta, Haigh's and Robern Menz. In the high-end section of creative industries we have Rising Sun Pictures, which does visual effects for Hollywood blockbusters. Philmac, in my electorate, is a leader in pipe fittings for the irrigation sector; and there is ASC, one of the largest defence projects in Australia, with the AWDs.


South Australians are a patriotic people and rallied behind Spring Gully when their business was threatened last year. This is a great example of how the power of the consumer can have a real, positive impact on a product. This is the message that I have been encouraging government, industry and residents in my electorate to keep in mind, and some people in the media in South Australia have got behind it as well. Leon Byner on FIVEaa, and The Advertiser, have been very active in promoting the benefits of supporting our local produce. But there are not enough companies and not enough employees, and many of our talented workforce have gone either interstate or overseas—30,000 during Labor's reign; a 30,000-person brain drain; 30,000 talented people interstate.


It is also the senior management of our larger corporates who are moving interstate: Hill's Holdings, Harris Scarfe and Adelaide Brighton. Our small business sector, which the member for Makin acknowledged when he spoke last week, was ignored—yes, it was ignored; ignored by the state Labor government and the federal Labor government. There were higher taxes and tougher conditions in doing business. This is what people said to me before the election, that they were facing some of the toughest conditions ever and that Labor and their taxes were not helping. People knew that, and the member for Makin knows that.


South Australia can recover; we need a change of government to give our economic future the best chance. Many regions, both locally and overseas—whether that be in the UK with the closure of coalmines or Germany in the Ruhr area—have faced similar challenges over many years. Newcastle and the Hunter Valley in New South faced a similar situation when the BHP steelworks closed in 1999, with more than 5,000 manufacturing jobs lost. In the 1990s their unemployment was above 10 per cent and reached 16 per cent at one stage.


But what did they do? They diversified their economy. They went into services and they looked at other areas. Like Adelaide, Newcastle has benefited from large defence contracts—most recently the Air Warfare Destroyer Program. This was announced in 2004 by the Howard Liberal government, the total value being over $8 billion. ASC Shipbuilding at Osborne was awarded the tender, and has Adelaide as its headquarters. It lists more than 25,000 people with the AWD alliance as part of that exciting project: high-end engineers and high-end manufacturing—a future for South Australia.


But now, our defence industry enters the potential 'valley of death' scenario. Why? Because the Howard government's commitment to AWDs was the last real investment decision made in shipbuilding by an Australian government. Labor talked the big talk, and Kevin Rudd committed to building submarines prior to the 2007 election. But six years later there have been no contracts and no definite plans. We are working as quickly as possible to rectify these problems from Labor's inaction, and to give certainty to South Australia's defence companies.


The coalition government has a plan to build a stronger economy, the new infrastructure that Jamie Briggs is working so hard to deliver: the North-South Corridor and $500 million committed for Darlington. I have been talking regularly to my federal colleagues about fast tracking the Torrens-to-Torrens project. Our commitments are part of billions of dollars nationally. We are reducing $1 billion in regulatory costs; the freighters, the industry groups, the resources and Business SA have all spoken to me about cutting red tape. I note in today's Advertiser that Liberal leader Steven Marshall committed to reducing red tape, saving $100 million a year. Another area in which we are helping small businesses—not ignoring them, helping them.


We are removing taxes, like the carbon tax and the mining tax, and I just want to touch on the minerals resource rent tax. It applies to iron ore, something that the Premier, Jay Weatherill, does not acknowledge. There are currently three operational iron ore mines in South Australia, with a further three approved under construction and 11 developing projects. The mining tax is not good for South Australia, and Weatherill needs to stand up to his Labor mates in Canberra and tell them to adhere to the wishes of the people at the last election and get rid of the mining tax.


The mining tax is a $1 billion hit on manufacturing. The carbon tax is a $4 billion hit on electricity. As stated by the South Australian Chamber of Mining and Energy last year:


SACOME welcomes the introduction of legislation to repeal the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT), in line with the Liberal party's election commitment to abolish the damaging tax.


They go on to say:


The MRRT is an unfair tax, and discriminates against South Australia in particular due to our vast amounts of magnetite iron ore, …


The Premier just conveniently missed this. (Time expired)

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:29):  I am not at all surprised that this motion has come before the House two weeks before the South Australian state election, because the South Australian Liberal opposition leader needs all the help he can get and the members here in the federal parliament are trying to do just that. Can I say in respect of the member for Hindmarsh's address that he has just presented to the House that it is full of political rhetoric and full of bland statements and aspirations but very light on facts.


I welcome the opportunity to speak to this motion, because I am happy to bring some facts to this debate. During Labor's first decade in office, between 2002 and 2010-11, the South Australian economy grew by 22.4 per cent. It did so at a time of great difficulty and it did so because we had a state Labor government that was focused on the state and focused on the things that were going to improve productivity in South Australia—and the things that it invested in are doing exactly that. I refer to things like the new medical health and research centre that was opened only last month, a magnificent facility that will not only create jobs but will be the focus of medical research not just for Australia but for many parts of the world, something that we can indeed be proud of. The new Royal Adelaide Hospital, which is currently underway, is also a sign of a government that is looking to the future, not the past, because the South Australian government understands the importance of a good health system to the everyday lives of the people of South Australia. More importantly, it is also about efficiencies, because if you operate from an old, tired and run-down facility, the medical costs to the consumers and to the state are much higher than if you have a better facility.


The extensions to the convention centre are already underway. I spoke to the manager of the convention centre in recent weeks, and the centre is booked out for months and months in advance. It is very important to bringing people to South Australia. The South Australian Labor government totally understands that, and that is why it is investing in expanding the facility to accommodate the growing demands for the use of it. We have seen the Adelaide Oval redeveloped. Again, not only will that bring more people into South Australia but it becomes an asset and a showpiece for local and international sporting events. It enables the South Australian government to boost the economic activity of the state, because it can attract international events, which you could not otherwise do.


I heard the member for Hindmarsh talking about South Road. It was the state Labor government that put on the agenda the improvements of the South Road from the Torrens Road to the River Torrens, opposed by those in this place and opposed by the Liberals in South Australia. They would have preferred to spend the money down south at Darlington, which they think it is more important, against the advice of the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure in South Australia. The people who know best have advised that the money should have been spent in the Torrens Road to River Torrens area, but, no, these folks knew better. What they knew better was where to spend money to hold seats that they were desperately in need of holding at the last federal election.


The state Labor government has also invested in the Northern Expressway and the new Superway, at the northern end of South Road—new roadworks which will improve productivity because they will save transport times. It is about having in place a government that understands what is needed if you want to improve efficiencies and productivity, enabling industries to operate much more viably and not only attracting new industries but keeping the ones that you have.


I want to talk a little bit about the issue of jobs. Just after the September election, Minister for Industry Macfarlane came out to visit GM Holden, because there was the discussion about its future. The member for Hindmarsh willingly came out, visited the plant, put on his fluoro vest and walked through the plant as though he was there to save Holden, along with Minister Macfarlane. What happened immediately after that visit? The Abbott government decided that it would turn its back on Holden. It did so by not only cutting $500 million of funding from the auto industry but also by saying to GMH and car makers in this country, 'There will be no further funding beyond 2017, and we're not going to make any decisions; we're going to handball the issue on to the Productivity Commission.' When they did that, where was the member for Hindmarsh? He became invisible. The fluoro vests suddenly disappeared. At least the member for Murray had the decency to come in and stand up for her community and her electorate.


The member for Hindmarsh went missing. He was happy to be seen when the cameras were there, but he was not prepared to stand up for GMH workers when the decisions were made. And he talks about jobs, yet the jobs that will be lost to South Australia as a result GMH not continuing in South Australia beyond 2017 will run into the thousands. There will be several hundred small businesses and their employees who will also be affected—because their futures and their livelihoods, depend on GMH. Nobody knows that better than the member for Wakefield—who is going to speak in a moment—and myself. We have been part of that community for decades. And can I say to the member for Hindmarsh: in terms of the unemployment figures, the northern parts of Adelaide needed GMH to continue if they were going to increase and sustain employment down there.


This does not stop with GMH. Before the election, members of the Liberal Party happily wore, 'I love the Murray' T-shirts and paraded themselves in front of this Parliament House. In South Australia, those opposite were happy to campaign on the fact that they were going to save the Murray River. But as soon as the election was over, where were they? They have turned their backs on $600 million of water buybacks which were critical to South Australia. They have turned their backs on the 450 gigalitres of additional water to put back into the river Murray, that we fought tooth and nail for. We did that because we understood the importance of restoring the flows to the Riverland fruit growers in South Australia, who had been doing it tough for a decade under drought and needed every drop of water they could get. If those growers are denied the water they desperately need, what does the member for Hindmarsh think that will do to productivity and to jobs in South Australia?


Those people are struggling to survive now—improving their productivity would mean jobs for the Riverland area and it would mean jobs for South Australia, because their produce goes to small-business people, wineries and the like. Yet members opposite were happy to campaign saying, 'We are going to save the Murray if you elect us', but then turn their backs on that as soon as they were elected. And—of all people—the member for Hindmarsh, who brings this motion into the House, has not said a word about the water buybacks or the 450 gigalitres of extra water that he knows we fought tooth and nail for. Premier Jay Weatherill led the charge in respect of ensuring that we got that additional 450 gigalitres.



Mr Briggs interjecting—




Mr ZAPPIA:
  I would just like to finish on this point: the member for Hindmarsh comes in here and talks about a government that is going to grow the economy and all the rest. Let me quote to him the headline of an article only this Friday on the front page of The Australian—not a paper that is supportive generally of Labor politics in this country.  The headline says: 'Investment spending will fall: Worst slump in 20 years'. This is what they predict under the new Abbott government—the worst slump in 20 years. And you cannot keep blaming what has happened in the past for what is projected to occur in the future—that view is based on the policies of the government of the day and the policies it is espousing for the future. Investors make decisions based on those things. And what they expect is the worst slump in 20 years—that is what people in this country have to look forward to under an Abbott government, and that is what they will have to look forward to in South Australia under the Liberals—if they are lucky enough to win the next state election. That worries me, because there will be further jobs lost in the manufacturing sector and in the mining sector. According to the same article, manufacturing is already down by 20 per cent, and mining is expected to fall by another 25 per cent. Both industries are critical to the future of South Australia—as they have been critical to South Australia for the last three or four decades. We need to support our mining. We need to support our manufacturing. We are not going to support them by implementing policies that are already scaring investors away from South Australia.


This motion is nothing more than a political stunt. The South Australian government is doing the right thing: preparing for the future, investing in the future, and ensuring that South Australia has a viable future— (Time expired)

"Pasin, Tony, MP",LP,2014-03-03,"



Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (10:39):  I am disappointed to hear the member for Makin indicate that discussion about disturbingly high unemployment rates in South Australia is nothing more than political point-scoring. That is not the case. High unemployment rates in South Australia are a matter of grave concern.


I am a passionate South Australian: I hope I have made as much clear in the first short while of being in this place. I think, effectively, my priorities are: No. 1, South Australia; No. 2, South Australia; No. 3, South Australia. In fact I feel so much about my state that despite being a passionate advocate and supporter of the Essendon Football Club, deep down when Port Adelaide and the Crows are playing a part of me hopes that they do well. But I am embarrassed by the state of the South Australian economy and I am ashamed by the South Australian government. 


In speaking to this, I thought I would get together a list of South Australian Labor state government's greatest hits. I am a fan of the greatest hits albums so I thought I would go through the list. I am grateful that we have the member for Wakefield and the member for Makin here to hear some of these. To be truthful, I am surprised that we have got northern suburb MPs arguing this case on behalf of 'Jay for SA'. I do note that there is a particularly nice ring to 'Don for later on'! When I first heard Jay for SA, I was in support of it because I thought it was Jay for South Africa and I was waiting in the departure lounge. 


But let us get back to the greatest hits. Small and medium businesses in South Australia have surely the worst business conditions in mainland Australia. Payroll tax is off the charts. Maybe the member for Wakefield could listen to this: the youth unemployment rate in the northern suburbs in Adelaide is at 45 per cent. Regional South Australia, thankfully, has an unemployment rate of eight per cent.




Mr Champion:
  What is it in Murray Bridge then? Tell us what it is in Murray Bridge. What's the youth unemployment in Murray Bridge? 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Craig Kelly
):  Order! Member for Wakefield, you will have your turn shortly.




Mr PASIN:
  Kick him out! It would be cause for great acclamation! What about some of these other greatest hits? I am pleased to say that in my region unemployment on average in regional South Australia is at about eight per cent and in the south-east, 6½ per cent. 


The jobless rate is of great concern. But Labor had a plan for this. The South Australian Strategic Plan proudly boasted that 100,000 jobs would be created in South Australia. What happened? Instead of creating 4,200 jobs a month, we lost 4,600 jobs a month. That sounds pretty important: you promise one thing but deliver another—and I am referring here perhaps to the carbon tax. But effectively, what has happened in South Australia is that we have transitioned 30,000 private-sector jobs to 20,000 public-sector jobs. That is the difficulty we enjoy in South Australia. We have a centralist state government that does not understand that it is private industry, private businesses, that create and support jobs.


It is not a surprise that we are losing these private-sector jobs. Economic conditions for running businesses in South Australia are the most difficult in the nation. Over a period of 12 years where CPI increased by 39 per cent, state taxes increased by—wait for it—92 per cent, gas bills by 136 per cent, electricity bills by 140 per cent and, not to be outdone, water bills by 227 per cent! Little wonder that businesses in South Australia, facing these imposts, are finding it difficult to create employment. I will not even go to the WorkCover rate, which is twice the national average.


What then? That is the bad news, but the darkest hour is of course always just before the dawn. The people of South Australia have an opportunity on 15 March to right the wrongs of the last 12 years and do what the Australian people did on 7 September and pass judgement on those that have delivered these greatest hits. South Australians want a South Australian government that understands that only a business-led recovery will deliver outcomes for South Australia. Steven Marshall and his team have a plan for that growth—lower taxes and less regulation. In my home town of Mount Gambier, I am pleased to say that Troy Bell from Mount Gambier will deliver that seat and help Steven Marshall deliver government.

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (10:44):  The member for Hindmarsh brings this motion to the House. It is always very interesting to see—the last time I saw the member for Hindmarsh roaming around this sort of rhetoric was down at Holden. He came through like a little meerkat, following the minister on his tour through Holden. Of course, we know what happened there. He toured the factory, disappeared for a while and then we never heard anything more until we saw Joe Hockey's daring of GM to leave.


The South Australians opposite talk a good game about the South Australian economy, but on that critical issue of Holden they all came down—Minister MacFarlane, the member for Hindmarsh and all these other people—and toured the factory, posed for pictures—




Mr Pasin:
  You wrote to them!




Mr CHAMPION:
  My friend knows that if there were a Labor government, Holden would have continued producing cars in South Australia.


But what happened was that the minister came down and toured the factory with a sort of crowd behind him—Liberal senators and the member for Hindmarsh—all touring the place. Then what did we get? 'Hockey dares GM to leave.' We know the subsequent chaos that was caused in the car industry and the automotive components industry with 50,000 jobs lost. That is what we are looking down the barrel of.


I notice that the language in part (c) of this motion says, in rather glorious terms:


(c)    liberate the people of South Australia to realise their destiny; and …


'Liberate' them—in this case, as the deputy leader says, 'Liberate them from their jobs.'


We know that that is what the Liberal Party plans to do because Tony Abbott, when he announced the $100 million plan to help Holden's closure—that has now been stretched to Geelong, Altona and to the whole economy of western Melbourne—said:


Prime Minister Tony Abbott says many Holden workers will be ""liberated"" by the loss of their jobs at the carmaker.


So we see the same language used—quite extraordinary language, that you might be 'liberated' by losing your job.


We know that around the world there is a debate going on: growth versus austerity—whether we grow the economy or whether we cut it back. That is the great debate around the world. The rest of the world tried austerity first and now they are clinging to growth. In this country we grew. We decided to grow the economy and the Liberals now want to rescue us from that growth by cutting—by austerity. That is the debate around the world, but the Liberal Party are going to get it back to front. They are going to save us from a growing economy. Only in this sort of strange, weird world that the Liberal Party and the member for Hindmarsh create are workers liberated by losing their jobs or liberated by factory closures. Only in this world does cutting taxes produce more revenue and balanced budgets. Only in this weird world; it is sort of voodoo economics.


We know what the Liberal Party plan is for South Australia. It is the same plan they had in New South Wales and it is the same plan that they had in Queensland. It is the same plan they have for the nation, which is a secret commission for cuts. They do not have the courage to tell the South Australian people about the cuts. We had the member for Barker talking about 20,000 public sector jobs but not having the courage to use the figures of the former SA opposition leader, Isobel Redmond, and in a wave of honesty admit they were going to cut 20,000 public sector jobs. That is what he wants to do; that is what he is intimating. That is what the secret commission of cuts will do.


We know that they will hold back on infrastructure. Whatever they say, Torrens to Torrens is ready to go; instead they will hold back. We know that they will wreck our shipbuilding industry, and they will not go ahead with the Collins class submarine. You can see them slowly getting around it. They have a US Navy general in charge of reviewing current shipbuilding. We can see them backing away from the Collins class. And so the questions before the South Australian people are, 'Do you want to continue with a growing economy, with cranes over the horizon of Adelaide? With growth? Or do you want to see cutbacks? Do you want to see austerity? Do you want to see job losses? Do you want to see the resulting economic damage?' You only have to look to Queensland and you only have to look to this parliament to see their plans in action: jobs lost and economic growth collapsing.

Mr Broadbent

Before the debate is resumed on this bill, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate be allowed covering this bill, the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2013-2014 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014. The question is that the amendment be agreed. I call the member for Charlton in continuation.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (12:00):  When I was speaking on this bill previously, I was going through the $11½ million cut to the Building Multicultural Communities Program grants—a cut that could have been avoided using just 10 days of the interest bill from the government's nakedly political injection of $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. As part of this cut to this grants program, we were seeing the Ethnic Communities Council of Newcastle and Hunter Region lose a $150,000 grant to build the first ever multicultural men's shed and a community garden at their community centre. Members from all sides of this House will be aware of the wonderful contribution that men's sheds provide to our community, and to have a multicultural men's shed was a truly innovative idea from the ethnic communities council. Ninety men had already registered to join this shed, and they have lost their $150,000 grant which was awarded in the previous government and fully budgeted for.


Given that the funding agreements for the program stated that the projects had to be completed by 30 June 2014, most organisations had begun the planning process, and many are now well advanced in their project and are considerably out of pocket. Vedic Samiti are out of pocket for more than $14,000 after undergoing a lengthy building design and development approval process, and the ethnic communities council has invested around $49,000 on plans, DA approvals, electrical works and site preparation. I am advised that on Tuesday, 25 February, the department called the ethnic communities council to advise they will reimburse $4,500 for costs associated with the lodgement of a development application to Newcastle council. However, they refused to acknowledge the more than $44,000 invested by the council in utilities fees, design, EISs and electrical work required to get the approval for the DA.


So these groups made the decision to invest in these projects in good faith; they had had their grants awarded, in accordance with the grants process; and now they are considerably out of pocket because of the actions of the Abbott government. These are groups that have very low budgets. They operate on a shoestring, often through the operation of goodwill and donations from the community. To see them out of pocket to such a great extent demonstrates the contempt this new government has for community groups.


I am sure that, like members on this side of the House, coalition MPs would have enjoyed attending citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day and welcoming our newest citizens. These ceremonies are wonderful demonstrations of our modern, multicultural Australia. I would just highlight the hypocrisy of this government: although they pay lip service to multiculturalism, they have in fact cut funding to the very groups that are on the ground making multiculturalism work.


In the time remaining, I would like to discuss another part of the appropriations bill, and that is defence funding. At the moment, we have the naval shipbuilding industry in crisis. The entire industry is in a crisis where they are waiting for work. Most of the shipyards in this country that build naval ships—Forgacs in the Hunter, and BAE at Williamstown and Henderson—are looking at work running out in the next year. We are looking at between 4,000 and 5,000 job losses if nothing is done, including 900 jobs going in my region of the Hunter Valley. Once lost, these jobs will be very hard to rebuild—and we will need to rebuild them because, under the current white paper, the Royal Australian Navy will need to acquire 40 major naval vessels in the next couple of decades.


It is essential that we build most of these ships if not all of them here because there is a direct link between the ability to build a naval vessel and the ability to maintain them. As an island nation it is essential for our national sovereignty that we can maintain our own naval vessels so that we are not dependent on any other nation in the world.


Labor had a solution, and we took to the last election a proposal to bring forward the replacement of two supply ships and to guarantee a minimum amount of work being provided in Australia with a real opportunity for both ships to be built entirely within this country. This would have helped Forgacs and it would have helped BAE, who would have had to compete for the work but would have had a decent shot at overcoming the shipbuilding valley of death that they currently face.


There are other options, including building a fourth air warfare destroyer, advancing the replacement of the patrol boats that have seen some operational maintenance difficulties, or beginning early construction of our frigate replacements based on a hull modelled on the AWD. All of these options are worth exploring, but we need urgent work to resolve this issue.


If these shipyards, most particularly BAE in Melbourne and Forgacs up at Tomago, do not receive the opportunity to bid for new contracts shortly, they will have to start making workers redundant, and this will lead to 4,000 to 5,000 direct job losses and the impact on families and communities, not to mention the impact on other communities that depend on that work, whether those are steel suppliers or other specialty subcontractors.


This will be not only an economic and social impact; it will be an impact on our national defence. Once these jobs are lost, they will be very hard to rebuild and, as an island nation, this will be a great tragedy that will reduce our national sovereignty. So I urge the new government to find a solution quickly on this. They were briefed on this when they were in opposition. There should be a bipartisan approach. No-one wants to score political points on this. We need a solution; otherwise, we will see thousands of jobs going, devastating communities that have already seen significant job losses, whether it is in the Hunter Valley or in Melbourne, where they saw the loss of Toyota and other industries from that region.


I urge the new government to take action on this. I will be working very closely with the employers, the unions and the workforce in my area. I have already talked to Mr Lindsay Stratton, the CEO of Forgacs, a few times about this issue, and I have spoken to the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, which represents the workers on this site. This is an important issue. I urge the government to take action, not sit on their hands and wait for a new white-paper process. We need an urgent resolution now, or we will lose thousands of jobs and face a reduced national capability.


This appropriations bill contains a number of initiatives. Some of them are nakedly political, like the $8.8 billion injection into the Reserve Bank in one year, which will see dividends paid only six weeks later back to the government. It yet again demonstrates the skewed priorities of this government. It is all about superficial politics, not acting in our national interest.

Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (12:08):  I rise to speak in favour of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2013-2014 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014 and against the opposition amendment. Can I just take the point that the member for Chifley just raised in relation to—




Mr Conroy:
  Charlton!




Mr HOGAN:
  Sorry, Charlton. Sorry, Member for Charlton; apologies to the member for Chifley. On the point about the $8.8 billion for the one-off grant to the RBA: I have the privilege of being on the Standing Committee on Economics, and we had the Governor of the Reserve Bank come to a meeting in late December. There was much toing and froing about this from different members of the committee. It sounded to me as though there was almost a conspiracy feel about this according to members of the opposition. But I asked the governor a question. I said, 'Do you think it is a good thing or a bad thing, Governor, that this $8.8 billion grant be given to the RBA?' His exact words were, 'This is something that I welcome because it restores the capital position of the bank to where I would like it to be.' So, while we may make much toing and froing about who said what to whom, who made what phone call on what day or who said what to whom in the meeting, his response to that was that he welcomes it. He appreciates, probably more than anyone else, even anyone in this House, the importance of the Reserve Bank's capital position and that it be reinstated as quickly as possible due to the role that that reserve plays due to foreign currency fluctuations and everything else that the RBA needs it for.


Another part of this appropriation legislation obviously is for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. This debate I think is sometimes lost in the debate that we have in the public and in the media about this. When we talk about people seeking asylum in Australia, sometimes it is forgotten and sometimes it is lost that there is bipartisan support for Australia—given that we are a relatively wealthy country—to take in asylum seekers every year, and in fact we do. We take in 13,750 asylum seekers each and every year. Not only do we take them in; we make sure that we look after them to help their settlement into Australia. We do that through a variety of programs. We do it through housing programs and education programs. We do it in many other ways to make sure that they are not just left by themselves but find their transition into life in Australia as easy as we can make it.


That is why we cap the program. We do not take in hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers every year. Some countries have many more asylum seekers arriving on their shores every year, but those countries tend not to do anything for them. They just leave them by themselves. They do not have any rights, and they are certainly not given government assistance. That is not the Australian way. When we take in our asylum seekers, we want to look after them, which is why we cap the program at the 13,000 to 14,000 that we do.


The approach that we have taken to this has been in the context of a very highly and emotionally charged debate. I appreciate the passions on either side of this because I think that behind both sides of this argument there are good intentions and there is goodwill, in the sense that we get this right. In my mind, I look back at the statistics. I look back at what was happening at the end of the Howard government era. At the end of the Howard government, I think there was a detention centre that had three or four people in it. And it is important to remember that, while we only had three or four people in a detention centre, we were still taking in 13,750 people each year—as we should—and we were housing them and giving them education programs and language programs to help them settle. So, while the detention centres had closed, we were still taking in asylum seekers.


What happened? I will give some credit to the Rudd government maybe that their intention was good. When the Rudd government came in, they thought that the policies—and we know what they were; they were temporary protection visas, offshore processing and turning back boats if and when it was safe to do so—were harsh. They felt that the image of that to the international community or even the Australian community was too harsh. Let us assume for a second that their intention behind changing that policy was admirable, but let us look at the results.


The results were that the people-smuggling business started up again. This is a tragedy. I certainly do not want to sound political about this, but I am just stating the fact. The tragedy was that obviously we saw many drownings and deaths at sea because the people-smuggling business started up again. And we certainly had a lot of cost blow-outs again when we had to start to reopen detention centres, and we had a whole process that the previous government had had to start to pre-empt. I stand here and I think that we all want the same result in some ways in this country about this issue, in the sense that we do not want detention centres. Obviously the whole purpose of having offshore processing is to deter so that there is no demand for that. Again we see the government's policies. It is part of this appropriation bill that the policy we are implementing in relation to immigration and border protection is a good one.


When I look at appropriation bills, I look more broadly and see that these bills are always about economic management. You look younger than I, Deputy Speaker, so you might not remember as far back as I do. My first memories of economic management were the Whitlam days. At that stage, the Labor Party had not been in power for a long time so I think you can excuse some of their mismanagement., but we had a bit of chaos with them. We had the Khemlani loans affair and things happening, as far as economic management goes, that did not suit our country well. With the next Labor government, we had Hawke and Keating. Let us give credit where credit is due: certainly, as Treasurer, Paul Keating implemented some policies that he and the country should be quite happy with. But we also had the recession that we had to have, according to him. We had 18 per cent interest rates. Very tellingly, we were again left with a $96 billion debt.


I want to come to debt in a minute, given we are talking appropriation bills. Let us assume we are looking at this from a distance. The Howard-Costello government came in and they paid back all of that debt. The $96 billion was completely repaid. They put $50 billion into the Future Fund, which was unfunded superannuation liabilities we had for public servants. To have given those public servants surety about their superannuation is a wonderful thing. It is well documented, as you know, that in that government's last year alone we were left a $20 billion surplus.


We then get the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Everyone in that government would have observed the Whitlam experiment. They saw what Hawke and Keating did—that they did some good things but left us with a big debt. They saw the good economic management of the Howard-Costello years. What did they learn from that? What did the Rudd-Gillard government that learn from that? It would seem not much, because unfortunately we had the six biggest deficits in the history of our country. We had a global financial crisis during that period and there were certainly some elements where you could say that government needed to step in and do some things. I do not think anybody argued with that. But we would say again that some of those were mismanaged. I will not list them all, but some of the more obvious ones are the batts and the overpriced school halls. We have had some examples with the NBN rollout, where it looks like there has again been very wasteful spending.


But what does this mean? If you are the average punter, or the average mum and dad in the street, what does this mean? These deficits or debts, what do they mean for you? Is it an issue for you? It is—because the issue is that now, because of those six years, we have an interest bill. We all have mortgages or run a business and so we know what this means. We have an interest bill of $10 billion a year.


We stand in this House right now, and I have heard people from the opposition talk about this terrible stuff that is going on with things that the member was talking about previously—cuts, or being tough on multicultural programs. No-one wants to do that. No-one wants to be in government and say to a program, 'We are not going to give you as much money as we previously did.' But imagine if we had not had the six years of the Labor government and, now, the $10 billion a year we are paying in interest. Imagine how much better life would be for everyone in this country. This year we are paying $10 billion in interest, for which we will get nothing. We will get nothing: no service, no money to Gonski, no money for the NDIS, no money to the multicultural programs that the previous member was speaking about. This is $10 billion in interest which will just go to the people who we borrowed the money from. Then what happens? Next year, again, the same thing happens. Again we will have a huge interest bill. Again money will not go to infrastructure. We would love to have the money for infrastructure. Money will not be going to government programs or to very worthy causes.


Here we are in 2014, with the biggest debt in our history. We are overregulated and it is expensive to do business in this country. This is what the challenge is for the new coalition government: to get us back on track again and put our budget and our finances in a financially-sustainable position. Members on the other side are often very righteous about children and say that we need education and programs or services for our children, and rightly so. But the other thing that our children do not deserve is to be left a debt and an interest bill that will mean their standard of living and the services they get for themselves and their children is less than ours. That is the challenge for this new government. We know the budget repair work has already begun. We know that the reduction of red tape has already begun.


Interestingly enough, after the election I was talking to my community. They were coming to me about lowering red tape. I thought it would be predominantly small business. It is, but guess who else is in my office? Guess who else is talking to me as I walk around the community? It is not just a small business. It is non-government organisations and not-for-profit organisations; in fact, it is often members of the public sector themselves. I have had examples of schoolteachers stopping me at sporting events and saying, 'I have had to fill out eight pages in a risk assessment to walk my kids two blocks to get them here, or for this or for that.' That, too, is an example of wasted time and wasted resources. We all in this chamber come here with good intentions. We want the best for our children. We want the best for people in our community who are disadvantaged and we want the best for everyone now and in the future.


I want to recap on three important issues from these appropriation bills. One is the $8.8 billion grant. I reiterate: the Governor of the Reserve Bank said he welcomed it. I spoke about the border protection element of this appropriation bill too. I said that everyone in this country welcomes the 13,000 to 14,000 asylum seekers who come every year in an orderly way and who do not risk their lives. We look after them when they get here. We give them education, language and housing programs to make them assimilate. I know that this government—with the economic mismanagement that we have seen over the last six years, which has given us a $10 billion interest bill that does not go to any services or any infrastructure—will undergo a budget repair bill that puts our country's finances back in order so that our children and our children's children are not left with a Labor legacy of debt and a lower standard of living.

Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (12:22):  Before the election, the coalition said: 'If debt is the problem, more debt is not the answer.' Obviously, we have seen a change of heart since the election. In fact, we have probably seen the truth of where the Abbott government really stands when it came to the question of debt. Before the election, we also saw the coalition in this place, time after time, criticise the previous government for negotiating with and talking to members of the minor parties, including the Greens. They were particularly critical of the previous government's 'wheeling and dealing', as they put it, with the Greens. But, again, since coming to office, we have seen the Abbott government, immediately they have a problem, jump into bed with the Greens and get their support to increase or do away with the debt ceiling—another clear example of the government having said one thing before the election and acting completely differently after they have been elected.


They needed to increase the debt ceiling for, I think, two key reasons. Firstly, on coming to government they found that it is about more than just giving the community three- or four-word slogans and simple political rhetoric; it is about managing the economy. They have proven that they are incompetent at managing the economy. So, one of the reasons they have to increase their debt ceiling is that they know that, under the Abbott government, debt is going to rise.


Secondly, it is clear that the Abbott government's policies are in fact destroying confidence in Australia's future. Earlier on, when I was speaking on another matter in this place, I talked about confidence in Australia's future being destroyed and quoted a headline from The Australian of last Friday: 'Worst slump in 20 years hits jobs'. This article talks about confidence over the coming period—not in the past or today, but in the coming period. It is clear that Australian industry and the Australian people are losing faith and confidence in this government.


Why wouldn’t you lose confidence in this government? After all, they come in here with one view one day and a different view the next. Let me give some examples of that. When it suits the Abbott government, they are all in favour of foreign investment. Yet, when it does not suit them, they are opposed to it. We saw that with the GrainCorp sale. On one hand, they did not support that; on the other hand, they come into this place and talk about selling off Qantas. One day they are in favour of foreign investment; the next day they are against it.


We saw the same with industry support. They were opposed to industry support when it came to SPC Ardmona and the motor vehicle building industry in this country, but they were happy to give out $16 million to Cadbury. They support industry one day; they are opposed to supporting it the next. One day they are critical of government debt and then, the next day, they unnecessarily add to government debt by providing an additional $8.8 billion to the Reserve Bank, without any justification and without any request from the bank, to my knowledge, for that $8.8 billion. They were happy to increase the debt when they did not have to. It was the same with education. Before the election, the coalition was at one with Labor over Gonski funding. After the election, we saw a backflip. Everything is now off the table and the government are renegotiating their education funding. They are doing a terrible job of that, and I can say that having spoken to people in the education system in my home state.


All of that undoubtedly leads to a lack of confidence. We have seen that lack of confidence across a whole range of sectors, in particular the mining sector and the manufacturing sector. The article I referred to from The Australian, 'Worst slump in 20 years hits jobs', specifically talks about the future of manufacturing and mining in this country and the downward trend that is expected in those two sectors—both sectors that have been, to date, critical in underpinning the economy of Australia. Manufacturing is expected to fall by another 20 per cent over the coming year, and mining by a further 25 per cent. In fact, I have seen reports that tens of thousands of jobs are expected to be lost in the mining sector over the coming years. Again, it does not say much for the Abbott government when industry are making decisions based on expectations that things are going to get worse—a clear lack of confidence in this government.


Because there is a lack of confidence in the government, it is not surprising that there is also a blowing-out of government debt. That is why the Abbott government needed to lift its debt ceiling—because of their policies and their incompetence. The Abbott government's policies are directly adding to the national debt. The argument of the Abbott government in constantly blaming the previous government is wearing thin with the Australian people. They are waking up to the inability and incompetence of this government.


When industries close, government tax revenue also falls. When unemployment rises, government expenditure also rises. When government program funding is severely cut, economic activity declines. The effects of severe austerity measures, as seen in some European countries and some parts of the USA, are now evident for us to learn from. Clearly, they do not work. What you get as a result of severe austerity measures are higher unemployment, worsening economies, worsening business confidence, more bankruptcies and, ultimately, less government revenue. Again, that all means higher government debt. Conservative governments then start the cycle all over again and it becomes a downward spiral for those economies where conservative governments have applied severe austerity measures.


This is a matter that was very well articulated only two weeks ago at a forum at Adelaide university held by three or four academics, who had spent their time studying the effects of austerity measures across Europe and the USA. I understand that the notes and discussion from that forum can be downloaded. For those who attended, and I was one of them, it is quite concerning to see the negative effects that severe austerity measures have on the people of those countries, and how they simply do not work. What they really do is make situations worse, add to the economic difficulties of the countries involved and make tough economic times even worse.


There is another motive behind the rhetoric used by the Abbott government when it comes to making what they call the tough decisions that they need to make. Making tough economic decisions, as they put it, is nothing more than a convenient excuse by the Abbott government to attack workers, their wages and their conditions. That is exactly what the Abbott government are doing. We saw an appalling example of that when they attacked the workers at SPC Ardmona in Victoria. When you look at the facts of what those workers were earning, at the attacks that were made and the blame that was sheeted home to the workers for the difficulties at SPC Ardmona, it is really quite appalling. Those workers were not being paid any more than basic wages. In fact, I would like to see government members in this place suggest that they would like to be earning the sort of money that those workers earn. I am sure that they would not, yet they are happy to come into this place and criticise those workers.


It does not stop with the workers at SPC Ardmona. We saw the same attacks on the workers of this country when it came to the difficulties that GMH have been facing, that Toyota have been facing, and that Qantas have been facing. The Abbott government always blame the workers. Making the so-called tough decisions is a convenient excuse to attack the workers of this country and, in so doing, to start to bring down their wages and their conditions. Under this government, we have seen a loss of some 63,000 jobs since it came to office. We have seen jobs lost at SPC Ardmona. We will see the motor manufacturing industry come to an end in 2017, if not before. I suspect that as a result of decisions that have already been taken many of those companies will start winding down before that. We have seen jobs lost in a swag of other industries like Electrolux, Simplot, Caterpillar, Peabody and so on. All those job losses will result in a worsening budget outlook.


I want to comment on one of the other excuses we often hear from the government for the state of the economy—that is, the carbon tax. Only today I heard a government member suggesting that the reason Qantas are in trouble is the carbon tax bill. If that is what the government truly believe, the government always has the option of returning the carbon tax bill back to Qantas by way of a direct grant, a loan, a loan guarantee or a combination of all three. It is within the power of the government to act if it really believes the carbon tax is the cause of the problems at Qantas. The truth is that it is not and the government knows it, and that is why it will not act. It hides behind the excuse that the Labor opposition are standing in the way of the repeal of the carbon tax.


The government talks a lot about sound economic management, but in truth it has no answers and no policies. It is the government's policies that are actually damaging the bottom line of the budget. I want to talk about one of those policies which has not been clearly articulated when it comes to the loss of car-making in this country. When that industry is lost, Australia will lose about $3 billion in exports. It will also import an additional 100,000-odd cars a year, based on today's figures. What do members opposite think that will do to the balance of trade for this country and the budget bottom line? It will have a negative impact on it. But, again, have members opposite and the government considered those outcomes when they talk about their refusal to support industry in this country? They are critical of government debt, critical of the balance of payments and critical of debt generally, but their policies are going to add to the debt figure.


I have talked about some of the jobs that have already been lost, but it goes further than that. This is about the government rhetoric that the budget is in a mess, that we have massive debt and that the government have to fix it. It is a narrative that has been deliberately exaggerated for blatant political purposes. It has been exaggerated to cover their incompetence; to justify the harsh cuts that they will not talk about but which their Commission of Audit will undoubtedly recommend for the May budget; to attack the workers of this country; to attack the unions and give themselves cover for doing that; and to justify turning their backs on the environment and the environmental measures that were put in place by the previous government in order to create a balance between economic productivity and development and sound environmental management.


They run that narrative, exaggerating the budget position so that they can cut social outlays in this country—cuts to health, cuts to housing, cuts to education, cuts to disability support and so on. The worst of all, might I say, is the imposition of a GP tax of $6 every time someone visits a doctor. That, to me, scrapes the bottom of the barrel in terms of the desperation of this government: hitting people who need the most support at the time when they are looking after the their health.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2014-03-03,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (12:37):  I am very pleased to be speaking today in favour of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014 and cognate bills and against the amendment moved by the opposition. These appropriation bills represent one of the first steps for the government in cleaning up the very substantial mess we have been left with by the previous Labor government, and what a mess it is. It is a mess which has quite a wide range of aspects to it. One of the most critical parts of that mess is the debt situation which, unfortunately, our nation is now burdened with.


The previous government came in with no net debt and, in fact, with money in the bank, but we are faced with very substantial net debt of circa $200 billion. We also have a situation where that debt is set to grow substantially unless the government acts. The extraordinary thing is that, over the next four years of forward estimates, MYEFO has estimated that $123 billion of additional deficits will be added to what is already a very sore and sorry budgetary position—a very substantial addition to the debt we would face should we follow the policies of the previous government. Even worse, MYEFO forecasts that, over the next decade, if the budgetary position is not addressed, the debt of the Commonwealth by the end of that period would be some $667 billion—that is, two-thirds of a trillion dollars, a completely unacceptable situation.


Labor governments over a long period have not been able to balance the books. The last time a Labor government had a surplus budget was 1989—a very long time ago. Labor had deficits in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and then there were more deficits in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd period in 2008, 2009 , 2010, 2011 and 2012. Had it happened occasionally, in maybe one or two years during a particularly difficult economic period, it might be understandable. A reasonable person might say that they can understand why it was necessary to temporarily go into deficit for one or two years, but that is not the situation which occurred under the previous government. What occurred under the previous government and under the one before that was structural ongoing deficit, an addiction to spending and an inability to spend less than revenue taken in. That is the simple nub of the issue. If you consistently spend more than you take in, you are going to get into trouble. That is the case for families, for small businesses in my electorate and right around the nation, and it is certainly the case for governments. Cleaning up that debt position is certainly one of the key tasks for this government.


How did this situation arise? However could it get that bad? One of the key areas where we saw a huge blow-out in expenditure under the last government was border protection, or the lack thereof. When the previous government came in, the border security policies of the Howard government were working very effectively. As the previous member mentioned, a strong humanitarian program was in place and was being managed in an orderly fashion, and illegal boat arrivals had slowed to virtually none. The previous government said, 'Let's change what is working extremely well. Let's fundamentally dismantle a system which is serving the Australian people extremely well, and in the process let's spend billions and billions of dollars of borrowed money.' That is the sad reality of the previous government's border security policies, which saw a budget blow-out of more than $6 billion and spending of $11 billion or more.


There were many examples of this sort of policy on the run, lack of attention to detail and lack of understanding of how to manage programs in an operational sense. It is very easy to put out a press release. It does not take a long time. You type it up, you send it out and it is very simple. It is much harder to manage organisations effectively, especially organisations of the size and complexity of the federal government. Under the previous government we saw an addiction to the media cycle—to responding to the day's events—often in a way that was detrimental to the financial position of this country, feeding into the huge debt burden which we now face. A prime example of that was the decision in relation to live animal exports. The electorates of many members from your home state of Queensland, Deputy Speaker Vasta, and from other parts of the nation were affected very significantly by the former government's knee-jerk reaction, pretty much overnight, to abandon the live export industry. The extraordinary thing about that was the fact that it was such a harsh and ill-considered plan, taken so quickly, which had a huge negative impact on ordinary families right around the country, so much so that the previous government acknowledged their mistake and said, 'We'd better put together some sort of assistance package for these communities, which we've hit so hard with this poor policy.'


That assistance package cost about $100 million. If those opposite had not banned the industry overnight in such a superficial and shallow fashion, they would not then have had to spend $100 million trying to rescue it. It was a really relevant example of the lack of management expertise of the previous government. It was also a lack of financial acumen and a lack of respect for money, which was not only in evidence in the big programs such as the pink batts and the NBN—really a national joke under the Labor Party—but also in small programs that really give you an interesting and scary insight into the way the previous government used money.


One example of a lack of acumen was the spending on advertising of border protection policies prior to the last election. You might recall that there were very scary newspaper ads and gravely intoned radio advertisements supposedly targeting people smugglers and encouraging them to not ply their trade but which were, oddly, aired in rural, regional and metropolitan Australia where people smugglers are not typically based. There was about a $2 million spend on that program. In the scheme of an enormous budget it was a relatively small amount of money but it tells you something very important about the attitude towards spending of the previous government. What it tells you is there was a lack of respect for those funds and a lack of appreciation of the fact the government does not generate income.


The government does not create economic activity; the government is simply the beneficiary of it through taxation. So all of that money that the government takes in has in fact been created by the hard work of Australian families and Australian businesses whether through pay-as-you-go tax, company tax or capital gains tax. Whatever the source of revenue, the government did not do any of that work. The government did not work 40 or 50 hours a week having its tax taken out. The government did not take an entrepreneurial risk and employ people and really put its neck on the line to generate economic activity. The government did not do any of those things. The government was simply the beneficiary of that hard work. For the government to treat that money without respect was absolutely wrong.


It is a big task that we face. These appropriation bills represent one of the first steps in addressing it. There are some important steps that have already been taken by this government. So many projects were held up that the Minister for the Environment has given approvals for some $400-billion worth of environmental projects, infrastructure projects and the like. That means jobs in the creation of those projects and it also means ongoing economic benefit from the fact that those projects will exist.


Anyone who is in business, especially small business, does not like red tape. Frankly, if you are in business big or small, you have got better things to do than fill out forms for the government. You are worried about your business, you are worried about employing people and you are worried about paying the bills. The last thing you want to do at eight or nine o'clock at night when the day is done is get your HB pencil out and start filling in some forms for the government. Wherever we can minimise that regulatory burden, that is exactly what we should do.


The member for Kooyong has a tremendous initiative, 'repeal day', coming up soon when the government will be legislating to repeal more than 8,000 regulations—which is a particularly important initiative for the government. We have got to get rid of the carbon tax, of course. The carbon tax is causing such a drag on the economy at the moment. The comments of Mr Borghetti, the CEO of Virgin Australia, were well reported last week and demonstrated that the carbon tax has numerous impacts. One impact is the financial cost to the companies that have to pay it and to the households that have to pay higher electricity and other bills. The other impact is the contraction of economic activity which results from those additional costs. As in any business, if you have additional costs then that is a problem for you and you need to adjust your activities; perhaps cut back in a certain area or not do something you were planning on doing because you now have this additional cost. If that cost was not in place, it would not be necessary for such significant changes to have to occur. So getting rid of the carbon tax is absolutely fundamental and an important initiative for the government.


Free trade is a great driver of economic activity. The government has already got strong runs on the board with the South Korean free trade agreement, which will take tariffs off some 99.8 per cent of Australian products into South Korea. Importantly for my electorate of Banks, the government is working on a free trade agreement with the Republic of China. My electorate has the largest number of people of Chinese background of any electorate in Australia. There is a very warm and close relationship between my electorate and the people of China. We have many students here from China who are studying in our universities and colleges, and many businesses in my electorate work closely both in imports and exports with China and related markets. Free trade is an important part of the government's agenda and those discussions with China certainly will be of great benefit to my electorate.


These appropriation bills are an important first step in addressing the enormous mess that the Labor Party has left behind. It is incumbent on a new government to look honestly at the situation, to look the Australian people in the eye when things are not right and say they are not right, and say we are going to put them right. As the Prime Minister and Treasurer said, not all of those decisions are easy. Not all of those initiatives are simple to take but they need to be taken because we cannot just sleepwalk into the future as the previous government was doing. We cannot just keep spending and spending like money is going out of fashion. We need to take an orderly and sensible approach to financial management. We need to make sure that when we spend a dollar of the people's we are asking ourselves: 'Is this a good use of their hard-earned funds? Is this something that needs to be done?' And, if it is not something that needs to be done, then it cannot be done.


Managing the budget carefully is absolutely critical. The fact that we are on track for a debt position of some two-thirds of a trillion dollars in 10 years if we do not change course is a frightening statistic. It is something we cannot allow to happen. It is certainly not something that this government will allow, because we will be making a number of important changes to get this country back on track, and passing these appropriations bills is an important step in that.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:53):  I rise today to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014 and related bills and on Labor's worthy amendments.


I have listened to a number of my colleagues speak on these bills over the last week, and I must say it has left me with feelings of utter despair. It was despair I felt as my colleagues pointed out the gross hypocrisy and dishonesty of those opposite in their approach to spending—most evident in their blatantly political injection of $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank. It was despair I felt as my colleagues detailed the cuts to health and education—a flagrant breach of the coalition's pre-election promises not to cut health or education. It was despair I felt when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition detailed the cuts this government is making within the foreign affairs and international development portfolio, cuts that are hurting those most in need in our very own region—in Asia and the Pacific—despite this government's promise to make our region the focus of its international development policy.


There are a number of aspects of these bills that I would like to speak about today. The first is the $13.2 million being ripped from the health portfolio in this financial year. I am not the only one who recalls that prior to the election those opposite promised no cuts to health. On the eve of the election—1 September 2013, to be exact—then opposition leader, now Prime Minister Tony Abbott, appearing on the ABC's Insiders program said:


And I want to give people this absolute assurance: no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, and no changes to the GST.


But, since coming to power, the government's record in health has included: ripping $100 million from the Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital; abolishing the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council; backflipping on the promise not to close any Medicare Locals; abolishing the expert panel on the marketing of infant formula; and placing the jobs of departmental staff at risk and moving those awaiting redundancy to a permanent departure lounge. Based on its record so far, it would appear that the Abbott government has no vision for the health portfolio other than to make cuts.


I would like to talk today about one of the cuts that has already been inflicted. Last Friday, after 48 years of providing frank and fearless advice to policymakers, the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia closed its doors for good. This closure came after the Assistant Minister for Health—the minister responsible for the preventative health of Australia—Minister Nash, inexplicably cut ADCA's funding late last year.


ADCA was the non-government national peak body representing the interests of the alcohol and other drugs sector. Established in 1966, it has provided a voice for those who work to reduce the harm caused by alcohol and other drugs for nearly half a century. ADCA was based in my electorate of Canberra, just a couple of kilometres from where we are right now, but it worked for the betterment of all Australians, as well as for our neighbours in Asia and the Pacific who can learn from our experience in this space.


Some of the services that had been provided by ADCA, which will now no longer be provided, include: National Drug Sector Information Service; the Register of Australian Drug and Alcohol Research; the National Inhalants Information Service; the drug database; Drugfields—a professional development, policy and practice information service for the Australian alcohol and drug sector; 'Update', an alcohol and other drugs information bulletin board; Drug Action Week, which is incredibly popular; 'Drug talk', an alcohol and other drugs discussion list; and, of course, their one-of-a-kind, incredible library of resources.


The decision to axe ADCA truly came out of the blue. Earlier last year, under the Labor government, ADCA received an assurance of its ongoing funding. And, on 14 October last year, Prime Minister Abbott wrote to ADCA and said, 'I look forward to working with you in the years ahead.' Just six weeks after the Prime Minister had written these words, ADCA was axed. Understandably, many have been wondering why.


Why, after nearly fifty years of representing the Alcohol and Other Drugs Sector, is this the only government which has decided it does not need ADCA's advice? Is it because ADCA's support of the Australia 21 report on the prohibition of illicit drugs was too progressive for this conservative government? Is it an internal political decision we do not understand—given former Liberal MP the Hon. Dr Mal Washer is ADCA's president and former Liberal senator, Senator the Hon. Gary Humphries, was a director? Is it some form of payback, because ADCA have been critical of the NSW and QLD Liberal state governments' response to alcohol induced violence? Did it have anything to do with the reported links between Minister Nash's now former chief of staff and the alcohol industry? The fact is we will continue to wonder, because this government has not given a reason.


Minister Nash first said ADCA had a history of financial mismanagement—which was proved completely untrue. She then said the work of its incredible resource library was duplicated, only to retract that statement. This library is the only resource of its kind in the world and it would seem it is destined for the shredder.


With the many, many cuts being inflicted by this government, it is easy to lose perspective, so let me reintroduce some sorely needed perspective. The government has saved around $1.5 million in annual funding by cutting ADCA. The estimated cost of just one Australian living with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder over their lifetime can be up to $15 million. That is 10 times the annual budget of ADCA.


As the member for Canberra, I am concerned about the 14 ADCA staff who are my constituents and who have now lost their jobs. I am concerned about the landlord who has lost a tenant and the local businesses which will lose a client. But I am even more concerned about the implications for the future health of our country and the region as a result of the axing of ADCA.


Another cut outlined in these bills that I would like to talk about today is the $11.5 million that has been ripped from the Building Multicultural Communities Program. The program provided one-off grants to empower local multicultural communities to strengthen social cohesion and promote inclusion in diverse communities. Some of the community groups in Canberra that received grants under the former Labor government included the ACT Jewish Community, the Australian Chinese Culture Exchange and Promotion Association, the Bangladeshi Seniors Club, the Canberra Islamic Centre and the Spanish Speakers Association.


When the government announced that they were cutting funding from this program, these organisations were left in limbo. Would they receive the grants that they had applied for months before the election? We all know that grassroots community organisations like these run on the smell of an oily rag. These grants were a much needed injection of funds that would reinvigorate their work, and for months these organisations have been in the dark. To date, of the 29 community groups that were awarded grants in the ACT, only two have received their funding. Many have been told they will not be receiving their funding at all but might be eligible for compensation. Many more are still in the dark.


As recently as two weeks ago I received a phone call from a representative of one of these organisations who had been told she would receive her grant. Even though she keeps being reassured that it is going to be okay, will this actually occur? The stress this was causing her was evident. The decisions of this government are hurting those individuals and groups in our community who give up their time to ensure we live in a better, more inclusive society.


The 2013-14 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers clearly show that $11.5 million is being taken out of this program. I quote from the MYEFO papers:


The Government will achieve savings of $11.5 million by not proceeding with funding for the Building Multicultural Communities programme, announced in 2013‑14 Budget …


I am taking the time to point this out because, in defending this cut, Liberal senator for the ACT, Senator Sesejla, has told the community groups who have lost their funding that the grants were never funded. He said:


They promised something they didn't have the money for. They didn't allocate the money for it.


He has repeated this claim again and again. He has accused Labor of handing out grants that there was no money for. I would like to say to Senator Seselja: if the money wasn't allocated, how are you able to make a $11.5 million saving by cutting the program? Senator Seselja has either been blatantly misleading the ACT community or he is too incompetent to read Labor's 2013-14 budget and the MYEFO document his own government prepared. Either way, he owes Canberrans an explanation.


So many of the cuts outlined in these bills have caused me concern, but perhaps what has caused me the most concern is the cuts to the Education portfolio. We all heard those opposite say before the election again and again that when it came to education they were on a unity ticket with Labor. Those are their words, not ours—a unity ticket. But following the election it is clear that nothing could be further from the truth.


Those opposite speak about the importance of vocational education in our schools. The Parliamentary Secretary for Education, Senator Ryan, has praised trade training centres for addressing skills shortages. He has also said that the government needs to consider 'innovative and practical approaches to deliver trade qualifications in schools'. The Assistant Minister for Education, the member for Farrer, has declared the importance of vocational education in schools, saying:


… there's not enough “try a trade” for those kids in school so they can see what it is they want to do.


She went on to say:



… what we need to do is make sure that from a pathway in say Year ten, they're directed into a career in the trade that suits them …



If those opposite really believe this, why have they cut an incredibly successful vocational education initiative in the trade training centres? In government, Labor funded 510 trades training centres in schools around Australia, with more than 60 per cent in regional areas.


I have visited the trade training centres in my electorate and I know what an incredibly valuable asset they are. I have visited the building and construction trade training centre at St Mary MacKillop College, where I spoke to students who have told me that they have stayed in school because of that trade training centre. I spoke to students who travel for over two hours every day from Cooma to Canberra so that they can go to school at MacKillop because of that trade training centre.


Just two weeks ago I visited Wanniassa High School, which had experienced severe flood damage as a result of the storms here in Canberra. While I was inspecting the damage, Principal Karen Nagorcka was most keen to show me their new trade training centre—still under construction—which had miraculously escaped the damage. I have visited the commercial kitchen trade training centre at St Clare's College, just down the road on Canberra Avenue, where students are able to commence their qualifications in hospitality without leaving school, so they can keep studying languages and English while gaining the qualifications they need for their chosen trade.


Now, more than ever, Australia needs to give every Australian student every opportunity to secure a high-skill, high-wage job of the future. The decision by the Abbott government to cut trade training centres is disgraceful and short-sighted. It shows that they have no understanding of the skills and qualifications that young Australians require for the future. It shows that they have no plan for jobs in Australia, because if they did they would understand the importance of trades. It shows that, despite the talk, those opposite do not care about vocational education.


Just days before the election, the now Prime Minister promised on national television that under an Abbott government there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. But here in these bills—the very first opportunity the Abbott government have had to present bills concerning money supply—we see cuts to health, cuts to education. We see broken promises. We see that this is not the government they promised to be. Before the election, Prime Minister Abbott promised he would lead a government of 'no surprises and no excuses'. Here are the surprises, clearly set out for us. I would like to know what his excuse is.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (13:07):  In rising to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014 and cognate bills, I want to spend most of my time speaking about positive things and speaking about the future. To start with, I would like to centre my comments on the development of northern Australia. Truly one of the great moments in political life in Australia is when you have a Prime Minister who has the vision to stand up and say that, although there are 142 seats below the Tropic of Capricorn and there are only eight seats north of the Tropic of Capricorn, the country has to go to the north. What I want to see with the development of northern Australia is for us to get the development right—and, to get that right, we must work in partnership with science.


Cast your mind back to 2009 and the oil spill from the Montara oil rig in the Timor Sea. Green groups were up in arms afterwards about how they would ever find out what had gone on, the destruction of the environment and the damage that would go on for generations and generations. Before they commenced operations, the owners of the Montara oil rig had the foresight and vision to do a survey of the area in which they were going to drill. They grabbed the Institute of Marine Science, based in Townsville, to do a full survey of what was there. So when they did have the oil spill they were able to go through it afterwards and have a look at what damage was actually caused—and there was no damage.


We need to make sure that we have information to hand. If we are going to have development along our coastlines, if we are going to develop in places in the Timor Sea and the Torres Strait, and if we are going to expand our ports along the Queensland coastline, we must make sure that we engage with scientific organisations such as the Australian Institute of Marine Science and we get our baseline science and our mapping right so that we understand what is at stake, how it is going to be built, when it is going to be built and what the consequences of that will be. When talking about the environment I have always said that everything we do has an effect on the environment. The fact that we are in this place now speaking affects our environment. It is how we manage that effect which makes us the people we are. So we must handle that expansion and development of northern Australia in the right way.


If you ask anyone in Australia what the biggest river system is in this country, invariably people will say the Murray-Darling. That is the obvious answer, but it is in fact not correct. If we are truly to develop northern Australian, we must make sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the Murray-Darling. We must make sure that we use the science correctly and speak to people like Dr Damien Burrows at JCU and the CSIRO in North Queensland. We have 25 river systems in the north of Queensland and we had the baseline science on about five of those river systems. The Murray-Darling starts in both the Snowy Mountains and in Queensland and it flows into the Great Australian Bight. In Queensland, we have river systems that not only flow into the Great Australian Bight but also flow into Lake Eyre, the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Great Barrier Reef and the Pacific Ocean. The Fitzroy and Burdekin river systems are two massive river systems, both carrying much more water than the Murray-Darling.


We must ensure that we understand what is going on. If we are to develop agriculture and the resources west of the Great Dividing Range, in places like the Gilbert River and all those places out west, we must ensure that we have our baseline science right. It would be pointless and sheer folly to replicate the mistakes that have been made over the last 200 years on the Murray-Darling. It would be sheer folly to plant a $20 million mung bean crop if it was to destroy the billion dollar prawn fisheries of the Gulf of Carpentaria. We must make sure that we understand what we are dealing with here. When we are talking about the development of agriculture in the north of Australia, we must make sure that we understand the consequences of what the water is doing, how we are to store it, where it is to be stored and for what it is to be used.


I see the development of northern Australia as that key turning point in the north's future. I also see it as a fair bit of pressure on northern Australia and a fair bit of pressure on the members of parliament in the north of Australia. We have a Prime Minister who had the vision to actually put this forward, we have a Treasurer who understands where the country must go, we have a Minister for Trade and Investment who is actively out there pushing our case for us and we have a Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Minister for Foreign Affairs saying that this is a great idea. There are four members of cabinet, at the very top, who are saying that this should happen. If we as the members of parliament for the north of Australia miss this opportunity, it will be gone forever. I see this as a huge opportunity for us, but it is also a huge risk. It is an opportunity that we must grab and we must be very aggressive with it.


In relation to the development of northern Australia, I feel that we must include our nearest neighbour, Port Moresby. The previous mayor of Townsville—the mayor of Townsville when I arrived in Townsville in 1994—Tony Mooney, would always say that the closest capital city to Townsville is not Brisbane but is in fact Port Moresby. Papua New Guinea and Port Moresby have been great friends of Australia for an awfully long time. It has been 72 years now since the battle of the Kokoda Trail and the fuzzy wuzzy angels. Papua New Guinea has been there for us for an awfully long time. Our relationship has ebbed and flowed. I truly believe that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Peter O'Neill, wants the best for his country and wants our relationship to grow.


One of the issues that we have at the moment is the two-way visa issue between the two countries. Papua New Guinea is in the process of cancelling visas on arrival. What used to happen is that you would be able hop on a plane in Cairns and fly to Port Moresby and get your visa at Jackson Field airport on arrival. That does not happen for people from Papua New Guinea when they arrive in Australia. Mind you, it does not happen for any country. We do not have 'visa on arrival' for any country. But the perception is there that we are putting up roadblocks for people from Papua New Guinea—those who have business, education and cultural exchange work to do—to come to Australia. We must address that basic perception.


What we must do is make the process as simple as possible. If possible, we should create special categories of visa for people to do business, for people to do education and for people on cultural exchanges to make us an easier to get to country for them. The people you talk to in Papua New Guinea—from the Prime Minister to the previous Prime Minister, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, to people in business—will all sit there and say that they would do more in Australia but it was just too hard to get to. We must address the basic proposition that we are putting up roadblocks. I know that the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is working very hard in relation to this process. What we must do is try to simplify the process, try to make it more online and try to make it more user friendly so that we can get to this country and exchange these things more easily.


I believe that Peter O'Neill is heading his country in the right direction. In a recent speech to the Institute of Company Directors on the Gold Coast, he spoke specifically about getting direct flights to Townsville. Whether we organise that as a direct flight or via Cairns is another thing. He also spoke about trying to get involved in the microeconomic form of business-to-business operations between the two countries, and specifically Townsville. I think that this is where we must go. If the relationship between the two countries is to grow, it must grow on a business-to-business basis. I think Prime Minister O'Neill has the bull by the horns here and has the right idea. We must be able to engage better between the two countries on a business-to-business basis, and I know that Townsville business and our Townsville Chamber of Commerce are working very hard to facilitate that. 


Another pat on the back that you must give the Papua New Guinean government is for their attitude to corruption. Corruption is often spoken about as being a major issue between the two countries. Prime Minister O'Neill gave a recent speech to the governors of all provinces in Papua New Guinea and addressed the issue of corruption and how it must stop now that Papua New Guinea is on the cusp of a bright new age; that if they do not change the way they do their own business internally, they will never get the results that they should be getting internationally. If we can assist in any way, shape or form with the provision of the services that can assist with that, we should.


Townsville also stands on the cusp of being a major services hub. If you draw a right-angled triangle and have Townsville at the 90-degree axis, straight to the north of us is Papua New Guinea and straight to the east of us is Fiji. If you draw an arc from that 90-degree axis, you will basically get the entire Melanesian world within the circumference of that circle. You will get from Papua New Guinea to Bougainville to the Solomon Islands and around to Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji. Townsville can be the hub for services because we have a great university, a major teaching hospital, the defence force, a police academy, TAFE and Australian technical colleges. We have all these services already there. What we must be doing is facilitating the growth of those other countries by inviting them to come and participate fully in the use our facilities. Whether we do that by using our aid money for these countries or by them getting the aid money and purchasing services off Australian companies, be that as it may, what I do think we will do is get better results by using Townsville as that hub. That will mean that we will have to have people there from Austrade, the department of immigration and people from Foreign Affairs to get these things done, because we are the natural hub for business in northern Australia and we will need to make Townsville a truly international city.


In the time I have left in this debate I would like to discuss the work between the two countries at a defence level. The PNG defence force needs a lot of work and assistance. In Townsville we have the largest Army base in the country. We extend services and do joint operations with services from Papua New Guinea, but we could be doing a lot more. We could be doing exchanges and providing assistance in relation to how the PNG defence force is actually operating, their chains of command and the way they can set up a truly operational facility. What we need to be doing is getting more active in this space, getting in there and assisting them with that. It would be on invitation only, of course, but what we must be doing is looking at the best result for the Australian taxpayer across the board. If you look at where the two countries come closest in the Torres Strait, what we have to do is look at the most effective use of taxpayer funded equipment by basing things such as the C27J or the MRH90 helicopter in Townsville and being able to use them for surveillance. That will also attract high-end engineering jobs, which will then attract the second-tier engineering jobs and those sorts of things to maximise the return for the taxpayer. 


One of the criticisms I have of the previous government is that, in the rush to greater scale, they did not look at where the actual dollars were. They were neglecting saving the pennies and were just looking at the pounds. As my grandmother would always tell me, if you look after the pennies, the pounds will take care of themselves. We had situations where a contract had signed that everything would go down to Albury-Wodonga, to Bandiana, to be repaired and that they would get economies of scale and better results by sending stuff down there instead of getting the servicing done locally. How you get better economies of scale or better service by neglecting your local foundries and local engineering firms and instead putting a gearbox on a truck and sending it all the way to Albury-Wodonga to be repaired, or putting an engine on a pallet on a truck and taking it the 3,000 kilometres to Bandiana to have it rebored, then back on truck all the way back to Townsville, beggars belief. The Townsville business would produce better work at more affordable prices with a quicker turnaround and better use of the asset. This says so much about what was going wrong with the previous government.


What we must be doing is looking at how we maximise the benefit to the taxpayer and making sure that autonomy is given as close as possible to the relevant incident or occurrence. We can then get the best result for the Australian taxpayer. We must make sure we maximise those returns by shopping locally, by building the better relationships, by letting the bloke in the department who is heading up that section of the Army, Air Force or Navy go direct to his supplier and get it fixed locally, which means there will be a quicker turnaround for absolutely everyone. I thank the House.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (13:22):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I welcome it not because I am enthusiastic about the content of this bill but because I think it perfectly epitomises the actions and approach of the Abbott government to date. The bill before us is yet another example of their willingness to break promise after promise, yet another ideological attack on the central tenets of our society and yet another kick in the guts for every vulnerable Australian. It is what this government is all about. In just a few short months they have wreaked havoc. Take, for example, the first parliamentary sitting week of the year: in just seven days they managed to finish off the Australian car industry, blame affected workers for wanting wages and conditions, and then backtrack on their promise to deliver new jobs. I am sure they see it as quite the achievement. Broken promises, ideological attacks and hurting working Australians is this Liberal government's bread and butter.


So let us see what further pain they can inflict with these new appropriation bills. How about cutting $13.2 million from the Health portfolio, $4.8 million from education, $4.6 million from legal policy reform and advocacy funding, or $11.5 million from the Building Multicultural Communities program. They certainly have stayed true to form, with broken promise after broken promise. After all, this is the very same Prime Minister who said on the eve of the election that there would be 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS'. Let us break that down. Mr Abbott said there would be no cuts to education, a unity ticket: that did not last long. No cuts to health: obviously abolishing one of our oldest peak public health organisations does not count. No changes to pensions: I am not sure what Mr Abbott thinks a welfare review is for, then. No GST changes: mobile home owners who fought against the government's tax hike might disagree. And no cuts to the ABC or SBS, just apparently an efficiency and expenses review. It is almost like a checklist of cuts to come, a checklist of broken promises, a checklist to mislead the Australian people. So much for a no surprises, no excuses government. The Abbott government has consistently said one thing before the election and then gone and done the complete opposite. 


This is, after all, the party that said on multiple occasions that if debt is the problem then more debt is not the answer. What then did they do in government? They cut a deal with their avowed enemies, the Greens, to legislate for an unlimited debt ceiling—quite a backflip. And how many times did we see the current Prime Minister and Treasurer get to their feet in the lead-up to the election and claim Australia had a budget emergency? They claimed we were headed for disaster. I heard more of it today in this House. They claimed that only they could fix it. I guess they hoped that if they said it often enough it would become the truth, and when it did not they decided to change the rules. As the Secretary of the Department of Finance told Senate estimates recently, the Mid-Year Fiscal and Economic Outlook has discarded the former Labor government's fiscal rules which limited real spending growth. Mr David Tune confirmed that this change in assumptions had increased the outlook's projections of budget debt over the next 10 years. So the government changes the rules to suit its own purposes and then, lo and behold, uncovers a $667 billion debt figure in 2023-24. It is a disgraceful action by the Treasurer; it is deplorable. This willingness to fiddle with figures might also explain why the Treasurer decided to gift $9 billion to the Reserve Bank. It was an interesting choice, particularly given that there had been no indication that this was money they asked for or needed. 


So why would the government do this? What reason could they possibly have to create and craft a bad result? It is because they are looking for excuses to cut health care, excuses to slash education and excuses to rip up important infrastructure and services around Australia. So obsessed are they with cutting, they are willing to distort the budget numbers in order to justify their ideological agenda. And we know from history that this is something those opposite do. They say, 'We can't afford it and it costs too much.' They attempt to dupe and deceive the Australian public in order to cut, cut, cut. But it flies in the face of logic that if we cannot afford vital health and education services we can somehow afford the coalition's exorbitant Paid Parental Leave scheme, or tax and superannuation breaks for some of our most wealthy. To put it simply, if we are broke, we should not be eating caviar. But the truth is we are not broke, it is just a question of priorities. So it seems that the health of our nation and the future of our kids, creating an equitable and welcoming society, none of this matters to the Abbott government; they simply do not care. 


There is a fundamental disconnect between what Australian people want and what the Abbott government is delivering. After all, this is a government that relentlessly pursues inequity. It is a passion of theirs. It is in their bones. They govern for the big end of town while leaving the rest of us behind. We see it again and again. As my colleague the member for Throsby said last week, if you want a tax cut under this government then you had better own a mining company. At the same time as they reward big business they are cutting the schoolkids bonus. They are arguing that we cannot afford to help low-income earners with their lifetime superannuation savings. They are saying that Australian workers like those at Toyota and Holden earn too much. 


And if you need any more proof that this is a government that embraces inequality, look no further than their Gonski backflip with triple pike. It was those opposite that promised they shared a unity ticket with us on better schools funding. The Minister for Education pledged to us that he understood the importance of better and more equal education, but of course with this government promises and pledges mean little—in fact, zip. Despite their promises to the contrary, fundamentally, and buried deep within, this is a party that does not believe in funding education. Overcoming disadvantage, a fair go, creating equality—that is not what the Liberal Party are about. And now they are in government they no longer have to fool the Australian people, they are showing their true colours. They are pursuing their dreams of inequality and inequity. They are robbing from the poor to give to the rich. Yet this is the very same party that said they would govern for every Australian. I cannot recall how many times I saw a member of the coalition during the campaign with their Real Solutions pamphlet in hand. It contained, they claimed, the cure for every problem. It promised hope, reward and opportunity for everyone. But, as you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. The bill before us is yet another example which proves that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer govern for a minority, a small few with vested interests, and certainly not for everyday Australians.

"Conroy, Pat, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (12:00):  When I was speaking on this bill previously, I was going through the $11½ million cut to the Building Multicultural Communities Program grants—a cut that could have been avoided using just 10 days of the interest bill from the government's nakedly political injection of $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank Reserve Fund. As part of this cut to this grants program, we were seeing the Ethnic Communities Council of Newcastle and Hunter Region lose a $150,000 grant to build the first ever multicultural men's shed and a community garden at their community centre. Members from all sides of this House will be aware of the wonderful contribution that men's sheds provide to our community, and to have a multicultural men's shed was a truly innovative idea from the ethnic communities council. Ninety men had already registered to join this shed, and they have lost their $150,000 grant which was awarded in the previous government and fully budgeted for.


Given that the funding agreements for the program stated that the projects had to be completed by 30 June 2014, most organisations had begun the planning process, and many are now well advanced in their project and are considerably out of pocket. Vedic Samiti are out of pocket for more than $14,000 after undergoing a lengthy building design and development approval process, and the ethnic communities council has invested around $49,000 on plans, DA approvals, electrical works and site preparation. I am advised that on Tuesday, 25 February, the department called the ethnic communities council to advise they will reimburse $4,500 for costs associated with the lodgement of a development application to Newcastle council. However, they refused to acknowledge the more than $44,000 invested by the council in utilities fees, design, EISs and electrical work required to get the approval for the DA.


So these groups made the decision to invest in these projects in good faith; they had had their grants awarded, in accordance with the grants process; and now they are considerably out of pocket because of the actions of the Abbott government. These are groups that have very low budgets. They operate on a shoestring, often through the operation of goodwill and donations from the community. To see them out of pocket to such a great extent demonstrates the contempt this new government has for community groups.


I am sure that, like members on this side of the House, coalition MPs would have enjoyed attending citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day and welcoming our newest citizens. These ceremonies are wonderful demonstrations of our modern, multicultural Australia. I would just highlight the hypocrisy of this government: although they pay lip service to multiculturalism, they have in fact cut funding to the very groups that are on the ground making multiculturalism work.


In the time remaining, I would like to discuss another part of the appropriations bill, and that is defence funding. At the moment, we have the naval shipbuilding industry in crisis. The entire industry is in a crisis where they are waiting for work. Most of the shipyards in this country that build naval ships—Forgacs in the Hunter, and BAE at Williamstown and Henderson—are looking at work running out in the next year. We are looking at between 4,000 and 5,000 job losses if nothing is done, including 900 jobs going in my region of the Hunter Valley. Once lost, these jobs will be very hard to rebuild—and we will need to rebuild them because, under the current white paper, the Royal Australian Navy will need to acquire 40 major naval vessels in the next couple of decades.


It is essential that we build most of these ships if not all of them here because there is a direct link between the ability to build a naval vessel and the ability to maintain them. As an island nation it is essential for our national sovereignty that we can maintain our own naval vessels so that we are not dependent on any other nation in the world.


Labor had a solution, and we took to the last election a proposal to bring forward the replacement of two supply ships and to guarantee a minimum amount of work being provided in Australia with a real opportunity for both ships to be built entirely within this country. This would have helped Forgacs and it would have helped BAE, who would have had to compete for the work but would have had a decent shot at overcoming the shipbuilding valley of death that they currently face.


There are other options, including building a fourth air warfare destroyer, advancing the replacement of the patrol boats that have seen some operational maintenance difficulties, or beginning early construction of our frigate replacements based on a hull modelled on the AWD. All of these options are worth exploring, but we need urgent work to resolve this issue.


If these shipyards, most particularly BAE in Melbourne and Forgacs up at Tomago, do not receive the opportunity to bid for new contracts shortly, they will have to start making workers redundant, and this will lead to 4,000 to 5,000 direct job losses and the impact on families and communities, not to mention the impact on other communities that depend on that work, whether those are steel suppliers or other specialty subcontractors.


This will be not only an economic and social impact; it will be an impact on our national defence. Once these jobs are lost, they will be very hard to rebuild and, as an island nation, this will be a great tragedy that will reduce our national sovereignty. So I urge the new government to find a solution quickly on this. They were briefed on this when they were in opposition. There should be a bipartisan approach. No-one wants to score political points on this. We need a solution; otherwise, we will see thousands of jobs going, devastating communities that have already seen significant job losses, whether it is in the Hunter Valley or in Melbourne, where they saw the loss of Toyota and other industries from that region.


I urge the new government to take action on this. I will be working very closely with the employers, the unions and the workforce in my area. I have already talked to Mr Lindsay Stratton, the CEO of Forgacs, a few times about this issue, and I have spoken to the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, which represents the workers on this site. This is an important issue. I urge the government to take action, not sit on their hands and wait for a new white-paper process. We need an urgent resolution now, or we will lose thousands of jobs and face a reduced national capability.


This appropriations bill contains a number of initiatives. Some of them are nakedly political, like the $8.8 billion injection into the Reserve Bank in one year, which will see dividends paid only six weeks later back to the government. It yet again demonstrates the skewed priorities of this government. It is all about superficial politics, not acting in our national interest.

Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (12:08):  I rise to speak in favour of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2013-2014 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2013-2014 and against the opposition amendment. Can I just take the point that the member for Chifley just raised in relation to—




Mr Conroy:
  Charlton!




Mr HOGAN:
  Sorry, Charlton. Sorry, Member for Charlton; apologies to the member for Chifley. On the point about the $8.8 billion for the one-off grant to the RBA: I have the privilege of being on the Standing Committee on Economics, and we had the Governor of the Reserve Bank come to a meeting in late December. There was much toing and froing about this from different members of the committee. It sounded to me as though there was almost a conspiracy feel about this according to members of the opposition. But I asked the governor a question. I said, 'Do you think it is a good thing or a bad thing, Governor, that this $8.8 billion grant be given to the RBA?' His exact words were, 'This is something that I welcome because it restores the capital position of the bank to where I would like it to be.' So, while we may make much toing and froing about who said what to whom, who made what phone call on what day or who said what to whom in the meeting, his response to that was that he welcomes it. He appreciates, probably more than anyone else, even anyone in this House, the importance of the Reserve Bank's capital position and that it be reinstated as quickly as possible due to the role that that reserve plays due to foreign currency fluctuations and everything else that the RBA needs it for.


Another part of this appropriation legislation obviously is for the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. This debate I think is sometimes lost in the debate that we have in the public and in the media about this. When we talk about people seeking asylum in Australia, sometimes it is forgotten and sometimes it is lost that there is bipartisan support for Australia—given that we are a relatively wealthy country—to take in asylum seekers every year, and in fact we do. We take in 13,750 asylum seekers each and every year. Not only do we take them in; we make sure that we look after them to help their settlement into Australia. We do that through a variety of programs. We do it through housing programs and education programs. We do it in many other ways to make sure that they are not just left by themselves but find their transition into life in Australia as easy as we can make it.


That is why we cap the program. We do not take in hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers every year. Some countries have many more asylum seekers arriving on their shores every year, but those countries tend not to do anything for them. They just leave them by themselves. They do not have any rights, and they are certainly not given government assistance. That is not the Australian way. When we take in our asylum seekers, we want to look after them, which is why we cap the program at the 13,000 to 14,000 that we do.


The approach that we have taken to this has been in the context of a very highly and emotionally charged debate. I appreciate the passions on either side of this because I think that behind both sides of this argument there are good intentions and there is goodwill, in the sense that we get this right. In my mind, I look back at the statistics. I look back at what was happening at the end of the Howard government era. At the end of the Howard government, I think there was a detention centre that had three or four people in it. And it is important to remember that, while we only had three or four people in a detention centre, we were still taking in 13,750 people each year—as we should—and we were housing them and giving them education programs and language programs to help them settle. So, while the detention centres had closed, we were still taking in asylum seekers.


What happened? I will give some credit to the Rudd government maybe that their intention was good. When the Rudd government came in, they thought that the policies—and we know what they were; they were temporary protection visas, offshore processing and turning back boats if and when it was safe to do so—were harsh. They felt that the image of that to the international community or even the Australian community was too harsh. Let us assume for a second that their intention behind changing that policy was admirable, but let us look at the results.


The results were that the people-smuggling business started up again. This is a tragedy. I certainly do not want to sound political about this, but I am just stating the fact. The tragedy was that obviously we saw many drownings and deaths at sea because the people-smuggling business started up again. And we certainly had a lot of cost blow-outs again when we had to start to reopen detention centres, and we had a whole process that the previous government had had to start to pre-empt. I stand here and I think that we all want the same result in some ways in this country about this issue, in the sense that we do not want detention centres. Obviously the whole purpose of having offshore processing is to deter so that there is no demand for that. Again we see the government's policies. It is part of this appropriation bill that the policy we are implementing in relation to immigration and border protection is a good one.


When I look at appropriation bills, I look more broadly and see that these bills are always about economic management. You look younger than I, Deputy Speaker, so you might not remember as far back as I do. My first memories of economic management were the Whitlam days. At that stage, the Labor Party had not been in power for a long time so I think you can excuse some of their mismanagement., but we had a bit of chaos with them. We had the Khemlani loans affair and things happening, as far as economic management goes, that did not suit our country well. With the next Labor government, we had Hawke and Keating. Let us give credit where credit is due: certainly, as Treasurer, Paul Keating implemented some policies that he and the country should be quite happy with. But we also had the recession that we had to have, according to him. We had 18 per cent interest rates. Very tellingly, we were again left with a $96 billion debt.


I want to come to debt in a minute, given we are talking appropriation bills. Let us assume we are looking at this from a distance. The Howard-Costello government came in and they paid back all of that debt. The $96 billion was completely repaid. They put $50 billion into the Future Fund, which was unfunded superannuation liabilities we had for public servants. To have given those public servants surety about their superannuation is a wonderful thing. It is well documented, as you know, that in that government's last year alone we were left a $20 billion surplus.


We then get the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. Everyone in that government would have observed the Whitlam experiment. They saw what Hawke and Keating did—that they did some good things but left us with a big debt. They saw the good economic management of the Howard-Costello years. What did they learn from that? What did the Rudd-Gillard government that learn from that? It would seem not much, because unfortunately we had the six biggest deficits in the history of our country. We had a global financial crisis during that period and there were certainly some elements where you could say that government needed to step in and do some things. I do not think anybody argued with that. But we would say again that some of those were mismanaged. I will not list them all, but some of the more obvious ones are the batts and the overpriced school halls. We have had some examples with the NBN rollout, where it looks like there has again been very wasteful spending.


But what does this mean? If you are the average punter, or the average mum and dad in the street, what does this mean? These deficits or debts, what do they mean for you? Is it an issue for you? It is—because the issue is that now, because of those six years, we have an interest bill. We all have mortgages or run a business and so we know what this means. We have an interest bill of $10 billion a year.


We stand in this House right now, and I have heard people from the opposition talk about this terrible stuff that is going on with things that the member was talking about previously—cuts, or being tough on multicultural programs. No-one wants to do that. No-one wants to be in government and say to a program, 'We are not going to give you as much money as we previously did.' But imagine if we had not had the six years of the Labor government and, now, the $10 billion a year we are paying in interest. Imagine how much better life would be for everyone in this country. This year we are paying $10 billion in interest, for which we will get nothing. We will get nothing: no service, no money to Gonski, no money for the NDIS, no money to the multicultural programs that the previous member was speaking about. This is $10 billion in interest which will just go to the people who we borrowed the money from. Then what happens? Next year, again, the same thing happens. Again we will have a huge interest bill. Again money will not go to infrastructure. We would love to have the money for infrastructure. Money will not be going to government programs or to very worthy causes.


Here we are in 2014, with the biggest debt in our history. We are overregulated and it is expensive to do business in this country. This is what the challenge is for the new coalition government: to get us back on track again and put our budget and our finances in a financially-sustainable position. Members on the other side are often very righteous about children and say that we need education and programs or services for our children, and rightly so. But the other thing that our children do not deserve is to be left a debt and an interest bill that will mean their standard of living and the services they get for themselves and their children is less than ours. That is the challenge for this new government. We know the budget repair work has already begun. We know that the reduction of red tape has already begun.


Interestingly enough, after the election I was talking to my community. They were coming to me about lowering red tape. I thought it would be predominantly small business. It is, but guess who else is in my office? Guess who else is talking to me as I walk around the community? It is not just a small business. It is non-government organisations and not-for-profit organisations; in fact, it is often members of the public sector themselves. I have had examples of schoolteachers stopping me at sporting events and saying, 'I have had to fill out eight pages in a risk assessment to walk my kids two blocks to get them here, or for this or for that.' That, too, is an example of wasted time and wasted resources. We all in this chamber come here with good intentions. We want the best for our children. We want the best for people in our community who are disadvantaged and we want the best for everyone now and in the future.


I want to recap on three important issues from these appropriation bills. One is the $8.8 billion grant. I reiterate: the Governor of the Reserve Bank said he welcomed it. I spoke about the border protection element of this appropriation bill too. I said that everyone in this country welcomes the 13,000 to 14,000 asylum seekers who come every year in an orderly way and who do not risk their lives. We look after them when they get here. We give them education, language and housing programs to make them assimilate. I know that this government—with the economic mismanagement that we have seen over the last six years, which has given us a $10 billion interest bill that does not go to any services or any infrastructure—will undergo a budget repair bill that puts our country's finances back in order so that our children and our children's children are not left with a Labor legacy of debt and a lower standard of living.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (12:22):  Before the election, the coalition said: 'If debt is the problem, more debt is not the answer.' Obviously, we have seen a change of heart since the election. In fact, we have probably seen the truth of where the Abbott government really stands when it came to the question of debt. Before the election, we also saw the coalition in this place, time after time, criticise the previous government for negotiating with and talking to members of the minor parties, including the Greens. They were particularly critical of the previous government's 'wheeling and dealing', as they put it, with the Greens. But, again, since coming to office, we have seen the Abbott government, immediately they have a problem, jump into bed with the Greens and get their support to increase or do away with the debt ceiling—another clear example of the government having said one thing before the election and acting completely differently after they have been elected.


They needed to increase the debt ceiling for, I think, two key reasons. Firstly, on coming to government they found that it is about more than just giving the community three- or four-word slogans and simple political rhetoric; it is about managing the economy. They have proven that they are incompetent at managing the economy. So, one of the reasons they have to increase their debt ceiling is that they know that, under the Abbott government, debt is going to rise.


Secondly, it is clear that the Abbott government's policies are in fact destroying confidence in Australia's future. Earlier on, when I was speaking on another matter in this place, I talked about confidence in Australia's future being destroyed and quoted a headline from The Australian of last Friday: 'Worst slump in 20 years hits jobs'. This article talks about confidence over the coming period—not in the past or today, but in the coming period. It is clear that Australian industry and the Australian people are losing faith and confidence in this government.


Why wouldn’t you lose confidence in this government? After all, they come in here with one view one day and a different view the next. Let me give some examples of that. When it suits the Abbott government, they are all in favour of foreign investment. Yet, when it does not suit them, they are opposed to it. We saw that with the GrainCorp sale. On one hand, they did not support that; on the other hand, they come into this place and talk about selling off Qantas. One day they are in favour of foreign investment; the next day they are against it.


We saw the same with industry support. They were opposed to industry support when it came to SPC Ardmona and the motor vehicle building industry in this country, but they were happy to give out $16 million to Cadbury. They support industry one day; they are opposed to supporting it the next. One day they are critical of government debt and then, the next day, they unnecessarily add to government debt by providing an additional $8.8 billion to the Reserve Bank, without any justification and without any request from the bank, to my knowledge, for that $8.8 billion. They were happy to increase the debt when they did not have to. It was the same with education. Before the election, the coalition was at one with Labor over Gonski funding. After the election, we saw a backflip. Everything is now off the table and the government are renegotiating their education funding. They are doing a terrible job of that, and I can say that having spoken to people in the education system in my home state.


All of that undoubtedly leads to a lack of confidence. We have seen that lack of confidence across a whole range of sectors, in particular the mining sector and the manufacturing sector. The article I referred to from The Australian, 'Worst slump in 20 years hits jobs', specifically talks about the future of manufacturing and mining in this country and the downward trend that is expected in those two sectors—both sectors that have been, to date, critical in underpinning the economy of Australia. Manufacturing is expected to fall by another 20 per cent over the coming year, and mining by a further 25 per cent. In fact, I have seen reports that tens of thousands of jobs are expected to be lost in the mining sector over the coming years. Again, it does not say much for the Abbott government when industry are making decisions based on expectations that things are going to get worse—a clear lack of confidence in this government.


Because there is a lack of confidence in the government, it is not surprising that there is also a blowing-out of government debt. That is why the Abbott government needed to lift its debt ceiling—because of their policies and their incompetence. The Abbott government's policies are directly adding to the national debt. The argument of the Abbott government in constantly blaming the previous government is wearing thin with the Australian people. They are waking up to the inability and incompetence of this government.


When industries close, government tax revenue also falls. When unemployment rises, government expenditure also rises. When government program funding is severely cut, economic activity declines. The effects of severe austerity measures, as seen in some European countries and some parts of the USA, are now evident for us to learn from. Clearly, they do not work. What you get as a result of severe austerity measures are higher unemployment, worsening economies, worsening business confidence, more bankruptcies and, ultimately, less government revenue. Again, that all means higher government debt. Conservative governments then start the cycle all over again and it becomes a downward spiral for those economies where conservative governments have applied severe austerity measures.


This is a matter that was very well articulated only two weeks ago at a forum at Adelaide university held by three or four academics, who had spent their time studying the effects of austerity measures across Europe and the USA. I understand that the notes and discussion from that forum can be downloaded. For those who attended, and I was one of them, it is quite concerning to see the negative effects that severe austerity measures have on the people of those countries, and how they simply do not work. What they really do is make situations worse, add to the economic difficulties of the countries involved and make tough economic times even worse.


There is another motive behind the rhetoric used by the Abbott government when it comes to making what they call the tough decisions that they need to make. Making tough economic decisions, as they put it, is nothing more than a convenient excuse by the Abbott government to attack workers, their wages and their conditions. That is exactly what the Abbott government are doing. We saw an appalling example of that when they attacked the workers at SPC Ardmona in Victoria. When you look at the facts of what those workers were earning, at the attacks that were made and the blame that was sheeted home to the workers for the difficulties at SPC Ardmona, it is really quite appalling. Those workers were not being paid any more than basic wages. In fact, I would like to see government members in this place suggest that they would like to be earning the sort of money that those workers earn. I am sure that they would not, yet they are happy to come into this place and criticise those workers.


It does not stop with the workers at SPC Ardmona. We saw the same attacks on the workers of this country when it came to the difficulties that GMH have been facing, that Toyota have been facing, and that Qantas have been facing. The Abbott government always blame the workers. Making the so-called tough decisions is a convenient excuse to attack the workers of this country and, in so doing, to start to bring down their wages and their conditions. Under this government, we have seen a loss of some 63,000 jobs since it came to office. We have seen jobs lost at SPC Ardmona. We will see the motor manufacturing industry come to an end in 2017, if not before. I suspect that as a result of decisions that have already been taken many of those companies will start winding down before that. We have seen jobs lost in a swag of other industries like Electrolux, Simplot, Caterpillar, Peabody and so on. All those job losses will result in a worsening budget outlook.


I want to comment on one of the other excuses we often hear from the government for the state of the economy—that is, the carbon tax. Only today I heard a government member suggesting that the reason Qantas are in trouble is the carbon tax bill. If that is what the government truly believe, the government always has the option of returning the carbon tax bill back to Qantas by way of a direct grant, a loan, a loan guarantee or a combination of all three. It is within the power of the government to act if it really believes the carbon tax is the cause of the problems at Qantas. The truth is that it is not and the government knows it, and that is why it will not act. It hides behind the excuse that the Labor opposition are standing in the way of the repeal of the carbon tax.


The government talks a lot about sound economic management, but in truth it has no answers and no policies. It is the government's policies that are actually damaging the bottom line of the budget. I want to talk about one of those policies which has not been clearly articulated when it comes to the loss of car-making in this country. When that industry is lost, Australia will lose about $3 billion in exports. It will also import an additional 100,000-odd cars a year, based on today's figures. What do members opposite think that will do to the balance of trade for this country and the budget bottom line? It will have a negative impact on it. But, again, have members opposite and the government considered those outcomes when they talk about their refusal to support industry in this country? They are critical of government debt, critical of the balance of payments and critical of debt generally, but their policies are going to add to the debt figure.


I have talked about some of the jobs that have already been lost, but it goes further than that. This is about the government rhetoric that the budget is in a mess, that we have massive debt and that the government have to fix it. It is a narrative that has been deliberately exaggerated for blatant political purposes. It has been exaggerated to cover their incompetence; to justify the harsh cuts that they will not talk about but which their Commission of Audit will undoubtedly recommend for the May budget; to attack the workers of this country; to attack the unions and give themselves cover for doing that; and to justify turning their backs on the environment and the environmental measures that were put in place by the previous government in order to create a balance between economic productivity and development and sound environmental management.


They run that narrative, exaggerating the budget position so that they can cut social outlays in this country—cuts to health, cuts to housing, cuts to education, cuts to disability support and so on. The worst of all, might I say, is the imposition of a GP tax of $6 every time someone visits a doctor. That, to me, scrapes the bottom of the barrel in terms of the desperation of this government: hitting people who need the most support at the time when they are looking after the their health.

"Coleman, David, MP",LP,2014-03-03,"



Mr COLEMAN
 (Banks) (12:37):  I am very pleased to be speaking today in favour of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014 and cognate bills and against the amendment moved by the opposition. These appropriation bills represent one of the first steps for the government in cleaning up the very substantial mess we have been left with by the previous Labor government, and what a mess it is. It is a mess which has quite a wide range of aspects to it. One of the most critical parts of that mess is the debt situation which, unfortunately, our nation is now burdened with.


The previous government came in with no net debt and, in fact, with money in the bank, but we are faced with very substantial net debt of circa $200 billion. We also have a situation where that debt is set to grow substantially unless the government acts. The extraordinary thing is that, over the next four years of forward estimates, MYEFO has estimated that $123 billion of additional deficits will be added to what is already a very sore and sorry budgetary position—a very substantial addition to the debt we would face should we follow the policies of the previous government. Even worse, MYEFO forecasts that, over the next decade, if the budgetary position is not addressed, the debt of the Commonwealth by the end of that period would be some $667 billion—that is, two-thirds of a trillion dollars, a completely unacceptable situation.


Labor governments over a long period have not been able to balance the books. The last time a Labor government had a surplus budget was 1989—a very long time ago. Labor had deficits in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995 and then there were more deficits in the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd period in 2008, 2009 , 2010, 2011 and 2012. Had it happened occasionally, in maybe one or two years during a particularly difficult economic period, it might be understandable. A reasonable person might say that they can understand why it was necessary to temporarily go into deficit for one or two years, but that is not the situation which occurred under the previous government. What occurred under the previous government and under the one before that was structural ongoing deficit, an addiction to spending and an inability to spend less than revenue taken in. That is the simple nub of the issue. If you consistently spend more than you take in, you are going to get into trouble. That is the case for families, for small businesses in my electorate and right around the nation, and it is certainly the case for governments. Cleaning up that debt position is certainly one of the key tasks for this government.


How did this situation arise? However could it get that bad? One of the key areas where we saw a huge blow-out in expenditure under the last government was border protection, or the lack thereof. When the previous government came in, the border security policies of the Howard government were working very effectively. As the previous member mentioned, a strong humanitarian program was in place and was being managed in an orderly fashion, and illegal boat arrivals had slowed to virtually none. The previous government said, 'Let's change what is working extremely well. Let's fundamentally dismantle a system which is serving the Australian people extremely well, and in the process let's spend billions and billions of dollars of borrowed money.' That is the sad reality of the previous government's border security policies, which saw a budget blow-out of more than $6 billion and spending of $11 billion or more.


There were many examples of this sort of policy on the run, lack of attention to detail and lack of understanding of how to manage programs in an operational sense. It is very easy to put out a press release. It does not take a long time. You type it up, you send it out and it is very simple. It is much harder to manage organisations effectively, especially organisations of the size and complexity of the federal government. Under the previous government we saw an addiction to the media cycle—to responding to the day's events—often in a way that was detrimental to the financial position of this country, feeding into the huge debt burden which we now face. A prime example of that was the decision in relation to live animal exports. The electorates of many members from your home state of Queensland, Deputy Speaker Vasta, and from other parts of the nation were affected very significantly by the former government's knee-jerk reaction, pretty much overnight, to abandon the live export industry. The extraordinary thing about that was the fact that it was such a harsh and ill-considered plan, taken so quickly, which had a huge negative impact on ordinary families right around the country, so much so that the previous government acknowledged their mistake and said, 'We'd better put together some sort of assistance package for these communities, which we've hit so hard with this poor policy.'


That assistance package cost about $100 million. If those opposite had not banned the industry overnight in such a superficial and shallow fashion, they would not then have had to spend $100 million trying to rescue it. It was a really relevant example of the lack of management expertise of the previous government. It was also a lack of financial acumen and a lack of respect for money, which was not only in evidence in the big programs such as the pink batts and the NBN—really a national joke under the Labor Party—but also in small programs that really give you an interesting and scary insight into the way the previous government used money.


One example of a lack of acumen was the spending on advertising of border protection policies prior to the last election. You might recall that there were very scary newspaper ads and gravely intoned radio advertisements supposedly targeting people smugglers and encouraging them to not ply their trade but which were, oddly, aired in rural, regional and metropolitan Australia where people smugglers are not typically based. There was about a $2 million spend on that program. In the scheme of an enormous budget it was a relatively small amount of money but it tells you something very important about the attitude towards spending of the previous government. What it tells you is there was a lack of respect for those funds and a lack of appreciation of the fact the government does not generate income.


The government does not create economic activity; the government is simply the beneficiary of it through taxation. So all of that money that the government takes in has in fact been created by the hard work of Australian families and Australian businesses whether through pay-as-you-go tax, company tax or capital gains tax. Whatever the source of revenue, the government did not do any of that work. The government did not work 40 or 50 hours a week having its tax taken out. The government did not take an entrepreneurial risk and employ people and really put its neck on the line to generate economic activity. The government did not do any of those things. The government was simply the beneficiary of that hard work. For the government to treat that money without respect was absolutely wrong.


It is a big task that we face. These appropriation bills represent one of the first steps in addressing it. There are some important steps that have already been taken by this government. So many projects were held up that the Minister for the Environment has given approvals for some $400-billion worth of environmental projects, infrastructure projects and the like. That means jobs in the creation of those projects and it also means ongoing economic benefit from the fact that those projects will exist.


Anyone who is in business, especially small business, does not like red tape. Frankly, if you are in business big or small, you have got better things to do than fill out forms for the government. You are worried about your business, you are worried about employing people and you are worried about paying the bills. The last thing you want to do at eight or nine o'clock at night when the day is done is get your HB pencil out and start filling in some forms for the government. Wherever we can minimise that regulatory burden, that is exactly what we should do.


The member for Kooyong has a tremendous initiative, 'repeal day', coming up soon when the government will be legislating to repeal more than 8,000 regulations—which is a particularly important initiative for the government. We have got to get rid of the carbon tax, of course. The carbon tax is causing such a drag on the economy at the moment. The comments of Mr Borghetti, the CEO of Virgin Australia, were well reported last week and demonstrated that the carbon tax has numerous impacts. One impact is the financial cost to the companies that have to pay it and to the households that have to pay higher electricity and other bills. The other impact is the contraction of economic activity which results from those additional costs. As in any business, if you have additional costs then that is a problem for you and you need to adjust your activities; perhaps cut back in a certain area or not do something you were planning on doing because you now have this additional cost. If that cost was not in place, it would not be necessary for such significant changes to have to occur. So getting rid of the carbon tax is absolutely fundamental and an important initiative for the government.


Free trade is a great driver of economic activity. The government has already got strong runs on the board with the South Korean free trade agreement, which will take tariffs off some 99.8 per cent of Australian products into South Korea. Importantly for my electorate of Banks, the government is working on a free trade agreement with the Republic of China. My electorate has the largest number of people of Chinese background of any electorate in Australia. There is a very warm and close relationship between my electorate and the people of China. We have many students here from China who are studying in our universities and colleges, and many businesses in my electorate work closely both in imports and exports with China and related markets. Free trade is an important part of the government's agenda and those discussions with China certainly will be of great benefit to my electorate.


These appropriation bills are an important first step in addressing the enormous mess that the Labor Party has left behind. It is incumbent on a new government to look honestly at the situation, to look the Australian people in the eye when things are not right and say they are not right, and say we are going to put them right. As the Prime Minister and Treasurer said, not all of those decisions are easy. Not all of those initiatives are simple to take but they need to be taken because we cannot just sleepwalk into the future as the previous government was doing. We cannot just keep spending and spending like money is going out of fashion. We need to take an orderly and sensible approach to financial management. We need to make sure that when we spend a dollar of the people's we are asking ourselves: 'Is this a good use of their hard-earned funds? Is this something that needs to be done?' And, if it is not something that needs to be done, then it cannot be done.


Managing the budget carefully is absolutely critical. The fact that we are on track for a debt position of some two-thirds of a trillion dollars in 10 years if we do not change course is a frightening statistic. It is something we cannot allow to happen. It is certainly not something that this government will allow, because we will be making a number of important changes to get this country back on track, and passing these appropriations bills is an important step in that.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:53):  I rise today to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014 and related bills and on Labor's worthy amendments.


I have listened to a number of my colleagues speak on these bills over the last week, and I must say it has left me with feelings of utter despair. It was despair I felt as my colleagues pointed out the gross hypocrisy and dishonesty of those opposite in their approach to spending—most evident in their blatantly political injection of $8.8 billion into the Reserve Bank. It was despair I felt as my colleagues detailed the cuts to health and education—a flagrant breach of the coalition's pre-election promises not to cut health or education. It was despair I felt when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition detailed the cuts this government is making within the foreign affairs and international development portfolio, cuts that are hurting those most in need in our very own region—in Asia and the Pacific—despite this government's promise to make our region the focus of its international development policy.


There are a number of aspects of these bills that I would like to speak about today. The first is the $13.2 million being ripped from the health portfolio in this financial year. I am not the only one who recalls that prior to the election those opposite promised no cuts to health. On the eve of the election—1 September 2013, to be exact—then opposition leader, now Prime Minister Tony Abbott, appearing on the ABC's Insiders program said:


And I want to give people this absolute assurance: no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no changes to pensions, and no changes to the GST.


But, since coming to power, the government's record in health has included: ripping $100 million from the Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital; abolishing the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council; backflipping on the promise not to close any Medicare Locals; abolishing the expert panel on the marketing of infant formula; and placing the jobs of departmental staff at risk and moving those awaiting redundancy to a permanent departure lounge. Based on its record so far, it would appear that the Abbott government has no vision for the health portfolio other than to make cuts.


I would like to talk today about one of the cuts that has already been inflicted. Last Friday, after 48 years of providing frank and fearless advice to policymakers, the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia closed its doors for good. This closure came after the Assistant Minister for Health—the minister responsible for the preventative health of Australia—Minister Nash, inexplicably cut ADCA's funding late last year.


ADCA was the non-government national peak body representing the interests of the alcohol and other drugs sector. Established in 1966, it has provided a voice for those who work to reduce the harm caused by alcohol and other drugs for nearly half a century. ADCA was based in my electorate of Canberra, just a couple of kilometres from where we are right now, but it worked for the betterment of all Australians, as well as for our neighbours in Asia and the Pacific who can learn from our experience in this space.


Some of the services that had been provided by ADCA, which will now no longer be provided, include: National Drug Sector Information Service; the Register of Australian Drug and Alcohol Research; the National Inhalants Information Service; the drug database; Drugfields—a professional development, policy and practice information service for the Australian alcohol and drug sector; 'Update', an alcohol and other drugs information bulletin board; Drug Action Week, which is incredibly popular; 'Drug talk', an alcohol and other drugs discussion list; and, of course, their one-of-a-kind, incredible library of resources.


The decision to axe ADCA truly came out of the blue. Earlier last year, under the Labor government, ADCA received an assurance of its ongoing funding. And, on 14 October last year, Prime Minister Abbott wrote to ADCA and said, 'I look forward to working with you in the years ahead.' Just six weeks after the Prime Minister had written these words, ADCA was axed. Understandably, many have been wondering why.


Why, after nearly fifty years of representing the Alcohol and Other Drugs Sector, is this the only government which has decided it does not need ADCA's advice? Is it because ADCA's support of the Australia 21 report on the prohibition of illicit drugs was too progressive for this conservative government? Is it an internal political decision we do not understand—given former Liberal MP the Hon. Dr Mal Washer is ADCA's president and former Liberal senator, Senator the Hon. Gary Humphries, was a director? Is it some form of payback, because ADCA have been critical of the NSW and QLD Liberal state governments' response to alcohol induced violence? Did it have anything to do with the reported links between Minister Nash's now former chief of staff and the alcohol industry? The fact is we will continue to wonder, because this government has not given a reason.


Minister Nash first said ADCA had a history of financial mismanagement—which was proved completely untrue. She then said the work of its incredible resource library was duplicated, only to retract that statement. This library is the only resource of its kind in the world and it would seem it is destined for the shredder.


With the many, many cuts being inflicted by this government, it is easy to lose perspective, so let me reintroduce some sorely needed perspective. The government has saved around $1.5 million in annual funding by cutting ADCA. The estimated cost of just one Australian living with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder over their lifetime can be up to $15 million. That is 10 times the annual budget of ADCA.


As the member for Canberra, I am concerned about the 14 ADCA staff who are my constituents and who have now lost their jobs. I am concerned about the landlord who has lost a tenant and the local businesses which will lose a client. But I am even more concerned about the implications for the future health of our country and the region as a result of the axing of ADCA.


Another cut outlined in these bills that I would like to talk about today is the $11.5 million that has been ripped from the Building Multicultural Communities Program. The program provided one-off grants to empower local multicultural communities to strengthen social cohesion and promote inclusion in diverse communities. Some of the community groups in Canberra that received grants under the former Labor government included the ACT Jewish Community, the Australian Chinese Culture Exchange and Promotion Association, the Bangladeshi Seniors Club, the Canberra Islamic Centre and the Spanish Speakers Association.


When the government announced that they were cutting funding from this program, these organisations were left in limbo. Would they receive the grants that they had applied for months before the election? We all know that grassroots community organisations like these run on the smell of an oily rag. These grants were a much needed injection of funds that would reinvigorate their work, and for months these organisations have been in the dark. To date, of the 29 community groups that were awarded grants in the ACT, only two have received their funding. Many have been told they will not be receiving their funding at all but might be eligible for compensation. Many more are still in the dark.


As recently as two weeks ago I received a phone call from a representative of one of these organisations who had been told she would receive her grant. Even though she keeps being reassured that it is going to be okay, will this actually occur? The stress this was causing her was evident. The decisions of this government are hurting those individuals and groups in our community who give up their time to ensure we live in a better, more inclusive society.


The 2013-14 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers clearly show that $11.5 million is being taken out of this program. I quote from the MYEFO papers:


The Government will achieve savings of $11.5 million by not proceeding with funding for the Building Multicultural Communities programme, announced in 2013‑14 Budget …


I am taking the time to point this out because, in defending this cut, Liberal senator for the ACT, Senator Sesejla, has told the community groups who have lost their funding that the grants were never funded. He said:


They promised something they didn't have the money for. They didn't allocate the money for it.


He has repeated this claim again and again. He has accused Labor of handing out grants that there was no money for. I would like to say to Senator Seselja: if the money wasn't allocated, how are you able to make a $11.5 million saving by cutting the program? Senator Seselja has either been blatantly misleading the ACT community or he is too incompetent to read Labor's 2013-14 budget and the MYEFO document his own government prepared. Either way, he owes Canberrans an explanation.


So many of the cuts outlined in these bills have caused me concern, but perhaps what has caused me the most concern is the cuts to the Education portfolio. We all heard those opposite say before the election again and again that when it came to education they were on a unity ticket with Labor. Those are their words, not ours—a unity ticket. But following the election it is clear that nothing could be further from the truth.


Those opposite speak about the importance of vocational education in our schools. The Parliamentary Secretary for Education, Senator Ryan, has praised trade training centres for addressing skills shortages. He has also said that the government needs to consider 'innovative and practical approaches to deliver trade qualifications in schools'. The Assistant Minister for Education, the member for Farrer, has declared the importance of vocational education in schools, saying:


… there's not enough “try a trade” for those kids in school so they can see what it is they want to do.


She went on to say:



… what we need to do is make sure that from a pathway in say Year ten, they're directed into a career in the trade that suits them …



If those opposite really believe this, why have they cut an incredibly successful vocational education initiative in the trade training centres? In government, Labor funded 510 trades training centres in schools around Australia, with more than 60 per cent in regional areas.


I have visited the trade training centres in my electorate and I know what an incredibly valuable asset they are. I have visited the building and construction trade training centre at St Mary MacKillop College, where I spoke to students who have told me that they have stayed in school because of that trade training centre. I spoke to students who travel for over two hours every day from Cooma to Canberra so that they can go to school at MacKillop because of that trade training centre.


Just two weeks ago I visited Wanniassa High School, which had experienced severe flood damage as a result of the storms here in Canberra. While I was inspecting the damage, Principal Karen Nagorcka was most keen to show me their new trade training centre—still under construction—which had miraculously escaped the damage. I have visited the commercial kitchen trade training centre at St Clare's College, just down the road on Canberra Avenue, where students are able to commence their qualifications in hospitality without leaving school, so they can keep studying languages and English while gaining the qualifications they need for their chosen trade.


Now, more than ever, Australia needs to give every Australian student every opportunity to secure a high-skill, high-wage job of the future. The decision by the Abbott government to cut trade training centres is disgraceful and short-sighted. It shows that they have no understanding of the skills and qualifications that young Australians require for the future. It shows that they have no plan for jobs in Australia, because if they did they would understand the importance of trades. It shows that, despite the talk, those opposite do not care about vocational education.


Just days before the election, the now Prime Minister promised on national television that under an Abbott government there would be no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS. But here in these bills—the very first opportunity the Abbott government have had to present bills concerning money supply—we see cuts to health, cuts to education. We see broken promises. We see that this is not the government they promised to be. Before the election, Prime Minister Abbott promised he would lead a government of 'no surprises and no excuses'. Here are the surprises, clearly set out for us. I would like to know what his excuse is.

"Jones, Ewen, MP",LP,2014-03-03,"



Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (13:07):  In rising to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2013-2014 and cognate bills, I want to spend most of my time speaking about positive things and speaking about the future. To start with, I would like to centre my comments on the development of northern Australia. Truly one of the great moments in political life in Australia is when you have a Prime Minister who has the vision to stand up and say that, although there are 142 seats below the Tropic of Capricorn and there are only eight seats north of the Tropic of Capricorn, the country has to go to the north. What I want to see with the development of northern Australia is for us to get the development right—and, to get that right, we must work in partnership with science.


Cast your mind back to 2009 and the oil spill from the Montara oil rig in the Timor Sea. Green groups were up in arms afterwards about how they would ever find out what had gone on, the destruction of the environment and the damage that would go on for generations and generations. Before they commenced operations, the owners of the Montara oil rig had the foresight and vision to do a survey of the area in which they were going to drill. They grabbed the Institute of Marine Science, based in Townsville, to do a full survey of what was there. So when they did have the oil spill they were able to go through it afterwards and have a look at what damage was actually caused—and there was no damage.


We need to make sure that we have information to hand. If we are going to have development along our coastlines, if we are going to develop in places in the Timor Sea and the Torres Strait, and if we are going to expand our ports along the Queensland coastline, we must make sure that we engage with scientific organisations such as the Australian Institute of Marine Science and we get our baseline science and our mapping right so that we understand what is at stake, how it is going to be built, when it is going to be built and what the consequences of that will be. When talking about the environment I have always said that everything we do has an effect on the environment. The fact that we are in this place now speaking affects our environment. It is how we manage that effect which makes us the people we are. So we must handle that expansion and development of northern Australia in the right way.


If you ask anyone in Australia what the biggest river system is in this country, invariably people will say the Murray-Darling. That is the obvious answer, but it is in fact not correct. If we are truly to develop northern Australian, we must make sure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the Murray-Darling. We must make sure that we use the science correctly and speak to people like Dr Damien Burrows at JCU and the CSIRO in North Queensland. We have 25 river systems in the north of Queensland and we had the baseline science on about five of those river systems. The Murray-Darling starts in both the Snowy Mountains and in Queensland and it flows into the Great Australian Bight. In Queensland, we have river systems that not only flow into the Great Australian Bight but also flow into Lake Eyre, the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Great Barrier Reef and the Pacific Ocean. The Fitzroy and Burdekin river systems are two massive river systems, both carrying much more water than the Murray-Darling.


We must ensure that we understand what is going on. If we are to develop agriculture and the resources west of the Great Dividing Range, in places like the Gilbert River and all those places out west, we must ensure that we have our baseline science right. It would be pointless and sheer folly to replicate the mistakes that have been made over the last 200 years on the Murray-Darling. It would be sheer folly to plant a $20 million mung bean crop if it was to destroy the billion dollar prawn fisheries of the Gulf of Carpentaria. We must make sure that we understand what we are dealing with here. When we are talking about the development of agriculture in the north of Australia, we must make sure that we understand the consequences of what the water is doing, how we are to store it, where it is to be stored and for what it is to be used.


I see the development of northern Australia as that key turning point in the north's future. I also see it as a fair bit of pressure on northern Australia and a fair bit of pressure on the members of parliament in the north of Australia. We have a Prime Minister who had the vision to actually put this forward, we have a Treasurer who understands where the country must go, we have a Minister for Trade and Investment who is actively out there pushing our case for us and we have a Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and Minister for Foreign Affairs saying that this is a great idea. There are four members of cabinet, at the very top, who are saying that this should happen. If we as the members of parliament for the north of Australia miss this opportunity, it will be gone forever. I see this as a huge opportunity for us, but it is also a huge risk. It is an opportunity that we must grab and we must be very aggressive with it.


In relation to the development of northern Australia, I feel that we must include our nearest neighbour, Port Moresby. The previous mayor of Townsville—the mayor of Townsville when I arrived in Townsville in 1994—Tony Mooney, would always say that the closest capital city to Townsville is not Brisbane but is in fact Port Moresby. Papua New Guinea and Port Moresby have been great friends of Australia for an awfully long time. It has been 72 years now since the battle of the Kokoda Trail and the fuzzy wuzzy angels. Papua New Guinea has been there for us for an awfully long time. Our relationship has ebbed and flowed. I truly believe that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Peter O'Neill, wants the best for his country and wants our relationship to grow.


One of the issues that we have at the moment is the two-way visa issue between the two countries. Papua New Guinea is in the process of cancelling visas on arrival. What used to happen is that you would be able hop on a plane in Cairns and fly to Port Moresby and get your visa at Jackson Field airport on arrival. That does not happen for people from Papua New Guinea when they arrive in Australia. Mind you, it does not happen for any country. We do not have 'visa on arrival' for any country. But the perception is there that we are putting up roadblocks for people from Papua New Guinea—those who have business, education and cultural exchange work to do—to come to Australia. We must address that basic perception.


What we must do is make the process as simple as possible. If possible, we should create special categories of visa for people to do business, for people to do education and for people on cultural exchanges to make us an easier to get to country for them. The people you talk to in Papua New Guinea—from the Prime Minister to the previous Prime Minister, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, to people in business—will all sit there and say that they would do more in Australia but it was just too hard to get to. We must address the basic proposition that we are putting up roadblocks. I know that the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, is working very hard in relation to this process. What we must do is try to simplify the process, try to make it more online and try to make it more user friendly so that we can get to this country and exchange these things more easily.


I believe that Peter O'Neill is heading his country in the right direction. In a recent speech to the Institute of Company Directors on the Gold Coast, he spoke specifically about getting direct flights to Townsville. Whether we organise that as a direct flight or via Cairns is another thing. He also spoke about trying to get involved in the microeconomic form of business-to-business operations between the two countries, and specifically Townsville. I think that this is where we must go. If the relationship between the two countries is to grow, it must grow on a business-to-business basis. I think Prime Minister O'Neill has the bull by the horns here and has the right idea. We must be able to engage better between the two countries on a business-to-business basis, and I know that Townsville business and our Townsville Chamber of Commerce are working very hard to facilitate that. 


Another pat on the back that you must give the Papua New Guinean government is for their attitude to corruption. Corruption is often spoken about as being a major issue between the two countries. Prime Minister O'Neill gave a recent speech to the governors of all provinces in Papua New Guinea and addressed the issue of corruption and how it must stop now that Papua New Guinea is on the cusp of a bright new age; that if they do not change the way they do their own business internally, they will never get the results that they should be getting internationally. If we can assist in any way, shape or form with the provision of the services that can assist with that, we should.


Townsville also stands on the cusp of being a major services hub. If you draw a right-angled triangle and have Townsville at the 90-degree axis, straight to the north of us is Papua New Guinea and straight to the east of us is Fiji. If you draw an arc from that 90-degree axis, you will basically get the entire Melanesian world within the circumference of that circle. You will get from Papua New Guinea to Bougainville to the Solomon Islands and around to Vanuatu, New Caledonia and Fiji. Townsville can be the hub for services because we have a great university, a major teaching hospital, the defence force, a police academy, TAFE and Australian technical colleges. We have all these services already there. What we must be doing is facilitating the growth of those other countries by inviting them to come and participate fully in the use our facilities. Whether we do that by using our aid money for these countries or by them getting the aid money and purchasing services off Australian companies, be that as it may, what I do think we will do is get better results by using Townsville as that hub. That will mean that we will have to have people there from Austrade, the department of immigration and people from Foreign Affairs to get these things done, because we are the natural hub for business in northern Australia and we will need to make Townsville a truly international city.


In the time I have left in this debate I would like to discuss the work between the two countries at a defence level. The PNG defence force needs a lot of work and assistance. In Townsville we have the largest Army base in the country. We extend services and do joint operations with services from Papua New Guinea, but we could be doing a lot more. We could be doing exchanges and providing assistance in relation to how the PNG defence force is actually operating, their chains of command and the way they can set up a truly operational facility. What we need to be doing is getting more active in this space, getting in there and assisting them with that. It would be on invitation only, of course, but what we must be doing is looking at the best result for the Australian taxpayer across the board. If you look at where the two countries come closest in the Torres Strait, what we have to do is look at the most effective use of taxpayer funded equipment by basing things such as the C27J or the MRH90 helicopter in Townsville and being able to use them for surveillance. That will also attract high-end engineering jobs, which will then attract the second-tier engineering jobs and those sorts of things to maximise the return for the taxpayer. 


One of the criticisms I have of the previous government is that, in the rush to greater scale, they did not look at where the actual dollars were. They were neglecting saving the pennies and were just looking at the pounds. As my grandmother would always tell me, if you look after the pennies, the pounds will take care of themselves. We had situations where a contract had signed that everything would go down to Albury-Wodonga, to Bandiana, to be repaired and that they would get economies of scale and better results by sending stuff down there instead of getting the servicing done locally. How you get better economies of scale or better service by neglecting your local foundries and local engineering firms and instead putting a gearbox on a truck and sending it all the way to Albury-Wodonga to be repaired, or putting an engine on a pallet on a truck and taking it the 3,000 kilometres to Bandiana to have it rebored, then back on truck all the way back to Townsville, beggars belief. The Townsville business would produce better work at more affordable prices with a quicker turnaround and better use of the asset. This says so much about what was going wrong with the previous government.


What we must be doing is looking at how we maximise the benefit to the taxpayer and making sure that autonomy is given as close as possible to the relevant incident or occurrence. We can then get the best result for the Australian taxpayer. We must make sure we maximise those returns by shopping locally, by building the better relationships, by letting the bloke in the department who is heading up that section of the Army, Air Force or Navy go direct to his supplier and get it fixed locally, which means there will be a quicker turnaround for absolutely everyone. I thank the House.

"Ryan, Joanne, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (13:22):  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I welcome it not because I am enthusiastic about the content of this bill but because I think it perfectly epitomises the actions and approach of the Abbott government to date. The bill before us is yet another example of their willingness to break promise after promise, yet another ideological attack on the central tenets of our society and yet another kick in the guts for every vulnerable Australian. It is what this government is all about. In just a few short months they have wreaked havoc. Take, for example, the first parliamentary sitting week of the year: in just seven days they managed to finish off the Australian car industry, blame affected workers for wanting wages and conditions, and then backtrack on their promise to deliver new jobs. I am sure they see it as quite the achievement. Broken promises, ideological attacks and hurting working Australians is this Liberal government's bread and butter.


So let us see what further pain they can inflict with these new appropriation bills. How about cutting $13.2 million from the Health portfolio, $4.8 million from education, $4.6 million from legal policy reform and advocacy funding, or $11.5 million from the Building Multicultural Communities program. They certainly have stayed true to form, with broken promise after broken promise. After all, this is the very same Prime Minister who said on the eve of the election that there would be 'no cuts to education, no cuts to health, no change to pensions, no change to the GST and no cuts to the ABC or SBS'. Let us break that down. Mr Abbott said there would be no cuts to education, a unity ticket: that did not last long. No cuts to health: obviously abolishing one of our oldest peak public health organisations does not count. No changes to pensions: I am not sure what Mr Abbott thinks a welfare review is for, then. No GST changes: mobile home owners who fought against the government's tax hike might disagree. And no cuts to the ABC or SBS, just apparently an efficiency and expenses review. It is almost like a checklist of cuts to come, a checklist of broken promises, a checklist to mislead the Australian people. So much for a no surprises, no excuses government. The Abbott government has consistently said one thing before the election and then gone and done the complete opposite. 


This is, after all, the party that said on multiple occasions that if debt is the problem then more debt is not the answer. What then did they do in government? They cut a deal with their avowed enemies, the Greens, to legislate for an unlimited debt ceiling—quite a backflip. And how many times did we see the current Prime Minister and Treasurer get to their feet in the lead-up to the election and claim Australia had a budget emergency? They claimed we were headed for disaster. I heard more of it today in this House. They claimed that only they could fix it. I guess they hoped that if they said it often enough it would become the truth, and when it did not they decided to change the rules. As the Secretary of the Department of Finance told Senate estimates recently, the Mid-Year Fiscal and Economic Outlook has discarded the former Labor government's fiscal rules which limited real spending growth. Mr David Tune confirmed that this change in assumptions had increased the outlook's projections of budget debt over the next 10 years. So the government changes the rules to suit its own purposes and then, lo and behold, uncovers a $667 billion debt figure in 2023-24. It is a disgraceful action by the Treasurer; it is deplorable. This willingness to fiddle with figures might also explain why the Treasurer decided to gift $9 billion to the Reserve Bank. It was an interesting choice, particularly given that there had been no indication that this was money they asked for or needed. 


So why would the government do this? What reason could they possibly have to create and craft a bad result? It is because they are looking for excuses to cut health care, excuses to slash education and excuses to rip up important infrastructure and services around Australia. So obsessed are they with cutting, they are willing to distort the budget numbers in order to justify their ideological agenda. And we know from history that this is something those opposite do. They say, 'We can't afford it and it costs too much.' They attempt to dupe and deceive the Australian public in order to cut, cut, cut. But it flies in the face of logic that if we cannot afford vital health and education services we can somehow afford the coalition's exorbitant Paid Parental Leave scheme, or tax and superannuation breaks for some of our most wealthy. To put it simply, if we are broke, we should not be eating caviar. But the truth is we are not broke, it is just a question of priorities. So it seems that the health of our nation and the future of our kids, creating an equitable and welcoming society, none of this matters to the Abbott government; they simply do not care. 


There is a fundamental disconnect between what Australian people want and what the Abbott government is delivering. After all, this is a government that relentlessly pursues inequity. It is a passion of theirs. It is in their bones. They govern for the big end of town while leaving the rest of us behind. We see it again and again. As my colleague the member for Throsby said last week, if you want a tax cut under this government then you had better own a mining company. At the same time as they reward big business they are cutting the schoolkids bonus. They are arguing that we cannot afford to help low-income earners with their lifetime superannuation savings. They are saying that Australian workers like those at Toyota and Holden earn too much. 


And if you need any more proof that this is a government that embraces inequality, look no further than their Gonski backflip with triple pike. It was those opposite that promised they shared a unity ticket with us on better schools funding. The Minister for Education pledged to us that he understood the importance of better and more equal education, but of course with this government promises and pledges mean little—in fact, zip. Despite their promises to the contrary, fundamentally, and buried deep within, this is a party that does not believe in funding education. Overcoming disadvantage, a fair go, creating equality—that is not what the Liberal Party are about. And now they are in government they no longer have to fool the Australian people, they are showing their true colours. They are pursuing their dreams of inequality and inequity. They are robbing from the poor to give to the rich. Yet this is the very same party that said they would govern for every Australian. I cannot recall how many times I saw a member of the coalition during the campaign with their Real Solutions pamphlet in hand. It contained, they claimed, the cure for every problem. It promised hope, reward and opportunity for everyone. But, as you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. The bill before us is yet another example which proves that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer govern for a minority, a small few with vested interests, and certainly not for everyday Australians.

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (13:30):  I draw the House's attention to the inspirational story of Katherine Marshall and her family who live in my electorate. Katherine is 23 years old and has been fighting an extremely rare immune disease, atypical haemolytic uraemia syndrome or aHUS, since 2010. When I first met the Marshall family in 2012, Katherine was consigned to a life at home, besieged by constant fatigue and endless trips to the hospital.


Her family and physicians drew my urgent attention to Soliris, a drug produced by Alexion Pharmaceuticals. Alexion has been gracious in providing a compassionate access supply of Soliris to Katherine. The effect on Katherine was immediate and positive. In her father's, Gary's, words: 'She is a totally different girl now.'


Since then, the Marshall family have advocated for other aHUS sufferers, many of whom do not have compassionate access. They have established a support group and attracted national media about the need for aHUS sufferers to be covered for Soliris under the Life Saving Drugs Program. This support group has run a national petition calling on parliamentarians to support funding for Soliris through the Life Saving Drugs Program for sufferers of aHUS. More than 22,000 Australians signed the petition, which was tabled in the House earlier today. I want to commend their energy, compassion and sacrifice and to support their efforts in making sure that not only Katherine but other sufferers get access to Soliris.

 (Warringah—Prime Minister) (14:00):  The situation in the Ukraine is fluid and it is threatening. It is something that all Australians are rightly concerned about and that people right around the world are rightly concerned about. I can inform the House that this morning the Russian ambassador was called into the department of foreign affairs to be told in no uncertain terms what Australia thinks about this aggression against an independent country. I can inform the House that a visit to Russia by the Minister for Trade and Investment will not go ahead and I can further inform the House that a visit to Australia by the Russian national security adviser likewise will not go ahead.


Unprovoked aggression should have no place in our world. Russia should back off; it should withdraw its forces from the Ukraine. The people of the Ukraine ought to be able to determine their future themselves. That is what should happen.




Mr Shorten:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: I associate the opposition with the Prime Minister's remarks. Today, our thoughts are with all the people of Ukraine. We understand that people of all faiths and backgrounds have worked hard to create a Ukrainian democracy.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (15:12):  I rise to speak to the Address-in-Reply to Her Excellency the Governor-General. It is an honour to speak again on this matter. My previous address-in-reply was my first speech in this place in October 2010, and I congratulate the new member for Griffith and all my new colleagues who have given their first speech during this debate.


Following the custom adopted by many of my colleagues, I will use this opportunity to provide the parliament with an update on some of the programs I have implemented in Bennelong and also a short review following the results of last September's federal election. In my first speech I said:


Opportunity is the first essential ingredient to achieve success.


… … …


To realise our country’s full potential, every Australian must have the opportunity to compete and earn just reward for their effort and success. 


I remain grateful for the opportunities provided to me throughout my life. In this role, as legislators, we are endowed with an important task of ensuring those less fortunate than ourselves are also provided opportunities to succeed in life. It is, therefore, most appropriate that the first local program I will talk about, and also the one I am most proud of, is the Bennelong Gardens Project.


As patron to the disability services organisation Achieve Australia, and also as an ambassador for Lifeline, I developed this project as a way to empower those in our community suffering from debilitating health issues, to give them the opportunity to take ownership over a local venture, with the aim to build it into a rewarding and profitable exercise. The Bennelong Gardens project seeks to utilise unused public land to establish commercial market gardens operated and owned by people with disabilities. Retirees are also invited to participate as a way to facilitate active recreation and social engagement, and to give a new sense of purpose to their lives. For their continuous support of the Bennelong Gardens project, I thank Michael Trail of Social Ventures Australia, Anne Bryce and Sunita Menezes of Achieve Australia, Tristan Harris of Harris Farms, Patrick Soars from Australian Native Landscapes, Sue Dennett of Karonga schools and Martin Wren from Nova Employment. We look forward to receiving support from the New South Wales state government in the form of approving sites that we have identified. No pressure—yesterday would have been just fine!


I entered this parliament on the back of many years as a small business operator, following my father's lifetime of experience in this most difficult but most rewarding of sectors. While distributing ANZAC brochures to local businesses in 2012 in some of our 20 villages, there was a tale of woe being repeated by nearly every business owner. The complaint was: 'These are the toughest times we have ever had to endure.' The dominance of the major retail players had left many in despair, contemplating capitulation. Shortly after my election in 2010, I commenced the Bennelong Village Business initiative, or BVB. This was designed to help local business owners by providing a platform for a collective approach to marketing the unique services they provide to the community. Inspired by Prime Minister Abbott's direct action philosophy, we formed Bennelong Village Businesses to gain a collective power to negotiate on the part of some 350 traders in 20 villages. The first result was a 33 per cent discount for advertising in our local paper, John Booth's The WeeklyTimes. Then more assistance came from Boehringer Ingelheim with marketing and design of our brochures, which were letterbox-dropped throughout the community.


In 2012 I moved a motion in this place for which I was grateful to receive bipartisan support. The motion formally recognised the significant contribution that Australian Chinese have made to our nation's modern multicultural society. The motion noted the strong history of Chinese migration to Australia throughout the past 200 years, and the vibrant festivities and events hosted by the Bennelong Chinese community and enjoyed by people from all cultures in the region. Over the past month, I have been fortunate to attend many community events as part of the lunar New Year, with our strong and vital Chinese and Korean communities coming together to treat us to a magnificent program of celebrations as we farewelled the Year of the Snake and welcomed the Year of the Horse.


One of the local events I developed in early 2011 has become a growing annual celebration. This is the Bennelong Cup Table Tennis competition, which grew out of the Bennelong Schools Table Tennis Program. This program was developed to engage students from a variety of cultural backgrounds through the sport of table tennis. Hyundai generously agreed to sponsor the provision of table-tennis tables and equipment to all 40 schools in the electorate of Bennelong, which has one of the largest Chinese communities in Australia. The Bennelong Cup has become an annual event and sees top table-tennis players from China, Korea, Japan and Australia compete to promote social engagement through their sport.


In September last year, I received a strong vote of support from the people of Bennelong. The support I received from across my electorate is a product of both my ongoing work as a local member and the strong national leadership of Prime Minister Abbott, who leads a united and focused team. Former member for Bennelong and Prime Minister John Howard once said, 'All politics is local.' The people of Bennelong have elected me and this government with a mandate to govern in the best interests of our nation—to provide a safe and secure Australia, to return to the levels of hope, reward and opportunities that we grew accustomed to during the Howard era. 


I commit to the good people of Bennelong, from Ermingon to Chatswood West, from North Epping to Meadowbank, from Carlingford to Gladesville and from Eastwood to East Ryde, to continue to serve as a representative for the entire electorate, to work hard for you, for your businesses and for your families. We will face many challenges over the coming years as our economy is put back on track. By working together, we will develop a stronger community and a better future for our next generation.


As every member in this place will agree, elections are gruelling tests of our dedication to the task and to our community whilst trying to balance the needs of our families and those close to us. I was very fortunate to receive an abundance of assistance and tireless dedication from a large team of campaign workers. I have thanked each and every one of them personally but wish to reiterate my appreciation to them on the parliamentary record.

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen—Second Deputy Speaker) (15:20):  It is a pleasure to speak in the address-in-reply debate. Back in November 2013, the Governor-General gave her speech for the new government in this parliament. It has now been five long months since that election. Since then, we have seen from the coalition what can only be described as one of the most catastrophic starts to a new government in political history. We have a government that has spent three years opposing everything but standing for nothing. Australian voters are now experiencing a bit of buyer's regret as this government has shown it is not the government Australian people voted for. The honeymoon period that new governments should expect is long since over.


I start by talking about the electorate of McEwen, which I have been re-elected to represent. It is an honour to be standing here, having been given the trust of the many communities who make up the seat of McEwen, and to be the first Labor member to retain McEwen in 25 years since the late, great Peter Cleeland. There are quite a few people who I need to personally thank with regard to my election campaign. Firstly, to my ever-supportive family, Lisa, Rachael, Mum and Dad, Glenda, Sharyn, Meagan, Jessica, Elly, David, Geoff, Belinda, Brooke and Jaya—and I note that, at 16 years old, it was Brooke's first election campaign and she did a fantastic job: your constant support and understanding throughout this period was amazing. I could not have done this without you. To my staff during the election, Josh, Jeni, Gareth, Chris and Hailey: your hard work around the clock, your camaraderie, your intelligence and your humour were invaluable. I also pay tribute to the Labor branch members of McEwen: the ever-reliable Carmel and her wonderful family, who answered Mum's call seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and Santo, Tom, Jon, Gurri, Casey, Stephen, Rex, Pam, Spiro, Stephen, Phil and of course Big Andy, who always made sure the table was empty when he finished.


I would like to especially thank the 300-plus volunteers who helped out during the election campaign and on election day. They took time out of their own lives to help us, to help the cause, and I am truly grateful. I will continue to work tirelessly for the communities of McEwen, ensuring that the trust and the faith they have again placed in me will be entirely justified. The people of McEwen re-elected me as their voice, and I will ensure that that voice is heard.


On 7 September 2013 a shadow was cast over this great country of ours. The Abbott government came into power and, with that, all the futures, hopes and dreams, not to mention the livelihoods of millions of Australians, came into doubt. That fear has become a reality for many families. The coalition government causes great concern for many Australians, particularly those in the seat of McEwen. They are concerned for their jobs, the environment and, more recently, our standing on the international stage. It would be easy to dismiss those concerns if they were not so consistent and happening right across the nation.


We have seen a government come into power on the strength of a few negative three-word slogans but, in reality, they are very far from doing what they promised—which I will talk more about later on. Even in the first few months since coming to power, the Abbott government have delivered nothing but a long line of broken promises and policy backflips. Unfortunately for the people of Australia, we now have a Prime Minister who is opposed to the fair go for all and helping those in our community who are most in need.


For the people of McEwen, their needs are inherent, varied and significant. McEwen is a disparate electorate. Since its creation in 1984, McEwen has straddled the two major political parties. It has always been a very marginal seat due to the wide-ranging demographics. In fact, McEwen has always been one of the most marginal seats in Australia. While it is a predominantly rural electorate in size, containing areas like Kilmore and Seymour, it also contains some of the fastest-growing municipalities in Victoria such as Craigieburn, Sunbury and Mernda. We have a community of over 104,000 people who, under Labor, have seen considerable investment in health care, education, jobs, communications, infrastructure and community facilities. One important point to mention here is that investment of this scale was never delivered during 14 years of continuous Liberal representation.


In the 3½ years that I have been the member for McEwen, Labor has provided almost $30 million in funding for hospitals, health clinics and local health practices. A major example of this is the $9.2million Wallan superclinic, which opened its doors in December 2013. This clinic was one the new government wanted scrapped. With a lack of all-round health services available to those in and around Wallan, the Wallan superclinic now provides a range of health services, such as improved access to general practice consultations, nursing, dietetics, podiatry, speech pathology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, paediatric, mental health and counselling services. We also invested $4.95 million towards the Macedon Ranges Community Health Facility in Gisborne, under the HHF regional priority round. This was actually opposed by the new government but, now that it is being rolled out, they are suddenly all too keen to claim the glory by getting their picture taken during sod-turning ceremonies. The question is: will they acknowledge that, without a Labor government, the community would not have seen this facility delivered?


We implemented the Building the Education Revolution initiative across all schools in all parts of the electorate. This program delivered crucial and much-wanted science and learning centres, language and learning centres, classrooms, libraries and sporting facilities, along with a hydrotherapy pool for children and those in the wider community with special needs. These investments in jobs, investments in education and investments in our communities have delivered facilities and opportunities for regional communities that no other government before us had ever delivered.


I recall having parents, teachers and members of the wider community tell me of the excitement in watching new facilities being built at their schools for the first time in 30 years. Parents and families had come and spent their weekends participating in working bees to further enhance existing buildings, lifting them towards the standards that the BER buildings had delivered. I was particularly pleased to deliver the $11 million trade training centre across the McEwen electorate. This TTC is a prime example of how public, Catholic and independent schools can collaborate, with their focus being the aspirations of their students and delivering opportunities for country kids—opportunities that they could never receive under Liberal and National governments.


Labor spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade roads and infrastructure across McEwen—a prime example being the $525 million spent on the M80 Ring Road upgrade. There is also the $400 million Post Entry Quarantine facility to go ahead in McEwen, which will give us a new and more advanced quarantine facility for this nation—not to mention the hundreds of new jobs that will be delivered.


I look forward to delivering more and more enhanced services in this term of office, but this will also involve the ongoing task of holding this government accountable for the promises they made to the people of McEwen during the 2013 election campaign. This will be no mean feat since, as mentioned, the government have already demonstrated their ability to break promises and undertake extraordinary tactics to turn their backs on the people of Australia. During the election last year, the Liberal Party made dozens of promises to the people of McEwen. Out of the 14 local funding promises for infrastructure, transport and community projects, not one of these promises has been delivered. The community is rightly concerned these promises will not be kept, as they join a long list of Liberal promises never delivered. I have made numerous attempts to contact several members of the Abbott government in order to expedite their funding commitments. To date, I have been inundated with the sound of silence. When not being ignored by the Abbott government, I have received a blatant refusal to follow through on their election promises to the people of McEwen.


Mr Abbott and the Liberals are pulling the plug on the National Broadband Network fibre rollout in my electorate, affecting many communities, like Lancefield, Romsey, Sunbury, Craigieburn, Whittlesea, Eden Park, Wollert, Wallan and Kilmore. The result of this decision is enormous. We will become the electorate of the haves and have-nots, and we have already seen people moving away from the electorate purely because they cannot get broadband access. Children in these areas will not have access to educational resources. Businesses will not have the same connectivity to customers and wholesalers alike. And, without government funding to expand mobile phone coverage in the same areas, communication to and from these communities will be even less. The Abbott government has a responsibility to these communities to ensure they have access to an NBN. I will not rest until every town in McEwen is connected, as it should be, by a national broadband network—not the hotchpotch set-up being touted by this government.


As mentioned earlier, McEwen is one of the fastest-growing electorates in Victoria, and being a rural based electorate means it has constant issues with mobile phone connectivity. It contains three of Australia's major transport routes: the Hume Highway, the Northern Highway and the Calder Highway. As we witnessed with the fires that ravaged our electorate three weeks ago, in an area that is very prone to bushfires and that survived the worst fires in this nation's history, mobile phone reception can mean the difference between life and death. The residents of McEwen rightly want improved mobile phone coverage addressed as a matter of priority.


During the election campaign the Abbott government announced a $100 million investment to expand the mobile coverage footprint and increase competition in regional Australia. The coalition also promised an extra $80 million to expand the mobile network along major transport routes, in small communities and in locations prone to natural disasters. But, even though we have more than met the criteria to receive funding to help address this problem, repeated requests that I and communities have made to government have fallen on deaf ears. In fact, to date, we have not received the courtesy of a reply or a response from the government on whether they will even consider these requests. I know that they hear me loud and clear but, in typical form, they are ignoring the real needs of real Australians. 


In Seymour, in the north-east of McEwen, is the Vietnam Veterans Commemorative Walk, which was developed in honour of the 62,100 personnel who were part of the Australia's Vietnam War effort. Local community members, RSLs and organisations rallied together and created funding for the walk. After years of dedicated hard work by the community, the commemorative walk was unveiled to much emotion and much honour. This walk has enjoyed bipartisan support at the state level, was supported by the Mitchell Shire at the local level and was supported by Labor at the federal level. Unfortunately, in recent months, local serial vandals have desecrated the commemorative walk. These crimes could easily be prevented by enhanced security at the site. Security would have been provided under round 5 of RDAF if the Abbott government had not ripped the funding away. To be clear, it is only the Abbott government that continues not to support this iconic project. For less than the price of one of Mr Abbott's 'women of calibre' $75,000 paid parental leave bonuses, we could have a safe and secure Vietnam Veterans Commemorative Walk—an iconic destination for our much-loved Vietnam vets, their families and tourists alike. That is a kick in the teeth for the local community and the brave returned soldiers.


The government's complete disregard for working Australians can be no more evident than in the loss of thousands of jobs in manufacturing. Since the Abbott government was elected on that sad day in September 2013, over 10,000 direct jobs have been lost in the manufacturing sector. Due to the government's complete ignorance of what manufacturing means to Australia, Ford, Holden and Toyota have decided to shut down their manufacturing arms in Australia. The ramifications of these closures cannot be measured in just numbers. Yes, we have the number of almost 45,000 direct jobs lost. Yes, we have the number of 150,000 indirect jobs lost. Yes, we have the shocking fact that under the Abbott government there is one job lost every three minutes. That is 150,000 people who have been, in the words of the Prime Minister, 'liberated' under this government. 


What is the real cost to our community? Around 10,000 people in McEwen work in manufacturing. What about those local businesses who provided supplies to the companies now shutting up shop? What about the families whose standard of living relies on salaries earned in these jobs? What about the emotional and psychological effects on those workers and their families? The costs of these cannot be measured, but hardworking Australians will bear the brunt, with thanks to the Abbott government's policies. To add insult to injury, Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey have the gall to try and blame the workers for the demise of manufacturing.


It is in the Liberal Party's DNA to ensure that they hurt the lowest paid workers in this country. Their sly move to remove penalty rates, overtime, shift work allowance and public holiday pay is simply their way of reintroducing around-the-clock work and lengthening the working day—well, while we're at it, Mr Abbott, why don't we just remove weekends all together? They are creating a huge rising unemployment problem, which will force a race to the bottom on wages and conditions. This simply is the government bringing back Work Choices by stealth.


I firmly believe that Australian workers deserve penalty rates for working extended or unsocial hours. The seat of McEwen represents over 37,000 people who work in industries affected by unsociable hours, such as retail, health care, social work and hospitality, and of course the 10,000-plus who work in manufacturing. While I am mentioning it, a big shout out to the Victorian paramedics in the Code Red campaign for fighting the chaotic and dysfunctional Napthine government to try and get a fair day's pay for the work that they do. The idea that you should have to trade family and home time for nothing is not the Labor way. Whether it is about being able to go to a suburban footy game, see a play, do the kids' sporting circuit or, as many of us know, reduce the backlog of backyard chores when you get home, penalty rates are best protected through a modern award system.


Unlike those opposite, Labor will always stick up for workers' rights and will not trade them away like economic commodities. And we do not believe that 'any boss is better than no boss', as the Prime Minister once said. As the member for McEwen, as a member of the Labor party and as a member of the local community, I will ensure that everyone gets a fair go. In 1996 I attended Labor's campaign launch, and these words of Paul Keating rang true:


We will not adopt the fantastic hypocrisy of modern conservatism which preaches the values of families and communities, while conducting a direct assault on them through reduced wages and conditions and job security.


Those words were true then; those words are true now. This also includes access to Medicare without having to pay a tax simply for being sick. Universal health care is a right, not a privilege. For the thousands of families who are struggling to make ends meet, the additional costs of having a sick child or children could be crippling. It sickens me that the Prime Minister is more than happy to sneakily introduce this sick tax, leaving families having to choose between putting food on the table or taking their sick child to the doctor. My message, our message, to you, Mr Abbott, is: keep your hands off Medicare.


It is Labor governments that built this nation. Medicare, superannuation and, of course, the National Disability Insurance Scheme are some of our proudest achievements. It is Labor governments that built the infrastructure and social capacity that make this country great. It is those opposite who want to tear it down or sell it off. The big question for Australians is what will be left of our great nation once the conservative, morally bankrupt, Tea Party politicians on the other side have torn down and sold off the nation's silverware. Where will that leave us? In conclusion, I would like to reiterate how honoured I am to be re-elected. The Abbott government had best be prepared for a fight if they want to continue to keep turning their backs on the people of McEwen.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2014-03-03,"



Mr TURNBULL
 (Wentworth—Minister for Communications) (15:37):  I thank Her Excellency the Governor-General for outlining the direction and priorities of our new government: cutting taxes, reducing regulation, redefining the role of government and investing in 21st century broadband, roads and hospitals. If there is a single philosophical thread weaving all of these reforms together, surely it is this: that we on our side of politics believe that the role of government is to enable citizens to do their best, whereas our opponents on the Labor side believe that government's role is to tell citizens what is best. The stark difference that we see again and again through every policy area bears out the importance and the significance of this distinction and the failures of the 'government knows best' approach which were so apparent in the last six years of Labor government. A touchstone of all of that is freedom, a belief in the individual, a belief that citizens, individuals, private businesses, are best able to chart their own destiny. 


We see this very clearly in my own portfolio of communications. The rise of the internet, which became commercial, I suppose, 20 years ago and has gathered more and more momentum and more and more coverage, has revolutionised the communications world and the media world. Our laws and regulations and assumptions were all based around a series of platforms: newspapers, magazines, licensed broadcasters in radio and television, subscription television whether on cable or satellite. These great platforms were the only means by which people could communicate to the mass. They were the gatekeepers and they posed huge barriers to competition. Then the internet came along and devastated all of that. It provided a very cost-effective platform for advertising and so undermined significantly, materially, the business model of newspapers, particularly those like the big metropolitan broadsheets of yesteryear which depended on classified advertising. It takes on subscription television. People now can buy the programs, download the programs they want to watch when they want to watch them, from the internet. They do not have to buy a bundled package. Netflix arises to take on all of the cable TV companies in the United States and it has many imitators around the world. So these are revolutionary times.


We have all been very concerned especially about the damage to the newspaper business, not because any of us I hope are so naive as to be filled with a particular affection for newspapers or journalists as a group or proprietors as a group or shareholders of newspapers—all businesses have to deal with the travails of the world and adapt to them. But newspapers and journalists have a very fundamental role to play in our democracy, or I should say journalism does. The work that journalists do in a free media is just as important as any work that we do here in this chamber or in the other place as legislators or that the judiciary do or that the Public Service do in running the country. We cannot be a democracy without a free media. So the concern naturally was that as the resources were drained away from those newspapers which had been the big foundations of journalism so the quality of our democracy would diminish as the quality of journalism and the number of journalists, the resources available to journalism, were diminished too. That has been a matter of very real concern.


What we have also seen with the arrival of the internet is an opening up of competition on a scale that would have previously been unimaginable. If you think back 20 or 30 years, the idea of there being new newspapers to compete with The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Daily Telegraph or the Melbourne Herald Sun was fanciful. Every now and then some rich person would try and start their own newspaper to take on one of the established ones but it was generally a very unsuccessful effort. I am thinking of Lang Hancock in Perth and Robert Holmes a Court for a period. But what the internet has done is lowered the cost of entry into the media market. So at the same time as we have been lamenting the demise of the great beasts of the media jungle we have seen more competition than ever. We have seen The Guardian Online, we have seen The Mail Online. Out here we have seen the paper I launched on Friday, Morry Schwartz's The Saturday Paper, and so many others—a host of them, too many to name.


We had never had more competition and more diversity in our media world than we have today. Yet it is remarkable that under the previous government their obsession was with the technological constructs of the past. They said, 'Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has the majority share of metropolitan daily newspaper circulation.' So it has had, for nearly 30 years since a Labor government enabled Mr Murdoch to buy the Herald and Weekly Times group. But that share of the total media and information pie represented by newspapers is getting smaller and smaller as more and more competitors come onto the scene. Yet it was precisely at that time—when a media landscape that had been frozen for decades suddenly started to thaw and was open to so much competition—that the Labor government wanted to constrain freedom and regulate the media in a way it had never been regulated before in peacetime.


So there is a fundamental difference between the way I am approaching this portfolio of communications and, indeed, the way the government is approaching this area and the way its Labor predecessor did. Labor believed that the arrival of the internet required more regulation and less freedom. We say that the arrival of the internet enables much more competition and therefore more freedom, and that therefore there is a need for less regulation not more. You could not have a starker difference between our government and its predecessor, and the difference is that we believe in freedom.


I note in passing that some commentators on the conservative or the right-wing side of the political debate have criticised me for launching Morry Schwartz's new paper The Saturday Paper on Friday. They apparently would like me to be—just as Senator Conroy was the minister for left-wing communications or the minister for communications that agree with the Labor Party—the minister for right-wing communications or communications that agree with the Liberal Party. And that is not the case. I am the Minister for Communications. I am the minister that seeks to ensure that we have the freest and most diverse media we can possibly manage. I am the minister that wants to take away the barriers to competition wherever I can so that as many voices can speak out as possible, and whether they are left or right is of no concern to me in my capacity as the Minister for Communications. As the member for Wentworth seeking re-election I may be disappointed if the anti-Liberal forces in the media call for me not to be elected; fair enough—that will be distressing at election time. But, in my ministerial capacity and in my role as the custodian of this vital portfolio in the government, my job is to stand up for freedom. Those who think that this Liberal minister should be like Senator Conroy and seek to persecute or suborn or bully those that do not agree with him have got it completely wrong; they are wrong in principle and they are wrong in practice. Everybody has a vested interest in freedom—everybody. Whether you are on the right or on the left, you have a vital, vested interest in freedom. As I said in one brief comment on the weekend to one of these critics, mangling Bill Clinton: 'It's the democracy, stupid!' It's the democracy—that is what we are committed to.


You see another example of the Labor Party's big-government obsession in their approach to broadband. The fundamental failure and mistake of the previous government—and it was a fundamental one and one that is impossible to reverse at this juncture, regrettably—was to be mad enough, genuinely mad enough, to imagine that the government was the right agency to build a new telecommunications network. It was back to the days of the postmaster-general. Every other comparable country in the world, in approaching the challenge of getting broadband services upgraded, has done this: they have encouraged the private sector to do the job. They have provided judicious subsidies to ensure that people in remote or regional areas got their services upgraded where it otherwise would not be commercial to do so. The virtue of that is that it ensured that the government was up for a certain amount of money—a sum certain. And all of the execution, the construction risk and the business risk was left with the private sector. An excellent example of that—you do not have to look very far—is what John Key did in New Zealand, or, indeed, what the British have done in the UK. There is a very long list.


The craziness of the previous government's policy was, right from the jump, in having the hubris, in defiance of experience both in Australia and everywhere else in the world, to imagine that the government was the best party to do the job. So in Australia, in the socialist paradise of Senator Conroy and Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd, we had a situation where the execution and business risk of this vast project was entirely vested in the government—in the taxpayer, in other words. And the only people that got the cheques, that got the certainty, were in fact the telephone companies, Telstra and Optus, who sold their assets to the government—an extraordinary fundamental failure. So it is no surprise that the project has run late and it has run over budget. Indeed, as Ziggy Switkowski observed just last week, so far the NBN Co has invested $6.4 billion of taxpayers' money and, in its fibre rollout, passed less than two per cent of the country.


The challenge that we have is that we are not in a position to turn back the clock. We are not in a position to undo all of the mistakes the Labor Party has made. So what we have to do is to mitigate the madness and to try to complete the project as quickly and cheaply and hence as affordably as possible. As I said in question time, one of the consequences of the Labor Party's approach of course would have been, had it been persevered with, that broadband prices would have been up to 80 per cent higher. There is no magic in that; there is nothing unusual in that: if you have a massively expensive, overcapitalised government monopoly with no competition to keep it honest, you are going to get very high prices. You do not get cheap prices by overcapitalising a business, especially if it is a monopoly.


I noticed earlier the member for McEwen speaking about his electorate and saying that people had been moving away because of lack of broadband. He should really raise that with his colleagues, because in six years of Labor virtually nothing was done. There was the best part of two million premises without access to broadband in 2007, and there has only been a tiny chip into that in the intervening six years. And then, I might say, with a chutzpah that is quite epic, he went on to complain that there were mobile phone black spots in his electorate. No doubt there are, and that is one of the reasons why the coalition government, the Abbott government, has allocated $100 million to address them—or to address as many as we can with that sum of money. But it is worth noting that in six years of the Labor government not one cent was spent to fix mobile black spots.


It is the same point about regional and remote broadband subsidies. It is the same point that you have areas where there is no mobile phone reception. As we all know, this is by far the biggest complaint—as you would know in particular, Deputy Speaker Scott, from your electorate of Maranoa—and by far the biggest telecommunications concern in rural and regional Australia. In those areas, of course, because of the small population, it is not necessarily economic for the telcos to make the investment, so there is a role for government, but in six years not one cent was spent by Labor on upgrading or addressing mobile phone black spots. But, to date, $6.4 billion has been invested in passing less than two per cent of premises in Australia.


I have spoken earlier about the other critical issue, but it bears repeating. It is this issue of affordability. It is no good having the best broadband technology in the world, which enables a household of six to engage in simultaneous high-definition interactive cybergaming across the world—there is no point having that—if battlers cannot afford it.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr TURNBULL:
  The member for Chifley is interjecting away there because he does not like to know the truth. The truth is that there are many people in his electorate who cannot afford broadband today, and he in his hubris has turned his back on them and supported a broadband policy that will make broadband less affordable than it is today. Forty-one per cent of the least well off households, the lowest income households, the households with the lowest 20 per cent of income in Australia, do not have access to the internet at home. Four per cent of the top 20 per cent do. What do you reckon the difference is? I think it is all about affordability, don't you? You do not have to be a rocket scientist to work that out. And yet, there was Labor—in a manner calculated, inevitably—determined to make broadband less affordable than it already is. That was the inevitable consequence, as night follows day. If you overcapitalise a business and you render it immune from competition, that will result in higher prices. There is no alternative.


And that is the critical objective of our government when it comes to the NBN: to get this project finished, to ensure that people everywhere have access to very fast broadband, using the mix of technologies—in common with all of the other major developed countries: the United States, the UK, Germany, Belgium, France; take your pick—that will ensure that we have a broadband network that is built nearly four years sooner and $32 billion less expensively and, above all, to make it more affordable.


Labor's arrogant indifference to the position of the people that they claim to represent, the least well off Australians, is truly chilling. It really is truly chilling. Labor's policy would result in average broadband prices increasing by $43 a month, increasing by up to 80 per cent a month. That is the fact. They can run around, wave their arms and talk about gigabits and gigabytes. They can do all of that. They can talk about all these things, which most of them do not understand. And yet the bottom line is this, and we all know it, whether we are in big business or little business: you give the Labor Party a project like this to manage and they will make a hash of it. You overcapitalise a government monopoly and you will get higher prices, and the consequence is that a vital service which has been unaffordable for many to date will become unaffordable to many more in the future.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (15:57):  In this debate on the address-in-reply, I would like to make some comments about Australia's investment in its future, specifically its investment in the protection of our environment and biodiversity and its investment in the clean and sustainable industries that should be the basis of economic activity in the decades ahead. Like many people, I am concerned that under this government Australia will turn away from the fundamental understanding that our environment is not something to be considered simply as a resource to be tapped or churned but is in fact the foundation of our future wellbeing in every aspect: social, physical and emotional, as well as economic.


On this point I note the submission the Australian Conservation Foundation has made in relation to the 2014-15 federal government budget. That submission includes reference to the observation from Treasury's Intergenerational report from 2011 that 'few countries have incorporated the potential impact of policies related to environmental issues into the long-term fiscal projections'. Needless to say, Australia is not one of those few countries.


I am concerned that under this government we are already seeing a rapid retreat from the significant gains made by the Labor government when it comes to tackling climate change, improving marine conservation, improving environmental regulation as a whole and supporting renewable energy and energy efficiency. There seems little doubt that the government's role as the custodian of our shared environmental wealth and as the way finder on what should be our path to sustainable economic and social wellbeing is in the process of being abdicated by the coalition. This abdication is occurring across the spectrum of government responsibility. It is occurring when it comes to environmental regulation. It is occurring on the expenditure side when it comes to government support and investment. And it is occurring on the revenue side when it comes to the price on carbon, the introduction of an emissions trading scheme and the receipt of a fair contribution from the profits of resources companies.


Australians understand that if you want to invest in a burgeoning sustainability sector the funds have to exist to make that investment, just as public investment was once made in the creation of our existing stationary energy and distribution infrastructure. Australians understand that if you want to minimise the costs associated with climate change there needs to be structural reform to ensure that carbon emitters are responsible for the costs they have produced.


Why price carbon? The answer is from a first-year economics principle. Pricing the externality is the most efficient way to reduce the externality. As Christine Lagarde, the head of the International Monetary Fund, put it last week, externality has a cost. We can either deal with that cost by putting a price on it and allowing the market and companies to innovate to reduce emissions in the most efficient way for their business, or we can allow the externality to not be priced and emissions to continue. In the latter scenario, the cost will be borne by the government, the taxpayer and, ultimately, all of the community.


People want effective action. They want it to be achieved at least cost and they want it to be paid for by a fair and effective mechanism. The whole rationale of an emissions trading scheme is that the burden of addressing the impact of carbon pollution falls on the polluters, with a corresponding market impetus for business and households alike to reduce carbon emissions.


The Abbott government's Direct Action policy has three massive flaws: firstly, it is quite possible they will not achieve the reduction target of five per cent on 2000 levels by 2020 to which we have committed. In other words, it will fail its basic purpose. Secondly, it will be paid for by the taxpayer, with no contribution from the polluters themselves and no encouragement for polluters to reduce their emissions other than in the form of payments from the taxpayer to do so. And thirdly, it is a matter of common agreement that Direct Action is the most expensive way to seek a reduction in carbon emissions. Prime Minister Abbott has already indicated that if the Direct Action policy costs grow beyond his expectations, which everyone predicts they will, then the target itself will be moderated.


It is instructive to remember the environmental, social and economic task we are engaged in here. The existing reduction targets that form the basis of our commitment are designed to limit the average temperature increase to two degrees over the course of this century. To give a sense of how two degrees of warming—while significant and harmful in itself—is possible to manage while a higher temperature rise is not, I refer to a comment by Professor John Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, on the difference between two degrees and four degrees of warming. He says:


The difference is human civilisation. A 4 degree C temperature increase probably means a global [population] carrying capacity below 1 billion people.


It is a sobering statement. I am grateful to have encountered it in John Wiseman's excellent essay Climate change: reconnecting politics with reality from the collection Pushing our Luck: ideas for Australian progress.


At this point, it is relevant to note that last week the Climate Change Authority provided its latest update, which recommends that Australia target a minimum 15 per cent reduction. Labor provided for the need to go higher than five per cent. It seems overwhelmingly clear that much higher reductions are essential and should have been committed to before now. It was nearly two years ago that the World Bank, in its Turn Down the Heat report, stated that:


Even with the current mitigation commitments and pledges fully implemented, there is roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4°C by 2100. If they are not met, a warming of 4°C could occur as early as the 2060s.


That is why we need to keep the gravity of this issue front and centre of the national policy conversation in Australia.


The former Labor government was both clear and courageous in establishing a mechanism that properly attributed the cost of carbon pollution and properly derived the revenue necessary to support Australia's shift from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy—from a traditional hydrocarbon energy production profile to a 21st century traditional and renewable energy mix. Unfortunately, the current government is abandoning that project, and I am concerned that the forthcoming budget will be a document of irresponsibility and neglect on that front.


As I said earlier, acting in the long-term interest of the Australian environment—and indeed the global environment, if you consider our oceans and our climate—requires sound economic management. In fact, such action epitomises sound economic management. Spending money to save the environment is not largesse—it is sensible and prudent action. It is taking out insurance for our children and their children. It is easy to cut these programs now. Trim $650 million from the Murray Darling Basin Plan over the forward estimates and perhaps it inflates your budget bottom line. But what is the long-term cost of this?


Consider for a moment what the science is telling us about the impacts of climate change. If no action is taken there will be a cost to government across a range of budgetary areas—roads and infrastructure, health and environment to name just a few. What will this do for the budget bottom line? Pricing carbon allows us to deal with this challenge now while also allowing our economy to grow. It decouples economic growth from pollution. Australia has recorded uninterrupted growth for 22 years and yet last financial year was the first time this occurred without a corresponding increase in pollution.


Many stakeholders with an active advocacy role in this space show the kind of balance and responsibility needed to achieve change: that is, they are prepared to look at where the revenue will come from in order to underwrite the investments needed. The budget submission I mentioned earlier, from the Australian Conservation Foundation, is a perfect example. That submission identifies savings that are nearly ten times the investments that ACF would like to see made in Australia's sustainable future. Of course, that is possible because the creation and encouragement of greater sustainability is not just about policy settings that fund renewable energy, green infrastructure or water resource research. Greater sustainability and resilience can also be pursued or achieved by ensuring that outmoded or unjustified concessions do not persist in relation to activities or practices that run counter to the principles of a sustainable economy.


Almost two years ago the now Treasurer, standing in London, boldly declared the end of the age of entitlement. The largesse of government would come to an end, he said, and Australians, both households and businesses, would need to stand on their own two feet. We were told companies should not look for government subsidies or support. Yet at the same time, they propose to spend billions of taxpayers' dollars subsiding polluters through a faux climate policy, which no expert believes will meet the emissions reductions targets. The viability gap between clean energy and dirty, which was closing but will now yawn wide again, will continue to be defined as much by the outrageous subsidies for hydrocarbon production and consumption as by the withdrawal of support for renewables and energy efficiency.


As the ACF submission points out it is hard to understand, let alone justify, why special and favourable depreciation rules for oil and gas assets were reintroduced in the early 2000s, after they had been removed as a trade-off for the substantial lowering of the company tax rate. The existing fuel tax credit scheme, which cost $6 billion in 2013-14, is currently the government's 14th most expensive program, costing more than federal government spending on schools. The ACF makes the case for reducing and better targeting this massive concession, with savings of two-thirds by 2016-17. There are aviation fuel concessions and counterproductive exemptions to fossil fuel producers through the Energy Security Fund that could also add up to $2 billion to the budget bottom line. It is common sense that, if you want to encourage a diversified and low-emission energy production profile, you go about that task by supporting renewable energy innovation and/or by ensuring that fossil fuel production and consumption is not unduly buoyed by unwarranted and counterproductive—or, if you like, countersustainable—concessions and subsidies.


On that basis, I urge the government to approach the forthcoming budget with the following in mind: first, that Australia's future wellbeing depends at least as much on the health of our environment as on sustainable economic growth; second, that addressing climate change by reducing carbon emissions at a much faster rate is essential and it is urgent; third, that the investment needed to improve resilience and sustainability should be funded from revenue derived by the application of a fair impost on carbon pollution and resource extraction; and, fourth and finally, that progress towards a low-carbon Australia and an Australia that is a leader in renewable energy production and innovation can be hastened by ensuring a level playing field without undue subsidies or concessions for fossil fuels.


I return to the wise words of Mr Wiseman, from the essay I referred to earlier:


The economic growth debate is … best framed not in terms of 'growth' versus 'degrowth' but as a shift in priorities from limitless growth in the consumption of energy and resources to improvement in important social and ecological priorities. In Prosperity without growth: Economics for a finite planet, UK economist Tim Jackson makes a compelling argument that our ability to 'decouple' conventional economic growth from ecological destruction is highly questionable and that our focus must be on a redefinition of prosperity— a vision 'in which it is possible for human beings to flourish, to achieve greater social cohesion, to find higher levels of wellbeing and yet still to reduce their material impact on the environment.'


I know that kind of reframing represents a big change. I know it represents a shift from the current state of play, in which we remain fixed on the idea that growth can and should continue indefinitely—however much basic logic tells us it cannot be so. In a brilliant book entitled A Short History of Progress, Ronald Wright notes the lessons of the past:


That the health of land and water—and of woods, which are the keepers of water—can be the only lasting basis for any civilization's survival and success … If civilisation is to survive it must live on the interest, not the capital of nature.


He goes on to say:


Capitalism lures us onward like the mechanical hare before the greyhounds, insisting that the economy is infinite and sharing therefore is irrelevant. Just enough greyhounds catch a real hare now and then to keep the others running till they drop. In the past, it was only the poor who lost this game, now it is the planet …


Things are moving so fast that inaction itself is one of the biggest mistakes. The 10,000-year experiment of the settled life will stand or fall by what we do, and don't do, now. The reform that is needed is not anti-capitalist, anti-American, or even deep environmentalist; it is simply the transition from short-term to long-term thinking. From recklessness and excess to moderation and the precautionary principle.


The great advantage we have, our best chance for avoiding the fate of past societies, is that we know about those past societies. We can see how and why they went wrong. Homo sapiens has the information to know itself for what it is: an Ice Age hunter only half-evolved towards intelligence; clever but seldom wise.


We are now at the stage when the Easter Islanders could still have halted the senseless cutting and carving, could have gathered the last trees' seeds to plant out of reach of the rats. We have the tools and the means to share resources, clean up pollution, dispense basic health care and birth control, set economic limits in line with natural ones.


If we don't do these things now, while we prosper, we will never be able to do them when times get hard. Our fate will twist out of our hands.


On behalf of my community in Fremantle and communities throughout Australia, I want to be one of the many people who are prepared to have this conversation and to argue the merits of taking a radically different, massively important shift in perspective.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2014-03-03,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (16:12):  I rise to speak on this address-in-reply. First, I want to acknowledge the great honour and trust that the people of Higgins have placed in me to be their representative, to represent their issues both big and small. It is an honour that I have been granted three times now and I am very, very conscious of the great responsibility that comes with this incredible honour.


The key function and task of our government will be to repair the nation's balance sheet so we again live within our means, as we did during the previous coalition government, the Howard-Costello years. We need to be able to turn the deficits into surpluses and to start repaying the debt so that our children and their children do not inherit a parlous economic situation where they are restricted in the services that are provided to them as a result of the financial mismanagement of their forebears.


One of the critical tasks for us in repairing the national balance sheet will be to encourage business to grow, invest and employ. One of the critical aspects here is to ensure that we have the right productivity-enhancing infrastructure available to us. This brings me to the first point that I wish to raise in the House today—that is, railway crossings in my seat of Higgins and the state of Victoria. 


While historically Melbourne has benefited from thoughtful planning, there remain 172 level crossings within the metropolitan area, as compared to eight within Sydney. Many of these crossings are positioned on Melbourne's busiest roads, adjacent to major arterials such as the Monash Freeway and the Dandenong Road-Princes Highway. These level crossings cause substantial delays to motorists, road based freight and road based public transport—15 to 40 minutes during peak times—while, at the same time, limiting growth in rail based public transport due to capacity constraints.


The Dandenong railway line currently serves over a million people in south-eastern Melbourne and is considered a key area for future population growth; it also serves industrial and commercial sites through to Dandenong and thereafter the proposed deepwater port of Hastings. Along the Dandenong rail corridor, within Higgins and bordering Chisholm and Hotham, the hands-down, single largest issue facing constituents on a daily basis is level crossings. It influences key decisions: where people will shop, where they will send their children to school and how they will access work.


The 2012 RACV Redspot survey ranks three Higgins level crossings in Victoria's top 10 worst sites for congestion. They are Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena, at No. 1; Koornang Road, Carnegie, at No. 4; and Burke Road, Glen Iris, at No. 5. Key stakeholders, including the RACV and the Committee for Melbourne, share the view with me that planning and investment, both public and private, are now required to ensure south-eastern Melbourne continues to grow.


In June 2013, I tabled a petition with 1,151 signatures which drew the attention of the House to the severe congestion caused by the regular closure of the level crossings along the Dandenong railway line and I asked at that time that parliament give greater priority to their removal. In total, there are 21 railway stations and nine level crossings in the electorate of Higgins. They are along the Dandenong railway line; Grange Road, Carnegie; Koornang Road, Carnegie; Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena; Poath Road, Hughesdale; along the Glen Waverley line; Glenferrie Road, Kooyong; Toorak Road, Kooyong; Tooronga Road, Malvern; Burke Road, Glen Iris; and High Street, Glen Iris.


The Victorian government's 2011 Infrastructure Australia submission, resubmitted in 2012 for the Nation Building Program, notes that the catchment area of this rail corridor contributed $92 billion in 2007-08, accounting for roughly half of Melbourne's GDP or nine per cent nationally. The Victorian government has sought support from Infrastructure Australia and the previous Commonwealth government for $30 million to enable initial planning and development work for the Dandenong rail upgrade, including the removal of its 12 level crossings, which would have the potential to lift rail passenger capacity by nearly 100 per cent—that is, 11,000 people per hour—and significantly reduce road congestion, as well as $16 million to enable planning for a broad-ranging level-crossing removal program across Melbourne.


In total the Victorian government is spending just over $418 million, but received nothing from the Commonwealth in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 federal budgets for level-crossing removal. I congratulate my state colleagues for focusing on this issue, after the failure of previous Labor governments that squandered the surpluses that they inherited and the GST windfalls that they also inherited—which they did not invest in this productivity-enhancing infrastructure. The Victorian coalition government is in the process of removing 12 level crossings, which is the largest number of level-crossing removals by any Victorian government in the state's history. In particular, I am pleased that the state has commenced planning for the removal of crossings at Burke Road, Glen Iris and Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena, both of which are within Higgins. The removal of a level crossing can cost up to $200 million. However, the need for varied solutions to level-crossing removals depends upon site opportunity and constraints as well as the need to explore private sector investment. There is also broad agreement as to the nature of this problem and the need for action. How these projects are to be funded remains less clear. There are varied funding options that should be considered, including private sector involvement—for example, in the development of air rights where appropriate. Importantly, though, the removal of level crossings is as much about road congestion as it is about rail. For this reason, I believe that it is important that Victoria receive its fair share of the infrastructure dollar provided federally through Infrastructure Australia.


The second issue which I wish to raise in the House this afternoon, in the time available to me, also relates to our economy and jobs. It is about job participation and increasing the participation of women, in particular, in the workforce. We know through the reports released by the Grattan Institute that if we can increase female participation in the workplace up to the same level as some of our OECD competitor countries, such as Canada and Germany, we will have an economic gain of up to $25 billion. What is standing in the way of this?


Affordable and flexible child care that is accessible to families is one of the key complaints I hear from constituents in my electorate of Higgins. Higgins is a much sought after area in which to care for and raise children. However, the previous Labor government made it more difficult to get affordable child care and local families are paying the price of the previous Labor government's legacy. Recent Department of Education figures indicate that childcare fees rose an average $70 per week over the six years of the former Labor government. On average, child care now costs over $3,000 a year more than it did before Labor came to power. There can be no doubt about the very real impact that this is having on family budgets. The June quarter 2013 Child care and early learning in summary report comes on the back of a recent review which found new regulations introduced by Labor added $2,000 in operating costs per child per year for an average sized long day care centre.


After speaking with childcare providers in Higgins, many have told me that the extra burden of regulation is unnecessarily forcing up costs and taking valuable time away from looking after the children. These costs are passed on to parents, many of whom query whether it is worth going back to work at all. However, it is not just formal long day care child care that has fared badly under the previous Labor government. I have visited many kindergartens and occasional-care centres in Higgins and spoken at length with families, staff and management regarding the increase in mandatory regulation that impacts directly on staffing, fees and access for families.


I have previously tabled a petition in the parliament with regard to the reduction in Take A Break occasional-care funding and hosted a forum with the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, in his former role as shadow parliamentary secretary for supporting families, the Hon. Jamie Briggs MP. All this has assisted to inform our understanding of the difficulties faced by the early learning sector and the very urgent need for change.


While our government has already started the process of reducing red tape, these new figures with respect to childcare fees back our decision to task the Productivity Commission to find a way to deliver more affordable, accessible child care in Higgins. All options are on the table and helping women stay in the workforce, or get back into the workforce, is something everyone in this House should support.


I turn to another issue which has been very significant in my electorate of Higgins—that is, community safety. Higgins is an electorate comprised of urban villages. Within those villages, law and order is definitely an issue of concern. In the western suburbs of Prahran, Windsor and South Yarra, which are home to the Chapel Street nightclub precinct, security issues do arise where entertainment and residential areas intersect.


I was particularly pleased when the Prime Minister, the Hon. Tony Abbott, then Leader of the Opposition, and the then Premier, Premier Baillieu, visited Higgins in August of 2012 to see firsthand the concerns of residents and to announce that federal funding for CCTV cameras in the local Chapel Street precinct was part of our $50 million funding for the coalition's Plan for Safer Streets. I was also very pleased to have the support of Inspector Adrian White from the Prahran Police Station, Oskar Cebergs from Chapel Street precinct, Justin Zakis, President, Lara Barry Residents Association, as well as local residents.


In total, $100,000 has been secured to increase security measures in this busy precinct and I am working with local government to ensure its smooth implementation. In addition, following a long and productive dialogue with residents, local businesses and traders in the south-eastern part of my electorate, it became clear that measures to improve security of persons and property would be welcome in the Carnegie area, a popular family-friendly cosmopolitan suburb. As a result, I was able to secure an additional $100,000 for Koornang Road, Carnegie, which has been warmly welcomed by the Carnegie traders and local businesses, along with residents.


While no-one would argue that CCTV and increased lighting will eradicate crime and anti-social behaviour, I believe they will form a deterrent and, if crime occurs, assist Victoria Police in apprehending those responsible.


Since these announcements the Ashburton traders have also expressed some interest in having closed-circuit television cameras in their High Street shopping strip and I am working with them to ascertain whether any future options exist for increased security measures there.


I now turn to an issue which is incredibly close to my heart, a very special organisation in my electorate of Higgins. This organisation does good work not only for those who reside in Higgins but also for those from throughout Victoria. It is aptly named Very Special Kids. It is an eight-bed children's hospice that provides planned and emergency end-of-life care, as well as flexible family support programs, including respite for families with children with life-threatening illnesses.


The organisation was established in 1985 after two local families recognised there was a need to support other families experiencing the loss and grief associated with having a child diagnosed with a life-threatening condition. Throughout this period, it has been championed by the founder and patron, Sister Margaret Noone, AM, and grown under the careful stewardship of a committed and talented board. Very Special Kids is not only Australia's oldest and largest children's hospice but also the only children's hospice in Australia to receive no federal government funding. The other two hospices—Bear Cottage in New South Wales and Hummingbird House in Queensland—receive substantial support from the Commonwealth government.


All Very Special Kids services are offered free-of-charge to families. It has an operating budget of just over $5.6 million per annum, 70 per cent of which is generated through philanthropy, with the remaining 30 per cent provided by the state government. However, in order to increase the occupancy of existing facilities and to increase the services to families in Melbourne and in rural and regional Victoria, Very Special Kids is actively seeking greater government support. The work Very Special Kids undertakes is truly important and difficult. In many ways, it is an organisation with which no family would wish to become familiar, yet so many Victorians are very grateful for the services and support they provide at the most difficult and challenging of times.


Very Special Kids has a very special CEO, Susan Hosking, and it is an organisation for which I have the utmost respect. I intend to do everything that I can humanly do to ensure it receives the support it needs to continue to provide its amazing services, not just to my constituents but to all Victorian families.


In the time remaining, I would like to raise the issue many people raised with me at the mobile office meetings I have held throughout the electorate during my four years as a member of parliament, an issue which I know will be challenging for this government—housing affordability. Higgins is very diverse in nature, with high-density inner-city living in the west and family-friendly suburbs in the east, all within a commutable distance of the Melbourne central business district. Despite some perceptions, it is very diverse in its demography. A third of Higgins residents were born outside Australia. While undoubtedly some people have significant means, Higgins also has a high percentage of people who live in rented accommodation, including nearly 1,000 who live in state housing dwellings. While the median weekly household income is $1,741, the median monthly mortgage repayment is $2,393; and the median price of a home in Carnegie is just under a million dollars at $935,000.


In addition, there are many residents in my electorate between the ages of 20 and 44—higher than the national average. This means that housing affordability remains a real concern for many homebuyers in my electorate. Higgins is a fantastic place to live and raise a family and, not surprisingly, when those children grow up they also wish to live in Higgins, close to their friends and family. I believe that there are things that we can examine, in this place, that can make it easier for people to have confidence in the current marketplace for residential property and to ensure that there is no distortion of the market for residential property.


Finally, it is indeed a great honour to be the member for Higgins and to represent the people of Higgins. I would like to thank all of those people who supported my campaign—in particular all of the volunteers who gave freely of their time. Ours is not a party that is of the union movement; it is a grassroots organisation and people need to give of their time in order for a campaign to be run. I would like to place on record my thanks to all those volunteers, over 800 of them, who helped out with the Higgins campaign, along with the wonderful Liberal Party members in my electorate led by Mark Stretton. I would also like to thank my staff, who every day do a tremendous job for me; my family, who support me no matter what; and especially my husband, Jon, who is on this wonderful journey with me. I look forward to being able to continue my engagement with the constituents of Higgins representing their issues. I have had, over the last four years, more than 200 mobile office meetings and more than 70 community forums. I pledge that in this term of parliament I will continue that very high engagement.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (16:32):  It is a pleasure to participate in the address-in-reply debate. I congratulate so many of the members on their addresses, particularly all of the new members who have experienced the privilege, first, of being elected to this place and then, usually in front of their family, friends and new colleagues, giving their first speech. It is a wonderful opportunity for all the new members on both sides of the House.


This address-in-reply is an opportunity for all members to reply to the new government's agenda, as was outlined in Her Excellency's speech in the other place. Usually members of the opposition, the government or the crossbench confront a detailed plan, from the new or re-elected government, of what it plans to do over the course of the ensuing three years to build the nation: to build the nation's prosperity, to build opportunity for its citizens, and to build social and physical infrastructure and the like.


The challenge we have in giving our addresses-in-reply is that the government has outlined precious little by way of a new plan. The limits of the plan outlined by this new government are really defined by what the new government intends to dismantle or to cut, rather than what it intends to build. In policy areas that are particularly close to my heart, the government has outlined very little by way of new plans. I want to address a few of those plans, contrast them with what we were able to achieve over the last few years in government and pose some questions about what this government might intend to do by way of dismantling that.


The first area I would like to address is the area of mental health. This is an area of very longstanding neglect, frankly, by governments of all political persuasions, at state and Commonwealth levels, over many years. All of us supported a process of deinstitutionalisation that would see people living with mental illness who, for many years, had been confined to hospitals for their entire lives often brought out into the community—taken out of the institutions and allowed to live their lives in the community in different Australian cities and regional areas. That was a fantastic policy.


The difficulty was that the quid pro quo, the follow-up from that policy, was supposed to be greater investment in community based mental health services so that those Australians would be able to receive good levels of support, find employment and stable housing, ensure they had strong peer and family relationships and take up all of the opportunities that Australian citizens have in front of them. As I said, governments of all political persuasions—particularly at state level, given that states have had responsibility for this policy area generally—


failed in delivering that quid pro quo. This led, firstly and most importantly, to very significant disability and profound disadvantage for hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens and their families. It also eventually led to a very significant level of community unease about the degree to which we were letting down those fellow citizens.


This unease really found its shape in Patrick McGorry being made the Australian of the Year in 2010. That year, with a whole range of other supports, Professor McGorry was able to shine a spotlight onto those issues associated with mental health at a national level that they simply had not had shone on them before. It did not happen overnight. A whole range of great organisations and individuals had done extraordinary work in previous years—beyondblue, along with many individuals, had done fantastic work. But Professor McGorry was able, in an election year, to bring a spotlight to these community failures for which we all bore responsibility.


For the first time in Australian political history the two alternative Prime Ministers, the current Prime Minister and former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, actually talked about mental health in a federal political campaign. It was a wonderful thing. I commend the Liberal Party for bringing a very substantial mental health policy to that 2010 campaign. Ultimately, when we formed government, I was made the first ever mental health minister at a national level. I then undertook a range of direct consultations all around the country—in regional areas and in capital cities—with consumers, people living with mental illness, their family members and their carers about what it was they wanted from a mental health reform package.


In 2011 we were able to deliver the largest-ever mental health reform package in Commonwealth history. It covered a whole range of different age cohorts, a whole range of different needs—many of them medical and many of them non-medical—many of them related to housing and employment and other social supports. We brought in a whole range of reforms, building on previous years, to deliver youth-specific mental health services, through the headspace model in particular, that had been started under the previous Howard government. We built upon that over the past few years. There were also services to deal with the first episodes of psychosis, which are often experienced by young people in their late teens or their early twenties—a model particularly pioneered by Professor McGorry.


We were able to bring into place new services to support families with very young children experiencing mental health difficulties. It is not often understood that fully 25 per cent of all mental health disorders emerge before the age of 12, often even before the age of five. Early intervention to support those kids, and particularly to support their families, is critically important if those kids are to be able to get back on the rails and embrace all of the opportunities that Australia has to offer—schooling, post-school education and training, and then adult lives. So again those were very wonderful reforms we were able to bring into place.


We were also able to respond to the requests that carers and consumers gave to me, as I was travelling around the country, for much better integration between the different types of services that people living with severe and persistent mental illness need. Often they are not just medical services; they relate to their need to find stable housing, to find avenues into employment and to be able to build good peer and family relationships. Those sorts of living skills, as well, were all brought together into a program known as Partners in Recovery.


I hope that this new government will continue with a range of those reforms, as we did with the range of reforms that came under the Howard government—and I will talk soon about headspace—but we have heard very little from the Liberal Party since their 2010 election policy. I hope that we will hear more into the future.


Another area on which the new government has said precious little is the area of aged care. I know from talking to members across the chamber, whether it is in this chamber or outside, everyone understands how critical a policy area aged care is; both because of the growing demand that we are going to see in the system in the future as the population ages, but also because there are emerging differences in the preferences that older Australians have for their aged-care services. There are some new needs that are emerging, and I talk particularly about the growing prevalence of dementia.


We inherited, when we came to government in 2007, a position that had not changed much in the 11 years of the Howard government, not for want of trying. Prime Minister Howard had tried on two occasions to get substantial reform of the aged-care system through—in 1997 and in 2004—and he was not successful. So we inherited a system that was largely put in place, firstly, by the Hawke government in the mid-1980s, and then reformed by the Keating government in the early 1990s to bring in some Commonwealth funded home-care arrangements.


We had put in place a Productivity Commission inquiry that took place at the same time they were inquiring into a national disability insurance scheme, and we received a report from the Productivity Commission at about the same time they published the NDIS report as well. Both reports are excellent and pay great tribute to the social policy expertise of the Productivity Commission.


At the same time, it is important to recognise that the aged-care sector had become much better organised, in terms of dealing with its own internal differences and then presenting a united front to parliamentarians and the community about what they wanted from aged-care reform. A lot of the difficulty that Prime Minister Howard got into in 1997 and 2004 reflected the fact that the aged-care sector itself was not united about what it wanted from reform. I think people in the parliament and people in the community were entitled to say: 'Well, if the aged-care sector cannot say what they want, why should we take a leap of faith into that unknown?' They learnt from that; they formed the National Aged Care Alliance, and they were able to work through their differences and present two important documents—first the NACA blueprint and then the NACA vision—about what they wanted from aged-care reform. NACA covered aged-care providers; the big church and charitable providers; private sector for-profit providers; the big consumer groups, like the Council on the Ageing, Alzheimer's Australia, Legacy and many others; aged-care staff; clinicians; and pretty much anyone with an interest in the aged-care sector. These were very good reports and they certainly assisted me and other government members in responding to the Productivity Commission report. 


After we received the report, I talked to literally thousands of older Australians in dozens of forums around the country, in capital cities and in many regional communities as well, to hear from them what they wanted from aged-care reform. Many of these were general forums where people came along. A number of them were specific forums for people living with dementia and their families, and they were incredibly powerful opportunities for me to hear from them about the failures of so many different elements of our health system—the hospital sector, the primary care sector and the aged-care sector—to respond to and support the particular needs of the tens and tens of thousands of Australians who are living with dementia now.


We came up with a comprehensive package to respond to the Productivity Commission report in the 2012 budget. It really does transform the nature of our aged-care system. It starts to bring to the centre of the system the need for people to live in their own home for as long as possible. If there was a single message I heard from older Australians during that period, it was that they did not want the aged-care system to be about nursing homes—although they wanted to know there was a good nursing home system there to fall back on if they needed it—they wanted aged care to be focused on supporting them to stay in their own home for as long as possible and, if at all possible, for the remainder of their lives. Our package significantly lifts the number of home-care packages and home support packages that older Australians are able to receive in their own home.


We also brought a new level of transparency and robustness to the way in which the residential care or nursing home sector works, particularly around the question of what accommodation charges some older Australians will have to pay to get into those nursing homes. We heard terrible stories about people being charged arbitrary figures that would run into the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars as bonds to enter aged-care facilities, with no requirement on the provider at all to justify why a figure of $500,000 or $600,000  or $700,000 or even $800,000 needed to be paid to gain entry to an aged-care facility. We have brought much more robustness. I understand the government will keep in place the Aged Care Financing Authority, which puts providers to proof about what they are charging older Australians and why. I think that will very significantly lift the confidence that older Australians and their families have in the residential care sector.


I am particularly proud of the elements of the reform package that respond to the needs of people living with dementia. I want to pay particular tribute to Alzheimer's Australia. This is an organisation that has been providing wonderful support for many, many years to Australians affected by this condition. It lifted its game incredibly with a public campaign that caught people's attention in this parliament and across the Australian community—across the cities, across the regions. It really captured the imagination of so many Australians about the need to come to grips with what I think will be one of the two major epidemics for Australia in the 21st century, and that is dementia. 


The numbers of people living with dementia, if we do not find a cure for this condition, will double every 20 years, reaching a million people by 2050 or so. As I said earlier in my address, neither our health system nor our aged-care system is well equipped to deal with those particular needs. To be frank, and without apology, the elements of the reform package that we adopted in this area largely come from the Fight Dementia Campaign that Alzheimer's Australia developed and talked about to parliamentarians across both sides of this chamber in the months leading up to the budget in 2012. I hope that the new government will support those elements of the aged-care reform package. I commend the new government for taking to the election campaign we just had a policy to provide additional funding for research into Alzheimer's. I think that is an important step in building on our reforms in this area, but again I cannot stress enough how important it is to shine a spotlight on the need of the health and aged-care sectors to respond to the needs of people living with Alzheimer's.


One element of the reform package where I think the government and the opposition part company is around issues associated with our workforce. The one change that we have seen to the reform package from the new government is to take $1.1 billion out of a program that was intended to start to lift the wages of aged-care workers. This is a very significant challenge, party politics aside. Aged-care providers are already having difficulty attracting and then retaining quality aged-care staff because of the low wages that they are paid. We currently have 350,000 workers in the aged-care sector. We are going to need about a million aged-care workers by 2050, to the point where one in 20 workers in Australia will be an aged-care worker. If we do not lift their wages, we simply will not get there. The position that we outlined in the reform package around wages reflected exactly the position that the aged-care sector had entirely signed up to in the National Aged Care Alliance blueprint. I am very disappointed that the new government has decided to turn its back on that element and particularly disappointed because I have not heard anything from the new government about what it intends to do to improve recruitment and retention of staff performing some of the most important work that our community has.


In the few minutes I have left, I want to say a few things about the wonderful community that I have the privilege of representing. This is my third election as the member for Port Adelaide. My two predecessors, Mick Young and Rod Sawford, both achieved seven elections, so I am a very long way short of those two very significant members for Port Adelaide. But it really is a privilege to serve the community. The community is made up of a number of different bits: the traditional port of Adelaide; the Lefevre Peninsula; the north-western suburbs, where I live; and then, beyond the salt pans, the northern suburbs, which have wonderful traditions and a wonderful culture. This is a community that is deeply tribal and has very high expectations—I know, from going to street corner meetings, shopping centres and footy clubs—of its members of parliament, whether they be members of this parliament or of the state parliament. I am acutely conscious every day I go to work of the high expectations that my community has of me.


They have achieved very big benefits from the last six years of the Rudd and Gillard governments. I have seen, from the time I started going to high schools in the area—because my kids are still at primary school I had not been to a high school since I was at high school—the capital upgrades that have been achieved over the last few years. When I started going to the high schools in my community, some of them only had one computer for every eight children. The changes that they have seen in the last several years have been extraordinary. There are trades training centres and community infrastructure. We saw part of the Rudd government's response to the global financial crisis bring new sporting and community facilities that are being used every day and every week. We have seen Water Proofing the West, which is a wonderful stormwater-recycling project. I know that those opposite do not see a role for the Commonwealth in urban stormwater, but this has been a wonderful project to do urban stormwater-recycling in that area.


In closing, I want to thank the vast number of supporters that we all need if we are going to get to this position and be a member of the federal parliament. Party members and party supporters again came out in force through the whole of the last three years, which were often very difficult years for members of the Labor Party, I can tell you. They came out time and time again, including in the election campaign, and supported me. For that, I am extremely grateful. They will now be working hard again, in the state election campaign over the next couple of weeks. There were so many other volunteers—not party members and not even people who would consider themselves ongoing party supporters—who also were willing to come out and give me support: well-wishers who would just say a good word to you in the shopping centre or at the footy club and make you lift your step when you might be feeling a bit exhausted. I had extraordinary officers, headed by Karen Grogan in the ministerial office and Julie Duncan in the electoral office, for whom again I am incredibly grateful. But without family and without friends—particularly without my wife, Suzanne, and my children, Ellie and Isaac—to come home to every now and then, when we have finally left and I can get back to Adelaide, this would not be worth doing. It is a wonderful privilege to be a member of this parliament. It is a wonderful privilege to represent Port Adelaide, and I am looking forward to the next three years.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-03-03,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (16:52):  'The Murrumbidgee's winding waters light the lives of Wagga's sturdy breed. Like hope eternal its waters bright flow on as our undying creed.' There is a message for all of us in the opening lines to the school song of St Michael's Regional High School at Wagga Wagga. The school served the Catholic and wider community well from 1873 until its closure in 2003. It was a boys school, and it was my school, from 1977 to 1980. I loved almost every minute of it. Whether or not you attended what was a Christian Brothers institution, there is some resonance of St Michael's song to those who live along the mighty Murrumbidgee or who rely on its life-giving water. Riverina people are a sturdy breed. They have had to be in the past; they will certainly have to be in the future. 


Murrumbidgee, from the language of the original custodians of the land, the Wiradjuri people, means 'big water'. The intrepid explorer, Captain Charles Sturt, after whom the Wagga Wagga campus of that remarkable university takes its name, went on his epic journey of discovery along the Murrumbidgee in 1830. Sturt and his party were often forced to carry their whaleboat on their shoulders rather than the easier and preferable option of rowing it down the river. That is because the river back then sometimes did not run—and sometimes it flooded. The greenies and the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists will probably dispute that, but it is true.


Whilst it is important that South Australia's water supply is secure and that the river environment is given due consideration, it is also imperative that the farmers and irrigation communities of the Riverina be allowed to continue what they have done on behalf of the nation for more than 100 years. The original Murray-Darling Basin Plan was stopped in its tracks in late 2010 by the loud and united voice of those marvellous people of Griffith and the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. They rallied in their thousands. They burnt copies of the daft draft. They forced the government to change course. People power won the day. Common sense won over rank stupidity.


On Thursday last week the New South Wales government, having held out for a better and fairer deal, finally signed the agreement with the Commonwealth. The plan is not perfect. No agreement on water would ever receive wholehearted endorsement by all stakeholders. Mark Twain is attributed as saying that whiskey is for drinking and water is for fighting over, and he was right of course.


I will always defend the rights of family farmers to have access to water to grow the fibre and food to clothe and feed our people and many others besides. When I came to this place in my first term I said my motto is that I shall not be silent when I ought to speak. Throughout my first term in this place that principle was tested many times, but I am proud to say that I stuck with it. I am proud of what I was able to achieve for the Wagga Wagga and Griffith base hospitals.


Wagga Wagga Base Hospital, which was first opened in 1963, has long been waiting for an upgrade. Successive New South Wales governments promised funding would come, but it was not until the New South Wales coalition came to government that the New South Wales state government started taking the project seriously. I am proud that the 2011-12 federal budget found $55.1 million for Wagga Wagga Base Hospital and the project is not only well underway but ahead of schedule.


Had it not been for a chance run-in at the Brisbane airport with Nicola Roxon, the former health minister, within weeks of the May 2011 budget, Wagga Wagga might well have missed out again. The minister was until that time mistakenly of the view that the project had been fully funded by the state government. Minister Roxon was willing to listen to my lobbying and found the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital the necessary funds. I am pleased to say that construction of the hospital is well underway. She also listened to my plea to give Ungarie flood assistance after Humbug Creek almost swept the village away on 4 March 2012.


I am also proud of the health funding boosts to the communities of Griffith and Hillston in the west and north-west of my Riverina electorate. The $11.3 million in funding in the 2012-13 budget for the Griffith community hospital was described by one of its chief proponents, John Casella, as 'good health, good for education and a real boost for our area', which has been hard hit in recent years. It was a delight of mine to inform the then Mayor of Griffith City Council, Mike Neville, of the project's success. He told me the news was 'just fantastic'. My good friend Adrian Piccoli, the member for Murrumbidgee in New South Wales and education minister, said it was 'the best political news he had ever heard'. This funding was complemented by the announcement that the multipurpose service at Hillston was also funded to the tune of $6 million.


The productive farming areas of Griffith and Hillston were both placed under considerable pressure as a result of uncertainty with future water availability at the time and the health announcements in those two areas were greeted with delight and surprise. As I have stressed in this place before, it is incumbent upon all of us never to forget the people who send us here and to stand up for them in this place always. For me, standing up for the people and being a voice for those who do not have one is why I ran for parliament in the first place and it is what drives me to come into this place again and again determined to represent the Riverina, a Federation seat, to the very best of my ability.


There is no denying that the 43rd Parliament was a roller-coaster ride for all in this place. It was the first minority government since that of John Curtin in 1941. It was a government that brought with it some of the worst debt, some of the biggest broken promises and a carbon tax that the Prime Minister promised would never be part of a government she led. Amongst this the Murray-Darling Basin Plan discussions were raging. Throughout the purpose-built irrigation areas in my electorate, which are rich with many cultures and have an abundance of produce upon which this nation relies, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan caused much angst. I will never forget the day I went to Griffith to attend the largest public rally. It was Thursday, 15 December 2011. At the Yoogali Club on Mackay Avenue in Griffith there were 14,000 passionate people there to fight for their water rights and their future.


It was a bad plan and the irrigators, the growers, the producers and the small business people all knew it. They knew what a devastating impact a bad plan such as that would have had on the purpose-built irrigation communities throughout the basin. There with me was my good friend and Nationals colleague Senator Fiona Nash, who is now the Assistant Minister for Health, and the opposition leader and now Prime Minister. They were there to listen, to care and to stand up for what was right. The then water minister, Tony Burke, the member for Watson, was there too. While we will never agree on the Basin Plan or on water rights, I do acknowledge that it took guts for him to turn up and, in the mist of all that passion and angst, stand and tell the then government's story.


The Murray-Darling Basin Plan was a threat to the people of my electorate and the basin. When I ran for parliament in 2010 I made it clear that I would be their voice in parliament, and I followed through on that, moving a motion to disallow the passage of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan through parliament. It was important to me and to the people of my electorate that I kept my word. Whatever the disallowance motion may have meant in this place—and my motion to disallow was defeated 95 to five—it meant a lot to the irrigators and producers of the Riverina to have a local member stand up for them, cross the floor and do what was right. Moving the disallowance motion has also meant that I as the local member can walk along Banna Avenue, Griffith's main street, and the main streets of many irrigation areas in my electorate and look farmers and people in the eye and tell them I did my best and I helped bring about a promise to cap buybacks at 1,500 gigalitres. The confirmation of this from my colleague Senator Simon Birmingham means that certainty has come to the irrigators of my electorate and they can plan their harvest with renewed confidence.


I am proud to be serving the government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Senator Mathias Cormann. I am relishing the challenge of my portfolio responsibilities. I thank Rachel Thompson, Brett Chant, Julianne Hyland and Carl Fitzpatrick for their work in my office in this role.


In the context of everything that government does, it is not surprising that from time to time the design or administration of Commonwealth regulation results in inequitable, unintentional or anomalous outcomes. That is why we have discretionary compensation mechanisms—act of grace payments and the scope to waive debts owed to the Commonwealth—for which I have responsibility. It is my hope that with fewer and better-designed regulations and a risk based approach to their administration we will see better outcomes for citizens and less need to resort to discretionary measures such as act of grace payments.


The Productivity Commission noted last year that those regulators with the best relationship with small businesses were those that took a risk based approach to regulation. The Commonwealth has come a long way in improving its approach to risk management since Comcover was established in 1998, but there is still much more to be done. One of my priorities is to promote a more mature approach to risk management within the Commonwealth, an approach that encourages officials to place risk management at the heart of everything that they do. This will apply as much to my own responsibilities in managing the administration of non-defence property portfolio as to anywhere else.


The reforms of the Hawke-Keating era were a response to a fundamental problem: the world had changed but government processes had not. Decades on, we face the same challenge. International trade and commerce, advances in technology, medical breakthroughs—all of these and more are changing the way Australians do business and the way we live. When faced with this challenge, the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government committed the fiscal equivalent of mortgaging the house to buy ice cream, as someone put it to me last week. The pleasure of short-term consumption has melted away, leaving us with a bucket load of debt. It is a big bucket, too.


Unlike those who preceded us, we are up to this challenge. The Commission of Audit is a crucial step in the process of considering the role of government. What is the government doing that people could reasonably be expected to do for themselves? Are the things we are spending money on worth the taxes needed to pay for them? Where is the government getting in the way of innovation and enterprise? What we need are reforms that will lift productivity and living standards into the future. Crucial to this process will be bipartisan support, the kind of bipartisan support that Hawke and Keating were able to rely on in pushing through their reform agenda. My invitation to those opposite is to work with us or risk being on the wrong side of history.


The incidence of mental illness and the high rate of suicide in regional Australia remains one of the least understood health crises facing our nation. Although the reasons why suicide is higher in rural and remote areas are not fully understood, we do know that suicide is roughly 30 per cent higher in regional and remote Australia. That is a huge challenge for our times. Indigenous Australians, young men under 24 years of age, men aged over 60 and farmers are particular population sub-groups considered to be at risk when it comes to suicide. Mental illness and suicide are felt especially severely in rural areas, where people are overrepresented in the statistics. There is nobody living in a country town today who has not been personally touched by suicide. How sad is that? It is the silent epidemic of our time. Minister Nash has done an outstanding job for rural health since she was appointed Assistant Minister for Health, and I commend her ongoing stewardship of this important portfolio.


As most would appreciate, life in the Australian bush can be harsh. It can mean hard work in often difficult environments. Farming and related industries can often be at the mercy of unpredictable weather. We are a land of flooding rains and long droughts. An entire year of production could be wiped out in the blink of an eye. External market forces and unfavourable currency can also put additional pressures on farming communities and families.


Even in the face of those adversities, it is difficult to reconcile higher rates of suicide in rural communities when these same communities consistently report higher levels of social cohesion than in major cities. People in rural areas are close-knit. They are friends; they are mates. People feel safer, there is more volunteerism and the social connections are greater in the bush. Wagga Wagga, my hometown, was recently judged the most family friendly city in Australia. These are the enduring strengths of our regions and these are also the very protective factors that can help fight the effects of depression and mental illness; yet the actual experience in the bush could not be more different.


Although the evidence from the millennium drought indicates that there was no increase in farmer suicides between 2001 and 2007 due to the drought, we know that there was a concerted effort by all governments to provide counselling and mental health services targeted towards various at-risk groups in drought prone areas during this difficult period. People from the bush are made of tough stuff, and when things start to become difficult they often try to tough it out, to not seek help, to fix their own problems. The fear of failure is a particularly strong motivator in the bush. It is this attitude, particularly among men, which makes it harder to identify when someone might be under more stress than normal, suffering from depression or perhaps even contemplating taking their own life. Despite widespread public awareness and education campaigns over many years, the stigma and shame associated with mental illness still exist to this day.


A lack of adequate services in rural and remote areas might account for some of the rural-specific suicide rate, and I know that all sides of this chamber have a commitment to providing services wherever they are needed. Indeed, I remain hopeful that this government will be able to deliver a headspace youth mental health centre in the Murrumbidgee, as I know many in my community would like to see. But dealing with mental illness is not just purely a health or psychological condition that requires medical help. While services do exist, we recognise that not every person suffering from mental illness will access them. Every community, therefore, has a responsibility to ensure that we are looking out for each other, that as resilient as we are no person can carry their burdens alone for too long. We do need to build resilience and to promote positivity.


The time has come for us as a community to shine a light on this unyielding tragedy that unfolds every week in households, farms and towns across our nation. We need to be able to discuss suicide and depression without the shame and stigma. Families need to be frank and honest with each other about the welfare of a family member, if they are concerned. Friends need to be extra vigilant about what their peers are going through. My message to rural communities is that there is no shame in raising mental health issues, there is no shame in being concerned for one another and there is certainly no shame in seeking help if and when we need it. Every person lost to suicide is an unnecessary and avoidable loss, and everyone has a role to play when it comes to suicide prevention.


I am humbled to have been returned as the federal member for Riverina and to have the opportunity to continue working for the people of the Riverina in the new Abbott-Truss government. I am thankful to the people of the Riverina for placing their faith and trust in me to be their voice again. My 2013 campaign director, Wes Fang of Wagga Wagga, is a loyal friend and confidant. Wes—the father of two young boys and he is expecting the arrival of another child in the coming weeks—worked tirelessly, day and night, for the campaign. There was nothing which was too much work for Wes. He spent hours stuffing envelopes, putting up corflutes, coordinating with the campaign committee and organising campaign events, all with a young family at home. Wes did all this in the midst of starting a small business, caring for his terminally ill father, Tom—may he rest in peace—and building a new home. I am very grateful to Wes for his hard work and dedication. I would like to publicly thank Wes and wish him and his wife, Nat Snyman, and their boys, Caspar and Atticus, all the best for the new arrival on the way.


My campaign committee was full of hardworking local volunteers—decent, compassionate and determined country people who did what was needed to get the job done. For many on my campaign committee elections are a familiar get-together of friends doing what the campaign needs, often late at night, packing booth boxes and distributing corflutes around the 61,435 square kilometres of the Riverina electorate. They did their job, because on election day we won every one of the more than 100 polling booths in the Riverina. Despite the cold and late nights, these volunteers got stuck in and did the job—as country people always do.


I thank Richard and Gretchen Sleeman of San Isidore whose constant help and support saw every booth across an electorate the size of Tasmania manned, with corflutes distributed, minutes taken at meetings and campaign coordination assured. There was no stopping Gretchen Sleeman—she is such a spirited community-minded person who worked day and night to make sure The Nationals had someone at every booth. Richard, amongst his commitments with many other organisations, made sure corflutes were ready, booth boxes were packed and people were informed. I thank them both immensely.


My indefatigable campaign committee had many people from many communities who would meet weekly to work through what the campaign needed. In addition to the people mentioned, there were the Hon. Rick Bull of Holbrook, Anna and John Dennis of Collingullie, Councillor Pam Halliburton and Margaret Hill of Junee, Barney Hyams of Batlow, Dominic Hopkinson, my wife Catherine, Zac Lederhose, Joanne McLennan, Barbara Parnell, Ange Smit, Robert and Lesley Vennell, and Anabel Williams—all of Wagga Wagga. They are all hard workers, they are all friends and I thank them very much.


I wish to also thank my wonderful predecessor Kay Hull for her ongoing and unwavering support, Ben Franklin for all that he has done and continues to do on behalf of the NSW Nationals, and Temora mayor Councillor Rick Firman for his counsel, his friendship and, at times, his humour.


I thank my staff in Wagga Wagga and Griffith who work hard every day to serve the people of the Riverina—not just those who vote Nationals but all the people of the Riverina. In Wagga Wagga Anabel Williams, Melissa Irvine, Anna Duggan, Dom Hopkinson, Kerrianne Malone, Ange Smit, Marney Johnstone, Helena Adamcewicz, Georgie Hutchinson and Jess Glynn have all worked for me at some point during my first term and I thank them for their efforts.


In Griffith, I thank Doris Bertollo, a stalwart of the Riverina electorate office who has worked in that role in Griffith for more than 25 years. After having worked for both Noel Hicks and Kay Hull before me, there is nothing Doris does not know about the Riverina or the immigration portfolio. Jess, Ange, Kerrianne and Anabel have all had a baby within the past 18 months or are due within the coming weeks—I am not quite sure what that says about my electorate office. I wish them and their families all the best with their new arrivals.


I am blessed with a loving and supportive family. My wife, Catherine, and I have spent 27 years together—she has put up with a lot—building a life for ourselves and our three lovely children. To see Georgina, Alexander and Nicholas grow into strong, intelligent, purposeful adults has been one of the great joys of our life together. So I am especially keen to ensure that government does what it can to help support families. If we have strong families we have stronger and more resilient communities. We should recognise the role of the family unit in providing people with a sense of belonging and as the foundation for people within communities to be socially connected with each other.


In closing, I restate my full commitment to serving the people of the Riverina. It is a wonderful electorate that stretches from the eastern side of Mount Kosciuszko—as Simon Crean described it, the high point of Australian politics—right through to many kilometres past Roto, which is past Hillston, the last big community. I do not take my responsibilities lightly and I will always fight for the interests of the people of the Riverina. I am extremely pleased that I am part of the Abbott-Truss government—not only do we have to fix the budget issues but also we are setting about putting Australia onto a sound economic footing so that we can meet the challenges of the future. There will be many challenges—challenges with water, challenges with border security and challenges for the economy—but we are up to the task. The Australian people gave us the mandate to carry out our reform agenda and we will do that with purpose, dedication and maturity.

"Ellis, Kate, MP",ALP,2014-03-03,"



Ms KATE ELLIS
 (Adelaide) (17:12):  I begin my contribution to this address-in-reply debate by thanking the very good people of Adelaide for returning me to this place once more, and I put on the record my gratitude for their support and for the faith they have placed in me. Of course that is something that none of us should take lightly, and we know that it is our job to work each and every day to make sure we repay their faith in us. Whilst this address-in-reply debate is an opportunity for the government to outline what they seek to achieve over the course of this parliament, it is also an opportunity for each and every one of us to outline our priorities and the key issues we will be seeking to pursue. My absolute No. 1 priority is to stand up strongly for the people of Adelaide. For almost 10 years now I have come to this place and tried to make sure that I represent honestly and forcefully their views and their opinions, and I look forward to continuing to do that over the course of the next three years.


Before talking about some of the issues and some of the views that the people of Adelaide have asked that I bring forward to this place, I would like to thank a few people for assisting me to be here. Of course there is the Adelaide community. I have now run in four federal election campaigns, and never before have I seen the kind of support from local community members that we saw during the course of the last campaign. It was remarkable to have people who had not come through the ranks of the Labor Party or any political party, but who were working out in the community, ringing the office and saying they wanted to help. We had people dropping off supplies to feed our volunteers. One remarkable community member, having heard me on radio, knew that I was unwell and the next day they brought a get-well pack, which included honey and lemon and all sorts of remedies, to get me through.




Ms Collins:
  Did it work?




Ms KATE ELLIS:
  I am here, Julie, so it must have been highly effective. To all of these people, I say thank you. I would also like to thank my amazing staff, who worked day and night throughout the campaign, as they do throughout the term to ensure that we can carry on in this role. One of the consequences that is sadly inevitable in moving from government to opposition is that you do downsize those staff considerably, but we have a saying, 'Once a member of team Ellis, always member of team Ellis.' I know that they will always be there and I will always show my gratitude for having the absolute best staff members, best campaign committee members and best support that anyone could ask for. To all of them, I say thank you.


Now the job is to make sure that we stand up strongly for the people of Adelaide. Sadly, there is already evidence that there is going to be much to stand up against. I am really proud that we have managed to deliver record levels of investment and results to the Adelaide community over the last few years, but we have seen in the early stages of this Abbott government that they are a North Shore Sydney government who have never shown any interest whatsoever in South Australia or, particularly, in fighting for South Australian jobs. Already, just months in, we have seen the Holden closure and the thousands of local families who will be affected by that.


I will also place on the record today my thoughts for the Qantas workers who were delivered the incredibly bad news of 5,000 job cuts just last week. I know that many of those Qantas workers are residents of the seat of Adelaide. I have visited and spoken to them about their concerns about a lack of job security. I would like to say that I will absolutely use this parliament to ensure that we pursue a plan to get them back to work and to turn around the statistics which we have now seen showing that, since this government was elected, there has been one job lost every three minutes. That is unacceptable to my local community and it is unacceptable for our nation.


We have seen an emphasis by the Prime Minister, by the Treasurer and by others on Sydney, particularly North Shore Sydney. It is my job to make sure that South Australia is not overlooked. It is my job to make sure that the residents of Adelaide are not overlooked, and there are many key issues which are at stake. At the last election we already saw a number of issues to which we pledged funds for the Adelaide community which have so far not been matched and honoured by the government. I talk about things like the Women & Children's Hospital Foundation's funding for a feasibility study to look into increasing their research capacity, something that I would think that every South Australian should stand up and fight for and support.


Also in the local community there are things like new lighting and upgrades to the club facilities at the Broadview Football Club. This is a club that has gone through hard times. This is a club that has worked through those hard times and has massively expanded to see that the Broadview Football Club is now offering sport, entertainment and a community hub, and it has huge numbers of junior players coming through. We want to make sure that we are not turning away people who are engaging in a healthy pursuit on the weekends because the facilities are not there to support them. It is shameful that the incoming health and sports minister has said that they will not be matching just $120,000 for the Broadview Football Club.


One of the areas of my electorate for which I have a particular soft spot is Kilburn. The good people of Kilburn have worked long and hard and have too often have been overlooked by governments of all persuasions at all levels. These are people who have worked hard, have largely have come through public housing, have too much pollution in their area and have a lack of community facilities. Yet, when Kilburn Primary School was closed down several years ago, I launched a campaign to ensure that that space would be used for the local community, that there would not be more heavy industry moving into the area and that we would have a place where the community could come together. I was so incredibly proud to be able to announce $1 million in funding to build a sporting complex at the Kilburn Primary School site. It would be the new home of the West Adelaide Football Club, but, perhaps more importantly, it would also be open to community use.


Kilburn is one of the areas in the community that I represent where the demographics have changed hugely. They have an ever-growing Afghan community, who are pretty handy on the soccer field, I have to say, but are looking for a place to train and to play. There are also members of the Sudanese community moving into the area who are very keen to ensure that there is some place provided for sporting facilities and a facility where people can meet one another and come together as a community regardless of their background. Sadly, the Abbott government have failed to match this commitment too.


The situation of the Victoria Park grandstand is perhaps the most shocking. An area has been redeveloped around Victoria Park so that it can host a number of different community and sporting events. We pledged $62,000 for disability access at that grandstand. That is something that I would expect every member of this parliament would support, but, shockingly, $62,000 has now been ripped off of them so that this disability access will not be able to go ahead and so that these community events will not be able to be attended by all members of our community. It is on issues like these and so many more that it will be my role to stand up for the Adelaide community.


One issue that I particularly want to touch on, noting the minister who is at the table today—Minister Briggs—is the issue of the South Road upgrade. The assistant minister may know that this is a particular pet project. It is a big project. It is an incredibly important project for both Adelaide and South Australia. It is a project that was estimated to cost $896 million to upgrade South Road between Torrens Road and the River Torrens. It is a project which the former Labor federal government struck a deal with the state government on a fifty-fifty funding commitment so that this project could commence. This project did actually commence. There have been properties that have already been acquired. There was work that had already commenced. There is a site office that is up and running that had conducted community consultations. There was actually work happening on the ground to ensure that this became a very long overdue reality.


Even this year alone, it is an issue that I can say I have heard about at countless street corner meetings—that the residents are absolutely furious. Not only has this project now been brought to a stop but the residents in the local area actually received a flyer in their letterboxes during the election campaign saying, 'If you vote for the Liberal Party we will upgrade South Road to the western suburbs.' This was to the very residents who had fought for the Torrens to Torrens upgrade—not just for years but for decades—only to then learn that indeed the progress on that project would be stopped.


But I am hoping that there will soon be good news on this front. This is where I look towards the assistant minister. I was delighted on the weekend when I read The Weekend Australian—which does not always bring me delight, I should say! But I was particularly delighted to read this article, 'Tony Abbott eyes $5 billion for new road funding'. I note that the assistant minister said:


Infrastructure is already a major commitment of the federal government and I think you’ll see an even greater commitment, because there is a great need to lift our national productivity.


Now, I do not always agree with the assistant minister sitting at the table—




Mr Briggs:
  You never do!




Ms KATE ELLIS:
  But on this particular occasion, I say to him that if he wants to prove the point that this is not a government that is only focused on North Shore Sydney, that this is not a government that has absolutely and totally overlooked South Australia, then there is no reason why this funding, which is apparently on its way, will not ensure that the Torrens to Torrens road upgrade of South Road gets back underway and that we see this project delivered for the community that I am so proud to represent.


We know that the economic case stacks up. We know that there is far more policy rationale for doing this than the Darlington upgrade, which politics has persuaded the government to prioritise instead. We know that it is long overdue and we know that it will not just benefit South Road; it will not just benefit those who are using it as a corridor—the trucks and the like—but it will actually benefit the whole area. All the studies have shown that it will decrease massively the amount of traffic which is utilising Churchill Road and a number of other areas.


So whether it is on fighting for the South Road upgrade or whether it is on fighting for the funding which the Abbott government has already stripped away from the Adelaide community, I am delighted to be here to fight for those residents and to make sure that we continue to see real results.


Of course, I have been given a task on top of just looking after the people of Adelaide, and that is to serve as Labor's shadow minister for education and early childhood. They are two areas that I am deeply passionate about; in fact, the area of education was the very area which inspired me to look towards politics, knowing that education has the power to transform individual lives more than any other area of investment. It is a job that I take on with quite a sense of responsibility because I am incredibly proud of the huge amount of progress that we made in the education area under the Rudd and Gillard governments.


This was an area that was transformed. We saw new policies come into place: a national curriculum, which had been talked about for so long, finally became a reality; we could shine a light on school performance through national testing and making results available through accountability at a school level; and, importantly, we undertook the biggest review of the Australian school education system in over 40 years, under the panel led by David Gonski. Throughout that process, we had those opposite saying: 'There is no problem. There is no equity issue in Australian schools. There is nothing to see here; the funding model is not broken.' But, of course, the Australian public knew better. The Australian public sees the overwhelming evidence that there is far too big a gap between those schools which are high performing and those schools which are struggling, that this is a gap which is increasing.


There is far too big a gap between the performance of a student who is enrolled at a metropolitan school and one who happens to live in country Australia. There are far too many huge equity gaps in the Australian education system, and the Australian public know that, because whether you are a student, a teacher or a parent you see each and every day what is happening in our school system.


We saw on almost the eve of the election those opposite finally recognising that this was a critically important issue to the Australian public. So what did they do? They had a total reversal of policy, where they came out and declared that they had seen the light—they, too, agreed that we needed to see these school reforms. And in what has already been shown to be absolutely the biggest fraud committed on the Australian public, we now see that that was just not the case. They stood up—and not just on one occasion but time and time again—like the now Prime Minister, talking about how he was on a 'unity ticket' with Labor when it came to school funding, and the now education minister, saying:


You can vote Liberal or Labor and you'll get exactly the same amount of funding for your school.


He said, 'Well, we've said that we will adopt the new school funding model from 1 January next year for the next four years. So, it yes, we've accepted that there is a new school funding model.' The Prime Minister also said:


So, we will honour the agreements that Labor has entered into. We will match the offers that Labor has made.


The minister also said, 'Funding will be the same under the coalition as under the Labor Party.'


What is truly shameful from this government is that they stood at polling booths around Australia saying this. They had posters, 'Your school will receive the same amount of funding under Liberal or Labor.' But we already know that that is absolutely not true, and it was a sham that they tried to pull on the Australian public. It is our job on this side of the House to say: 'We will not give up on these reforms. We know that our school system is too important to let those opposite just throw away all of the progress that has been made.' But what we will also do is to point out, each and every day, to those who still come in here crying about broken promises on carbon tax, that every pamphlet they sent out to their communities and every sign in a polling booth about school funding has been shown to be utterly false in the most disgusting attempt to trick the Australian public that I think we have probably ever seen.


We now know that there is a huge difference in the amount of funding that schools will get under this government. What we were talking about under Labor's Gonski reforms would see $14.65 billion in additional funding flowing to Australian schools. Under the model put forward by those opposite, that figure is just $2.8 billion. Worse than that, those opposite, who claimed that there would be 'no difference in the amount of funding that your school would get', have then come in and said, 'Actually, we're going to throw away all of the conditions that were placed on state governments.' Even though our reforms had finally changed a system that saw too many state governments cutting funding to schools, not keeping up with indexation and not making co-contributions for additional federal funds, those opposite have come in and said, 'Yes, we'll send out a no-strings-attached blank cheque to the state governments but we will do absolutely nothing to stop them from cutting from their school education budgets the same amount in additional money that they're getting—or, indeed, more.' The government have said that they will do nothing to require state governments to put in co-contributions for the dollars in federal funding that they have received, which shows that there is absolutely no way that any member of the government, any of those opposite, can repeat the promises that they made at polling booths on election day. We have seen it from the Prime Minister. We have seen it from the education minister. They can no longer say, 'Your school will receive the same amount of funding under us,' as the school would have under the Labor Party, because they know that it was a sham the entire time.


We also heard that there would be no cuts to education, yet we have seen $1 billion stripped from the trade-training centres program—because, at a time when we are losing jobs, at a time when we are seeing youth unemployment, those opposite think it is a smart idea to cut the very programs that were put in place to skill young Australians. And now there are alarm bells ringing about the Youth Connections program, a program that was put in place to help young Australians who are at risk of being disengaged and falling out of our education or employment systems to stay engaged. There are huge question marks about whether those opposite are just going to cut another program.


I say to all members of this House: it is our responsibility to fight against the youth unemployment figures that we are seeing in this nation. Now, I do not claim that there is one silver bullet that is going to turn that around—and those opposite are being dishonest if they claim that there is—but I do say that you do not keep a single young person in employment by cutting the programs that are already in place to try and support them. There is absolutely no rationale for that. On this cut and on a range of other cuts, I am proud to be here in the parliament representing the very good voters of Adelaide, and I pledge to work my hardest each and every day to do just that.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2014-03-03,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo—Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (17:32):  It is a pleasure to speak in this debate and it is the privilege of all of us who are elected to this place that we get the opportunity to do so. I should say, as the member for Adelaide leaves the chamber, that she should be very happy with the new government's decision in respect of South Road, because we will, as the Prime Minister said in October last year, deliver a north-south corridor in South Australia and help build the productive capacity of our state within a decade. We have said time and time again that we will do both the Darlington and the Torrens-to-Torrens projects because they are both important projects.


As I said at the start, it is an absolute honour and privilege to be in this place. This is the third occasion I have had the opportunity to make this address. Actually, technically, it is the second, because the first time, as I was the child of a by-election, my maiden speech was on a bill. But it is a real privilege to be here again, and I thank the people of Mayo for delivering a very solid result for me and the Liberal Party on 7 September. I can report to the House that we had a swing to the Liberal Party of 5.22 per cent in my electorate, which puts me into the semi-marginal area of 62½ per cent, so I am very pleased with that. I did not quite get to Alexander Downer's best result in Mayo, but we will keep working away at that.


We only lost at one booth, which was at Bridgewater, by seven votes, and we know that Tim Burvill, who was in charge of that booth, was responsible for that! And I wish him a happy birthday for tomorrow. We had some great results in the new areas of McLaren Vale, McLaren Flat and Willunga, which we had inherited from—and she will not thank me for saying this—the member for Kingston, who had lost those areas in a redistribution. The member for Kingston is actually a very hardworking member and much underrated in this place, in my view, and I think that was one of the reasons that we had an 11.4 per cent swing in McLaren Vale, a 15.3 per cent swing in McLaren Flat and an 11.7 per cent swing in Willunga. 


So it was a great result and it was a result based on, I think, a lot of hard work on issues that were important to my electorate. The first and overwhelming issue was that people wanted to change the government, and they did. That was terrific because that gave us the opportunity to implement our plan for Australia, to ensure that we are stronger and more prosperous than we would have been down the path the Labor Party was taking us. 


But locally there were some important issues as well which I would like to deal with. Firstly, the most contentious issue in my electorate in the last three years was certainly the former government's decision to break an election promise following the 2010 election and put a detention facility at Inverbrackie without consulting the community first, breaking a commitment not to have more onshore detention facilities. That decision caused a lot of community resentment, a lot of community anger, around Woodside and Oakbank, and those parts of the Adelaide Hills, particularly the fact that they had never been consulted. They had never been asked by the former government whether this was something they would support. It was a commitment of ours at the election, a commitment that will be fulfilled in the very near future, that we will close that facility's operations because it is not an appropriate way to deal with the border security issue that the minister for immigration is so magnificently handling. So we look forward to that announcement. There have been some people, particularly some Adelaide Hills councillors who are certainly not of the Liberal persuasion, or even of the Labor persuasion, who constantly make claims that the centre retains community support and therefore should remain open.


The now minister for immigration and I put a very clear proposition to the electorate prior to the last election that we would close it if we won the election. The swing towards the Liberal Party in the booths most related to this centre, at Woodside and Oakbank—great Australians—was nine per cent in Woodside and nine per cent in Oakbank. Those members of the Adelaide Hills Council—who really should focus on delivering services to those of us who pay rates rather than focusing on federal politics and continuing to make these false claims—should look to what their voters actually said. There will be an opportunity in November when the council elections come up for those voters to send exactly the same message to some of those councillors.


An issue which I have fought for consistently since being pre-selected and since being elected to this place and which I will continually advocate for—and be proudly standing there when we have turned the first sod, as, ironically, the minister responsible—is the second interchange at Bald Hills Road off the South Eastern Freeway to cater for the growth in Mount Barker. Alexander Downer, when he was the member for Mayo, made a commitment in the 2007 election campaign that the federal government would contribute funding towards it. Mark Goldsworthy, the state member for Kavel, said the same in 2006 and 2010 and is saying the same in 2014. I made that commitment in the by-election in 2008 and 2010 and in 2013 we committed $16 million towards the project. I am happy to report to the House that, after being ignored for four years, the state Labor government, who opened up all the land around Mount Barker for development but failed to invest in the infrastructure, and Minister Koutsantonis, to his credit—and I do not think I have ever used those words in the same sentence before—have announced at the last minute that the Labor Party, if they are re-elected in a week and a half's time, which I truly hope does not happen, will fund the project.


So the people of Mount Barker and the people of Mayo know that, no matter who wins the state election, this project will be delivered. I will proudly be standing there later this year when we turn that first sod and we make sure that this project is delivered cheaply, efficiently and quickly, in line with our agenda to deliver more infrastructure to make Australia more prosperous and more productive. This is a very important piece of infrastructure. It will help alleviate the concerns of residents about the increased growth in our region after the state Labor Party decided to open up our region for that growth without investing in the necessary infrastructure. This is a small step to ensuring that the increased number of people who are living in Mount Barker and its surrounds have access to the freeway in a safe and efficient way. At the moment there is one exit to the freeway from Adelaide Road and it has become a constant bottleneck as the community has grown. It is not safe. We are in a bushfire zone in the Adelaide Hills, and one exit from a major town is far from safe. Having a second exit and entrance will make the town more efficient and much move liveable for the residents of Mount Barker. It is a huge win.


While there has been some misreporting in the local papers about what was offered by the state government, it is a proud achievement that I am extraordinarily proud to be part of. We have committed to this project and we will see this project through. I very much look forward to this road being built. Hopefully, after the 2016 election, if I am returned—I do intend to nominate again—I will be able to stand here and say that it is now delivered, open and operating, unless something gets dramatically in the way of that. That is, I think, the No. 1 commitment that I have pursued.


The second commitment that I have pursued is the swimming pool on the south coast—the Fleurieu aquatic centre. It is an issue which has raised some controversy in recent times. I committed to this project when I first ran in the by-election and I committed again in 2010. In this election we took the correct position to ensure that we were not making commitments that we could not fund, and there was some question about the commitment. But, given the decision the Deputy Prime Minister and I made to allow the uncontracted rounds 2, 3 and 4 of the RDA funds to be spent, the Fleurieu aquatic centre will also go ahead, and we look forward in the very, very near future to signing that contract and getting that project underway for the people of the south coast.


Kangaroo Island, a beautiful part of my electorate, is an area that has great opportunity. It also has some challenges—as do many island communities across our country—because of the cost of freight and the cost of getting to the island. It is the jewel in the crown of South Australia and also of our country. About 60 per cent of overseas tourists who visit South Australia do so for the specific purpose of visiting KI. Our plan to abolish the carbon tax and to take regulatory pressure off business will help KI prosper, but we will also work very closely with the Mayor of Kangaroo Island, Jayne Bates—who does an outstanding job—to see what we can do in addition to ensure that the infrastructure needs are met on Kangaroo Island so that they can take advantage of all their strengths.


One issue that is bedevilling them—an issue that I have long had concerns about—is the blue gum forests. The MIS program from some time ago shows that when governments intervene to try to create industries and markets, it inevitably has consequences which are long and painful. There is no better example than the locked up productive land on Kangaroo Island, which could be farmed and used for much better purposes. It is destroying the community of Parndana, and we do need to try to find a solution to this. It is not easy but it needs to happen because Kangaroo Island is a jewel in our crown. Because of the fertile soils and the climate, food production on the island is a real strength, and the blue gums are inhibiting that. It came from bad policy. It is still bad and getting worse and we need to fix it.


Another very proud achievement—and something which was the issue of my by-election—is in respect of the Murray-Darling Basin. It is something that I—as someone who grew up on the river, in Mildura, and who has been involved in this issue for a very long time—passionately believe we needed to address. When I was in John Howard's office, there was the groundbreaking plan to address the crisis in the Murray-Darling Basin. It has taken too long to get to this point where we can come to an agreement that we need to ensure that we can be as productive as possible in the basin but that we have a healthy basin. It is a terrific achievement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Simon Birmingham, to finally bring all the parties together—all the states—last week to sign up to the intergovernmental agreement and put those reforms in place, which will ensure that the deal that was done during the last term of parliament is locked away and achieved. I must mention Henry Jones, who is suffering from some health issues at the moment. He is a fisherman at Clayton and has fought day in and day out for years for this result. He will see the result and, I think, sit back with an element of pride. He deserves to have an element of pride, because he worked so hard, as did so many South Australians. It is a great achievement, particularly for Senator Birmingham, and I congratulate him on what he has done in that respect.


One of the commitments I made in the preselection for Mayo back in 2008 was that I would introduce a mobile electorate office to get around my electorate. It is a large electorate with diverse communities—the communities of Yankalilla, Victor Harbor and the Lower Lakes, out north to the Eden Valley and Springton, right through to the Adelaide Hills, where I live and continually show that I cannot ride a bike properly, and Kangaroo Island. So it is not easy for constituents to get to my office in Mount Barker, so I committed that we would get out and get around. During the last term I visited over 160 communities with my mobile electorate office, providing the opportunity for local residents to come and see me to raise issues. As I am sure all members of parliament in this place know, even if people do not always agree with you—or, indeed, often agree with you—they appreciate the opportunity to raise issues about Australia, politics, the economy, their jobs, their health care, their education and what have you. The fact that they get the chance to talk to their local member and that we live in a country where we can advertise that we will be somewhere and we have no fear of advertising that and we are not held up in our office constantly is another example, I think, of what a wonderful country we have. People are nearly always polite and respectful even if they are not always in full agreement, and we will do our best to convince those who do not necessarily agree with our perspective. I think getting around is an important thing that we do in my electorate, and I will continue to do it as much as I can—obviously with the additional responsibilities.


Following the election, it was a privilege, an honour and a shock to get a phone call from the Prime Minister inviting me to join the executive of the government. It is a humbling thing to be part of a ministry and to be one of the leaders of the government in driving our agenda through. I am constantly aware that this is a job which is not a right; it is an absolute privilege. We need to work at it every day to ensure that we are doing as well as we can to achieve the aims of the government. In infrastructure, as I said very early, we have bold plans. We have hard and difficult decisions to make to ensure we get our plans done, but we will get them done. We will invest in building our productive capacity. We will invest in ensuring that Australia can do better than we are doing today and that small business, medium business and large business can compete as well as they possibly can. We do not believe in government by chequebook; we believe in government giving all Australians the opportunity to achieve their best. I think the Prime Minister has been outstanding in delivering this message since we came to government. I think that, as time goes on, he will be seen as one of our best prime ministers. He has all the capacity to deliver for Australia. Australians respect Tony Abbott because he is a good man with strong values and strong beliefs and he will pursue those for the good of our country. I fundamentally believe that.


In conclusion, I should acknowledge a few people. We would not be here without volunteers. They are the geniuses of us all, and without them we would not be elected. David Hall is first among equals in that respect. He goes out of his way. He lives in Victor Harbor and runs a manufacturing business which is doing better every day, and he travels and gives up his own time, often with very little thanks. He is a great man, and I thank him so much for what he has done. We would not have been able to do it without Marg Westmore, and my state counterpart Mark Goldsworthy could not do it without Marg Westmore either. She is a treasure extraordinaire. I acknowledge Richard Munro, who ran the campaign and was the genius behind the Briggs Bus, an innovation which will continue—that will be back in a campaign; don't you worry about that—and Bryan Reid for all he has done as well. There are many others whom I do not have the opportunity to thank in the time remaining. I do want to acknowledge Brian Dohse, though. He sadly passed away the day after I had my thank-you drinks in December. He was a great man and we will remember Brian for a long time to come.


I must thank my staff—because that is what they have written on my piece of paper! They were terrific. I had no changes in my staff in the whole of the last three years. I think it is a really important part of a political office to ensure that you have a consistent group, and I thank them very much for what they have done. They have a bigger task now with more people on board. Laura, Amy, David, Amelia and Rhiannon—and I am going to forget someone now—are terrific people and they have done a great amount of work for me. So with those remarks I again thank the people of Mayo for re-electing me to this place. Avril is the other one, and she will kill me for that! I seek leave to continue my remarks at another time.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2014-03-03,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (21:00):  Many reckless pieces of legislation were brought before this place under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor-Greens alliance, but perhaps none were more reckless or more damaging to Australian families than their Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011. That law redefined family violence to mean just about anything, and encouraged vindictive parents to make fraudulent claims to remove other parents from families. The Labor minister at the time claimed that no-one would make such false claims. Yet in a submission to the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry relating to the 2011 bill, Professor Patrick Parkinson from the University of Sydney referenced a paper called ‘Domestic Violence: Views of Queensland Magistrates’ when he said:


A … survey of 38 Queensland magistrates found that 74% agreed with the proposition that protection orders are used in Family Court proceedings as a tactic to aid a parent’s case and to deprive their partner of contact with their children.


Fast forward a year after the law came into effect, and we have this article from The Sydney Morning Herald of 6 July 2013, the headline of which said it all: 'False … claims are the new court weapon, retiring judge says'. Justice David Collier was retiring from the Parramatta Family Court after 14 years on the bench and spoke about mothers who, he said, directed false allegations of abuse against former partners. He said:


When you have heard the evidence, you realise that this is a person who's so determined to win that he or she will say anything. I'm satisfied that a number of people who have appeared before me have known that it is one of the ways of completely shutting husbands out of the child's life.


It's a horrible weapon.


The consequences of such allegations can be extreme. A former colleague of mine and of others in this place, the former member for Hume, Alby Schultz, spoke with some of the victims of family law who were treated most unfairly and, unable to see light at the end of the tunnel, ended up taking their own lives. In his retirement speech, Alby had this to say:



… in 2005 I produced a booklet based on three years of hard research about the Child Support Agency and its relentless, unjustifiable anti-male culture, which culminated in the suicide of a number of my young constituents. Confronting the very serious issue of male suicide caused by the gender biased CSA was treated as a politically sensitive no-go area by many politicians, which I embraced as a challenge on behalf of 4,000 families and individuals across the country. 


Like the member for Hume, I too have had my share of constituents who feel they have reached the end of their tether. One example is a constituent whose ex-partner moved from their mining town home to the coast. When he followed so he could continue to spend time with his son, he could no longer find a job that paid as well as one of those mining jobs out west. But the CSA deemed that he was 'capable' of earning the much higher wage, so they forced him to make child support payments as if he was actually receiving that income. That situation was just not sustainable for him, so he had no choice but to move back to the remote west, giving up access to his son, so he could pay exorbitant amounts of money to keep his ex-partner in luxury on the coast. The CSA, through its actions, denied this father his right to have meaningful access to his child and, through its actions, denied the child its right to a meaningful relationship with its father.


In another example, a Mackay man had court orders in place that specifically precluded his ex-partner from moving to another town. In breach of those court orders, his ex-partner moved to an undisclosed location in another town, depriving him of his right to see his children. To rub salt into that wound, his ex-partner then requested a change of assessment from the CSA because, in their view, the ex-partner was no longer looking after his children. Despite knowing that the ex-partner was in breach of court orders and that the father's care time had been reduced against his will, the CSA still increased the amount of child support he had to pay to his ex-partner.


Family law and child support is a very messy area and there are no winners. But, under the current system, some of the losers are needlessly being turned into massive losers—even to the extent of losing their children, and their life. When constituents come to me with family law and child support issues, they almost always end their story with the phrase: 'How is that fair?' Well, it is not fair. The system is broken and the system needs to be fixed. It can be made fairer. We can do something to restore the balance in this area so that fathers can be fathers and that children can have a relationship with their fathers. There will never be winners in family law; there will never be winners in child support. But the least that we can do in this place is to make it fair for all parties.

Mr CONROY
 (Charlton) (10:31):  West Wallsend High School will celebrate its 50th anniversary this month and I advise the House of the festivities to promote the history of the school and its community. Whilst the first stage of the high school was built in 1962, students at the time were required to walk around a mile back to the old central school in Brown Street for manual arts, home economics, needlework and science lessons. It was not until January 1964 that the separation of primary and secondary school students occurred with the new high school operating full-time under founding principal, Mr Reg Thomas. As so many pioneering towns did, West Wallsend grew around its colliery; this coalmining history is celebrated and preserved in the West Wallsend District Heritage Museum, located on the grounds of West Wallsend High School. Last year, I had the pleasure of touring the museum. It contains a vast collection of photographs, artefacts and memorabilia available for viewing by the public and these are also used to enhance the learning experiences of students at West Wallsend High School.


The school will hold an open day on 14 March to celebrate the anniversary and the museum plans to display a range of ex-student memorabilia on the day. The last Labor government delivered close to $15,000 towards this event, which has supported the construction of a replica poppet head made by current metals and engineering students and their teacher Kevin Gray. The poppet head sculpture will be the main feature of a commemorative garden at the entrance to the school, forever reminding those attending West Wallsend High School of the town's proud mining origins. Pavers engraved with the names and messages of past students and families will also be laid in this garden. The funding also enabled the production of a historical DVD which involved videorecording of interviews with local residents in order to preserve their memories of the town's early days. Students from the school assisted with the capture and production of the video as part of their history studies. I am proud to say that the former heritage minister, the member for Port Adelaide, visited the school with me last year and recorded a personal message for this DVD which will be buried in a time capsule at the open day. 


I would like to thank the principal of West Wallsend High School, Ann Campbell, and her staff—in particular, Daniel Winter, Leah Buchanan, Kerri Cottrill and Mara Ellerton—along with Lillian Price and the Sugarloaf District Heritage Group for their work in promoting the school's history within our community. West Wallsend has a proud history of coalmining—it is the heart of that community—and this project will add to that legacy, in conjunction with murals that are appearing in the town commemorating this proud history. I wish the school and past and present students of West Wallsend High School a happy 50th anniversary and wish them all the best for their celebrations.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (11:02):  I move:


That this House:


(1) notes:


(a) that investment in infrastructure is a vital contributor to economic growth;


(b) the broad support in the House for:


   (i) the principle that infrastructure priorities should be developed by experts, based on the benefit to the national economy;


   (ii) Infrastructure Australia as an independent source of infrastructure advice to government; and


   (iii) the continuance and enhancement of the successful role played by Infrastructure Australia since its formation in 2008; and


(c) the overwhelming desire of infrastructure providers, financiers, and others involved in the infrastructure chain, for a robust, bipartisan approach to the governance of Infrastructure Australia; and


(2) resolves that:


(a) the issue of the future governance of Infrastructure Australia be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications for consideration and report back to the House by 30 April 2014;


(b) the Committee seeks formal submissions from the public, and specifically stakeholders across the infrastructure chain, on the matter of the governance of Infrastructure Australia;


(c) Infrastructure Australia, the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, other relevant federal agencies, COAG and its member governments, including local government, be specifically requested to provide input; and


(d) until such time as this review is completed, the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 not be further proceeded with in the House or the other place.


Getting the right advice on infrastructure development is essential to maximise value for public investment and encourage private sector activity. Infrastructure is a key to future productivity growth, future jobs growth and a better quality of life for all Australians. It is therefore critical that Infrastructure Australia, the independent adviser to government, be allowed to retain its independence and be able to publish its impartial findings about the infrastructure needs of the country.


The Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill will compromise Infrastructure Australia's independence. This bill should be withdrawn. It is an affront to the important concepts of evidence-based decision making and transparency. It has been roundly criticised by experts whose motive in offering criticism is not political but based purely on what they know about Infrastructure Australia and the broad infrastructure investment scene in this country. No less an organisation than the Business Council of Australia, representing the nation's biggest companies, has criticised this bill as an attack on Infrastructure Australia's independence. The Urban Development Association of Australia is also concerned. These people are not politicians; they are experts. We need a debate about why it is that the Abbott government wants to undermine Infrastructure Australia. 


My motion today proposes that the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill 2013 be withdrawn and be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications. I propose this because when the Minister for Infrastructure introduced this bill he assured the House that it would strengthen Infrastructure Australia. This is clearly untrue. This bill was gagged through the House of Representatives even though it was not due to be considered until after a Senate inquiry in March. There are at least two areas where the amendments to the operation of Infrastructure Australia will be severely compromised by this bill. The fact is that Infrastructure Australia has a critical role which will be undermined if this bill is passed.


Infrastructure Australia was created by Labor in 2008. Its design was specifically focused on independence, because Labor wanted to disconnect the infrastructure investment cycle—which is necessarily long term—from the short-term political cycle. IA conducted an audit of the nation's infrastructure needs and created an infrastructure investment priority list based on the potential for a project to contribute to lifting national productivity. Importantly, it took away the piecemeal approach of examining a single project in isolation. It recognised the need for integrated approaches and released a national ports strategy, a national land freight strategy and, more recently, a national urban transport strategy. 


Infrastructure Australia's recommendations were based on cold, hard facts—excluding political considerations. Any government interest in boosting productivity, and thereby opening the way for jobs growth, will be well served by following its recommendations. That is why the former Labor government funded all 15 out of 15 of the top IA recommendations for major investments. We did not pick and choose according to the electoral map; we used productivity gains as our yardstick. 


This current bill will undermine the IA's independence. Firstly, the Minister for Infrastructure wants to order Infrastructure Australia about what it can and cannot research. In particular, the changes allow the minister to order IA to exclude complete classes of investment from its research considerations. This fails to understand that, when you look at transport infrastructure, you need to look at the relationship between passenger and freight, as well as the relationship between rail and road. You need to look at the way that the cities and regions function in order to get the right outcomes. This is retrospectively attempting to justify the stripping of billions of dollars from projects like the Melbourne Metro and the Cross River Rail project, both of which have been recommended by Infrastructure Australia. It is also aimed at justifying the removal of $500 million that has been allocated for Western Australian public transport projects, both in terms of light rail and also heavy rail to the airport. This move will undermine the very functioning of Infrastructure Australia. 


A second change, which is just as serious, would allow the minister to prohibit Infrastructure Australia from publishing its findings. Transparency is absolutely critical. At the moment, Infrastructure Australia publishes that information. It is therefore critical that the transparent operation of Infrastructure Australia be defended. It is one of the statements that was made by the Business Council of Australia, who said in their submission to the bill:


The ability to undertake this evaluation without interference is critical to the effective operation of an independent and empowered IA. It is unclear why there should be a need for a power to carve out 'classes of projects'… Good planning should prioritise any infrastructure projects of the highest economic and social value, and not differentiate by project class …


The submission continues:


It is critical to public confidence in the decisions made by government that wherever possible these evaluations are made public, and a huge component of public disclosure is the publication of these reports…


Further:


It would be a concern if evaluations are not published because the demonstrated economic or social value is at odds with the decision by government about whether or not to support a particular investment. Publication of evaluations should be the norm except where there is a justifiable reason not to do so.


It is clear that the Business Council of Australia submission, as well as the other submissions—including Infrastructure Partnerships Australia and, indeed, the submission from the Infrastructure Australia coordinator himself—shows that they are on to what the government is aiming to do here, which is to go back to the old pork-barrelling provisions, whereby you have decisions made without proper analysis. We can see this happening in the way that funding is being allocated in Melbourne by this government, which it has foreshadowed without proper cost-benefit analysis. 


It is not just the BCA; the UDIA said it:


… objects to this provision on the grounds that it impairs Infrastructure Australia’s ability to objectively evaluate projects based on their merit, and introduces the potential for political bias. 


This is absolutely critical and on Friday the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee heard further concerns from Infrastructure Partnerships and the Moving People 2030 Task Force. Departmental representatives at that hearing seemed unclear as to the operation of the bill.


Last month the Treasurer played host to the G20 finance ministers in Sydney. During that meeting he strongly emphasised the need for infrastructure investment to drive global economic growth. In that objective he was right, but that is completely undermined by this legislation that was rammed through the House without proper consideration. It undermines the very reason Infrastructure Australia was established. Infrastructure Australia was established to have proper analysis of integrated plans for the way that cities, regions and the entire nation functions. Infrastructure Australia has been an enormous success that is being undermined by those promoting this change. Infrastructure Australia was a part of the creation of the new infrastructure department, and my appointment as Australia's first ever infrastructure minister was a recognition that you need integrated plans because there are interrelationships between transport, energy, water and communications, and you need a body which is able to examine those issues.


The Treasurer was right at the G20, but it is hard to believe his sincerity when the government of which he is a part is dismantling the existing evidence-based system for making decisions about infrastructure investment. It is time to stop the charade and go back to the drawing board via a full inquiry by the House of Representatives committee. That would enable proper analysis and proper input from the business and research communities to ensure that we get the right outcomes through proper legislation, and if amendments that are of merit need to be considered the opposition is certainly prepared to do that. What we are not prepared to do is exclude entire classes of transport or infrastructure developments and remove the transparency provisions that are currently there in the Infrastructure Australia legislation. I commend the motion to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-03-03,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (11:12):  I listened to the shadow minister and member for Grayndler with great interest. Part (1)(b)(i) of his motion says that the investment infrastructure makes a vital contribution to economic growth. Yes, we agree with that. It says there is broad support in the House for:


(i) the principle that infrastructure priorities should be developed by experts, based on the benefit to the national economy;


Of course, we all agree with those words but it is worthwhile having a look at what happened over the previous six years and then understanding the reason why we need this change. The first exhibit I will give is the train wreck of the NBN. So far, we have seen after six years of promises just a three per cent rollout. That has cost the taxpayer $7 billion. This is a project that is hopelessly behind schedule and hopelessly over budget. This was a project with the biggest infrastructure spend we had seen under the previous Labor government, and yet it did not have any of the required cost-benefit analysis that we have talked about. It did not have any of the transparency that the former minister talked about. The NBN is the greatest example of why the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill is needed and why this motion should be rejected. One of the great reasons the so-called experts put forward for having an NBN was that we were going to become a gigabit nation. A press release from 19 April says:


Australia will become a Gigabit Nation before the end of the year …


Can you guess how many end-users in fact connected to this so-called 'gigabit nation'? The answer is zero: not one single customer took up the offering of the NBN. We were told that it was important that the NBN be rolled out so that the connection speed could go to 250 megabits. But can you guess how many customers have signed up for the NBN's 250 megabits? The answer is one: one single customer.


A further example of the former government's infrastructure problems is the great Epping-to-Parramatta rail link. It was promised in 2010 with great hoopla and publicity, but it was never among the national infrastructure priorities. It was simply an example of pork-barrelling: the former Labor government's rolling out a project for political ends and not for the sake of what the country needs.


We only have to look at what the Australian National Audit Office said about Labor's infrastructure expenditure. In 2010 its report found that Labor had handed $2.2 billion in taxpayers' funds to eight infrastructure projects which its own advisers had questioned as economically unviable or not ready to proceed. This is what happened under the previous Labor government. But do not take my word for it; take the word of Lindsay Tanner, the former finance minister, who attacked his former colleagues and said that they were ignoring the national interest and handing out infrastructure spending irrespective of merit, for political rather than economic gain. Such are the reasons that change is needed.


Another great example of the former government's problems with infrastructure is the Moorebank Intermodal project. Treasury and Infrastructure Australia criticised the former Labor government's plans. They said that the private sector was organised and ready to start but that the former government knew better and wanted to do it itself using public money rather than private money. The government's analysis of the project was completely flawed in many ways. I will go through a few of them in the time left.


Firstly, the government's analysis completely overestimated the growth in the number of containers in Sydney. Between the years 2000 and 2008 there was a very large increase—around eight per cent per annum—in the number of containers in Sydney, and the former Labor government forecast that the same rate of growth would go on forever. But that is not what has happened; the forecast growth has not occurred. There are many reasons for this. One is that the goods that people are buying are becoming smaller. Take books—many people are now buying online books rather than traditional books. Look at how computers are decreasing in size. Compare the size of a flat-screen TV to the old-fashioned-style TV. Many of the goods we are buying are coming down in size. But this was not thought through by the previous government, so they panicked and said, 'We need an intermodal terminal in Western Sydney.'


Secondly, the intermodal concept itself is flawed. The concept is that you put on rail a container which arrives at the port in Sydney, and you take it out to Western Sydney and distribute it from there. I often hear the former minister say that the intermodal project would take trucks off the road. That would be true if the containers ended up in a great big hole where the intermodal terminal was, but the fact is that the goods in the containers would end up going by road anyway unless there were a rail siding next to each of the warehouses where the containers were being unloaded. So an intermodal terminal would not remove trucks from the roads; at best it could reduce the distances that a truck needed to travel by road. That is why it is very important to do an analysis of where the containers would end up before the goods in them were distributed. Guess what? In the former government's analysis, this simply has not been done. What we heard from the former minister was how wonderful all of Labor's plans were, but no analysis was done of where those containers actually go today. I have arranged for that analysis to be done; if we look at it, the market has simply rejected the Liverpool and Moorebank area as a point to distribute containers.


If we look at the map, the majority of Sydney's containers go to the Eastern Creek area. There are 890 TEU movements from that Eastern Creek area, and that is 25 kilometres from where this Moorebank intermodal is going to be located. So why wouldn't you locate—if you are having an intermodal in Western Sydney, you need to have it located where the containers actually end up. There is no point putting it on a rail link, only to have to unload it there and still truck it 25 kilometres away. But, unfortunately, that is what this plan from the previous Labor government does. We also have the Enfield intermodal opening up in the coming months. It will capture anything inland back to the coast from Moorebank. So the whole area around Moorebank has been rejected by the market, and the reason it has been rejected by the market is simply because it is a bad location to distribute containers from. We have the Copeland Road section of the Hume Highway in Liverpool—one of the worst black spots in the country, as identified by the NRMA.


The other thing the previous government failed to do with their infrastructure planning is to look at where the containers need to go tomorrow. And if you look at the plans for Sydney, we have a Western Sydney area of economic development: we have an economic zone there, we have an area of development to the south, an area of development to the north. There are 500,000 residences aimed to go in that area—that is almost half the size of Brisbane—with Badgerys Creek in the middle. If we are going to build an intermodal, the ideal spot in Western Sydney is Badgerys Creek, but unfortunately the previous government's plans never even looked at that.


One of the other real concerns I have is their analysis of the pollution, which was another thing that was done very poorly. Yes, when we put a container on rail rather than road, we burn less diesel fuel. The problem is that when we burn that diesel fuel in the existing locomotives, the particulate matter that those diesel trains spew out, as compared to a modern truck, is actually five to 10 to almost 20 times greater. So we are not going to reduce pollution; this will increase the amount of particulate pollution in Western Sydney, and particulate pollution is the pollution that kills. Overall, it is very important—the previous government's analysis of infrastructure spending was neither transparent nor independent. That is why the change is needed, and that is what this change will do. That is why this motion should be rejected, and the bill should be passed. (Time expired)

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (11:22):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Hughes, and it was particularly useful for me to listen to his contribution to this debate, and—




Mr Craig Kelly:
  Listen and learn, listen and learn!




Mr GILES:
  I did do a bit of learning; I have learnt a lot about Sydney's intermodal freight needs. But before the member for Hughes turned to that matter, he went through a number of examples with which he found fault going to the previous government's management of significant infrastructure projects. While I do not agree with the conclusions he drew, it is hard to understand that contribution as being anything other than a contribution in support of the principles underpinning this motion—that is, the call for a greater degree of transparency and more evidence as the basis in the rollout of significant infrastructure projects; the call for the principles set out in the member for Grayndler's motion.


Moving on to that motion, I am always grateful for any opportunity to speak on infrastructure provision, and I am particularly grateful to be able to support this important motion moved by the member for Grayndler. I am passionate about infrastructure, and to this extent I am pleased that our Prime Minister wishes to be known as the 'infrastructure Prime Minister', although this does seem to be something of a vain hope with regard to his form. This is a government that says one thing and then does another, and that is clearly demonstrated at the heart of this debate by its rhetorical claim going to the bill that is the subject of this motion—that is, the claim that it would strengthen Infrastructure Australia when its entire concept is to do the reverse. Labor is the party of nation building; it is what we do. From the Fisher government and the aged care pension through to Medicare, through to superannuation and, indeed, the National Broadband Network.


On the National Broadband Network, we are the party of infrastructure, the party of building the future—investing and improving the circumstances in which people work and live their lives; through building a stronger and more productive national economy. Labor in government turned around infrastructure neglect. We were 20th of the 25 OECD nations in terms of infrastructure investment when we came to government in 2007, the government preceding us being one in which our current Prime Minister was a senior minister, along with the Deputy Prime Minister, the now Minister for Infrastructure—but perhaps more on his contribution later. We are now first on the list of infrastructure investment, but sadly it seems not for long. As Paul Keating said:



W
hen you change the government, you change the countr
y



In terms of major infrastructure decision making this is perhaps doubly true. These changes will have a lasting impact. So much for the concerns expressed for intergenerational equity by members opposite, especially for those who live in our major cities and their outer suburbs. On the other hand Labor has shown itself to be committed to an evidence based approach to shaping how we will live and work—more productively, more sustainably—and to building stronger communities. For these purposes Labor, when they were in government, established Infrastructure Australia as a major priority, and supported this body. Under Minister Albanese, the member for Grayndler—a minister committed to the infrastructure agenda—we did not just get Infrastructure Australia to audit our infrastructure needs; we funded those projects. We listened to the experts, or the 'so called experts' in the words of the member for Hughes, and then responded. 


On the other hand, our current Prime Minister wrote in his book Battlelines of 'kings in their cars'. This perhaps sums up this governments approach to this debate, a triumph of the 'I reckon' school of public policy making—working hand in hand with its two coalition parties; the ideologically blinkered who simply cannot abide public transport; and the National Party, the party that brought us the regional rorts. This is a world view of haves and have-nots, for there to be kings in their cars there must also be serfs; those in public transport it appears are condemned to be second-class citizens.


Since the last election things have changed for the worse. I refer members opposite to the abolition of the Major Cities Unit, and the apparent end of the National Urban Policy Forum—I say apparent, because we do not know the future of this important body. This is not only a government that is allergic to independent expert advice but one that was addicted to secrecy. This debate today brings these two unfortunate traits together. It was timely that I received Infrastructure Australia's Urban transport strategy document in the mail last week; and I hope members opposite have read it carefully, including the member for Corangamite. It sets out well the challenges of an urban transport infrastructure strategy, as well as reminding us of the reason for increases in public transport patronage, and concerns in transport equity, it states that we must:


Recognise that the Commonwealth has a role in influencing the quality of planning in our major cities, investing in urban transport infrastructure, and encouraging a consistent national approach to decisions on urban transport.


If only. I remind members opposite of the Melbourne Metro project, so important that people right across the city are crying out for increased capacity in our rail network, including patrons on the South Morang and Hurstbridge lines. There is a better way. (Time expired)

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (11:27):  The Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill will strengthen the role of Infrastructure Australia. It will make Infrastructure Australia independent and transparent, and these are important principles of government about which Labor should be concerned—and clearly we are seeing Labor is not concerned. It is disappointing that the member for Grayndler, in moving this motion, cannot see the wood from the trees when it comes to these important principles. 


Infrastructure Australia's current governance structure inhibits its independence in their advice to governments. The direct line of reporting, between the Infrastructure Coordinator and the minister, places significant power in the hands of one person, rather than the Infrastructure Australia Council. Infrastructure Australia was largely answerable to one person, the former infrastructure minister, the member for Grayndler. No wonder he is opposing these changes. Reshaping Infrastructure Australia as an independent statutory authority, governed by a board, with a CEO who reports to the board, enhances the governance of this organisation. The proposal by the member for Grayndler that this bill be referred to a House of Representatives standing committee is futile and obstructive. As the member should know, the bill is already before the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, which is due to report on 17 March.


Our bill also ensures that infrastructure projects are prioritised according to their capacity to contribute to improved productivity. This is so important for our nation and this is one element of our changes which is advancing the cause of the national interest. As the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out just this week, Labor's road and rail funding projects, its wasteful response to the global financial crisis and its infrastructure election promises were all announced without being fully assessed by Infrastructure Australia. Labor completely sidelined proper process. It made a mockery of the organisation that it itself established. We heard from the member for Scullin on the NBN, a $78 billion white elephant which has become an absolute basket case under Labor. And guess what: one of our biggest infrastructure projects in this nation was never referred to Infrastructure Australia.


Our focus on economic growth and productivity is critical. This helps our cities and regions to grow and prosper. Yes, the Prime Minister is proudly 'Australia's infrastructure Prime Minister'. In my electorate there is a powerhouse of major infrastructure projects underway, in partnership with the Victorian government. There is the $171 million duplication of the Princes Highway between Waurn Ponds and Winchelsea. The planning is underway, and we have brought forward some money in the budget for the $515 million duplication of the next section of this road, from Winchelsea to Colac. Work on the $4.8 billion regional rail link is well underway, and that is going to be a great boon for commuters in my region, in Geelong. 


Of course, there are two critical infrastructure projects in my region which Labor is very unfortunately opposing. The first is our $50 million upgrade of the Great Ocean Road—an iconic road that is so critical for jobs, for tourism and for our regional economy. This road is the centrepiece of our regional tourism industry, which is contributing $2.1 billion to the Australian economy, something that Labor does not seem to be too concerned about. We are proudly starting to deliver on this project. The other critical project for our region is the East West Link. Our government has committed $1.5 billion. Stage 1 of this project will create more than 3,200 jobs during construction and, for the several thousand people of my electorate who commute to Melbourne each day, this will put an end to the highway that becomes a car park in many places during peak hour. It is another critically important infrastructure project for our region. 


Our government is proudly delivering $342 million in the Community Development Grants Program and we are rolling out our National Stronger Regions Fund—$200 million a year for five years. This shows an unbelievable commitment to the regions, particularly in relation to community infrastructure. We are very proud of our commitments to infrastructure.

It is the annual Cyprus wine festival that is conducted by the Cypriot community of Melbourne, Victoria. This particular festival was the 20th anniversary. Its aim is to promote Cypriot food and wine to the broader community, including Cypriot culture.


The motto of the wine festival, which you are all very familiar with now, is that if you drink wine, you will have long and good health, inserting the other platitude: excellence in moderation is very important if you want a long life and good health. 


Cypriots are very proud of their winemaking history. They are also proud of the wonderful food that is always on offer when I and many other guests attend these functions. 


The Cypriot Wine Festival was very well attended on Saturday night. There was a cross-group of first-generation Australians of Cypriot background with their grandparents and their grandchildren. The beauty of it being at the South Wharf for the first time meant that it was available for a greater audience to participate in.

 (
Bruce
) (
16:45
):


I rise this afternoon to speak on the grievance debate and to make some points regarding the issue of the Australian aid budget, particularly Australia's contribution to two international initiatives, which I think are of tremendous significance in terms of providing real concrete and effective aid to those in the world who are most in need. I refer particularly to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, commonly known as the GAVI, and also Australia's commitment to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tb and Malaria.





We are a wealthy, prosperous nation and a generous nation. Australia certainly has a significant role as a global player in doing what we can to help stamp out poverty. If we just look at the immediate Asia-Pacific region, we have some 740 million living in extreme poverty—some 60 per cent of the world's undernourished. The numbers have halved since 1990, but there is still much more work to do.





The circumstances around the debate around foreign aid in recent times is that it was a consensus around the question of meeting the millennium development goals. However, in the lead-up to the last election there were changes—there were changes by the then government of which I was proud to be a member—and subsequently significant changes, drastic changes, on behalf of this coalition government.





I refer to a number of those changes in terms of an article which came out in 
The


Sydney Morning Herald


earlier this year
:





The federal government will slash Australia's contribution to global initiatives to tackle climate change, health and sanitation crises in developing countries as part of its $650 million cuts to foreign aid.





The cuts, announced on Saturday, will strip almost $250 million in funding from the Asia-Pacific region and south Asia, despite Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's assurances that Australia will renew its foreign aid focus on the region.





Plan International said the timing of the cuts was almost as damaging as the cuts themselves, given the 2013-14 financial year is already more than 10 months underway.





It goes on:





The government will cut $61 million comes from the Pacific region, with only Nauru
—





escaping cuts.





Australia will also cut $116 million in planned expenditure from East Asia, including $59 million from Indonesia, $71 million from South and West Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, $113 million from Africa and the Middle East and $5.3 million from Latin America and the Caribbean.





Australia spent $3747 million in international aid in 2012-13, and Labor had budgeted for this to increase to $4223.5 million this financial year.





But 10 months into the financial year, the government released its revised 2013-14 foreign aid spending on Saturday, showing it will spend $3598 million this financial year. This is $625.5 million less than Labor's predicted spending and $149 million less than last year's spending.

Australia will cut $75.4 million from humanitarian, emergency and refugees programs, including $8.5 million from the International Committee of the Red Cross, $4 million from planned donations to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and $1 million from the United Nations Peacekeeping Fund.


It will also cut $23.9 million from UN, Commonwealth and other international organisations, including $6 million from the United Nations Development Programme, $4.2 million from UNICEF, and $3.4 million from the World Health Organisation.


Two days before the September election, the Coalition announced it would no longer commit to a timeline for Australia to contribute 0.5 per cent of its gross national income to overseas aid, which was part of Australia's commitment to the Millennium Development Goals.



As you can see, these reductions are significant—and they are not just numbers. They are about people's lives. They are about helping those in international communities who are very desperate and in a situation where they are in real need. The plea that I make today is that, given this is what is happening and it is the way that it is, there are some aid programs that surely even this government will recognise as performing well and providing real assistance that is going to make a real difference to thousands and thousands of lives. I mentioned those two programs before.


GAVI is a public-private global health partnership committed to reducing the number of children dying, by increasing immunisation access in the poorest of countries. Around seven million children die every year, mostly from preventable diseases such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria. Two things need to be done to stop this happening: vaccinate against dangerous diseases and strengthen the capacity of local integrated health systems so they in turn might be able to manage their own disease prevention treatment systems.


GAVI works through four methods. First, it works with recipient governments to build political will for vaccines. Second, it assists the country in strengthening its health systems so it is capable of delivering immunisations and other health services. Third, it ensures funding from donor countries and sustains co-financing of vaccines by recipient countries. Fourth, it shapes the global market for vaccines to make sure there is an adequate supply of vaccines at sustainable prices for developing countries.


GAVI has immunised over half a billion children. On AusAID's multilateral scorecard in 2012 GAVI was ranked 'very strong' or 'strong' against all assessment components in the effectiveness category. GAVI has also been endorsed by the current foreign minister. On 14 February this year in a speech at the ANU she said:


I am really impressed with the change in thinking of a number of multi-lateral organisations. GAVI for example, its international finance facility for immunisation is using capital markets to create new funding for its work. The finance facility uses donor funds as collateral to issue bonds on the capital market, these bonds generate funds that are then used to finance crucial immunisation programs. That is the kind of thinking we need, get away from the old models of government handouts because ultimately our overseas aid is an investment in our region, an investment in the people, an investment in the future and we expect sold returns from that investment.


I had the privilege of travelling to Myanmar in late 2012 to see GAVI programs in action on the spot, and that is exactly what we saw. We saw good work being done. We saw people being helped. We saw capacity-building and, through that and through the nature of the financing mechanisms, we saw dollars that were donated effectively multiplying and that multiplication saving lives. So I urge the government to consider the question of Australia's commitment to GAVI in the future.


In 2011, under the then Labor government, Australia made a pledge of $200 million, which covered the next three years. However, there is a need for a further commitment now, and that commitment needs to be undertaken. I urge the government to commit an extra $75 million over 2014 and 2015 to ensure that the fantastic work of GAVI can continue.


I also mentioned the global fund, and I will speak briefly on that. The global fund does excellent work on the questions of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. To provide an example I quote again from a document regarding the work that is occurring in Papua New Guinea:


Duba, like many others, is a testimony of the TB program implementation in Papua New Guinea's Western Province.


In February 2012, five year old Duba was admitted to Daru General Hospital with an enlarged spleen and his parents were slowly losing hope that he would live. During that time the TB Program was picking up phase with the upgrading of Daru General Hospital.


A Gene X-pert machine and a digital X-ray machine were put in place by AusAID and Duba underwent Multi Drug Resistant-TB testing. He was diagnosed with MDR-TB, however, Duba's case is a primary infection meaning that his family doesn't have a TB history.


Duba commenced treatment right away and his treatment duration like any other MDR-TB case is for 2 years. Now one year and three months on, Duba is enjoying life like any other normal kid. He still has some more months to complete his treatment. We are proud of his treatment success so far and he will have a story to tell when he grows older.


The fact is that, when we look at these particular diseases, we see that 3.5 million people are killed annually by HIV-AIDS, TB or malaria. Although improvements have been made, there is a risk to our investments if these diseases are allowed to gain a foothold once again.


On 3 December 2014 Australia made a pledge of $200 million for 2014-16, and I welcome it. However, it falls roughly halfway to what is needed to maintain the growth that is required to actually conquer these diseases. The program that is in place and the aims of the global fund require that growth. They require it from a range of donor nations. Our role and the money we provide will have a multiplier effect with regard to the actions of the United States in particular but also others. Dr Mark Dybul, the fund's executive director, makes a very valid point: 'We can invest now or pay forever.'


So I urge the government to look to consider supplementing the $200 million they have provided and go to the question of $400 million, which is what is actually needed. I note that the 20th International AIDS Conference will be in Melbourne in July this year. I think it is important to send a message at such a conference that that is the commitment we make to the international community and that we recognise that there is a great need there. These programs are examples of international aid that work; they are programs which I would urge the government to get behind. They are examples of where a few more dollars in a large program budget can actually make a real difference. It is something that needs to be considered. It is aid that will save lives. It will save lives in the region; it will save lives all around the world. I urge the government to consider these matters incredibly seriously.
