"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2000-06-22,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 1, 2 and 3 standing in my name for the next day of sitting for the disallowance of the Health Insurance Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 6) as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 343; Health Insurance 1999-2000, Diagnostic Imaging Services Table Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1) as contained in Statutory Rules 1999 No. 345; and Health Insurance Determination HS/6/1999 made under subsection 3C(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee's correspondence concerning these instruments.
Leave granted.
The correspondence read as follows—

Dear Minister

·	Health Insurance (1999-2000 Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 1999 No. 345
Statutory Rules 1999 No.343
These Statutory Rules extend for a further year the period within which Medicare benefits may be payable for certain R-type diagnostic imaging services.  As the Explanatory Statement points out, item 2 of Schedule 1 extends for one year a sunset provision originally specified in paragraph 16B(11)(d) of the Health Insurance Act 1973.  But the Statement also notes that the sunset date was originally 1 January 1997, and that it has now been extended to 1 January 2001.  The Statement further observes that the sunset period has been extended `until new arrangements can be implemented'.  The Committee would appreciate your advice as to the nature of such new arrangements, and whether there will be a further need in twelve months time to extend the deadline once again.
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 345
Regulation 2 provides, among other things, that the amendments made by Schedule 1 to these Regulations commenced, retrospectively, on 1 November 1999.  The Explanatory Statement notes that the reason for this retrospectivity is to correct a `drafting error' in the Principal Regulations.  However, the Statement does not specify that no person (other than the Commonwealth) will be adversely affected by this retrospectivity.  The Committee would appreciate your assurance that no-one has been adversely affected, in order to be certain that these amendments are not rendered ineffective by subsection 48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 February 2000 concerning Health Insurance Regulations 1999 (No. 6), Statutory Rules 1999 No. 343 and Health Insurance (1999-2000 Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 1999 No. 345.
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 343
In relation to the Health Insurance Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 6), Statutory Rules 1999 No. 343, you sought advice as to the nature of the new arrangements referred to in the Regulations. You also queried whether the deadline would need to be extended in a further twelve months.
By way of background, the Health Insurance Act 1973 provides two exemptions that allow General Practitioners (GPs) to provide specialist-type (R-type) diagnostic imaging services under the Medicare Benefits Scheme. A remote area exemption was introduced in 1990 to ensure the access and equity of diagnostic imaging services provided to patients by practitioners located outside a 30km radius of another imaging practice.
A pre-existing diagnostic imaging practices exemption was introduced in 1990 for a three-year period on the understanding that a Continuing Medical Education and Quality Assurance (CME & QA) program would be developed for GPs providing diagnostic imaging services. This exemption contains a sunset clause enabling it to be further extended, and so far it has been extended seven times pending the development of the CME and QA program, the latest extension being the one referred to your committee.
Progress on the development of the CME and QA program by the industry associations was slow. However, once agreement was reached, the Health Insurance Amendment (Diagnostic Imaging Services) Bill 1999 was introduced into the House of Representatives. This requires that GPs providing services under either exemption be participating in the CME & QA program.
As the Bill was not passed by the Senate before the latest sunset clause expired, there was a need to extend the clause until 1 January 2001. Providing the Bill is passed this year, there will be no need to extend the clause any further.
Statutory Rules 1999 No. 345
In relation to the Health Insurance (1999-2000 Diagnostic Imaging Services Table) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 1) Statutory Rules 1999 No. 345, you have sought assurance that no-one has been adversely affected by the retrospectivity of the proposed amendment.
As you are aware, the regulations were amended in September 1999 to allow the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) to finalise the lodgement of statutory declarations in respect of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) equipment by introducing a cut-off date.
A drafting error occurred in the November 1999 reprint of the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table that extended the cut-off date to providers, as well as equipment. As it was never intended to `lock-out' new providers, this error was rectified at the earliest opportunity. The retrospectivity of the amendment is to ensure any providers who may have sought eligibility in the period between 1 November 1999 and 1 February 2000 are not disadvantaged. ·	
I hope that this information is of assistance to you.
Yours sincerely

CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Health Insurance Determination HS/6/1999 made under subsection 3C(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 which makes minor changes to the arrangements for the payment of Medicare benefits for a specific service.
The Explanatory Statement to this Determination asserts that “Medicare funding for the procedure [listed in the Schedule] will be provided on an interim basis, and its continuation will be subject to a 95 per cent compliance rate with quality assurance activities implemented by the [Royal Australasian] College [of Surgeons].  The outcomes of these activities will be reviewed in 12 months to determine whether interim funding for the procedure is still appropriate.”  However, there is no provision to this effect in the Determination itself.  The closest that the Determination appears to get to such an outcome is in clause 3, under which “This determination will cease to have effect on 1 November 2004.”  
The Committee would therefore appreciate your advice as to what legislative basis there is for the assertion made in the Explanatory Statement.
Yours sincerely

Dear Helen
Thank you for your letter of 9 March 2000 concerning Health Insurance Determination HS/6/1999.
The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has correctly noted that there is no regulatory basis for the review and potential withdrawal of funds for the procedure covered by Determination HS/6/1999, endoluminal grafting of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Given the complex issues involved in the provision of the service, including its life-saving potential in some circumstances, I have elected to rely on policy rather than regulatory mechanisms to maximise flexibility in determining an appropriate basis for funding the procedure in the. future.
The Medicare Services Advisory Committee will advise me in 12 months time on, among other things, the level of compliance with a clinical audit currently being piloted by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. The audit is strongly supported by the College and endovascular surgeons. Notwithstanding, the audit is one of the first such comprehensive quality assurances activities conducted in Australia for new surgical procedures, and its feasibility and value are yet to be established.
All subsection 3C(1) Determinations are reviewed and remade on an annual basis primarily to keep pace with fee indexation pertaining to items listed on the Medicare Benefit Schedule. I have the discretion to amend or withdraw Determinations at this point, or indeed at any time deemed appropriate to address policy concerns as they arise.
I hope this information clarifies the Committee's understanding of the approach adopted with respect to these funding arrangements. Thank you for your vigilance and interest in this issue.
With kind regards,
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letter dated 5 April 2000 relating to the Committee's concerns with Health Insurance Determination HS/6/1999.
The Committee understands that following the review of the provision of the service covered by this Determination, you will have the discretion to amend or withdraw the fee for this service and that such determination is made through a disallowable instrument that is subject to scrutiny by this Committee. ·	
The Committee would therefore appreciate confirmation of its view that any exercise of your discretion in this instance will be made through a disallowable instrument.
The Committee would appreciate your response as soon as possible as this Determination is subject to a notice of disallowance that will expire on 26 June 2000.

Dear Helen
Thank. you for your letter of 13 April 2000 concerning Health Insurance Determination HS/6/1999, I sincerely apologise for the delay in responding. 
Your letter relates to previous correspondence with the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in regard to this Determination, which provides for funding for the procedure endoluminal grafting for abdominal aortic aneurysm. The Committee has now asked for confirmation of its view that any such exercise of my discretion to withdraw or amend this instrument would be made through a further disallowable instrument.
As you will be aware, this Determination was made under Section 3C of the Health Insurance Act 1973, which, however, makes no provision for revocation or amendment of such instruments. Therefore, exercise of my discretion to do so would be made under Section 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which provides that it may be exercised “in like manner” to the power to make the original instrument.
The Committee is correct in its view that any amendments to, or revocation of, Health Insurance Determination HS/6/1999 would be made by a further disallowable instrument in that the original instrument is itself a disallowable instrument.
If the Committee wishes to find out more about the background to or the particulars of this instrument or the procedure for which it provides funding, the contact in my Department is Mr Damian Coburn, Director, Health Technology Assessment on (02) 6289 6812.
Thank you for your continuing vigilance and interest in this issue.

That the Senate take note of the report of the Community Affairs Legislation Committee.
I wish to speak to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report tabled today by Senator Calvert on behalf of Senator Knowles. It includes a unanimous report from the committee expressing very serious concern about the failure of the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the Minister for Aged Care, but particularly the Minister for Aged Care, to answer questions that were placed on notice or were asked at the estimates committee by members of the committee. I want to congratulate Senator Knowles for her assistance in this matter. She has proved to be a good chair in assisting the committee to get answers to questions. She has been proactive in making sure the committee's work was able to proceed with a degree of efficiency by applying pressure to ensure that we got answers to questions. I want to record my thanks for Senator Knowles's assistance in that. But there have been extensive delays in getting meaningful answers from the Minister for Aged Care as part of the estimates process.
It was frustrating to find at the 2 May hearing, following the events at Riverside, that the department was unprepared to answer many of the questions asked about the nursing home and the government's intervention in the nursing home. A commitment was given to provide written responses to questions taken on notice as soon as possible. A total of 83 questions were outstanding at the end of that hearing. At the start of the committee hearing on 23 May, 70 responses to those questions had been provided to the minister by the department, but only seven of those had been passed on to the committee. After the committee expressed some concern at the hold-up at the minister's office—and Senator Knowles took it upon herself to seek further information—the minister's office was suddenly able to produce 60 of those answers within the day. They had been sitting in the Minister for Aged Care's office for some time but had not been provided to the committee. I want to make it clear that the department had provided the minister's office, within a very reasonable time frame, with most of the answers, but they had not been cleared by the minister's office and had not been made available to the committee.
Included in those answers were answers to questions asked at the 7 February hearing. I was still receiving responses to questions asked on 2 May yesterday, and some are outstanding. Unfortunately, it seems that it is only when a deadline approaches—and when there is an understanding that a fuss is going to be made and some publicity given to the matter—that we get any answers to very serious questions about serious matters of public concern. What is of most concern to me today is what we do not know about Riverside Nursing Home and what we do not know about the government's intervention in the Riverside Nursing Home. The minister and the department, on her instructions, have repeatedly refused to answer questions on just what the minister was told about Riverside and when she was told. ·	
We still do not know when the Minister for Aged Care was first told about the serious risks to residents identified in the first report on the nursing home. We still do not know when the minister was first told about the death of a resident following the kerosene bath incident. We still do not know when the minister was first told about the serious risks to residents identified in the second report on the nursing home. Instead of an answer, all the parliament and the Australian public got was this response: `The minister and her office were appropriately briefed at all times.' That is just not satisfactory. The Australian public have a right to know what was involved in the intervention in Riverside, why the decisions were taken and why those residents had to experience that terrible stress and trauma. We have been unable to get proper answers from the minister's office or from the department as to the events at Riverside, as to the knowledge of the minister and as to the sequence of events. We do know there are a number of contradictions in the minister's version of events. The answers to some of the outstanding questions may well resolve many of those inconsistencies, but I am not sure that is the case.
The Minister for Aged Care claims not to have been first told about the risks to residents until some time after 22 February, despite having ordered an inspection of Riverside on 15 February and having come into the parliament to express her serious concerns. We are expected to believe she was uninterested in knowing about the residents for at least seven days after first being told that they had been bathed in kerosene. We are expected to believe she did not inquire and did not receive a report from her department as to the condition of the residents and the circumstances at Riverside. The minister claims that she did not know about the risks to residents until after a decision on the sanctions to be imposed on the nursing home was made on 22 February. The minister has claimed that she referred the events of Riverside to the Federal Police as soon as she became aware of the death. We now know the referral occurred only on 29 February. From the evidence of the department, the minister may have known about the death and the serious risks to residents as early as 19 February, but we still do not know when she knew or why she was not told, if she was not. But, if she was told on 19 February, this is at least three days earlier than claimed by the minister, and this predates the decision to impose sanctions. This is at least 10 days before the matter was referred to the Federal Police.
Having heard of the death and the risks to residents, what was the minister doing in the 10 days before the matter was finally referred to the police? Why didn't the minister immediately refer the death to the appropriate authorities—the Victorian coroner and the Victorian police? The minister has tried to use the pending court case from the former owners of Riverside on the closure as a defence against providing full information, but I think the minister has to be accountable for her actions to the parliament. She has to be accountable to the people of Australia, and she should provide answers to these critical questions about the events at Riverside. To date, we do not have satisfactory answers, and we have a refusal by the minister and the department to answer many of the key questions.
Clearly, in the case of Riverside, the timing of the minister's briefing is an important part of making a judgment about how she handled the case at Riverside—whether it was handled appropriately, whether alternative options could have been pursued and whether or not those frail and elderly people were properly treated by the Commonwealth government. The minister has made a number of claims about when she was told about events in the nursing homes. We ought to be able to verify that that information is factual. Certainly the families of the residents of Riverside have a range of questions that have been unanswered about the treatment of their relatives, and they will continue to pursue answers to these very important questions. The opposition will also support them in seeking those answers.
What we finally did get yesterday in one of the answers to questions on notice was access to the Aged Care Standards Agency's report on Riverside made in November 1999. It has taken until now, until June 2000, to get access to the report on Riverside which the agency completed in November 1999. The minister claimed in the parliament that that report gave the nursing home at Riverside the all clear. She claimed that, following the unsatisfactory report in July 1999, the nursing home had been monitored and brought up to scratch.  ·	
What we now know, after finally gaining access to this report, is that the minister's claims were untrue. The report shows that the nursing home had still not reached appropriate care standards six months after the problems had been identified. The November report indicates that:
The care plan system is ineffective in ensuring that residents receive adequate clinical care.
It found, on the key question of residents' care, that the performance of Riverside was unsatisfactory. Other problems were identified which led the standards agency to conclude:
This practice does not ensure that residents receive consistent clinical care.
So you had a very highly critical report of the Riverside Nursing Home available in November last year, yet the minister said in the parliament that the nursing home had been brought up to scratch and that it was operating satisfactorily. This report, finally released for the first time yesterday, proves that not to be the case. That means there are even more unanswered questions about the effectiveness of the monitoring of nursing homes in this country. How is it that a nursing home that had been proved to be unsatisfactory was allowed to continue to operate without the sort of supervision that would have prevented the kerosene bath incidents that occurred and the other mistreatment and lack of care of the residents at Riverside that were revealed in the reports in February?
There are a whole range of questions about the handling of the Riverside intervention that need to be answered. Unfortunately, we do not have those answers yet. The estimates process has been frustrated and the minister and the department have refused to provide full information. But I and the families will continue the pressure to ensure that we do get the full picture, because the Australian parliament and the Australian people deserve a much better explanation; they deserve answers to those very important questions.

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-06-22,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report of the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee.
I want to make a few remarks going to the issue of commercial-in-confidence. At the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee estimates hearings, Telstra, an agency of the Commonwealth and still 51 per cent owned by the Commonwealth, were asked to provide details of contracts, specifically the nature, duration and value of contracts between Telstra and Leightons Holdings and any subsidiaries of Leightons Holdings. They were initially asked that question in early May at supplementary additional estimates and they took it on notice.
About an hour before the more recent estimates commenced, Telstra provided a written response to the committee in response to questions asked by me saying that they would not provide the information as requested on the basis that it was commercial-in-confidence. They would be willing to provide that information to the committee on the condition that it was received on that basis. That means that there are some implications for senators accepting that commission. When the Telstra Corporation came in later in the afternoon, we had a rather lengthy and robust discussion with them as to their right to refuse to provide to senators and members of parliament details of contracts between them and subsidiary and alternative companies. It should be noted that we were not seeking details of past contracts; we simply wanted current contracts between Telstra and Leightons Holdings. That is a matter of public interest because Mr Besley, who is chairing the current inquiry into service levels and the adequacy of service levels of Telstra around Australia, has had some interest and involvement through various corporate entities that he is involved in with the Telstra Corporation over the years.
The reason I raise this now is that the reference to that issue in the chair's draft is relatively minor and may not draw the attention it warrants. Accordingly, Labor senators were of the view that it was and is appropriate to take the somewhat unusual step of attaching a dissenting or minority report to the chair's draft going to that issue of commercial-in-confidence and increasing reliance by government agencies and departments and a series of public officials on the words `commercial-in-confidence'. Every time they are asked to provide information to senators in hearings, their reply is that the information so requested is commercial-in-confidence and cannot be provided. ·	
`Commercial-in-confidence' has a limited meaning and has had a longstanding limited role in this place. But increasingly, I observe, the role of Commonwealth agencies and Commonwealth departments is not to assist in the estimates hearings but to rely on commercial-in-confidence for reasons that are best known to themselves. The role of estimates and the role of senators in this place and of the parliament generally is to inquire, to make observations and to report on matters of public interest.
I would have thought a case involving officials of Telstra and officials of Leightons Holdings—that company and one of its senior officers being involved in a very public review which will make findings and may make recommendations, if accepted by government, that go to the disposal by Telstra of assets worth tens and tens of billions of dollars—would be a matter of public interest, would be a matter that this parliament should be and is interested in as a matter of our continued review. So, at this stage, I think it is appropriate to place on record the attitude of the relevant officers of Telstra. Their refusal of what were, in my view, legitimate requests to have access to the nature, duration and value of current contracts between Telstra and Leightons Holdings was an inadequate response and needs to be pursued in the coming weeks through actions in this chamber.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-06-22,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.
I have not received a number of responses that should have emerged from questions put during consideration of the estimates committee for the Attorney-General's portfolio. One of those responses relates to an undertaking given by the minister that the minister would take up with the Attorney-General a request that was made in the committee for the Australian Government Solicitor or Solicitor-General to provide legal advice as to the operation of the native title legislation.
I am not aware—unless someone else in the chamber is aware and can inform me—of what has happened to that request by the minister to the Attorney-General. But I take this opportunity of alerting the Senate to that fact and also to the fact that I will be pursuing the matter at some stage. It may have just been an oversight, but I certainly will be pursuing the matter. I think it is really in the interests of the government that it gets an opinion about the matter. It is to do with the 26A alternative scheme, which has been adopted by the New South Wales parliament in respect of fossicking and exploration on land having interests by native title claimants and native title holders as well as representative groups.
I just take this opportunity of marking this matter in the hope that the government will be able to get an opinion, as was requested. If it does not and the matter comes before the parliament, I may be forced to move a disallowance to any decision or determination made by the Attorney-General in respect of the New South Wales legislation, and that would not do anybody any good. So I believe that this ought to be done beforehand: get the opinion, let us have a look at it and then proceed from there.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I was talking last night about the effect that this legislation will have upon the ability of various people to communicate the message that they want to communicate to the outside world. I was pointing out that, while this legislation may be seen as giving advantage to one giant in a battle of two, nevertheless an issue of liberty remains: the right to express oneself as one would want. ·	
I was talking about the development of technology and the part that the Printing and Kindred Industries Union played in the history of media and print, in particular, in Australia. I mentioned the part that Mr Vic Little played in this area. He has been a very outstanding contributor to the community. He and his wife, Vida Little, are getting on in years now, and, unfortunately, Vic is a little unwell. He epitomises the ability that people have, if they try, to express themselves and to get matters up and going. The part he played in the Printing and Kindred Industries Union was great. He still publishes. He perhaps epitomises what we used to believe to be freedom of the press—that is, people using small presses to publish what they want. That has passed. He still gets his material together for May Day marches and other things as well. 
The Printing and Kindred Industries Union is very interesting. They do not have branches, they have chapels. `Chapel' gives the right impression in these circumstances. Publishing and the setting out of ideas has more than just a material quality about it. True enough, this bill deals with people who may get lots of money. That is the economic dimension of the bill. The bill also deals with that matter of the heart and soul, the freedom of expression. That is well summed up in the title that the PKIU uses for its branches—that is, chapels. 
When the Printing and Kindred Industries Union became part of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the then secretary allowed that union to keep the name `chapel'. The secretary then was Mr George Campbell, now Senator George Campbell. We may think of Senator Campbell as a tough, intellectual leader of working men and women, but, in addition, he has a heart of gold and a sense of tradition. 
—Senator Hutchins was similarly equipped with a heart when he so nobly led the Transport Workers Union. He would know that Senator Campbell allowed them to keep this title which expresses the spiritual quality that is contained in those connected with publishing and, in this case, in the PKIU. It has some great members and ex-members such as Kevin Davis, Ernie Jackson and Brian Smiddy. Senator Collins would know them. They have contributed mightily to the Victorian community not only in terms of the conditions and wages they were able to achieve for their members but also in terms of matters of the heart and soul. 
It is interesting to look at publishing. In 1455, Johannes Gutenberg got the first press going. The first book he published was the Bible. We know of the Gutenberg Bible. Senator McGauran would know of the Bible. I do not know whether he knows of the Gutenberg Bible, but he would certainly know of the Bible. To a certain extent, I think that reflects the idea of publishing. It was a great leap forward. Great ideas could be sent or broadcast, to use modern parlance, abroad. That broadcasting was a freeing quality. It allowed people to think and read on wider plains. 
It is very interesting to note what happened after the Gutenberg press came into being and its use spread throughout Europe and England. Mr Acting Deputy President Hogg, you will remember that we learnt about Caxton at school—or at least I did in my time; perhaps history was not part of your curriculum, because you are some years younger than me. Caxton brought the press to England. When this new technology developed, the government reacted and brought in laws to restrict the use of the press. They said, `Even though this new technology has been developed, we have to restrict it.' They seem to have restricted it for two reasons, which I spoke about earlier. The matters of the heart, as I call them, had to be restricted. In other words, there was censorship so that people could not read what they would otherwise be able to read. People were frightened of new ideas so they restricted its use. It was also restricted to ensure that one lot of people got the economic benefit of the press while others did not.  ·	
So you had monopolies set up under the Tudors. They said that only certain people should have the benefit of the press. So under regulations which were established by the Star Chamber in Queen Mary's reign, printing was restricted to people who were members of the Stationers' Company. That sort of thing led to this fight—or `struggle' might be a better word to use—for freedom of the press. There is a book I often read which has the fairly grand title of English Constitutional History: From the Teutonic Conquest to the Present Time, written by a man with the fairly grand name of Thomas Pitt Tas-well-Langmead. The `present time' he was talking about was the start of the last century. He had this to say, and I think it is worth reading in this context: 
Of the political privileges of the people acquired or enlarged since the Revolution—
and he is talking of the revolution led by Oliver Cromwell—
we have still to consider the liberty of the Press—“the guardian and guide of all other liberties”—and the last to be recognised by the State.
So the liberty of the press was the last to be accepted by the state. He goes on to talk about the various acts and laws which were passed to suppress the press. It is the sort of thing where, when everybody is feeling in the mood and wants to stand up for rights and liberties, they talk about the freedom of the press. It was not until quite late into the 19th century that freedom of the press got to the point we would find acceptable. It is interesting that the last area to be freed up was the reporting of parliamentary debates. That has an interesting history. Now of course we have freedom of the press. We have people in parliament reporting—reporting very well at times and not so well other times. There are some great figures we can all think about who presently report here—people like Alan Ramsay, whose daughter, Tosca, has every reason to be proud of her father and her mother, Laura Tingle. It is just nice to see that we have some good people doing good things here.
—Do you see what he writes about the New South Wales right wing Labor politicians? 
—Senator Hutchins has just interjected and asked whether I have seen what he writes about the right wing Labor politicians in New South Wales. I note that it is very well led by Senator Hutchins. 
—He doesn't discriminate. He writes some rough stuff about the Left too. 
—Just to balance it up, I will refer to Senator George Campbell's comment. He said that he writes some pretty rough stuff about the Left as well. I might return to the subject of the bills. In any event, this issue has come a long way since the press that Johannes Gutenberg got going. I think the principle is the same. The questions that we face here, and which have been asked by those who have given speeches before me, are the same. What do you do with new technology? Who is going to benefit from it in terms of who is going to be able to have access to what is published by the new technology and who is going to be able to use the new technology? Choices have to be made. But the present situation is like it was after the Gutenberg Press was established in Germany and after Caxton took it up in England. It is the same in the sense that the law is going to come in and say that some people will get the benefit of this particular technology and other people will not. Although it is very much an economic contest, it is not simply an economic contest. It is also a contest of how we treat ideas, how wide ideas should be able to flow, who should put them forward and who should have control over them. That is the situation here.
So the debate has flowed around the following questions: how can we hold the technology back? Can't datacasting be used to distribute more news than is presently the situation? Why do we limit datacasting? If we are going to limit datacasting, to what degree should it be limited? Those are all fundamental questions that have been around since the printing press was invented. We on this side of the chamber say that if this technology is here it should be used as widely as possible. For me to say that you cannot hold back technology is to mouth a platitude that has been mouthed again and again before me, and it is a platitude because it is true. You certainly have to have some regulations so that the material is put across properly. You have to have some sort of censorship so that there is a limit on what can be put across. They are questions that should be looked at in terms of what technology is available and in terms of ensuring that we do not hold back for whatever reasons—for economic reasons, moral reasons or ethical reasons—what we should not hold back. That is the test and that is the balance that has to be struck. ·	
The government has not achieved that balance in this case. The amendments which are being put forward on this side will achieve that balance. Debating these bills is like debating tax bills in some ways because we are talking about money and where it will go. But this talk about how matters can be published and dispersed goes to the issue of our rights and of our dignity as human beings. Publishing, writing and journalism all have an element that people always feel goes beyond the economic; often the duty they have towards the public is not discharged as well as it may be, but nevertheless it is there and I think they are noble professions. We are talking here about how we are going to limit what could otherwise be expressed. If we do that for simply economic reasons, I think we will be betraying our trust as an institution that has to look beyond the hip pocket and start to look towards the sky and the faraway hills.",SENATE,<title>DATACASTING CHARGE (IMPOSITION) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I thank my colleague Senator Cooney for those very kind words in his contribution. The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000 seeks to amend both the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992. It is acknowledged that the former establishes the ownership conditions for broadcasting licences, while the latter regulates the usage of the spectrum, including the licensing of transmitting devices. This bill is focused primarily on regulating digital television technology in an environment where the scope of this technology is still relatively unknown, both here and overseas. The question needs to be asked, `Why is the government in such a rush to push this bill through?' The length of the Senate inquiry, which was meant to enable interested parties to voice their opinion on the bill, was limited, and therefore it did not allow adequate preparation time for parties to assemble detailed responses to this bill.
The Labor Party recognises the complexity of the Australian broadcasting system. I am particularly concerned to ensure the continuing special role of the two public broadcasters: the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, better known as the ABC, and the Special Broadcasting Service, better known as SBS. The role of these public entities needs to be enhanced, with particular reference to maintaining their independence, along with a sustainable funding structure that allows the ABC and SBS to operate effectively in a rapidly changing technological environment.
There are three main tenets to this bill: datacasting, multichannelling and the use of enhanced services. This bill has many deficiencies, specifically the overly restrictive content based definition of datacasting, as well as the requirement for the ABC and SBS to pay a datacasting licence fee. The restrictions on the ABC and SBS to multichannel will also have a specific impact on rural and regional Australia, which currently have only limited access to the analog network anyway. This bill will only serve to impede the emerging digital industry in Australia.
The provision of datacasting within this technology has the means to be one of the most popular aspects of the new digital environment. However, the definition as it stands is far too restrictive, particularly as it is content based. The definition as it stands will stifle this emergent industry. The Productivity Commission in its recent report on broadcasting noted that the government's policy relating to datacasting stifles competition and innovation and is at odds with major tenets of mainstream broadcasting policy. The entry of datacasters into Australia's media landscape not only can lead to greater diversity within Australia's media industry but can bring major benefits to the economy more broadly.
This bill will stifle the emergent industry through unwarranted regulation. The impact of this bill will be negative if emergent players are restricted in adequately pursuing technological advancement, and any consequent improvements in customer service, employment and economic opportunities for the industry will be limited. These would be available and accessible if this bill were adequately altered to take into account the role that the emergent digital industry could fulfil in Australia's media landscape and the wider economy. ·	
Consider what some of these potential datacasters had to say about the unwarranted restrictions placed on them through definitional constraints and access to the types of programs that have been allowed under this bill. Optus gave evidence to the committee stating that they would be unable to transmit a full variety of programming if the legislation stayed in its current form. Telstra—and I quote from the committee's report:
... have maintained that datacasting should be defined as broadly as possible because it is a new industry that we are trying to create ... we need a definition that helps the industry emerge ... I see no reason for it to be as constrained as it is.
News Ltd said:
The bill expands what free-to-air operators can do with their spectrum, and severely limits what datacasters can do. Therefore putting free-to-air operators beyond competition.
And, lastly, Fairfax, in respect of the restrictions on datacasting of educational programs, said:
A program which may be educational in relation to interests of rural communities or interests of particular sections of city communities will not be available on datacasting, for no particular reason.
While one of our main concerns is the accessibility to this technology for the national broadcasters, it is alarming to see, as recently as last weekend, the Australian Financial Review saying:
... all the potential new entrants into digital broadcasting—including John Fairfax, News Corporation and Telstra—simultaneously withdrew from proposed trials of “datacasting”.
What is the point of promoting the technology if the government intends to stifle its use or concentrate access in the hands of a powerful few? This is one occasion when a policy of `let a thousand flowers bloom' is the best protection for the community from the abuse of monopoly power. Another issue that is of importance to datacasters and will limit their emergence is that the entertainment value of datacasting is likely to be constrained as it may be perceived to be commercially unattractive to potential datacasters. This debate is not about TV but about the real potential with this technology to bring a wide range of services to the Australian community not currently available using parallel technologies.
The degree of technological specificity of the proposed bill will in effect prevent potential datacasters keeping up with advancements as they become available. The complexity of the definition of datacasting and the use of a content- based definition will promote complexity and uncertainty in this emergent industry. These restrictions will stifle innovation and the technological opportunities for consumers alike. The inherent restrictions in a content based definition specifically concerning educational programming will harm the provision of children's programs. The value these programs have to the community in general must be recognised. And, finally, we also must question the distinction that has been made to news and current affairs programs, a distinction that is totally inappropriate. This use of a content based definition needs to be amended to remove the artificial anomalies it brings to the provision of datacasting services. On the Lateline program on 10 May 2000 industry leaders discussed this very issue with the minister. As Paul Budde, a consultant in the field, said:
Datacasting of digital television has very little to do with the old free-to-air television.
But this government seems to believe that datacasters simply strive to be broadcasters and therefore restricts them unduly and is transferring old rules that simply do not apply in this environment.
The use of a content based definition rather than there being a distinction between datacasting and broadcasting is a contentious issue. No-one has denied that these are different things. The Labor Party proposes the definition of datacasting be distinguishable from broadcasting and be worded as broadcasting being the linear, passive, scheduled production of television programs on a repeatable or ongoing basis and datacasting by reference to it not being broadcasting. Labor's definition for datacasting stipulates that a datacasting service means a service, other than a broadcasting service, that delivers information, whether in the form of data, text, speech or images or in any other form, to persons having equipment appropriate for receiving that information where the delivery of the service uses the broadcasting bands. The correct focus should be on the difference between broadcasting and datacasting. This definition allows the Australian Broadcasting Authority to distinguish clearly between a datacasting service and broadcasting service. The distinction between datacasting and broadcasting is made on the technology and the service provided, not the content, and also remains technologically neutral. There are commonalities between datacasting and broadcasting which have to be recognised. However, the service provision is different, and that also has to be recognised in this bill. ·	
The Labor Party fully support the emergence and development of a datacasting industry. Hence, we support an industry that in its beginning stages has the flexibility for new services to develop over time. However, we also support the continued role of the national broadcasters. Many people in rural and regional Australia benefit from the variety of programming. The imposition of a licensing charge on the national broadcasters would be an illogical move. For example, if the government- funded broadcasters have to pay this fee back to the government, then their funding will have to be increased to compensate them accordingly. If their funding is not increased to compensate payment of the fee then this is tantamount to a further reduction in the funding requirements of the national broadcasters. It is illogical that the ABC and SBS be charged a datacasting licensing fee.
Multichannelling by the national broadcasters is another feature of digital television that will be invaluable. The reasons this is such an important feature of this new technology are that it will allow the national broadcasters to become more cost effective in their programming and will provide a greater regional focus along with a greater multicultural focus of programming. The national broadcasters—the ABC and SBS—are in a special position to encourage the take-up of this technology; therefore, to hold them back is tantamount to setting up this technology to fail in Australia. The ABC and SBS have already stated that to allow them to multi-channel will allow them to fulfil their charters better and more comprehensively. This is not about the ABC and SBS extending their charters and competing with the commercial broadcasters; it is about the government recognising the inherently special role that the national broadcasters play. It is about ensuring that regional and rural Australia are properly catered for in the new environment. The reality is that the national broadcasters primarily serve the regions, and it is the national broadcasters that will in effect provide the best service for the bush. Therefore, it is socially and economically responsible for the national broadcasters to be given the ability to use this technology, especially datacasting and multichannelling, to fulfil their charters, particularly in regional areas.
The argument put forward by the Federation of Commercial Television Stations, FACTS, that to support the national broadcasters is tantamount to uncompetitive behaviour is an absurdity and should be refuted. The national broadcasters in no way impact on the revenue earning potential of the commercial stations. SBS occupies approximately one per cent of the advertising revenue, and obviously the ABC is not in that business at all. So, what is the competition that the commercial stations are referring to? In fact, it is the reverse, as commercial operators seek to subsume the traditional markets of the public broadcasters. The benefits to regional and rural Australia of continued support for the national broadcasters to multichannel within the constraints of their respective charters far outweigh any criticisms there may be.
It seems in respect of this bill there are many anomalies and overlaps that are not consistent with previous policy statements by the minister. This is of particular concern in respect of enhanced programming. The problem is specifically when enhanced programming may in fact overlap as multichannelling. The pay TV industry is concerned with this as they obviously do not want their industry to suffer undue competition from free-to-air broadcasters, who have also benefited from a free loan of spectrum space to engage in these services. ·	
Community broadcasters, represented by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, are also concerned, and rightly so, about the lack of provisions in their sector for digital transition. Community broadcasters occupy a necessary and relevant space, and should be treated as such. They are obviously not the same as the national broadcasters, yet should not have to face undue constraints on them. There should be legislative certainty established by the minister, rather than this haphazard way of waiting and seeing, which seems to be the case with community broadcasters in this bill.
Captioning arrangements are another facet of this bill that are necessary for people who are hearing impaired. I support the necessary improvements in captioning arrangements, particularly having led a union that had a lot of boilermakers in it—a lot of people who worked in very heavy industry, who were subjected to constant noise every day, day in, day out, over many years and many of whom suffer from hearing deficiencies in their later years. The provision of captioning arrangements allows those people to be able to access news, current affairs and other information as efficiently as do those who have not had to suffer that impact upon their hearing loss. However, in comparison to the UK and the US these arrangements do not go far enough. I recognise the difficulties for regional and rural broadcasters, but at the same time we cannot ignore the necessity of it for those who require captioning and the worth and benefit to them, and hence to the community.
Digital technology is a new technological advancement. High definition is not being used in other parts of the world. We have no benchmark to determine how successful this technology will be or how extensive its use. Therefore, the restrictions that are being placed on the emergence of this industry in Australia are incomprehensible and could effectively destroy its ability to reach its full potential. Our national broadcasters occupy a unique role, particularly in rural and regional Australia, and in some areas are one of two broadcasters and in others the sole broadcaster.
This technology has the potential to enable people in rural and regional Australia to access a diversity of information as yet unknown to them and should not be restricted as it will be if this bill goes ahead in its current format. We cannot ignore the size of this country and the isolation that is often felt by people in regional Australia, so, again, it is incomprehensible that it is these people that will suffer from the short-sighted restrictions being put forward in these bills, especially in respect of the national broadcasters.
We have continuously heard in this chamber and in the other chamber about the focus being put on the needs of people in regional and rural Australia, the needs of people in the bush, to get access to modern day communications, to have the same benefit of the communications environment that exists in the capital cities. The way in which the government is treating the introduction of digital technology, is treating the restrictions in terms of data broadcasting, will simply further impede the capacity of this parliament and further impede the capacity of companies in the communications industry to be able to provide real and lasting benefits to people in rural and regional Australia in terms of allowing them to also get maximum benefit out of the new information environment within which we live. It would be an absolute farce, another farce, to once again see the junior coalition partner—the so-called National Party of Australia; the people who purport to represent the people in the bush—go along with supporting this bill and, again, by doing so deny the opportunity for people in rural and regional Australia to have real access to real services, real technology, that would allow them to play a real part in the Australian economy and within the Australian community.",SENATE,<title>DATACASTING CHARGE (IMPOSITION) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-06-22,"—Before I go to the substantive matters that I wish to address in this debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000 this morning I also as an aside wish to give thanks for the contribution of Senator Campbell, who has coalesced some of my thoughts about the issue, particularly the issue about regional and rural Australia, when I recall my youth. We stand here on a precipice of change, a change that will come about. It will come inexorably about. It will come about despite this government's narrowmindedness about change and about how it embraces new technology and how it goes about trying to restrict what would otherwise be a very useful innovation. ·	
 In fact, when I look back, I can say that in my youth I have always been with television. The debate is not about television as such; it is about new technologies. I was born some time after television was introduced into this country in 1956, so I have always had it as background noise and as a medium to watch. One of the times that I found myself unable to watch it was in rural and regional Australia, in Cunnamulla. One of the profound things that occurred in my youth was that I ran into the living room, looking for the television, `the box', and it was not there. It was not there because, for a range of factors, technology had not been supported, pushed and delivered to regional and rural Australia. So, for a while, there was no box. When I was in Roma, the same thing occurred: colour television was upon us, and it was one of the earlier things my family purchased to ensure that we would have colour. I recall watching test patterns in colour.
Youth are interested in changing technology. The youth of today are interested not in Collins Street National Party people but in people who wish to embrace new technologies, look at change and embrace change. If you recall the need for changing technologies, the youth of today will participate and expect these types of changes. They will expect that the government of the day leads the way forward and allows new technologies to be embraced. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald headed `TV's big dollars in the balance' says:
The three big would-be datacasters, Telstra, John Fairfax and News Corp, last week attempted to place serious pressure on the Coalition, ALP and Democrats by pulling out of datacasting trials.
It is disappointing to find that datacasting as it stands is a matter that is being played with in a manner that might in fact throw it into the dustbin. The article also says:
The bottom line, however, is that Meg Lees is likely to find her position far closer to the Government's than the Opposition's.
The general belief is that she will be happy enough with amendments that allow the ABC and SBS to multi-channel (broadcast more than one channel).
I turn also to the Sydney Morning Herald of Thursday, 22 June. The headline reads `Alston to push for digital TV solution':
The Communications Minister, Senator Alston, was prepared to talk with both parties, a spokesman said last night.
It seems to be that there is at least a wish to bring about a digital revolution, to bring about new technology and to bring it about in a manner so that the youth and regional and remote Australia can access it in a meaningful way and that it is not restricted or unduly affected by legislative enactments.
We also look at the development of technology. The development of technology has not been impeded by government in any serious way. I recall when computers were first about. Having been through a generation which spans not only television but also the development of computers, my early exposure to computers themselves was about punch cards. I was part time at the Queensland Institute of Technology, where computer science and technology was being taught through punch cards and a mini mainframe. To do 4GL language, we had to use overheads, because the technology to bring that into a classroom had not been developed at that point. It had not got to a point where we could then disseminate it and develop it. Very quickly, the technologies came about. Very quickly, the educational institutions picked up the technology and delivered it to students. It took a lot longer to get out to regional and rural Queensland and regional Australia. It took a lot longer, for a range of reasons, but those reasons should not include government's restrictive enactments. The technology should be able to be delivered in a timely and appropriate way.
Turning to the substantive elements of the matter, the purpose of the bill is to refine arrangements for the introduction of digital television and establish a system for the regulation of datacasting services. The conversion to digital broadcasting requires amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992. The former act sets out the ownership and programming conditions for broadcasting licences and is administered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. The latter act regulates the usage of the spectrum, including the licensing of transmitting apparatus, and is administered by the Australian Communications Authority. ·	
Datacasting is defined in the digital conversion act as a service, other than a broadcasting service, that delivers information to persons having equipment appropriate for receiving that information, where the delivery of the service uses the broadcasting service bands. This definition of datacasting, as it stands, is overly restrictive and complicated and goes beyond restricting datacasting to services that do not constitute broadcasting. Labor believes that, while datacasting cannot be de facto broadcasting, the definition should be amended to remove the artificial and unnecessary limitations on datacasting. This restrictive definition has had a considerable impact on would-be datacasters. According to the Internet Industry Association of Australia, the restrictive provisions in this bill are:
. . . the kiss of death for the development of a multi-billion-dollar datacasting industry in Australia.
They go on to say:
A golden opportunity to have the entire Australian population online within three years was about to be thrown aside.
Similarly, Telstra has recently stated that it is:
. . . disappointed with the Datacasting Bill as it raises serious questions abut the viability of datacasting in Australia. 
It is crucial that this emergent industry is not stifled in its development and innovative capacity by overly restrictive regulation and that the benefits for Australia's technological advancement, improved consumer services and employment and economic opportunities should not be constrained. For the same reasons, we also oppose the genre based content definition of datacasting and call upon the government to depart from that approach. The current provisions prevent datacasters from providing content in genres regarded as the province of free-to-air television.
The genre restrictions will also greatly restrict the viability of datacasting and are fundamentally anti-competitive. The monthly newsletter on Australian telecommunications and media law cites a number of companies voicing their strong opposition to these provisions in the bill, with OzEmail arguing that it would not be financially viable to invest in developing a datacasting business within these constraints. Labor, on the other hand, supports an approach that favours flexibility, minimises barriers to entry and allows new services to develop over time. 
The basis of the amendments we propose to put forward to achieve this is in the report on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000 of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. The report provides an overview of both the bills in question, together with some very good background material on the new technology we are referring to today—datacasting, digital television and HDTV. The report also contains a minority report from the Labor senators. In the executive summary on page 64 there is an outline of matters that go to developing appropriate and proper digital and datacasting services in Australia, and a number of recommendations have been put forward in support of that. Those recommendations provide, subject to the regulatory conditions of the existing broadcasting regulatory framework, a new definition of a datacasting service; namely, that a `datacasting service' means a service—other than a broadcasting service—that delivers information, whether in the form of data, text, speech, images or in any other form, to persons having equipment appropriate for receiving that information, where the delivery of the service uses the broadcasting services bands.
Like the government's framework, this proposed framework confirms the 1998 legislative position that datacasting services cannot be broadcasting services. Similarly, the proposed framework provides that those matters allowed without constraint in the government's bill remain unconstrained in the model effected by these proposals, for example, parliamentary broadcasts. Unlike the government's bill, which seeks to limit or restrain the creative and economic potential of what might be offered by potential datacasters, this framework considers both the physical attributes of emerging digital services and the intent of services provided, in order to make a distinction between broadcasting and datacasting services. ·	
Labor believes the national broadcasters should have the ability to multichannel content consistent with the operation of their respective charters; broadcasters should be allowed to broadcast radio programs for datacasting purposes and should be exempted from payment of datacasting fees; regulatory arrangements pertaining to the ABC and SBS should be incorporated into their respective acts; the silly decision to impose datacasting fees on the national broadcasters should be reversed; they should be exempted from payment of those types of fees; and national broadcasters should be allowed to broadcast radio programs for datacasting purposes.
There is broad support for allowing the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel. There is no valid justification for denying the national broadcasters the ability to multichannel, particularly when those arguments are balanced against the resultant benefits. The ABC do not come into what you would call direct competition; unlike the commercial free-to-air broadcasters, they do not have paid advertisements. They do not come into direct competition with the subscription broadcasting industry or the pay TV industry, but they perform essential public and national interest good, particularly in rural and regional Australia—and should not be abandoned. The government's restrictions on the ABC and SBS being able to multichannel will do disproportionate harm to rural and regional Australia as those areas are deprived of what could be a flourishing new information service. On the issue of regional Australia, Steve Lewis writes in today's Australian Financial Review:
Regional Government members of parliament have been warned the Coalition's digital broadcasting reforms will reduce the amount of sport and other programs delivered to the bush by pay-TV operators.
The article goes on:
Austar United, the regional pay-TV operator, also suggested that its $800 million proposed investment in regional Australia could be threatened if the government's proposals were legislated. 
The article quotes a letter to government regional members of parliament by the chief executive officer of Austar United, Mr John Porter:
In his letter, Mr Porter expressed `concern at the Government's latest proposed amendments to the digital television regime'.
The aspect that is of concern, and the theme I have developed today, is that regional and rural Australia will suffer as a consequence of this government's bills. Similarly, they will lose out with the problems that they face more generally, in addition to the direct issues of access to new technologies, digital television and datacasting services. Labor senators acknowledge the legitimate concerns of the national broadcasters that the genre based content definition of datacasting might impinge on programming decisions that are properly the province of their boards. However, the definition of datacasting in the bills gives occasion for this concern. Specific provisions that might apply to datacasting by the ABC and SBS might more appropriately be contained within the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 and the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991. The former Managing Director of the ABC recently commented that it was extraordinary that the government was preserving the status quo with a regulatory regime that was far too restrictive. He stated that the ABC will be at a huge disadvantage with these bills, which have a severe effect on its ability to keep pace with the digital revolution. The provisions offering enhanced services by free-to-air broadcasters are substantively different from those previously proposed.
Labor believes that the government's enhanced services framework, to more accurately reflect the framework announced in 1999, should contain matters, firstly, that the Senate committee addressed, which go to allowing overlap of broadcasts where an unexpected delay or extension in the time of one broadcast coincides with the scheduled broadcast of a news bulletin; secondly, that go towards maintaining enhanced service provision for free-to-air broadcasters at the level described by the December 1999 announcements of this government; and, thirdly, that allow simultaneous transmission of content additional to the primary broadcast content, provided the additional content has a `direct and obvious' link with the primary broadcast.  ·	
These bills contain a range of provisions that develop a framework for the regulation of digital television, and a range of deficiencies have been identified in the following areas, as stated in the Senate report: the datacasting regulatory regime, the rights of administrative appeal and the regulation of technical standards. It is believed that a range of proposals to assist with the regulatory framework and to develop more appropriate regulatory conditions are necessary. Those that go to the ABA's power to rationalise and clear spectrum for datacasting should be enhanced. In addition, a `use it or lose it' provision for datacasting transmission licences should be incorporated into the datacasting framework, and the calculation of a commercial television licence holder's datacasting fee should be subject to parliamentary disallowance. Lastly, review of datacasting transmission licences should include competitive and regulatory arrangements and `revenue to the Commonwealth' provisions. 
Turning to the regulatory issues, Labor believes that the bills deny interested parties the ability to access stay powers or seek injunctive relief in relation to the ABA. In summary, it is not about datacasting being backdoor or de facto broadcasting. The government's model is simply not sensible. Datacasters will not be broadcasters. Labor has relied on an attributes basis to distinguish them rather than a content basis, which is the model of the government. Labor's approach underpins our objective for Australia to become a knowledge nation. (Time expired)
 (Senator Calvert)—Before I call Senator Schacht, I will remind him—he has been here long enough to know—that it is classed as disorderly and against the standing orders to walk between the chair and the person speaking.",SENATE,<title>DATACASTING CHARGE (IMPOSITION) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-06-22,"—Will I be flogged at lunchtime or put away in the dungeon of the privileges committee?
—Disgraceful behaviour!
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I apologise for this extraordinary breach of democracy. The sovereignty of the Senate has been impugned.
—Apology accepted.
—I am not apologising to you, Minister, but to the chair. I have always apologised to the chair. I rise to speak on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television and Datacasting) Bill 2000 and the Datacasting Charge (Imposition) Amendment Bill 2000. These bills are part of the long, ongoing saga that this government has created for itself about how to establish a regulatory regime for the new broadcasting and telecommunications technologies that are now sweeping the world and sweeping Australia. The government's whole attitude to this area over the last four years has been completely dominated by how it thinks it can curry favour with the various existing media moguls and proprietors in this country. You do not have to be a genius to work that out. Obviously, politicians on all sides are sensitive to those who control, own and run the media that report political developments and political issues in this country. But, in my view, it has been humiliating in many ways that this government has done everything possible to curry favour with a particular media proprietor. There is no doubt that, on a whole range of issues, it has decided to align itself with the fortunes of PBL, or Mr Packer and his companies. This has upset Mr Murdoch and his companies and, accordingly, there have been some public statements.
I believe that, whenever you attempt to conduct a policy structure for media, broadcasting or telecommunications in this country, if you start on the basis of currying favour, you will end up with a mess. The only principle that should guide the formation of policy for the media in this country is to aim for maximum diversity of ownership of the media and maximum plurality of content. I have said before that all politicians of all parties of all governments have never been 100 per cent pure about that; there has always been the pressure and the concern about what the media will do to government and politicians if they appear to be opposing the interests of the media.
There is no doubt that, as public policy makers, we should, wherever we can, separate our nervousness or anxiety about how we may be reported or treated by a particular media outlet from the issue of what is best for the operation of a pluralistic, democratic system. We should try to get it right in the long term rather than trying to appear to appease the interests of various media owners. As a former shadow minister for communications, I am as aware as anybody of the pressures that operate in this area on all politicians on all sides, but I have always believed that, if possible, you should argue for those two principles: diversity of ownership and plurality of content. ·	
The bills before us do not do anything to extend the diversity of ownership of the major media forms in this country. I think we may be missing an opportunity in the operation of digital data and datacasting to ensure that there are more effective new players coming into the market to add to that diversity of ownership. But time will tell whether my comments about that are correct or whether I am unnecessarily pessimistic. We are debating these bills because, two years ago—when the government first introduced the legislation for a regime to regulate digital broadcasting, data broadcasting and the introduction of high definition television—the Senate refused to give the government carte blanche to regulate by administrative decision in all of these areas. We insisted in the Senate that the government would have to come back to the parliament and debate the definitions in the various areas of multichannelling, digital data, et cetera. I think we have been proved correct in that it was a good policy for the Senate to have adopted with the opposition, the Democrats and the Independent senators.
It is disappointing, though, that when the government returned here with this legislation they still took an unnecessarily restrictive and narrow view of what these rules and regulations should be. They took the bizarre decision that the ABC and SBS, as national broadcasters, should not be able to multichannel. This has been roundly condemned by everybody else in the community, and I am told that even the commercial broadcasters support the ABC and SBS having the right to multichannel. Of course, we want to provide increased broadcasting services in rural areas, and multichannelling will be one way that that can be achieved if the ABC and SBS are able to do it. At the moment, in some areas of regional and rural Australia, people get an effective reception of only two channels: one is the ABC and one is commercial. They may also receive some SBS. They may now be able to get several further channels and get a diversity of programming, whether it is entertainment, education, sport or arts programs. We would all welcome that. 
The rest of us—those other than the inner cabal of the cabinet—could not work out the policy justification for denying the ABC and SBS the ability to multichannel. It appears from public comments from both the Labor Party and the Democrats that there is now a majority in the Senate to force those amendments so that those two public broadcasters will be able to multichannel. I see that today it appears the government have finally seen commonsense, have rolled over and will agree to it. That is a very welcome decision by the government, and it is a good decision for our national broadcasters.
When I went to one of the committee hearings on this legislation, the new Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Shier, was there. He was very forthright, as was the Chairman of the ABC, who is a close friend of the Prime Minister, and they were arguing strongly for multichannelling capacity for the ABC. Mr Shier made quite a reasonable case for it. As Mr Shier has been appointed by a board that is now overwhelmingly appointed by the present government, one could see that even those who have been appointed to the ABC board with the support of the government could not understand the government's decision.
I say as an aside that, although I agree with Mr Shier's remarks and the need for the ABC to multichannel and multibroadcast, I cannot agree with some of the ways he has gone about reorganising the ABC. The way a number of senior people have been treated is a good example. I understand, for example, that some of the very senior executives of the ABC who have had their jobs wiped out, who have effectively been sacked, never had an opportunity to speak to Mr Shier before they were actually in the conversation in which he dismissed them. That was even though he had been there for some two or three months. I find that an odd way for a chief executive to work. I find it odd that he did not discuss it with the existing senior managers and make his own judgment about their capabilities. To just leave them hanging for two or three months and then to call them in and say, `You're dismissed. I've got no job for you,' is a bit of an odd way to work. I do not think it engenders good morale in an organisation if people can have their heads lopped off without any prior warning or discussion. The proof will be in the pudding of Mr Shier's appointments and restructuring of the ABC. I look forward to hearing his explanation at the next Senate estimates hearing of how his new structure for the ABC and his new appointments will improve the quality of the ABC as a national broadcaster. ·	
I now turn to the digital datacasting definitions. The proposals by the Labor Party offer a very sound and sensible definition. The government clearly had a very restrictive definition purely to satisfy the interests of the free-to-air operators in Australia. Those definitions are unnecessarily restrictive and do not allow the full development of datacasting in this country as a new form of service to Australian consumers. Therefore, I hope the Senate carries the definitions put forward by our shadow minister Stephen Smith on behalf of the Labor Party, and I hope the government again sees sense—as it did over the multichannelling for the ABC—and accepts these amendments. The government's definitions will collapse anyway, because they are so restrictive. They will have the ABA endlessly chasing data broadcasters down every burrow and warren trying to find out whether there was a breach here or a breach there. It will not be light-handed regulation, which the government says it is always in favour of; it will be heavy-handed regulation, designed to restrict data broadcasters from developing the new services—to the advantage of existing free-to-air broadcasters only, not to the advantage of Australian consumers.
We should acknowledge that the free-to-air broadcasters got a major advantage from the initial legislation in the introduction of digital broadcasting by having a guarantee that their existing licences would last until 2007. That is a guarantee that they are the only ones who will be free-to-air broadcasters in this country—a significant advantage. I cannot think of any other major industry where the existing players have been guaranteed by government legislation, with no increased or further payment, an existing entitlement to stop competition coming in against them. At the time, two years ago, we tried to reduce the period of time. We agreed there should be some guarantee to help the cost of the introduction of high definition television, to encourage its uptake and the development of programming and the equipment that would be needed, which is costly. There was a reasonable case, but we did not think the length of time granted was necessary or appropriate.
Some economically dry commentators in the media—and even in the Treasury and the cabinet—would have liked to have seen the auction of those licences in the next year or so, particularly the auction of all the digital spectrum for either HDTV broadcasting or standard digital broadcasting. In view of what is being paid around the world, the government has forgone an opportunity to raise not hundreds of millions of dollars but billions of dollars of revenue. Some other media commentators—led by the News Ltd organisation, which does not have a licence and which is prohibited, under the existing cross-ownership rules, from having a licence—keep pointing out that the existing free-to-air broadcasters have a great economic gift available to them whereas elsewhere in the world it would have been put up for auction. If people are willing to pay several billion dollars to get into the new third level of mobile telephone technology, one can imagine what others would have been willing to spend to get the licence for digital television. Only recently, the last FM licence in Sydney was sold for $120 million. Let me repeat: one FM radio licence for broadcasting in Sydney went for $120 million at auction. You can therefore imagine what digital licences could have brought in if they had been auctioned right across Australia.
The government is forgoing that. If they restrict the definitions of digital data too much, maybe no-one will bid. There is not much point in bidding for something that is too restrictive. There must be an interesting argument between people like the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Assistant Treasurer and people from Treasury, who are always looking at ways of raising revenue. They have been forced to forgo an opportunity to raise more revenue to pay for the services of the community. Some more money for the ABC and SBS could be provided from the income of these licences if they were put properly to the Australian people. ·	
I want to conclude on a matter that shows the government is not able to understand that technology is going to make this legislation irrelevant. That is why we are recommending a number of statutory reviews over the next two or three years. This piece of legislation will fall apart and be ineffective almost from the day it is gazetted if it gets through the parliament in the way the government wants it to. I draw the attention of the chamber to an article by journalist Ivor Ries that appeared on 15 June in the Australian Financial Review. Part of the story indicates that Telstra is now seriously considering bidding for the AFL football rights for 10 years and paying a figure that is rumoured to be in excess of $1 billion. That is for the full AFL television rights for free-to-air television, pay TV and the Internet. Telstra would use those rights to put the AFL on Foxtel, which it half owns. When I saw the article, I thought, `This does raise a number of interesting implications.' I am sure Mr Packer, Mr Stokes and Mr Asper—who own the three free-to-air commercial stations—might have a view about bidding against Telstra. If Telstra does put a bid in, I bet anything you like, Mr Acting Deputy President, those three media owners will hotfoot it to the Prime Minister immediately, demanding that Telstra not be able to bid, because it is against their interests.
Telstra does have the money to bid. Telstra does have the delivery system. It would clearly on-sell to the free-to-air stations, put the AFL football on its pay TV operation and, above all else, reserve for itself AFL Internet rights to develop its part of the communications network. In all, it may well be a very good outcome for Australia that the national carrier, 51 per cent owned by the Australian people—although the government is trying to sell it off—would, in public interest terms, be providing a greater service and a greater spread of AFL football around Australia. To see the Crows win more premierships in the near future would be a good outcome.
What it does show is that this government is flat-footed. If the national telecommunications carrier is seriously preparing a bid for AFL television rights, it just shows you that the old mindset of this government in handling regulatory arrangements is outdated. Will the government use its 51 per cent ownership to direct the Telstra board not to bid for AFL football rights? It will be an interesting test because the minister, Senator Alston, has always refused in any way to direct the Telstra board. I suspect there will be no direction. The weights will just be put on individual board members who have been appointed by the minister if they believe it is not in the interests of this government to upset the existing media owners.
This legislation is, as I said before, going to die and be ineffective almost from the day it comes into effect if it is not amended by the sensible amendments being put forward by the opposition and the Democrats. ABC multichannelling is a must. The definition to widen the broadcast of digital datacasting is a must. The issues of how to effectively manage the new regulatory regime have not been covered in this legislation. So we look forward to the debate in the committee stage and hope that the Senate will be able to convince this government that the legislation at the moment is overwhelmingly defective and is not in the interests of the Australian people.",SENATE,<title>DATACASTING CHARGE (IMPOSITION) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-06-22,"—I concur with many of the remarks and proposals put forward by Labor and Senator Schacht. Indeed, politics sometimes is on its head, but I think the Greens will take the most free-market approach to this important matter, while we have the coalition taking the most conservative—
—The Stalinist view of the world.
—Certainly the most controlled and narrow view of the world. After all, the digital spectrum does belong to everybody; it is a public resource. How that resource is handled is a matter for government. What this legislation does is lock up that resource for a few—in particular, for a few already big players. It is the existing commercial networks that are being given that resource dirt cheap. ·	
Following on from what Senator Schacht said, there is no doubt that the auctioning, allocation, tendering for and selling of that resource would potentially enrich the public coffers, the public owners, by many billions of dollars. With the government looking in the future to ways of resourcing important items like the environment, it is one of those options that it has quite unnecessarily closed down. The existing free-to-air networks fear that, if the datacasting provisions are too lax, other players will be able to backdoor broadcast—that is, rather than just provide teletext type services, they will be able to provide content that will be in competition with this service. Well, why not? The Productivity Commission found that the rules are too restrictive, and I agree with Labor that the whole thing needs to be rejigged. There is a real concern that the influence of the current big players in television in particular has blinded the government to a public obligation to open up this technology for the advantage of Australians—it is inevitably going to happen; it is just that we are going to be decades behind—and also to give information technology a boost so that Australia goes to the forefront instead of being at the back of what is going to be one of the great industries of the 21st century, one of the great sources of wealth and, of course, one of the great sources of jobs.
I note that the Democrats will be supporting many of the measures that Labor has mooted, or they will be putting forward similar measures, to allow liberal use of datacasting, but I am concerned that they are going to oppose some of the Labor amendments which would allow a very broad definition of datacasting. I would have thought the Democrats would be keen on busting up the existing media monopolies when the opportunity came or at least affording Australians the broadest access to different media outlets possible.
High definition TV comes into this. It is important, but everyone seems to have just about given up on it because it has been government policy for so long. It was legislated last year and has led to very little action. Mandatory high definition TV along those lines seems unique to Australia. It needs to be reviewed. It has just been the wrong way to go. It may suit the existing networks, but increasingly even that seems to be not totally the case. But it will not service the best interests of the most important people as far as we as representatives in a democracy are concerned, and that is the 19 million Australians out there who are looking forward to the best in the world when it comes to communications. I note the comments of Alan Kohler in the Financial Review on Saturday, 17 June where, amongst other things, he said:
Why John Howard and his Communications Minister, Richard Alston, remain so determined to press on with a bill that now has absolutely no support beyond the three commercial TV networks has become an abiding mystery to observers of media policy. It shouldn't be.
Every meeting between executives of Fairfax or News Corp and Government ministers over digital TV policy begins with a tirade about the biased political reporting of the two companies' newspapers, especially The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Telegraph. When the minister—usually Alston—has got that off his chest, they then start talking about the unrelated matter of broadcasting policy. 
Unrelated? Well, it turns out that the two big newspaper companies and Telstra, all desperately keen to become broadcasters, have been such big losers out of the digital TV policy that they are giving up. So well have potential competitors been blocked from the TV business, there is universal agreement, outside the Government and the networks, that Australia's conversion to digital TV is doomed. 
The policy is not just a dud that won't achieve its aim of converting the nation to digital by 2008. It also represents a decision by the Government to forgo billions in revenue, as well as the well-understood benefits of competition and the chance to thrust Australia to the global forefront of technology, all to protect the existing broadcasters from having to deal with competition from newspaper and phone companies.
Even the networks agree full conversion to digital in 2008, as required by the policy, will probably be impossible. The head of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, Tony Brannigan, told a Senate committee last week (regarding digital take-up): “I would not be at all confident that by 2008 we would be much beyond the 50 or 60 per cent mark.”  ·	
That is a column worth reading in full.
The ABC and SBS are important focuses in this. They should have the right to datacast and multichannel without restriction so that they can reach more people with more content, and with a different form of content. ABC and SBS are fundamental to the spectrum of information available to Australians. They are outlets, in relation to not only news but also entertainment, which are coveted by people all around the world. With new technology, it is very important that they are players so that the particular quality of service they bring the public is available in the new formats. I am very pleased to hear that the Democrats and the Labor Party are much more aware of that than the government. Quite clearly, they are quite determined to see that the ABC and SBS have their opportunity in this new world of information technology.
So the Greens support the amendments coming from this side of the house. We will be supporting those that give the fullest reach to choice and alternatives.
—That is strange for you.
—No, it is clear-headed thinking, Minister. It is a swap around, if you like, in philosophical terms. But, while it is strange for the Greens to be saying they are free-market oriented in this, it is tragic that the government has got the blinkers on and, at the behest of some big players, is trying to restrict this market down in a way that, as far as I know, no other country in the world is doing.
So it is strange for us, but we are not in government. Mr Howard and his ministers are in government, and the word `strange' does not apply there—but the words `bad government' do. This is a missed call. This is a very big policy mistake for this nation. It needs to be rectified, and here is the opportunity. Again, here is the Senate fulfilling a very important role, not just as a check on government but also as a stimulus to government changing its mind. I believe that change will come out of this debate that is taking place, and I believe that change will come out of the power of the Senate to say `think again' to the government. That is what is important here. (Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>DATACASTING CHARGE (IMPOSITION) AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2000-06-22,"—I rise to conclude the debate on the package of bills relating to digital television. In 1998, all the main parties supported an extension of the moratorium on new commercial free-to-air television broadcasters until the end of 2006; the loaning of seven megahertz of spectrum free of charge to all free-to-air broadcasters, including the ABC and SBS, with a requirement that they broadcast in high definition; a requirement to simulcast in analog and digital for at least eight years; and a prohibition on multichannelling by free-to-air commercial broadcasters until 2005. 
The legislation before the Senate reflects the framework agreed by the coalition, Labor and the Democrats in 1998 and builds on this framework by establishing the rules that will govern datacasting and enhancements. In relation to datacasting—the issue that has caused most conjecture over the last month—it seems to me that no-one in the parliament is seriously disputing the government's position that datacasters cannot be broadcasters and that they must offer a service that is different to broadcasting. Rather, the issue is: what is the most effective means of ensuring that while datacasters are not broadcasters they can still offer an attractive array of non-broadcasting services? 
The government considered this matter in great detail during the reviews that were conducted between June 1998 and the introduction of this legislation earlier this year. The clear conclusion from these reviews was that the genre based regime is the most effective and practical means of providing certainty to broadcasters and datacasters. The government rejects the claim that the genre based regime is so tight that it will not allow datacasters to establish viable businesses. It must be remembered that the datacasting spectrum will enable datacasters to reach nearly 100 per cent of the population offering a wide array of information, e-commerce and educational products and services. 
Probably the most vexing issue in this debate is the provision of Internet content by datacasters. The point that needs to be made on this issue is that to seek to exempt material merely because it is on the Internet is really seeking to water down the rules which prevent datacasters from being broadcasters because any content can be placed on the Net, from text to full motion video. A number of senators may well be aware that there have been stories in recent days regarding the virtual avalanche of new Internet television sites springing up in the United States. Those who are asking the government to make different rules for content controlled by datacasters but which is really on the Internet are really asking for the rules to be relaxed across the board.  ·	
A number of other issues have been raised during the debate. I am sure they will be discussed at greater length during the committee stage next week. In relation to enhancements, it has always been puzzling to me that the same people who argue that the datacasting rules should be relaxed argue that the enhancements should be more tightly constrained. The claims by some that the government has welshed on a deal in relation to enhancements are totally false. In 1998, the government made it clear that it would not allow free-to-air broadcasters to multichannel—that is, to provide full-blown sports channels, news channels, movie channels or any other simultaneous channels. 
The overlap provisions only relate to those few instances where a sporting event runs over time due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather delays and play-offs. To only allow the overlap when the other program is a news program is nonsensical. The same sport at the same venue at the same time provision is tightly confined and only one sport is likely to be affected—that is, tennis, and only in the early rounds of tennis matches. Any claims that such a narrowly applicable provision will have a massively detrimental impact on existing businesses are gross overstatements. 
Obviously, the issue of whether the national broadcasters should be allowed to multichannel will be further considered in the committee stage. However, it is the government's view that all free-to-air broadcasters should be treated equally in the digital environment. The 1998 decision not to allow the free-to-air broadcasters to multichannel, so as not to encroach on the primary business of the fledgling pay television industry, was supported by all the main political parties. A decision now to allow the national broadcasters to provide unrestricted multichannelling would run contrary to the 1998 decision. I conclude by thanking all those who have contributed to the debate and by commending the main political participants for the way in which they have sought to tackle this complex and prominent matter of public policy in a serious and constructive fashion. 
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-06-22,"—The Democrats are pleased to see the introduction of these amendments. They are long overdue. We are happy to allow the government to push ahead with its amendments in order to satisfy the outcome that we have all been hoping for—the Democrats since 1990, the opposition since April and the government since the budget—of ensuring a discounted rate for assets for farming families. We are sorry that it has taken so long. We are proud that the Democrats kept the government to its 1996 election promise. I am happy to see the withdrawal of any amendments standing in my name and to not press the request in order to achieve this outcome. We are aware of a government argument that the initial amendment, as it states on the notes on requests and amendments that were circulated for the Senate, was technically difficult as a consequence of the drafting process. As you would know, we recirculated a new amendment that dealt with that technicality. So it rests now only on the ethical or moral arguments of the government as to why it could not press ahead with the original Democrat amendment. As I say, we will not be postponing this process any further and we are glad to see that rural students will be assisted in this way, after a long period of time, unfortunately.

"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2000-06-22,"—When this debate was adjourned the other day I was quoting from a submission—
—You were not puffing as much. 
—No, I was not puffing as much. I was quoting from a CFMEU submission to the Economics Legislation Committee. The submission states:
As I see it, under this legislation virtually no-one with less than 80 per cent of income from one source will be affected, so how come the government's response to the revenue estimates is the same as Ralph? I just cannot see how that can be so and that is a matter that the committee should pursue much further with Treasury. For those who have 80 per cent or more of their income from one source and its associates, the legislation provides that a contractor can avoid being taxed as an employee if he can achieve a Personal Services Business Determination from the tax commissioner. In this regard the legislation is almost falling over itself to help contractors to continue to avoid tax. It provides for four tests, as is being discussed, only one of which has to be passed. So there are three tests for a personal services business—the ones we had before—and a fourth for those who fail all of those: that the contractor is contracting to produce a result, not just work for a certain period, that he supplies his tools of trade and is liable for the cost of rectifying defective work. So, again, every effort has been made to minimise the impact.
In addition, in order to be considered a legitimate personal services business, only one of the four tests needs to be met. The CFMEU argued that the measures in themselves are inadequate and will not address tax avoidance. They said:
It will not be too difficult for lots of creative people with all their accountants assisting them to en masse avoid the so-called crackdown on the tax avoidance in the building industry. 
The CFMEU went on to say:
I predict that the cash economy will be back in a very big way in the building industry . . .
Given the weakness of the tests they will result in tax avoidance flourishing. It also said:
The government's revenue forecast for the Bills is “very substantially overstated”. 
ACOSS also share concerns over these measures. In a letter to the CFMEU, ACOSS highlight:
The main weakness of the Bill and it's such a serious one as to undermine the basic objectives of the Ralph proposal lies more in the tests for determining whether a person is an employee or contractor rather than the transitional arrangements. In our view a tax-payer should not be exempted from the provisions of the bill on the basis that he or she “passes” just one of these tests. The tests should instead be treated as factors that the ATO takes into account in assessing whether the PAYG system should apply, where a taxpayer applies for a determination ... even then we believe these tests should be tightened up. ·	
It is clear that the alienation of personal services measures developed by the government will not address avoidance of taxation. The real challenge for the coalition government is to adopt the Ralph review's recommendation and to raise the standard of the alienation of personal services criteria so that the law will be effective. As it currently stands, this is a Clayton's law that the government has designed to be easily exempted from, and it will be of no benefit to either the national revenue or the contractors involved. It will ensure that the package of bills relating to business tax reform do not—and it cannot—meet the government's own critical test of revenue neutrality. (Quorum formed)",SENATE,<title>NEW BUSINESS TAX SYSTEM (ALIENATION OF PERSONAL SERVICES INCOME) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-06-22,"—Naturally, I listened with great interest to the speeches during the second reading debate.
—You would have known that the debate was finished if you had been listening.
—I was just finalising my research notes for my response, Senator. As usual, the speeches were patchy. There were some points made which were of interest. During the committee stage of the bill, we can deal in detail with a number of those issues. The New Business Tax System (Alienation of Personal Services Income) Bill 2000 is one of a number of business tax bills that the government has introduced into the parliament to implement its broad-ranging business tax reform. The government is implementing these business tax reforms following 12 months of extensive consultation with the business community through the review of business tax, headed by John Ralph.
I think it is worth putting on record the remarkable work done by the Ralph committee. Certainly from my experience, it was a quite unique process of consultation with the business community. There has always been debate in the business community, which I think in recent years has perhaps reached a level of intensity that we have not seen before, about the need for greater consultation. Indeed, the Ralph committee delivered that consultation in a unique way. Mr Ralph has been given a lot of credit, very appropriately, for the chairmanship of that committee and for the very constructive and consultative way that the committee worked.
In many ways, the Ralph committee report was a landmark because not only has it led to a lot of changes which will be of great benefit to the tax system in this country in creating a more competitive tax system but it points to the way in which major reforms can be undertaken and the constructive role that the business community—and indeed other groups which were directly brought into the process—can play. After a period of consultation, a report was produced which, I think, was very widely welcomed. There will be continuing debate on some of the recommendations, and option 2 is clearly one of those where there will be continuing debate. But the truth of the matter is that it was a remarkable effort and it produced a very wide range of reforms which this and related bills, in part, reflect. In September and November last year, the Treasurer announced the government's response to the recommendations of the review, and since then there have been further consultations with business on the implementation details of these measures, as foreshadowed in September.
To summarise, the government's business tax reforms contain a broad range of measures, including a number of integrity measures—some of which have already been legislated—and including the one we are debating here today. The government has already, for example, legislated important measures preventing loss duplication and preventing value shifting through debt forgiveness and the taxation of consideration received from the signing of leases. As part of its business tax reforms the government has also already legislated significant cuts in company tax and capital gains tax rates which will give Australia an internationally competitive business tax system. The government has also introduced scrip for scrip rollover relief and additional rollover relief and exemptions from capital gains tax for small business. These business tax reforms complement the broader reforms that the government has introduced, such as cuts in personal income tax rates, changes to family assistance and reform of Commonwealth-state relations and indirect taxation reform. ·	
The bills being debated today implement an important business tax measure that will improve the fairness of the tax system. The measures in these bills are based on the recommendations of the Review of Business Taxation. The bills will prevent individuals reducing their tax by diverting the income generated by their personal services to a company, partnership or trust, or limit work related deductions available in those cases, and to an individual contractor in similar circumstances. The provisions of these bills will apply where individuals and enterprise entities receive at least 80 per cent of their personal services income from one source, unless the commissioner makes a determination that the income is from conducting a personal services business. 
To recap, the commissioner may make such a determination on one of four grounds: firstly, having two or more unrelated clients; secondly, having one or more employees; thirdly, having separate business premises; or, fourthly, the individual or entity is producing a result, supplies their tools of trade and is liable for the cost of rectifying defective work. The government has also included in the bills a specific transitional provision to minimise the compliance burden associated with moving to the new tax system. Under this transitional provision, the Commissioner for Taxation will be able to make a declaration that has the effect that the regime will not apply to a class of contractors under the prescribed payments system who have payee declarations with the commission as of 30 April 2000, the day the bills were introduced. The declaration will apply for a period of two years, ending 30 June 2002.
In designing this transitional provision the government has had regard to the fact that payers under the prescribed payment system are currently subject to withholding arrangements and are specifically recognised as independent contractors under the tax laws. The government has also had regard to the logistics of the commissioner being able to process a potentially large number of requests for individual determinations for the 2000-01 income year. The transitional arrangement will remove any additional compliance burden from the new rules that independent contractors currently in a prescribed payment system face in transferring to the new tax system.
There were a number of specific issues raised by senators during the debate. I would note that the bills deal only with issues of taxation, and so I suggest that I deal with these matters as they arise in the committee stage of the bills. I would also like to record that the contributions from senators, typically in this case, were patchy. I would like in particular to mention Senator Quirke, who made a contribution to these bills.
—It was a very fine contribution.
—Given the fact that he had zero notice, and given the fact that he was not sure what bills we were debating, I think it was a very fine effort on his part. I do not say that in a disparaging fashion at all, because it is the duty of the whip, as things occur in the chamber of an unpredictable nature, to stand up and fight the good fight. I am happy to go on record as saying that Senator Quirke made a sterling effort in this particular regard. These bills, quite appropriately, have the support of all parties in this chamber, I trust.
—The government is going to vote for its own bills!
—I would have to say also that the wit of Senator Carr shows no sign of improvement, his having been here for so long. I think it has probably got worse, Senator Carr, in fairness to you. Mr Acting Deputy President, I will ignore the interjections—
 (Senator Hogg)—Very wise.
—And express the hope that the bill has a speedy passage.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-06-22,"—The Financial Manage-ment and Accountability Amendment Bill 2000 is necessitated by virtue of the GST. Those who are the authors of this flat, regressive tax should stop for a moment and contemplate—because oh, what a terrible web they weave! This bill is that one that enables the appropriations to be added to, in order that government departments pay the GST. It is a necessary piece of legislation from that point of view. It raises a series of technical matters, some of which I would like to deal with in a moment; but the basic reason for this somewhat circuitous piece of legislation is that we have a GST and, in looking at the application of that tax, the requirements put on government departments, agencies and instrumentalities mean that we have to take with one hand and give with another—or vice versa, according to the circumstances.
The second thing I want to say before I turn to my substantive remarks is that there is, as Senator Harradine indicated in an intervention a few moments ago, a somewhat jerky management of the program. We have had a piece of legislation just complete its second reading stage, but the government has delayed the consideration of the committeestage of that legislation—on the alienation of personal income, an important part of the business tax reform package—because it is not convenient to go on. This follows part of the GST package being deferred the other day as well, when we were in a position to proceed with it. The program is being jerked around at a moment's notice to suit what is happening offstage. Offstage, what is happening has just been revealed in a press conference by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Meg Lees; and that is because the government has been hiding a report on the impact of the GST on caravan parks and boarding house rental accommodation. This report was leaked to the Sunday program, to the interviewer Laurie Oakes, and disclosed a couple of nights ago. ·	
It is now clear that the government's undertaking to the Australian community about the impact of the GST on caravan park rentals and on boarding house rentals has been understated. Their promise was that it would go up by 1.9 per cent, but it has been revealed by the government's own report, which has now been leaked, that it will in fact go up by at least five per cent. Those people living on the margins in Australia, dependent on residency in caravan parks and boarding houses—and quite a huge number of Australians are, thanks to the attitude of this government, in such a situation—will have imposed on them new and unexpected charges that they were led to believe, prior to the election, would not occur. We know that the Democrats had asked for this report but we know as well that they never followed up on it, and they are now trying to resurrect the situation. The press conference that has, I understand, just concluded has led to an announcement by the Democrats that they will seek some compensatory amendments for the impact of the higher charges, and we will shortly no doubt see in this chamber a debate about that.
My point in raising this matter is not to have that debate now—because we will certainly join it when it comes on—but simply to make the point that the program in this chamber has been jerked around at the caprice of the government and the Democrats—who offstage have been manoeuvring to cover their embarrassment about the impact of the GST on ordinary Australians living in caravans and boarding houses—and that the Senate is not being provided with an opportunity to sequentially consider some of this legislation. We are being made the caprice of side deals offstage. That does interrupt the program, and it is important to make the point now lest, later on, someone says that the program is delayed. Let the finger be pointed at those who have jerked the program around: the government and the Australian Democrats.
I now turn to the legislation before us. As I said in my introductory remarks, this is one of those weird pieces of legislation necessitated by virtue of the GST. Let me address it by quoting, from the explanatory memorandum, the outline of this bill. The explanatory memorandum says:
The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate moneys to Commonwealth entities to meet certain payments arising from the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).
The appropriation will apply only where the Commonwealth can recover the amount of the payment as an input tax credit (recoverable GST) under the GST law.
The amounts of appropriation shown in the Appropriation Bills 2000-2001 do not include an allowance for recoverable GST. The figures represent the net amount that Parliament is asked to allocate for particular purposes. This approach is in line with the accepted accounting practice for GST, which specifies that revenues, expenses and assets are to be recognised net of the amount of recoverable GST.
Consequently, additional appropriation is required to cover the following payments that give rise to recoverable GST:
.	payments to suppliers to the extent of the GST embedded in the acquisition price; and
.	payments of GST on creditable importations.
That is the basic outline of the bill. The bill certainly does reflect exactly what the explanatory memorandum has described. It is important to note as well that the financial impact of this legislation is described thus:
The additional appropriation will have no effect on recorded revenues, expenses and assets. It will not have any impact on the cash or Fiscal Budget balances.
Some agencies may find it necessary to draw, for a short time, on bridging finance that is available under current agency banking arrangements in order to address the cash flow effects of the GST on departmental expenditures.
So there will be a cost in the form of bridging finance, a cost not quantified in the explanatory memorandum. I foreshadow now that that might be an issue, uncontroversial though it is, that in the committee stage of this legislation we will be asking the government to provide a figure on. We would like to know what the estimate is of the financial impact of this legislation in view of the fact that under the financial impact requirement no figure is given—although it is pointed to that a cost will be incurred. We would simply like to know in the public interest what that cost will be. ·	
This bill only arises because of the GST, and in layman's language what it is doing here is ensuring that government departments will have to pay the GST in certain circumstances. We are allocating funds to them so that they can do that and pay the GST back to the government, and this looks just like a book entry. The bill has chosen to do this as a special appropriation. In order to check what the precedent for this type of action is and what, in parliamentary terms, the proper explanation of this process might be and to assess the impact procedurally, I turn to the eighth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Under the heading `Indefinite appropriation proposed: new section 30(a)', the report, in referring to this bill, states:
Schedule 1 of this bill proposes to insert a new clause—
I will skip all of the introductory descriptive parts and pick up the statement as follows:
However, proposed new section 30(a) limits the amount of any increase to the total of the GST qualifying amount for any acquisition or importation.
The memorandum notes that this appropriation will apply only where the Commonwealth can recover these amounts, and it goes on:
Therefore, this particular additional appropriation, though indefinite and arguably not subject to separate parliamentary scrutiny—
and I would emphasise those words—
is akin to a book entry which notes that a GST amount is payable and then recoverable.
It is the emphasis that I placed here that I wanted to draw the Senate's attention to. By agreeing to this bill, we are providing an `indefinite' appropriation—not one that we would claw back into this chamber and make accountable—that is `arguably not subject' to the parliamentary scrutiny which follows, of course, the indefinite nature of this legislation. My office, in order to tie down the precedent and the nature of this, asked for an opinion from the Clerk of the Senate. I have before me a letter he wrote to my adviser in this field, Mr Jody Fassina, who is an excellent adviser indeed. I wish to read into the Hansard the remarks of the Clerk on this legislation. His response, headed `Financial Management and Accountability Bill 2000', states:
You asked for a note on this bill.
The bill would insert a new section into the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to increase every annual and standing appropriation under every act of the Commonwealth parliament by the amount necessary to fund payment of the GST by the Commonwealth departments and agencies which are authorised to spend money by those acts. The bill is therefore an appropriation bill, in that it would appropriate money to add to existing appropriations.
As the explanatory memorandum accompanying the bill explains, the addition to the appropriations would not result in an increase in actual expenditure because the GST applies only notionally to Commonwealth departments and agencies, and the amounts they pay as GST will be recovered through input tax credits.
I want to particularly draw the chamber's attention to the next two paragraphs:
It is not unusual for the Parliament to pass standing appropriations, that is, appropriations which continue as long as the relevant act of Parliament remains in force, and most standing appropriations are of indefinite amount, in that the act says only that funds are appropriated to the extent necessary to meet a particular commitment. The Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 contains provisions which add to existing appropriations: section 28 appropriates money for the purpose of repayments by the Commonwealth which are required by any other act or law.
This bill, however, is unusual, and I believe unprecedented, in that it would add an indefinite amount to every—
that word is emphasised—
annual and standing appropriation in effect. Moreover, this would be an extraordinary kind of appropriation, in that it would not involve actual expenditure, but would be purely a `bookkeeping' device. ·	
It is important to have that opinion on the record so it is clear that we know what is being done here. From the point of view of the opposition, it delivers to us a dilemma. The dilemma is: should we require this legislation to be periodically presented to us with the appropriation bills in the normal time to ensure that the purpose of parliamentary scrutiny is served and the accountability of the government is met or should we agree to an open-ended appropriation knowing that in so doing we create a precedent and one that we would be loathe to have visited in any other conceivable set of circumstances on the processes of the parliament? We balance those considerations against the consideration that this government tax clearly imposes on those departments and agencies an onerous responsibility for them to meet it. If the bill did not carry, they would be debited on their normal appropriations by the amount that this bill will enable them to pay—and after all it is only a book entry.
The approach the opposition have taken to the government's handling of the GST is noteworthy in terms of our approach to how we should deal with this legislation. Our approach has been to fight tooth and nail to prevent the GST from being introduced. It is a matter of record that that is what we have done; it is a matter of record that the Labor Party are opposed to the GST. It is also a matter of record that, of late, government ministers have stood up in this chamber and said that the Labor Party support a GST. Coming from a most unreliable source, that is hardly a credible statement and, coming from the authors of the GST, is something that hardly anyone pays any attention to. It is also the case that, whenever that fatuous and facile allegation has been made, we have disowned it because it is not our position. Funnily enough, we think that the Labor Party speak for the Labor Party, not the Liberal Party. This is just the Liberal Party trying to shift the blame onto us for the type of tax that is being introduced. Emphatically, yet again—underlined, in italics, raised into bold print and blackened—we say: we are opposed to the GST. Now let us put that issue aside.
What we have done, though, having tried to prevent the introduction of this tax, is that we have enabled the processes that underpin it to be the government's. We have supported government legislation on how they will go about collecting this tax and how they will go about offsetting the regressive nature of this tax. As a consequence, we have supported the measures for pensioners, tax cuts and a range of other things as well. We have done that quite deliberately and for a reason. If we cannot defeat this tax, we want it to be the tax the government want so that when the Australian community is called to the ballot box, whenever that is, and a judgment is to be passed on the government, the government cannot say to the Labor Party, `You made us do certain things that caused this tax to be other than what we wanted.' So this is the government tax as they asked for it, replete with all the details they sought. Of course, the government's defence will be that they did a deal with the Australian Democrats which changed the nature of what they originally asked for. It is true; they did. And it is true that it did change the nature of what they originally asked for. But they agreed to it; it was, after all, an agreement. By agreeing, they have to accept the responsibility for the dog's breakfast that is going to be imposed, in a few days time, on the Australian community. Taking all that into consideration, it is appropriate for us in these circumstances to support the necessary remedial legislation, although it is unusual, although it is open-ended and although it creates a precedent, so that government departments and/or agencies that are met with a bill because of this tax will not be disadvantaged. It would be unfair of us to handicap them, if that were to be the case, in any way.
I will return to the Clerk's advice. We have a high regard for the office of the Clerk of the Senate and for the impartial advice that that office from time to time provides to this chamber. It is not always the case that we necessarily agree with that advice, and it would be inappropriate for me to pretend that we do. This is often an area that is heartily contested. But what he says here is confirmed not just by him—which would be a weighty enough argument on its own for this chamber to sit up and take notice—but also by what is in the explanatory memorandum produced to accompany this bill. If anyone wanted to take issue with what the Clerk has said, they would have a mighty difficult task to argue him down. We do not take issue; we think he is absolutely spot-on—right on the money. We support the views and the warning that he has given to this chamber in his letter. I want to emphasise that warning: this is open-ended, it is unprecedented and it is on account of the GST. We will not be opposing this legislation, but I want to mark in the Hansard the spot where we have raised these considerations, reflected the Clerk's advice and clearly put before the chamber—and in the mind of the chamber—the nature of this precedent so that it is not repeated on any other occasion and that we are only moving to this position because of the GST. If we can roll back the GST to cover this point at some future time when we get our hands on the Treasury books, we will obviate this precedent as well.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-22,"—The Financial Management and Accountability Amendment Bill 2000, while technical in nature, is a very important piece of legislation. My colleague Senator Cook has touched on the subject matter. This legislation does provide for an indefinite—I stress the description `indefinite'—provision for the assessment of GST on Commonwealth government departments. It is the first time that any tax legislation has been dealt with in this way. That is understandable because it is the first time this country has had a goods and services tax—a massive new tax on just about everything in the Australian community, whether it is a good or a service. The GST, being an extraordinarily massive new tax imposed on the Australian community, requires some fairly extraordinary treatment to cover its impact on government departments—in this case we are dealing with Commonwealth departments. In respect of the treatment of government departments, we are still to receive a detailed response from Treasury about the way in which the GST impact will be treated at a state government department level. A number of Labor senators, including me, pursued this issue recently at estimates. While we were obviously asking Commonwealth Treasury officials and Commonwealth finance department officials about what relates to a state government matter, it is still highly relevant to ask, in the context of the impact of a GST, how it will be dealt with at a state level, and I look forward with interest to a response to those questions.
This legislation provides further confirmation that the GST is a federal government tax. In the budget papers, there is an attempt—and I think it is a very half-hearted attempt, frankly—to maintain that the GST is not a Commonwealth government tax. Again, this was the subject of some intensive questioning at the Senate estimates committee hearings because Treasurer Costello, the Prime Minister and various members of the Liberal-National parties in government have attempted to maintain the fiction that the GST is in fact a state tax. Of course, this is an absolutely absurd position to be taking. I do not think many people in the Australian community seriously believe that the GST is a state tax. The revenue will be given to the states; however, the goods and services tax in this country is being implemented under a Commonwealth head of power. It has nothing to do with state tax laws whatsoever. If we want further evidence that this is a Commonwealth tax and not a state tax, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which is an impartial judge in this area, has referred to it and classified it as a Commonwealth tax, not a state tax. Of course, the legislation we are considering here, whilst technical in nature and important in terms of the way in which Commonwealth departments will be treated, does provide further evidence that this is a Commonwealth tax, not a state tax. I think it is important to make those points because the government still tries to maintain a fiction in this area. As I said, it is not an overly important issue because, frankly, no-one in the general community or the business community believes that this tax is being imposed by state governments.
Senator Cook has made some comment about the program. The program has been shifted around significantly in the last few days when we have been dealing with GST related matters, and the Labor opposition, as usual, are being cooperative. The government has its program. We may not agree with the goods and services tax. However, the government does have the right to deal with legislation on a day-to-day basis as it sees fit. However, as I have noted previously, we are dealing with continual roll-backs of the goods and services tax in a wide range of areas. We are being hit with amendment after amendment and page after page. I think there are well over 1,000 amendments to the government's original GST legislation, and we will shortly receive another amendment. It is not being presented to this legislation; it will obviously be presented to some other GST legislation. That amendment will go to the very important issue of the impact of the GST on boarding houses and caravan park rentals. ·	
There has been a great deal of public comment about this. We know that for the last five months—and I am glad Senator Newman is in the chamber as the minister responsible in this area—Senator Newman and the Treasurer have refused to publicly release the very important report by Econtech that was commissioned in this area to assess the impact of the GST on rents in the general community. It was discovered that the government's prediction that rents would increase by a little over two per cent, depending on the circumstances, was in fact totally incorrect and that rents will increase by more than double the initial government claim. They will increase at an average of about 4.7 per cent, perhaps higher, depending on individual circumstances. Senator Newman, Senator Kemp, Mr Costello and the Prime Minister sat on this report for approximately five months. They refused to release it until part of it was leaked to Laurie Oakes, the well-known journalist. The government sat on this report and were finally forced to release the report. The government's secret report showed that rents in this country were going to be double what the government were initially claiming they would be.
There has been a great deal of public comment about this. I understand that a press conference was held a short time ago by the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees. She announced that a deal had been reached with the government to increase rental assistance from seven per cent to 10 per cent. This is currently being analysed in some detail. My understanding is that it will not have a significant impact in ameliorating the disastrous effect of the GST on rents for people in caravan parks and boarding houses. It will probably be worth only $1 or $1.50 a week to some of the people who will be hurt by the GST in this area. But it is significant also that the government—Senator Newman, earlier this week; Senator Kemp; the Treasurer, Mr Costello; and the Prime Minister—said that they would not change the government approach to the GST in this area. They have now done a backflip—and not because of the National Party. The poor old National Party has become irrelevant because of some pressure from the Democrats and the Labor Party. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
Leave granted; debate adjourned.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I emphasise that the government—including, variously, Senator Newman, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister—have been saying that there will be no change in the important area of the GST impact on rents, but today the Leader of the Australian Democrats has made an announcement on behalf of the Treasurer. I note the Treasurer himself did not front the press conference; he would have had to answer some fairly embarrassing questions about why they have done a partial backflip in this particular area. This is yet another backflip in a series of very important backflips on the GST. ·	
A few remarks should be made about the approach of the Australian Democrats to this matter. We have a GST because it is the policy of the Liberal-National parties. They have pushed this matter continuously since the election and since the infamous backflip on the `never ever' commitment given by the Prime Minister. We have a GST also because the Australian Democrats did a deal with the Liberal-National parties—and, when it suits the Treasurer, he blames the Democrats for the fallout from some of the consequences of that deal, whether it is in respect of food or in respect of rents. But the Australian Democrats have discovered the issue of rents. My colleague in the other place, our frontbench spokesperson in this area, Mr Swan, has made many quite correct comments about the impact of the GST on rents. On a number of occasions, he has called for the public release of the government's secret report that they have tried to keep buried for the last five months. The assiduous work of Mr Swan and other members of the Labor Party brought this issue to the public's attention. Then the Australian Democrats, who signed up to the deal on the GST, jumped on the bandwagon at the last moment, as they did with the taxation treatment of beer.
The poor old National Party have kicked and screamed over this issue over the last fortnight. We know what happened at their conference. The poor old National Party have pleaded at various times, publicly and privately, with the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to change position in respect of the treatment of rents on caravan parks and boarding houses. But who listens to the National Party in this government? They do not count; they do not matter. It has come down to the Australian Democrats—albeit in a fairly minor way—to get the government to do a backflip, yet again, on another important aspect of the implementation of the GST at an incredibly late hour. We have only a few days until the implementation of the GST.
Senator Newman was here earlier. I had invited her to give the Senate an explanation of the public announcement that was made this morning by Senator Lees. Senator Newman has defended the impact of the GST on rents. She has defended it on a number of occasions in this chamber, and she had a duty—not just to the Senate but to the public of Australia—to give us some sort of explanation while she was in here and while we were debating important GST legislation to explain why this backflip occurred. Regrettably, she failed to do so.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-06-22,"—The Financial Management and Accountability Amendment Bill 2000 is technical in nature and its details have been outlined in the second reading speech. I will not go over the details, other than to say that the bill accommodates the fact that the Commonwealth, like other entities, will be paying the GST. We need to have an appropriation which accounts for the amount of GST which is payable and recoverable. In that, there is no great moment, mystery or magic, despite what the opposition would have the Australian community believe.
I might briefly address the point raised by Senator Cook when he referred to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee's eighth report of the year 2000. Senator Cook did not state that a letter from the Minister for Finance and Administration comprehensively—and I use the term of the committee when I use that word; I use that word because I intend to, because it was a comprehensive reply by the minister for finance—addressed the two queries raised by the committee. On the indefinite nature of the appropriation created by the bill, Minister Fahey quite correctly pointed out that many appropriations are indefinite as to amount in the sense that the amount appropriated in any given year can be determined only in retrospect.
A vivid and common example is the standing appropriation which relates to social security. In any year, you cannot forecast how many claimants there will be for a particular government benefit, so you set aside a standing appropriation, which is not finite—it does not have a specific figure. When the financial year has passed, you are then able to work out exactly what was paid out. At the start of that year, you would not be able to estimate with precision how many claimants there would be. That is an example of a longstanding indefinite appropriation. There are other appropriations which are open-ended as to amount, but the nature of the expenditure is tightly controlled—for example, the appropriation to the Commissioner of Taxation for the making of refunds. Who is to know in any given year how much in refunds will be paid to Australian taxpayers? The indefinite nature of the appropriation is by no means unprecedented. In fact, it enjoys quite common practice in the system of Australian government over a period of time. ·	
The other matter which was dealt with in Minister Fahey's letter was the question of scrutiny by parliament. This issue was raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which does a very good job. As a former member, I can vouch for the excellent job it does in looking at the legislation before the parliament. Minister Fahey states that the bill does not diminish the extent of any scrutiny by parliament. The appropriations in the bill are very similar to appropriations which have been established under sections in annual appropriation acts in respect of net appropriations. I quote Minister Fahey:
As in the appropriation under scrutiny, each of these appropriation supplements are basic appropriations to the extent of receipts of a specified character.
What Minister Fahey is saying is that this appropriation enjoys the same scrutiny as any other appropriation. Indeed, at the estimates committees, of which we have just had lengthy sittings, questions can be asked easily by the opposition in relation to amounts which have been appropriated in relation to these matters. So it is not a question of there being some indefinite figure, a mysterious figure, which will remain so in relation to the appropriation of moneys; it is something which deals with the GST. When we come to supplementary estimates committee hearings, these figures can be obtained, just as any other figure can be obtained in relation to any other indefinite appropriation.
This amendment to the bill is essential because it provides for section 83 of the Constitution to be followed so that amounts spent must be appropriated for. That is in the system of our government, and not to do that would be inappropriate. Also, for accounting purposes, it provides for an appropriation for these GST amounts which can be recovered.
Perhaps I can just add that the amounts which are in the budget and to which we refer in everyday business are net amounts, and they are exclusive of the GST which has been paid. They are, in fact, the real cost, if you like, to the taxpayer or to the government. It makes sense that, in dealing with figures, we provide net figures exclusive of the GST. That is why you have those net figures provided for in the budget context.
I note that the opposition will not oppose this bill. But if the opposition gets into government—and it may get into government one day, although that is a very big `if'—I note that it will be keeping this bill because it will be keeping the GST. It has not said that whenever, if ever, it gets into government it will not be keeping the GST; it has merely said that it will roll it back. If the opposition rolls back the GST, that means it is going to keep it. If it is going to keep it, it means that it has to carry on the provisions of this very bill—and that is why the opposition is not opposing it today.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I would like to make a few comments in relation to what has happened with this bill that I think the opposition would like put on the record. I have to say that the opposition was dismayed by the level of mismanagement in relation to this bill. In fact, it was a complete dog's breakfast. It isn't now, but it was at that point when it first came on. The bill actually comes from the original bill, which was called the Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 2000. The Transport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 was, in fact, an omnibus bill which incorporated controversial and non-controversial elements. The omnibus nature of that bill obviously created some difficulties for us and, as I understand, led to a convention where, if possible, omnibus bills would be avoided. The reason that that convention arose was precisely because of what happened in relation to this bill, and I appreciate that a frontbencher would not be aware of it.
The opposition was willing to support the practical amendments contained in the bill, but there were other controversial elements which could not be supported, thereby necessitating the break-up of the bill, which is what has happened now. At the point where this came to the Senate, the opposition did not make an offer to the government to break the bill up in order that this could be dealt with. What happened was that, as we were dealing with the bill, a whole set of amendments was circulated, virtually during the second reading stage of the bill. I do not wish to cast aspersions on this chamber, because I do understand it was a difficulty from a minister who is not in this chamber.
We had new amendments circulated half an hour prior to the bill coming on to deal with Australian National Railways in the wind-up, something which was not related, in fact, to the territories bill which was before us. There was a scramble as a result of that. We were happy to accept it, but we have processes that we had to go through in terms of consultation with the appropriate shadow minister. So what happened—and the government has now fixed it and I do appreciate that—is that there was a major difficulty causing an embarrassment all round, not simply in relation to the government. We were given very little time to consider them, and I have to say that we were not happy with the management of this bill in relation to the minister in the other chamber who deals with transport.  ·	
What we have got now is a bill that contains these additional amendments as well as the transport aspects of the omnibus bill. We support this bill. It is in relation to some technical matters that relate to the facilitating, the wind-up of AN. It has been supported by the House of Representatives and we will be supporting it, but we just wish to make the point that omnibus bills ought to be avoided where possible, and the opposition would like the government to convey to the minister in the other place that, as far as we are concerned, it makes it extremely difficult for us to agree to what are non-controversial matters if issues are placed before us at very short notice. As I said, this is not casting aspersions at all on Senator Macdonald—it was nothing to do with Senator Macdonald—but I do wish to say through Senator Macdonald to Minister Anderson that in future we could avoid a lot of unnecessary confusion on all sides if what has happened now had happened earlier. With those remarks, I indicate that we will be supporting the bill.",SENATE,<title>TRANSPORT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-06-22,"—I thank Senator Mackay for her comments and her support for this bill. It was part of what we thought was a fairly technical and unexciting omnibus bill to correct a few anomalies in various bits of legislation for which the Department of Transport and Regional Services has responsibility. A couple of parts of it were time critical. Regrettably, and I think I made this apology last time—again, it was not Mr Anderson's fault, but due to some administrative oversights thatoccasionally happen—there were some elements of this which were not advised to the opposition at the appropriate time. I think I have made that apology before, and I repeat it. I take on board again what Senator Mackay has said about consultation and involvement. 
As a government, we always want to make sure that both the opposition and, particularly, the Democrats, who we understand have limited resources, are fully briefed on issues that come before the chamber so that, even if they do not agree with the legislation, they do at least understand it. A couple of bills I have had through here, I have to say, with the greatest of respect to the Democrats, I feel at times they have not understood and have simply taken the easy way out and said, `We will follow the Labor Party because perhaps at times their philosophical approach is closer to ours.'
I also should mention that where the omnibus bill really got into trouble was when we found an amendment attached to it which started dealing with mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory. Whilst an omnibus bill is very broad and wide and while it covers a lot of different bills and pieces of legislation, I have to say, again with the greatest of respect to the Democrats, that it is not really the avenue for dealing with mandatory sentencing. It is an important issue but it should not be dealt with here. 
Where we are left now, of course, is that we still have the other bill halfway through this chamber. There are a couple of pieces of that that have raised some opposition. I am not sure whether it is opposition directly or otherwise; I have not quite caught up with the industrial relations element of that bill. That still has to come back along the line. Whether it is to be passed or not passed will depend upon the will of this chamber, but we still have to deal with that. Certainly the mandatory sentencing did not help with that bill. Hence, we have taken the appropriate way to get this time critical bill through—and that is what we are doing here today. I appreciate the support from Senator Mackay.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I rise to indicate that the opposition will support the passage of this bill. It is an important piece of legislation. I note that the bill runs to only four pages, but the explanatory memorandum runs to 46 pages. That intrigued me as I started to read the explanatory memorandum. I might point out that contained within it is a very comprehensive history of the development of the community pharmacy agreements.
This particular legislation will implement the third community pharmacy agreement and that agreement will operate from 1 July this year for the next five years. That agreement follows on from the two earlier agreements, the first of which commenced back in 1991 under the former Labor government and then was subsequently updated with the second community pharmacy agreement in 1995.
Without going into the detail, I invite honourable senators to peruse the explanatory memorandum. There is very good history documented there of the work that was done by the previous Labor governments in promoting expansion of community services into rural and remote areas—rather than being concentrated, as they were, in the more urbanised and metropolitan areas. It also notes some of the other initiatives in respect of community education and in respect of the provision of pharmacy services for persons in aged care facilities.
This third agreement will come into operation pursuant to this amending legislation, as I said, and operate for the next five years. It has a number of key features. In particular, there is a new allowance, the Rural Maintenance Allowance, to be instituted which will replace the current Isolated Pharmacy Allowance and Remote Pharmacy Allowance. That measure includes initiatives of some $76 million over the next five years to continue the process of improving access for people in rural and remote areas to pharmacy services. There is a further program, the Pharmacy Development Program, which will involve $188 million of expenditure over five years. That is intended to promote greater quality of service and better information for consumers utilising the services of pharmacists, and, of course, in particular, accessing pharmaceutical drugs under the PBS system.
There is also provision for a new dispute resolution mechanism and new arrangements in relation to the medication reviews that were implemented under previous agreements. Those reviews are a system of providing ongoing assistance and monitoring for persons in residential care facilities. 
We are happy to support this legislation because it continues the very good work and the visionary approach adopted by the previous Labor governments. For that reason, we are pleased to see this government continuing with those initiatives in this most important area of health for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1

That the Senate take note of the failure of the Minister for Finance and Administration to provide either an answer or an explanation.
I remind the minister that I gave notice of this at about 1.30 p.m. today, so the minister ought to have been informed of the fact that I was going to move in this manner. I will remind the senator of the nature of the question: it was on the charter of budget honesty and accrual accounting, which require the government to accurately value assets. I asked: why is it that Telstra is valued at close to zero in the budget when its value is estimated to be around $90 billion, why was the G3 mobile phone spectrum included as an asset and not other parts of the spectrum and how was the G3 spectrum estimate of $2.6 billion calculated? These are questions that are critical to the budget, given that the budget surplus was dependent on the $2.6 billion for the sale of the spectrum. Even since the budget, there have been various reports about whether or not that is a realistic estimate, whether it should be much higher or whether it should, in fact, be much lower than that and whether the existing telecommunications carriers in this country will need to purchase spectrum at all. Given the speculative nature of the spectrum sale, it seems to me to have been a very important question which ought to have been answered well and truly by now. It is more than a month since that question was put.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Cook today, relating to taxation.
This is about whether the Treasurer deliberately or inadvertently misled the public on AM yesterday when he claimed that the average family would be receiving a $50 a week reduction in tax. Senator Cook's question drew out the fundamental political lie that this government has been peddling throughout its propaganda campaign to try to persuade Australians that the GST is fundamentally a good thing for them. We have now seen the government spend some $431 million promoting and advertising a most unpopular tax. We have seen as much as 12 times the amount of money spent selling this unpopular tax as is being offered to caravan residents and boarding house residents in the way of compensation. We are seeing extraordinary sums of money being devoted to this propaganda effort. The fundamental lie that this government is peddling is that there will be a reduction in tax when we all know that the government is actually proposing a whole series of new indirect taxes which will see the raising of some $24 billion. On the one hand, the government proposes to offer people $12 billion in tax cuts but, on the other hand, it fails to point out that it is raising $24 billion by way of indirect taxes.
The government has also failed to point out in this great political lie that most of the so-called benefits of these tax cuts will soon evaporate insofar as we will see a whole range of price rises, which will lead to quite significant inflation across the country. That will in turn see a rise in income as people chase those price rises and a whole series of bracket creeps, which will essentially wipe out the tax cut arrangements that the government is now proposing with regard to its income tax policy as distinct from its indirect tax policy. We have noticed that, just two weeks ago, some informed source, some inspired leak from this government, managed to put on the front page of the Australian a proposition that this government was seeking to develop a $20 billion war chest for the next election, which of course would essentially be made up of increased revenues that it would be able to secure through various means and of course would allow, as a result of the new taxation arrangements, a massive increase in the capacity of the government to deliver various bribes in the way of re-election policies. ·	
I think we therefore have to understand that the full package—and this government constantly seeks that we do this—ought to be measured properly. The $12 billion in tax cuts that the government talks of have to be measured against the $24 billion in increased revenue that it is raising as a result of indirect tax increases as a result of the GST. Of course, it is understood that all the GST revenue will allegedly be flowing back to the states. I would like to see exactly how much of that will in fact flow back to the states and how much of that money will come back to the Commonwealth as a result of the various clawback mechanisms now being proposed by this government in the way of general assistance grants to the states.
I think the general public, however, understands the fundamental lie of these new taxation arrangements because they know that many of the things that they are asked to pay for on a daily basis will increase in cost. This is the fundamental unfairness of the GST. It particularly strikes low income earners. It particularly strikes people with large families. Large low income families are particularly disadvantaged by this tax, especially if they are young families, because young children require significant expenditure. This situation is of course often accompanied by significant movements out of the work force so that income to families declines. We also see that people in regional and remote areas are likely to face increased expenses as a result of increased transport costs. People have been told that their education expenses will remain GST free, but that is not the case. We see, for instance, that school uniforms, bus and tram fares, stationery, various food required at school tuckshops, music lessons, musical instruments, coaching and extra classes and all those sorts of expenses will attract the GST. Much of what we are told about this new taxation system is built upon a fundamental lie. The fundamental lie is that Australians will be better off, when Australians know that that is not the case, particularly low income earners and particularly people in rural and regional parts of this country.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-06-22,"—I rise to speak on this motion. I was just reflecting on this debate today. I have been in the Senate now for nearly a year, and, from the day I arrived, and every day since I arrived, the Labor Party has been scaremongering. Naively, perhaps, I thought that one of the world's oldest social democratic parties might have something to say about the changing nature of work, the reform of welfare, information technology and issues that are gripping this country and indeed the rest of the world, but it does not at all.
—Like how unfair the GST is.
—It is a long way from the Vietnam moratoriums, isn't it, Senator Carr? The tree of knowledge which the Australian Labor Party always hold up has withered. The light on the hill is dim. Ben Chifley's pipe has gone out. All you care about now is scab lifting the GST, and there is nothing else left. Unlike the Australian Labor Party, most Australians accept that the new taxation system and the GST is good for Australia. It is good for Australia, and most Australians know it. The only people in the world to defend the system that Australia has currently are those in Swaziland and the Australian Labor Party. You believe in defending the wholesale sales tax. We do not. We think it should be reformed. It reminds me of an old story that my mother often tells about when we changed from pounds, shillings and pence: many people were running around saying that the economy would fall over and that small business could never cope. Of course, it did, and Australia has prospered. ·	
After 1 July, business in this country will get on with it, and we will prosper. Some 150 countries around the world have a goods and services tax—all the advanced economies on earth have it—yet somehow the Australian Labor Party think this country is not up to it. We cannot do it. Everyone else can, but we are not up to it. They are wrong. Other countries have a goods and services tax because it is a very efficient way of distributing tax equitably. That is why we are introducing it. It helps exports and it helps jobs. Let us look at a bit of history. I like history, as Senator Carr knows. Let us go back to, say, 1985, the time of the tax summit. What did Graham Richardson say then? He said, `I have come to the conclusion, after wrestling with it for a long, long time, that if we do not move forward and go ahead with this tax reform package this government will forever be branded as weak and indecisive.' How right he was. For 13 years, the Australian Labor Party did not have the courage to move forward. They buckled in the face of union pressure in a most pathetic way, and now their entire political credibility, their political future, rests on the fact of scab lifting the goods and services tax. Behind all this is the vision of the Canadian experience. That is what the Australian Labor Party hope to do. They have not brought one decent policy into this place in the year I have been here.
—Instead, they have spent their entire time running around with a scare a day—at least they kept their promise on that, Senator Gibbs. It is absolutely pathetic. Some 80 per cent of Australians—all those listening on their tractors and everywhere in the community—will pay no more than 30 per cent tax. That is fundamentally the most important thing. The Australian Labor Party never like to hear that. The average single income family earning $40,000 a year with two kids will be almost $50 a week better off as a result of the income tax cuts and increased family benefits. The new tax system will abolish inefficient taxes, it will broaden the tax base and it will provide a secure source of income for the states. It has been depressing to see over the last year that this once great party has nothing left to say on any of the major issues.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Income Tax Cuts</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-06-22,"—I also rise to take note of Senator Kemp's answer to Senator Cook's question on the GST. We are talking about a $12 billion tax cut as compensation for a $24 billion GST impost. It is not a simple tax, it is not fair, it is not equitable and it is not going to work. It is not going to work effectively to address the areas of concern that cry out for it—education, training, youth issues and the family assistance packages. All of those areas need assistance, not a $24 billion tax. 
We have a multimillion dollar advertising campaign to try to convince us that it will work. In addition, we have a letter from the Prime Minister to tell us that it is going to be a wonderful, terrific tax. How far do you have to go to convince people? You are not going to convince them. They are not convinced. They are going to remain unconvinced. In trying to convince the people that it is a fair and equitable tax, Mr Costello said on AM:
No, no, this is one of these areas where you have to be very precise of the figures because you're talking about very small amounts. There are two issues here: one is boarding houses and caravan parks, and the other is private rents.
Mr Peter Costello then explained how it is going to impact. He said:
... indicated that rents would rise by 4.7 per cent over the long term. Now, 4.7 per cent on a $200 a week rent is, by my calculation $9.40—correct? What the government believes is that post the Senate changes the effect on a $200 rent would be around $7—it is a difference of about $2.40 out of a $200 rent.
But he did not leave it there. He then said:
No, no—
in fact, the whole radio transcript is scattered with `No, no.' I think it is a reflection of what he feels about the GST—
well, let me say why first of all I say it is $7.
He tried to explain what the compensation package will be in response:
And on the other side of the equation, a $50 a week income tax, and family increase, which will more than outweigh any price rises, is completely left out of the equation. ·	
That is what he says: $50. But we heard Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, say today that it is $40 to $50. There has already been a shift in the margin down the track, so it is $40. If you go and have a look at the size of the GST package itself some 1,466 amendments later, it is 6.95 kilograms. It talks about electricity in terms of the average quarterly bill: householders on 4,450 kilowatt hours per year at 12 kilowatts per day, with a winter concession, which is now $152. Add from $13.70 to $14.45 to the householder's costs and already they have lost any increase.
If they have a gas bill as well, the average two-monthly billed household uses 9,470 megajoules bimonthly. Off-peak that is weighted now at $85, but after July add $7.65 to $8. These renters are not doing very well when you add just the electricity and the gas, but a family might have children and have to buy nappies. For toddlers weighing between 10 and 15 kilograms, nappies now cost $13.50, but add $1.16 to about $1.22. You already have more outlays and more increases that the average renters are going to have to face. All they get is statistics and figures from Mr Peter Costello to demonstrate to them that they are going to be better off. They do not believe that at all. Trying to convince people of that is going to be an uphill battle that you are not going to win. 
Also on the impact, Telstra have decided to put up prices by 10 per cent—not, as Allan Fels suggested, a lot less than that. If you then look at the backflip—and speaking of the backflip, Mr Peter Costello is not even in the country, he has jetted off to Paris, he does not want to stay here in case there are more amendments that might add to it—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Income Tax Cuts</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2000-06-22,"—If the public of Australia thought this debate had degenerated into a doozey some time ago, today it has hit rock bottom. Today we are debating the difference between dog bones and soup bones.
—No, we're not.
—That was part of question time today and, if Senator O'Brien does not recall it, I encourage him to get a replay of question time. Today, we had a further extension of the complete and utter misrepresentation of what the new tax package is all about. Isn't it interesting to note that the Labour Party Prime Minister in New Zealand, Helen Clarke, has repeatedly said, even prior to the election, `What on earth is the Labor Party about in Australia, complaining about the fairest tax system in the world?' As my colleague Senator Mason said, it is interesting to note that the tax system which the Labor Party is rusted on to—the wholesale sales tax system—is common with only two countries, Botswana and Swaziland. What has happened? Even Botswana has decided to abandon the Labor Party, so the Labor Party has a tax policy in common with Swaziland. Congratulations! What a huge achievement!
It was also interesting that only a couple of weeks ago a parliamentary committee here met with an all party delegation from New Zealand, and they were all confounded by the stupidity of the debate here in Australia about tax. They could not believe the stupidity. They said, `We went through this years ago,' and now there is no party in New Zealand—Labour, National, Green, anyone—which gives a commitment to abolish their tax system. Yet here we have the blast from the past Labor Party still hoping to roll it back. Tell us what you are going to roll back, because the list has gone on and on and on. Every day Minister Kemp asks the Labor Party to confirm what it is they are going to roll back. I do not know whether it is Senator O'Brien or Senator Gibbs who is going to make a contribution after this, but I know that I have issued the challenge to Senator Gibbs before: Senator Gibbs, please come forward and tell us what it is the Labor Party are going to roll back. Senator Gibbs happens to be smiling very, very fulsomely over there, so I am thinking that Senator Gibbs may let the cat out of the bag today. She may give us what it is—
—She's getting out.
—She is going to be getting out of the Senate, but that is irrelevant to what we are talking about. The fact of the matter is that she might tell us what the roll-back is because Senator Cook said back in February, I think, `We have nominated some areas in which we will start to roll it back.' Give us a hint. What are they? We don't know and the public don't know. Where is the roll-back? ·	
—How are they going to pay for it?
—Senator Kemp, that is a very good question. How are they going to pay for it? The answer is just to abolish the tax cuts. That is what happened after the 1993 election campaign. You had l-a-w tax cuts put into law by the Labor Party but, once re-elected, what happened? They were thrown out—just completely thrown out—and now they will not give a commitment to maintain the tax cuts, nor will they give us a commitment on what they are going to do about the GST and roll-back. 
What we do know is their record. When they continued to increase wholesale sales taxes—the 12 per cent, the 22 per cent, the 32 per cent wholesale sales taxes—on not one occasion did they ever give anyone any compensation by way of tax cuts or by way of pension increases. That is the record, that is the way in which they should be judged and that is what we can look forward to in the future. This is a totally dishonest debate that is just going on and on and on. Hopefully, in six months time, they will be seen as the fools that they have been for opposing the fairest tax system in the world and for being onside with Swaziland as the only remnants in this world supporting an outdated and unfair tax system.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Income Tax Cuts</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-06-22,"—It was extremely interesting to listen to the debate from the other side, particularly as we are supposed to be debating dog bones. That was as confusing as Senator Macdonald's answer today on GST-free marine things. God knows what GST-free marine things are. The mind boggles. It sounded a bit fishy to me. What I would like to talk about is the statements by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, on AM yesterday morning when he was talking about people who pay a rental of $200. First off, he said that they would expect to pay a $7 increase on the $200, which is a 3.5 per cent increase in GST. Minutes later he betrayed himself and said, `These people will be paying from $8 to $10 extra a week. This extra $10 a week in rent is not going to affect these families because they will get an extra $50 as a result of the tax cuts.' For an average family, $50 is really not going to go very far. I wonder whether the Treasurer actually knows what he is talking about. He is floating around different price increases all the time.
The government originally told the public that rents would rise by 2.3 per cent. Econtech, the federal government's preferred economic modeller, has predicted that rents will go up by twice as much. On my calculations, a 2.3 per cent increase on a $200 rent is $4.60. That is nowhere near the $10 extra that it is said these people will have to pay. We are talking about two million householders in Australia who have to pay rent. Most of those are battlers and average families. An extra $10 a week is a hell of a lot of money to the average family. The government have hidden the Econtech report for six months. We on this side of the chamber wonder why. Are they hiding something? Are they ashamed of this report? Why do the government not publish this full report? What else are they trying to hide in this report? I think it is an absolute disgrace. I think the people of Australia are entitled to know exactly what is in this report.
Let me get back to the $50 increase that everybody is supposedly going to get. Not every average family is going to get a tax rebate of $50. If you take out the $10 a week in extra rent then you have $40 extra a week. An extra $40 a week for an average family is not much when they have to buy clothes. Anybody who has children knows that children grow, so you have to constantly buy clothes. You just do not buy clothes every now and again. Children have this habit of growing. Children also have the habit of eating a lot. They do eat a lot, particularly when they get into their teens. Anybody who has teenagers or has had the experience of teenagers knows that these kids are human threshing machines; they eat everything in sight. When your children are teenagers is probably the poorest time of your life. The extra $50 a week will probably go on food. That does not take account of the increases in all the other things that this extra $50 is supposed to compensate for, like school books, electricity charges, phone bills and the other sundry things that one has to buy. If you have repairs done around your house or if you have somebody mow your lawn, this extra $50 a week has to cover increases in those costs. It goes on and on. ·	
The GST is disgraceful. What you are doing to the Australian people is an absolute disgrace. You are going to make them poorer and poorer. Everybody in this country is going to be poorer. Senator Harradine yesterday talked about a report on the gap widening. The gap is going to widen even further under you people. You are a dreadful government and you are damaging this country like you would not believe. You will pay at the next election because you are going to be thrashed. (Time expired)

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2000-06-22,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties entitled Agreement to extend the period of operation of the Joint Defence Facilities at Pine Gap, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted. 
The response read as follows—
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO REPORT 26 OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES 
In its Report 26, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties considered an Exchange of Notes constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to further extend in force the Agreement relating to the Establishment of a Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap. 1 During its deliberations the Committee sought a private briefing at Pine Gap.  In response, the Minister for Defence offered a comprehensive briefing by Defence officials in Canberra. 
COMMITTEE CONCLUSION
The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties concluded that it:
`supports, in principle, the Exchange of Notes constituting an Agreement between Australia and the United States of America to further extend the Agreement relating to the Establishment of a Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap; and
with the limited evidence made available, finds no reason to object to the continuation of the Joint Defence Facility.' 2
Government Response. The Government welcomes the JSCT's conclusion.   
COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendation 1
`That the Minister for Defence authorise his departmental officials to provide the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties with:
a classified briefing on the purpose and operation of the Joint Defence Facility;
a copy of the classified agreement that gives operational effect to the Agreement between the Australian Government and the United States Government relating to the Establishment of a Joint Defence Space Research Facility (1966); ·	
on-site access to the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap; and
such other information as may be required to enable the Committee to determine if the treaty action is in Australia's national interest.' 3
Government Response
The treaty action referred for consideration was the extension of the non-termination period of a treaty that had been in force since 1966. The terms of the treaty provide that it continues in force unless terminated. It would have continued in force whether or not the proposed treaty action had been taken. The treaty action merely provided formal reassurance that neither party would terminate the treaty for another 10 years. While not necessary for the operation of the treaty, such a reassurance is significant to both the Australian and United States governments from the political and security perspectives.
In providing briefings by its officials, the Government believes that it acted in a transparent and accountable manner in relation to the proposed treaty action. The officials gave the Committee background and insights that, while not classified, were sensitive and not publicly available.   All of the relevant treaty texts are on the public record. 
The practice of successive governments has been that the evaluation and endorsement of arrangements at Pine Gap as in the Australian national interest is the responsibility of the members of the National Security Committee (and its equivalents in the past).  Pursuant to this practice, and the `need to know' principle widely applied in the intelligence field, all the members of the National Security Committee are fully briefed on and have access to Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap.  In addition, it has been customary to also brief the Leader of the Opposition and the Opposition spokesperson for Defence, who are also able to visit the site. 
Recommendation 2
`That the Minister for Defence, in conjunction with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, develop a protocol for ensuring constructive parliamentary consideration of sensitive security-related treaties.  The protocol should:
identify the full range of sensitive security-related treaties and subsidiary agreements to which Australia is a party;
recognise the legitimacy and importance of the reformed treaty making process;
require that briefings provided to the Committee be comprehensive and at least the equivalent in terms of detail and depth as briefings provided to the ASIO and NCA Committees of the Parliament, provided such briefings be held in camera; and
empower the Committee to request the relevant Ministers to be present during such briefings to assist the Committee.' 4
Government Response
Should the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties be requested to review a sensitive treaty-level arrangement in the future, information necessary for the purpose will be made available. 
The Government does recognise the legitimacy and importance of the reformed treaty making process.  In response to two separate requests from the Committee, 5 the Government did decide that the most detailed and sensitive information concerning Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap was not relevant to the treaty action under review.  Beyond this, the Committee received the fullest possible assistance. 
The Committee can already request the relevant Minister to be present during briefings.  
DISSENTING REPORT
The dissenting report from four members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties 6 offered three recommendations:  
Dissenting Report Recommendation 1
`The Minister for Defence should authorise his departmental officials to provide the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties with:
a full (classified level) briefing on the purpose and operation of the Joint Defence Facility;
a copy of the classified agreement that gives operational effect to the Agreement between the Australian Government and the United States Government relating to the Establishment of a Joint Defence Space Research Facility (1966); and 
on-site access to the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap. 
If the Government does not accept the recommendation to provide a full briefing to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, then the Government should move to establish a National Security Committee of Parliament to oversee the operation of Defence facilities, including the Joint Defence Facility, and other defence-related security and intelligence agencies.' 7
Government Response·	
The Government's response to the first three points is contained in its response to Recommendation 1 of the main Report.  The Government's response to the suggestion of a National Security Committee of Parliament is recorded at Dissenting Report Recommendation 2 below. 
Dissenting Report Recommendation 2
`The Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Attorney-General should move to establish a Joint National Security Committee of Parliament to oversee the operation of Defence facilities, including the Joint Defence Facility, and other Defence-related security and intelligence agencies.
The motion to appoint the National Security Committee of Parliament should provide:
for a committee of seven members of parliament, comprising 4 members of the House of Representatives and 3 Senators, with a majority of government members;
for the House members of the Committee to be appointed by resolution of the House on the nomination of the Prime Minister;
for the Senate members of the Committee to be appointed by resolution of the Senate on the nomination of the Leader of the Government in the Senate;
that the following members of Parliament are not eligible for appointment to the Committee - a Minister, the President or Deputy President of the Senate, and the Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives;
that the Committee be empowered to monitor and review the performance of those agencies involved in gathering and analysing defence-related security and intelligence information; and
that the Committee be empowered to report to Parliament on any matter pertaining to the performance of its duties, provided that the Minister for Defence certifies that nothing in a proposed committee report would jeopardise Australia's national security interests.' 8
Government Response
The Government does not propose to take up this recommendation.  The Government notes that present arrangements for oversight of Pine Gap already include provisions for identified Government Ministers as well as senior members of the Opposition to receive briefings on sensitive aspects of Pine Gap operations and related matters.  It considers that these arrangements provide effective Parliamentary oversight of Pine Gap.
Dissenting Report Recommendation 3 
`The first task of the National Security Committee of Parliament should be to review whether the continuation of the Joint Defence Facility at Pine Gap is in Australia's national interest.  To enable the National Security Committee to form a view on this matter, the Minister for Defence should provide the Committee with:

Government Response
The Government does not intend to implement the recommendation that a Joint National Security Committee of Parliament be established.  The identified Ministers and senior members of the Opposition are fully informed on the purpose and operation of the Joint Defence Facility, Pine Gap.  They have been satisfied that the Facility serves Australia's interests.

Madam President, the report I have just tabled concerns the proposed provision of facilities for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation rationalisation, Melbourne.
The Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) is the second largest government funded research organisation in Australia after the CSIRO and has a work force of approximately 2000 employees.
DSTO provides advice on the application of science and technology that is best suited to Australia's defence and security needs.
DSTO has two laboratories, the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory (AMRL) in Melbourne and the Electronics and Surveillance Research Laboratory in Salisbury, South Australia.
The principal sites from which the AMRL operates are located at Maribyrnong and Fishermans Bend, Melbourne. Defence has occupied the Maribyrnong and Fishermans Bend sites since the 1920's. 
The Fishermans Bend site is the birthplace of aeronautical research activity in Australia. 
The development of Fishermans Bend site has spanned more than half a century and involved a number of large-scale projects. The Public Works Committee has been involved in this development.
AMRL currently conducts activities in four key areas:
operational analysis;
acquisition advice;
warfighter support; and
through-life support of Australian Defence Force assets.
The project encompasses relocating AMRL Maribyrnong activities to refurbished and new facilities at Fishermans Bend and enhancing AMRL capabilities. 
The project includes new and refurbished facilities to relocate and consolidate the following existing research activities: maritime platforms, combatant protection and nutrition, and science corporate management. 
The project also includes initiatives which will result in integrated common technologies across the areas of mechanical testing; and advance composites manufacture. 
The following enhanced capabilities are also proposed: 
a new airframes and engines division;
a large scale maritime and aircraft structures testing;
a thermal testing facility; and
a structural component bank.
The project will overcome a number of identified constraints in relation to the existing facilities at Maribyrnong and Fishermans Bend, including:
no opportunity exists to develop fully integrated research facilities or to develop multi-functional shared facilities;
research activities which are currently split over two sites impose operational and cost inefficiencies on AMRL; and
there is little or no ability to increase research outputs or achieve productivity gains as a result of the inefficient siting of facilities.
When referred to the Committee, the estimated out-turn cost of the proposed works was $56.71 million.
The Committee has recommended that the project should proceed.
The relocation, refurbishment and consolidation of existing capabilities will provide operational efficiencies, result in recurrent cost savings, and allow for a multi-disciplinary team approach to be implemented.
Proposed new facilities meet an identified need and will allow for improved operational efficiencies and significantly enhance AMRL's capabilities. ·	
The Committee was apprised of concerns relating to the rationalisation and future sale of Maribyrnong facilities and the heritage values of both the Maribyrnong and Fishermans Bend sites. 
In respect to the future sale of the Maribyrnong site, Defence advised and provided the Committee with an undertaking that studies that will be conducted by Defence to look at all issues relating to the sale of the Maribyrnong site will be done through extensive consultation with effected parties.
In respect to heritage, evidence submitted to the Committee indicated that the Maribyrnong site as a whole is potentially significant for its early association with the former Maribyrnong Racecourse and for the historical development by Defence.
Defence advised the Committee that it has directed the Project Consultant to engage a heritage architect to complete a preliminary survey of any historic, natural or indigenous heritage values at both the Fishermans Bend and Maribyrnong sites.
Given the potential heritage significance of the two sites, the Committee recommended: 
that the survey of any historic, natural or indigenous heritage values at both the Fishermans Bend and Maribyrnong sites be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Australian Burra Charter; and 
that the National Trust of Australia be consulted regarding appropriate persons to be engaged for the survey.

(Committee's Fifth Report of 2000)
Madam President, the report I have just tabled concerns the proposed provision of facilities for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation rationalisation, Melbourne.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-06-22,"—As Senator Evans is not available at the moment to speak on the document, I thought I would make a few comments. It is interesting that the document refers to a decision of the council in relation to the World Trade Organisation round, and the Seattle outcomes are the next step. I thought that was particularly relevant, given the discussion we have been having in this chamber regarding the dairy industry, given that there has been an inquiry into the dairy industry and given that there has been a lot of comment about the pre-July regime with regard to our World Trade Organisation obligations and the current deregulation of the dairy industry. 
In relation to deregulation, there is a proposal at the moment following balloting organised by the Australian Milk Producers Association in the quota states of Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. It is interesting to note that that ballot, according to information from the Australian Dairy Industry Council that is now on the public record, only polled 27 per cent of dairy farmers around Australia and, of that 27 per cent, only nine per cent of farmers overall have voted against deregulation. Even that is a pretty appalling outcome for this ballot, given that polling in those states, as I understand it, was on the basis that the regime should be changed so that there would be a system where the farmers in the non-quota states of South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania would, in effect, pay out of their benefits under the arrangements tens of thousands of dollars for each farm towards the farmers in the quota states. Is it any wonder that that proposition would appeal to farmers in the so-called quota states? Even given that situation, the fact of the matter is that a very low vote for deregulation occurred. Only about a third of the farmers who actually received ballot papers voted against deregulation.
I know there are some very desperate farmers at the moment because of proposals on milk prices, and I will deal with that at another time. But doesn't this show how desperate the National Party have become and how, in some states, they are trying to blame state governments for what is effectively an arrangement that was put in place through legislation of this parliament. That is, the restructure package—all the measures which are being put in place and which come into effect, conditional upon deregulation in all states, particularly in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland—is a product of this parliament, and the National Party voted for it. I find it very hard to say anything other than that the members of the National Party have been extremely misleading in trying to blame state governments on this matter because what is being held to their heads, through the legislation of this parliament, is a restructure package which is conditional on those state governments agreeing to withdraw regulation—withdraw the quota system. 
I am sure you, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, would be alarmed if there were a proposal to take tens of thousands of dollars from Tasmanian milk producers to pay milk producers in the quota states of Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland on the basis of such an appallingly low vote. While I am on the subject, I note that, while Senator McGauran was making his contribution, I interjected and put to him that the situation is so bad with the National Party that his brother, Mr Peter McGauran, the member for Gippsland, was considering standing aside for Mr Peter Hall, the Deputy Leader of the National Party in the upper house in Victoria. He chose to take that interjection but refused to deny it. It would be interesting to get Mr Peter McGauran's comments on that because there is a lot of interest in how the National Party is going in Victoria, and that will be a barometer of how they see themselves coming out of the next election. The reality is that the National Party will not hold that seat after the next election. ·

That the Senate take note of the document.
Undoubtedly, everyone can tell you about someone who is not paying their due tax. Everyone has their own little story or anecdote in this area. Invariably, though, it leads to a focus on high wealth individuals. That is the subject of this report. There is no doubt that those who have the greatest capacity to pay should pay the most tax. I believe that the issues of social equity and social justice are the basis on which tax should be paid.
If one looks at this report, one can have quite a different view as to the contribution that is paid by the high wealth individuals in our society. These people have invariably searched, with the assistance of a battery of lawyers and accountants, for every which way to minimise their taxation. Paying tax is about being a good corporate citizen, and a good citizen as well. This report highlights a number of the difficulties that have occurred over a period of time which allow people to get away with a number of things. Specifically, I will refer to a number of sections of the report which highlight the moves that have been made by the Taxation Office in identifying the areas where people have in the past minimised their taxation, and I will refer to the steps that have been taken by the Australian Taxation Office as shown in this Australian National Audit Office report. The report started out in the Australian Taxation Office in 1996. On page 18 of the report, paragraph 1.4 states: ·	
Initial research by the ATO showed that a range of complex tax planning and minimisation practices had been used by some HWIs including:
·	distributions and loans from trusts—
and we have heard enough about that in this place—
·	creation and utilisation of losses;
·	intra-group arrangements, particularly debt forgiveness;
·	characterisation of profits on sale of properties by development;
·	interest deductions relating to property development;
·	offshore transactions and arrangements;
·	Research and Development (R&D) deductions; and
·	alienation of personal services income.
Those were part of the range of issues looked at by the Australian Taxation Office as being used by people to minimise their income. Paragraph 1.5 of the report goes on to say:
In May 1996, the Commissioner of Taxation announced that the ATO was developing a comprehensive compliance program to:
·	act on the unacceptable tax planning and minimisation techniques already identified in the HWI segment of the taxpayer population;
·	gain an expanded and comprehensive understanding of the tax planning and minimisation practices employed by HWIs; and
·	continually identify, monitor and address emerging minimisation techniques.
This is to be commended, because this was a systematic look at the opportunity by those who had advantage in our society to minimise their tax, not to play their role either as a good corporate citizen or as a good citizen by paying the tax that they deservedly should pay. Paragraph 1.6 of the report notes:
The Commissioner noted that the package of measures to be undertaken would include, as appropriate:
·	information collection and analysis;
·	release of rulings clarifying the ATO's view of how the law applied to particular arrangements;
·	litigation to test the law;
·	audit and prosecution activity; and
·	recommendations to the Government on appropriate legislative responses.
It should be noted that, as a result of activity in this area, there have been legislative responses. There have been definite attempts to take away the chances of those who wish to minimise their tax—quite legally but at the expense of other, ordinary wage and salary earners in our community who have nothing to cling to but the PAYE tax paying scheme. This report has a lot of merit in that it looks at the actions that the Australian Taxation Office has undertaken. Whilst it is a never ending process, it is a step down the right path.
Page 32 of the report outlines the results of the Australian Taxation Office's examinations to the end of March 2000. It states that they have examined a total of 236 HWIs in great depth. It is worth while looking at just a few of their conclusions. They found that these 236 HWIs were associated with a total of 7,771 entities, including 2,171 trusts comprising 1,116 discretionary trusts, 667 fixed trusts, 31 charitable trusts and 357 where the trust type was unknown. Those are the sorts of minimisation schemes that have been used at the expense of ordinary, average Australian taxpayers. They have shifted the burden to ordinary, average Australian taxpayers who have the least capacity to pay, and those with the greatest capacity have—through various minimisation schemes—shunned their burden.
The report states that 71 of the HWIs were associated with 10 or more trusts. It states that 60 per cent of these HWIs returned a taxable income of less than $198,000 each in the 1997-98 year. That is because the last full reporting year that the ANAO could look at was the 1997-98 financial year. The report states that 60 per cent of these HWIs each paid less than $40,800 in tax in the 1997-98 year, and the average tax paid as a percentage of the HWIs' taxable income was 20 per cent. One could not, under any stretch of the imagination, say that these high wealth individuals were making even a reasonable contribution to the society. It is not simply the quantum of what they might have been paying; the proportion was clearly out of whack with their social obligations and their obligations as good citizens. ·	
Time precludes me from traversing the whole content of the report, but I will make this point. The report in conclusion at paragraph 3.65 said:
The identification and risk profiling of HWIs is on-going. 
That is good news. The report continued:
The list of HWIs has grown to more than 500. As reported at paragraph 2.44, the taskforce has concluded that, on the basis of its risk analysis activities, a significant proportion (approximately 50 per cent) of HWIs examined require on-going monitoring by the taskforce.
That just shows the extent the monitoring process is considered necessary by the ATO to ensure that these organisations are not able to avail themselves of tax minimisation schemes and thereby abrogate their responsibilities. (Time expired)

Question resolved in the affirmative. ",SENATE,<title>DOCUMENTS</title>,<title>Report No. 46 of 1999-2000</title>,Documents,41,2
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2000-06-22,"—Tax regulations, private rulings and public rulings significantly lag behind the associated legislation which has been passed by the parliament. Increasingly, the executive is framing and the legislatures are accepting tax laws where further clarification of the law is required by taxpayers. It is the timeliness, cost and adequacy of these further clarifications that actually need addressing. 
Over time, some road guides become available in the form of public or private rulings or through income tax regulations. Very much further down the track, courts add their interpretations. My bringing this matter before the Senate this evening is not to be taken as a criticism of the explanatory memorandums accompanying tax legislation. In fact, the memorandums, with their illustrations and diagrams, are most helpful. I refer honourable senators to the annual report of 1990-91 of the former tax commissioner, Trevor Boucher, which addressed the ATO's links with the parliament and my own involvement. 
Unfortunately, when the black letter law stops so does the explanatory memorandum. This whole area is becoming inflamed with controversy, and in recent times we have seen the Australian Taxation Office come under fire in the rulings area, in particular with a former senior officer facing court charges. The volume of the rulings, both public and private, must be causing logistic concerns for the tax office. I draw the Senate's attention to this three-inch thick bundle of tax rulings which represents just 50 per cent of the rulings that have been issued this week and which have come onto my desk. Fortunately, the centralisation and the improved communications with the revenue office are improving the consistency within the rulings regime. Important as these issues may be, my focus tonight is a little more global. 
The matter of the tax commissioner's discretion arose again this week in reviewing the New Business Tax System (Integrity Measures) Bill 2000. The bill is divided into two parts: one dealing with non-commercial losses, the other with prepayment deductions. The purpose of the first part is to limit the extent to which non-commercial losses from an individual's business activity can be used as a tax deduction to reduce the tax paid on other income such as salary or wages. There are five tests, only one of which needs to be satisfied to enable losses from the business activity to be deducted from the income. It is the fifth of these five tests that attracted my attention—namely, the safeguard rule, which is the commissioner's discretion where the business is affected by special circumstances, and they are natural disasters, such as flood, drought or bushfire, or the business is in its start-up phase. So a taxpayer finding himself in test five—the tax commissioner's discretion area—has a dilemma. That taxpayer may await a public ruling, which could take two years to issue, or seek a private ruling. The latter approach is costly in terms of time as well as resources.  ·	
So the point that I am making to the Senate tonight is that taxpayers need a better system, since rulings significantly lag behind the date the legislation is passed by the parliament. I outlined this problem to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which accepted the thrust of my proposal. Unfortunately, there are no mechanisms for taxpayers to find certainty—and I will use the case of the integrity measures bill—in how primary producers are affected during the start-up phase of the enterprise under subclause 5, because the law is silent. 
This is but one example of dozens of similar measures that cause taxpayers to run to the ATO for some safe harbour protection but, unfortunately, there is none. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, of which I am a member, has liaised with the Auditor-General, who has agreed to report on the administration of the private bindings rulings system. The Auditor-General expects to report next year. Work has also been undertaken by the Taxation Office in an attempt to deliver an enhanced, transparent, robust and credible rulings system. The Auditor-General is, as I mentioned earlier, undertaking a separate inquiry into the rulings system. The point I wish to make to the Senate is that neither of these two inquiries covers the problems of the unacceptable time period which a taxpayer often faces in dealing with questions of grey areas of law or where a discretion is required before the subsequent issuing of rulings, whether they be private or public, or regulations.
Tax rulings are often detailed and voluminous, as I indicated to the Senate a few moments ago. Taxpayers therefore need a timely mechanism to explain the factors that the tax commissioner will rely upon in forming his opinion in relation to what I call the grey areas of tax law or where the tax commissioner's discretion is needed. There are just too many gaps to provide the degree of certainty that is required in tax law, given the very high penalties that can apply for breaches.
There is one way to go, that is, to add to the legislation or the black letter law the required information or the road maps. But I would say to you that this would add considerably to the volume of an already overloaded Income Tax Act. The resolution of this issue requires, I believe, the combined wisdom and experience of tax professionals, barristers, the tax institute, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the Australian Tax Office, the Treasury, ministers, parliamentarians and all others who can make a positive input. But the need is urgent because taxpayers need certainty in understanding the law.
