"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-17,"—I move amendment (2) standing in my name on sheet 5829 to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009:
(2)    Schedule 5, item 2, page 58 (after line 23), at the end of subitem (5), add:
    ; and (c)    the likely effects on the relevant industry or industry sector of any modern award that the Commission is considering, or is proposing to make, including on productivity, labour costs and the regulatory burden on businesses.
This amendment relates to award modernisation. I alluded to this amendment last night. When Senator Abetz moved the coalition’s amendment I indicated that I could not support that because I believed that an alternative approach would be better in relation to considering the various issues that are of concern to the coalition and, indeed, to the government.
This amendment would also require the AIRC to consider the likely effects on the relevant industry or industry sector of any modern award that the commission is considering or is proposing to make, including on productivity, labour costs and the regulatory burden on business. I think that covers all those issues of concern that the coalition considered but in a way that is consistent with parts A and B of the clause. This is about taking into account, for instance, the concerns of the horticulture industry. It provides additional guidance in relation to conditions that should be considered in the transition on to modern awards. In relation to horticulture, for instance, my office has had extensive discussions and I have had discussions with the SA Riverland horticulture industry and this amendment, I think, would fairly take into account the concerns of the industry whilst protecting the interests of workers in that industry. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it would take up some of the concerns of the coalition but in a way that is entirely consistent with the structure of the current legislation.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—The government notes that Senator Xenophon’s amendment is largely covered by factors that are already included in part 10A of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, which is being preserved by the bill. The language in the amendment is also consistent with the provisions in section 134 of the Fair Work Act, ‘The modern awards objective’. Therefore the government has no objection to the passage of this amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—We had a discussion on this last evening. My contribution to that might have been described as, in effect, a cognate debate on these two matters. I indicated the coalition’s position: we thought our amendments were better. Senator Xenophon did not see his way clear to agreeing. The minister said only last night that he could not find his way clear to supporting us, and I have a funny feeling that, despite being given the benefit of a new morning, he has not changed his mind overnight. In the circumstances, we say of Senator Xenophon’s amendment: we are not sure that it is going to do any good, in reality, but it definitely will not do any harm and, as a result, we are happy to support it.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-17,"—The Greens are not inclined to support this amendment, in fact, for the reasons that the government articulated. We think the concerns that Senator Xenophon has raised and the issues that this amendment addresses are already covered in the legislation, so we are not inclined to support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-17,"—I just want to take issue with Senator Abetz saying that he does not think this will do much good. The coalition amendment moved last night and voted on this morning talked about issues of profitability to be taken into account—I take it that that is correct. This amendment takes into account issues of productivity, labour costs and the regulatory burden on businesses. With respect to Senator Abetz, I think it covers broader grounds and it encompasses the concerns of the coalition. As Senator Arbib, the Minister for Employment Participation, said, it is already reflected in part in other parts of the legislation. But by putting it here, fairly and squarely, it is a matter that must be considered in the award modernisation and the transition process.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—I do not want to delay the debate too long, but I am astounded that the good Senator Xenophon tells us this morning that his amendment in fact covers broader grounds, because I thought last night the argument against our amendment was that it went too far and his was cast more narrowly and was therefore more acceptable to the government. It is amazing what a good night’s sleep can do to us in the Senate chamber! Senator Xenophon, you have not convinced me with your logic, but you still have my vote.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—I move opposition amendment (4) on sheet 5817 to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009:
(4)    Schedule 5, page 66 (after line 11), at the end of the Schedule, add:
Part 4—Relief from increased labour costs
14  Part 10A award modernisation process is not intended to result in an increase in labour costs
(1)    The Part 10A award modernisation process is not intended to result in an increase in labour costs for employers.
(2)    An employer’s labour costs in respect of an employee or outworker is the actual cost to the employer to employ the employee or engage the outworker:
              (a)    including wages and incentive-based payments, and additional amounts such as allowances and overtime; and
              (b)    disregarding the effect of any deductions that are made as permitted by section 324 of the FW Act.
Note:                Deductions permitted by section 324 of the FW Act may (for example) include deductions under salary sacrificing arrangements.
(3)    An employer suffers a modernisation-related increase in labour costs in respect to any employee or outworker if, and only if:
              (a)    a modern award made in the Part 10A award modernisation process starts to apply to the employer when the award comes into operation; and
              (b)    the employer’s labour costs are higher after the modern award comes into operation than the employer’s labour costs were immediately before the modern award came into operation; and
              (c)    the increase in labour costs is attributable to the Part 10A award modernisation process.
15  Orders remedying an increase in labour costs
(1)    If FWA is satisfied that an employer, or a class of employers, to whom a modern award applies has suffered a modernisation-related increase in labour costs, FWA may make an order (a relief from increased labour costs order) varying particular terms of the modern award as they relate to the employer or the class of employers that FWA considers appropriate to remedy the situation.
(2)    FWA may make a relief from increased labour costs order on application by:
              (a)    an employer who has suffered a modernisation-related increase in labour costs; or
              (b)    an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of such employer.
(3)    FWA must not make a relief from increased labour costs order in relation to an employer or a class of employers if:
              (a)    FWA considers that the modernisation-related increase in labour costs is minor or insignificant; or
              (b)    FWA is satisfied that the employer or employers have been adequately compensated in other ways for the increase, such as through increased productivity or flexibility.
(4)    FWA must ensure that a relief from increased labour costs order is expressed so that it does not apply to an employer unless the employer has actually suffered a modernisation-related increase in labour costs.
16  Relief from increased labour costs order continues to have effect as long as modern award continues to cover the employer or employers
A relief from increased labour costs order in relation to an employer or a class of employers to whom a particular modern award applies continues to have effect (subject to the terms of the order) for so long as the modern award continues to cover the employer or employers, even if it stops applying to the employer or employers because an enterprise agreement starts to apply.
17  Inconsistency with modern awards and enterprise agreements
A term of a modern award or an enterprise agreement has no effect in relation to an employer to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employer than a term of a relief from increased labour costs order that applies to the employer.
18  Application of provisions of FW Act to relief from increased labour costs orders
The FW Act applies as if the following provisions of that Act included a reference to a relief from increased labour costs order:
              (a)    subsection 675(2);
              (b)    subsection 706(2).
This amendment is to add a part. The amendment seeks to insert a new provision that provides the equivalent employer version of the take-home pay orders outlined in the preceding part of the legislation. The provision recognises and seeks to enshrine a provision within the existing award modernisation request that promises no increase in costs of labour. The provision details what a labour cost may include and describes the circumstances under which an employer may suffer an increase in labour costs related to the transition to a modern award. When Fair Work Australia finds that an employer has suffered a modernisation related increase in labour costs, it is empowered to vary the particular instrument as it applies to that particular employer. Such an order remains in effect while the modern award continues to cover the employer.
I will just indicate how this amendment might work. Where a particular business can demonstrate that it will suffer an increased cost as a result of transitioning to a modern award, it may seek assistance from Fair Work Australia. Fair Work Australia must be satisfied that any costs are due to the operation of the modern award and that no other compensation exists for that increased cost—for example, more flexibility. Fair Work Australia may vary the modern award as it relates to the business in a manner that it deems appropriate. This is similar in nature to the incapacity-to-pay provisions relating to redundancy pay that have previously existed in many awards and other state industrial legislation.
It is expected that this avenue will be rarely used and will therefore not impinge on the universal rollout of common rule federal awards. However, where business viability is jeopardised, an avenue can exist for relief. This allows further relief from increased costs in addition to the five-year default phase-out of state based differences, as will be sought by our amendment (6).",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-17,"—The Greens are opposing this amendment. I am sure that comes as no surprise to the opposition. We think this amendment fundamentally undermines the award modernisation process and, more importantly, the amendment means that employers will never have to provide their employees with the benefits of the new safety net. The requirement for the transition provisions allows for increased costs to be phased in, and we believe that is an adequate measure to take into account the consequences of the award modernisation process for business. Therefore we will not be supporting this amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—The government is also opposing the amendment. The government considers that modern award specific transitional arrangements should be developed by the AIRC after consideration of submissions with interested parties. This process is already underway. Initial submissions on transitional arrangements in modern awards were due on 29 May 2009.
The government has made a detailed submission to that proceeding and has requested the commission to deal with transitional provisions in a flexible way that best meets the requirements of the relevant industry or occupation covered by the modern award; to work closely with the parties, as they are best placed to deal with the intricacies of their industry; and to utilise the full five-year phasing-in period in a flexible way—for example, in some industries, a shorter phasing-in period may be appropriate, while in others the commission could even consider deferring transition to certain conditions. The government submission encourages the commission to work closely with the parties to examine any cost impact and to take account of the economic circumstances facing the industry. The submission recognises that the representatives of employers and employees are best placed to develop transitional arrangements that take account of any particular characteristics of their industry or occupation and that balance employer and employee interests.
The opposition has completely ignored the fact that, as well as the five-year phasing-in provision in the award itself, there is already in this bill the capacity for employers to manage their way through exceptional circumstances. Individual employers covered by transitional agreements may apply to Fair Work Australia to phase in any changes to base rates of pay that result from the making of a modern award. They can make the application if it is necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of their business. This is in schedule 9, part 4, clause (14).

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—The next amendment on the running sheet is in the name of the opposition.

"Fisher, Sen Mary Jo",LP,2009-06-17,"—I move opposition amendment (5) on sheet 5817 to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009:
(5)    Schedule 5, page 66 (after line 11), at the end of the Schedule, add:
Part 5—Factors requiring award modernisation request
Workplace Relations Act 1996
19  After section 576C
Insert:
576CA  Minister must make award modernisation request
         (1)    If the Minister has made or varied an award modernisation request to accommodate one industry based on any of the factors set out in subsection (2), the Minister must also make or vary an award modernisation request ordering the Commission to create a modern award to accommodate every other industry in which any of those factors exist.
         (2)    The factors are:
              (a)    the potential for the modern award to impact upon continuing business viability;
              (b)    low profit margins;
              (c)    peak operating times;
              (d)    limited capacity to bear significant cost increases;
              (e)    different business models and streams of revenue from other activities;
               (f)    the labour-intensive nature of the industry;
              (g)    high labour costs as a proportion of total expenses;
              (h)    high award reliance.
In doing so, I will provide some explanation as to what the amendment will achieve and why the opposition considers it to be necessary. The government’s well-publicised promise to ensure that the award modernisation process would not increase costs for business and would not disadvantage employees has been unkept in the most spectacular fashion thus far. This amendment goes directly to the heart of that promise. This amendment will provide that, if the minister has varied an award modernisation request to accommodate one industry based on a number of factors listed in the amendment, the minister must also make a similar request ordering the commission to create a modern award to accommodate every other industry in which any of those factors exist. It should be no surprise to the government that the factors listed in subsection (2) of the amendment are identical to the factors upon which the Deputy Prime Minister says she has relied in justifying her carve-out of the restaurant and catering sector, the factors listed in her letter to the President of the Industrial Relations Commission of 29 May as the reasons for which the government has appropriately seen fit to create a special case for the restaurant and catering sector.
Why is this amendment necessary? You would think that the fabric of the so-called Fair Work Act, together with the good work of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, would deliver the government’s promise of award modernisation not increasing costs for business and not disadvantaging employees. But the stream of traffic to preceding Senate committee inquiries considering the matter and the stream of traffic to my office and my colleagues’ offices demonstrates that this is not so. The stream of traffic demonstrates that the first port of call, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, working on the fabric of the Workplace Relations Act, is not responding to enacting the government’s promise and is not able, apparently, to respond to the concerns of business. Business gives us concerns along the following lines. A grape producer from South Australia, Mr John Harvey from Chalk Hill Wines, says that the proposed transfer of grape growing from the Federal Court horticultural award to the wine industry award, in his case:
… will increase our costs of production, further reduce our competitiveness and market share and force existing growers out of the sector.
Derek Cameron, Chairman of the McLaren Vale Grower’s Council, said:
The change to that wine industry award in its current form will seriously increase costs associated with employment and contracting staff, likely to cripple an industry at a time when it is struggling with oversupply and low grape prices.
Joch Bosworth, of Edgehill Vineyards, said:
The movement to the wine industry award in its current form greatly increases costs associated with night vineyard spraying, grape harvesting, contracting work.
Neil Delroy, of Agribusiness Research and Management, said:
The wine industry award—
and this goes right to the point—
is essentially designed for the processing, packaging and retail of wine, and does not provide the flexibility we need in agricultural production enterprise to have when we have to manage the vagaries of the seasonal nature of production and the vagaries of weather, plus pests and diseases.
Vineyard labour costs currently represent approximately 50 per cent of the total site cost for grape growing.
There is very little negotiability for the price of the final product we produce in this industry.
We have completed a forward labour cost projection for one of our operations based on the proposed award and anticipate a minimum increase to our labour costs of 7.1 per cent.
Those are the sorts of concerns that are being relayed by the industry. They are the concerns that have been put in testimony by this industry to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in their case in justifying their argument as to why the wine grape industry should not be coupled in one and the same award with the wine industry. After all, they have some different models because there may be different revenue streams under consideration. I will come back to that shortly.
It is clear that the industry needs relief in a way that is not being provided by either the current act or the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. So where to then? One would think that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations might be able to provide some assistance. Indeed, the minister would have us believe that she has provided some assistance to the restaurant and catering sector. The Minister for Employment Participation may shortly choose to respond to my question of last night about the extent of the consultation that the government says it is undertaking in respect of the wine grape sector. But, when the industry has been to the minister, it has not necessarily found even a response forthcoming from the minister, let alone relief. In terms of the case that the industry has put to the Industrial Relations Commission, Mr Mark McKenzie, the Executive Director of Wine Grape Growers Australia, for example, tells me that, despite multiple submissions from his association about the traditional length of independent wine grape production with horticulture award provisions, ‘The full bench of the commission has decided to parcel us up with the wine industry award instead.’ So, as I reminded Senator Arbib last night, wine grape producers have not been conferred with by the government. I am sure he will get back to me in that respect.
Similarly, Mr Neil Delroy told me he found Minister Arbib’s response in question time a couple of days ago suggesting a process of extensive consultation ‘interesting’. He said:
I have had no response at all from the email I sent to the Deputy Prime Minister or the agricultural minister. I have not heard of any consultation with the industry whatsoever from the Deputy Prime Minister’s office.
So the industry say they are not even getting a response, let alone relief, when they go to the Deputy Prime Minister. The existing act, the existing recourse to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and, one would think, the prospect of some relief from the minister have not delivered and the government has not delivered on its promise to not increase costs for business and to not disadvantage employees through the award modernisation process. It is pretty clear that the government has not got a policy, has not got a plan and has not got a process to deliver on its promise.
—But they’ve got ideology.
—They do indeed, Senator Abetz. This amendment is to ensure that the government, through its legislation, has a transparent plan and that the Industrial Relations Commission will be required to deliver on it. How this amendment will achieve that is quite simple. The factors listed in the amendment and the factors to justify the variation of award modernisation request are the very factors listed by the Deputy Prime Minister in her letter to the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of 28 May. Those are the very factors that she considers, on her own say-so, justify special treatment of the restaurant and catering sector. Other industries have the same. The government knows they deserve the same. This amendment is about requiring the commission to deliver them the same. It does that by going one step further than the Deputy Prime Minister’s letter in respect of the restaurant and catering sector and one step further than the Deputy Prime Minister’s variation of her award modernisation request.
The Deputy Prime Minister would have us believe that for the restaurant and catering sector—according to her covering letter—she has amended her request to require the commission to create a separate modern award for the restaurant and catering industry. The fine print of the administrative direction, the variation of award modernisation request—as it is so beautifully called—says:
The Commission should create a modern award covering the restaurant and catering—
sector. The covering letter has the Deputy Prime Minister saying that she is amending her request to require the commission to create a separate modern award, yet the very request says:
The Commission should create a modern award …
One would have thought the commission would not be so unwise as to not create a separate modern award for the restaurant and catering sector, but there is more. She goes on to say that she is amending her request to:
… clarify the government’s intention that the award modernisation process should take account of the specific operational requirements of the restaurant and catering industry.
Specifically, she says:
My request now requires the commission to establish a penalty rate and overtime rate that appropriately recognises the restaurant and catering industry’s core trading times and the labour intensive nature of work in the industry.
That is in reference to her request, and she now uses the word ‘requires’. Her request says:
The development of such a modern award should establish a penalty rate and overtime regime that takes account of operational requirements—
et cetera. Her letter says ‘require’; her direction says ‘should’. ‘Should’ is not ‘must’. ‘Should’ is no guarantee that there will be this outcome. The opposition’s amendment appropriately provides:
If the Minister has made or varied—
her administrative direction in respect of a industry for—
any of the factors—
listed in the amendment—
the Minister must also make or vary an award modernisation request ordering the Commission to create a modern award to accommodate every other industry in which … those factors exist.
This should be no surprise to the government because, as the esteemed Professor Ron McCallum has publicly pointed out to the government:
In the modernising process, it’s the minister that has the power to direct …
It was reported that he said:
Ms Gillard now had extraordinary powers and was using them more than he had expected.
He said:
… this modernising process gives the power to the minister to order the commission to do things.
This amendment will allow her, in appropriate circumstances, to require the commission to do things where appropriate—that is, because a particular industry deserves special treatment because of special factors that they share in common with the very industry, the restaurant and catering sector, that Ms Gillard has already considered appropriate for some form of protection from the brunt of her award overhaul. The opposition urges the Senate to support this amendment. Minister, I look forward to your answer to my question.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-06-17,"—I have had a look at this amendment and am inclined to support the opposition’s position on this because the government has realised there is a problem. Quite clearly, if there were not a problem, the Deputy Prime Minister would not have written to the Industrial Relations Commission in the way she did. The problem that the government have now is they have singled out one industry by saying that it is special. Where do you draw the line? Where do you draw the line with the next industry that comes along and says, ‘Hey, we are special’?
This is the dilemma that you have. The problem that I have is that the Deputy Prime Minister has written to the Industrial Relations Commission on 29 May, a copy of which I have. It is a fairly detailed letter and it quite clearly has raised a legitimate concern in the area of restaurants and caterers, but where do you draw the line? Where do you draw the line to say that they are special and another group is not? This is the problem or dilemma that you are going to have, so I think that what the opposition has put forward here has got some merit. Unless you folks can come up with a better argument than what I have seen publicly, I think it really does deserve support. What about the industries that have the same problems or similar issues? Where do you draw the line? I have trouble not supporting the opposition’s amendment. I think it is a reasonable submission, a reasonable amendment, and I am inclined to support it.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2009-06-17,"—The problem you face, Senator Fielding, by going down this path is that you invite every industry, every subpart of every industry and every employer to say, ‘My circumstances are somewhat different to everybody else’s and I cannot fit into the global picture.’ For years—and you would have heard this too—the opposition got up in here, railed against us and said: ‘The award system is terrible. There are thousands and thousands of awards. There are too many.’ This government, as a part of modernising a fair industrial relations system, has gone through this very thorough, complicated and difficult process, which is being managed very well by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to significantly reduce the number of awards. I think it is good for industrial relations in this country and good for the industrial relations system.
It is true that a number of industries and a number of subparts of industries are being put into modernised awards or different awards, but the process of consultation is incredibly thorough. People get to make their submissions and argue with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, which then takes that on board and puts out draft modern awards. The process of consultation then begins. It is true that in some specific cases, such as the restaurant and catering industry in particular, parties have managed to make a significant case for the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to intervene and to say to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, ‘You need to do that.’
It is clear the minister has that power. If cases can be made in other industries then I am sure the minister, using that power, will also accede to that. What you do not want to do is simply put a legislative framework in place which invites everybody to mount that argument whether it is meritorious or not. I come back to the point that what that will do is invite everybody to say: ‘I am special. I am different. I should have my own arrangements, my own award and I do not want to have anything across the board.’ I think what is happening now is a managed, structured process that is delivering outcomes. The people best able to manage this are the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on the whole.
—It is failing.
—You say it is failing. It is not failing at all. It is going through the process. It is a complicated and difficult process.
—Why did the minister write to the president on 29 May?
—We are aware of that. I have already addressed that. I do not know why you laugh at that, Senator Fisher. It is a bit strange.
—It is a hopeless explanation.
—It is not a hopeless explanation. I am saying that when a genuine case has been made out the minister has acted. What the opposition want to do, Senator Fielding, is sabotage this process with these sorts of amendments. What they want to do is invite everybody to make that argument and to make that case, and all that will do is add chaos. The provisions are there. When they need to be used, they can be used and they have been used. The people who do this are the industrial relations experts. The Industrial Relations Commission has evolved over 100 years and is managing this process. On the whole, it is the one best left to manage this process.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—Senator Marshall has given us, yet again, a great insight into how Labor do business. If you can make a special case to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, you will get preferred treatment. That is the way they do business. What we as a coalition are saying is that what we need is transparency and an opportunity for everybody to take their case to the independent body and for that case to be considered on its merits. What Senator Marshall basically said was, ‘If you can curry favour with the minister, if you can somehow make a special case, then she might look after you.’ We know that is how Labor do business.
Indeed, it is no surprise that the minister at the table on this is Senator Arbib from the New South Wales right. That is New South Wales Labor from Sydney coming to Canberra and doing business in this way. That is the hallmark of Labor governments all around this country: curry special favour with the minister and you will get a special deal. That is what the Labor Party is all about, cutting the special deal and doing the deal.
What we are saying is—and I think Senator Fisher has put it exceptionally well—that we need a transparent process where you do not have to weave your way through the carpet loops by crawling into the minister’s office seeking special favours. You ought to be able to make an application, put your case and have it judged openly and transparently rather than simply by the minister’s goodwill. I think that is a very important differentiation between what Senator Marshall has put on behalf of the Australian Labor Party and what we are saying as a coalition.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I cannot let that go by. On the one hand we have got Senator Abetz saying, ‘We should not be talking to people and consulting.’ On the other hand we have got Senator Fisher saying, ‘We should be doing it; we are not talking and we should be consulting.’ You cannot have it both ways in this. We have been 100 per cent clear. This is a major reform. This had been left in the too-hard basket by the opposition during their 12 years in government. When you were pursuing Work Choices, this is the one area where you decided it was too hard and too difficult—‘Let’s leave it behind and not get into the detail.’
This is something that business actually want. You claim to be the champions of business. Go out and talk to business. They want this reform. They do not want thousands and thousands of antiquated awards. This is about reducing red tape. This is about reducing costs for business, making it easier in the industrial relations system. And there is a role to play for the AIRC here. This, Senator Fisher, is about judging each case on its merits. This is about flexibility in the legislation. I fully support the comments of Senator Marshall on this.
I will also just go to a couple of other points that have been raised by Senator Fisher, because there does need to be some clarity. Either there are some misunderstandings or Senator Fisher is ill informed. In relation to the AIRC matter re horticulture and wine growing, this matter is not finalised. The AIRC said in a statement on 22 May 2009:
While some urged us to include independent wine grape growing in the Horticulture Award 2010, or at least apply some of the provisions of that modern award to independent wine grape growing, the extent to which current horticulture awards and NAPSAs actually apply to independent wine grape growing was not readily apparent. We invite further submissions on this issue.
That matter has not been resolved. They are seeking further information and further submissions. It is quite clear, Senator Fisher. That is the statement from the AIRC.
Senator Fisher made some statements regarding the AIRC in relation to the restaurant and catering industry too. The AIRC are acting right now on this request. In a statement made in Melbourne on 5 June 2009, they said:
[3] In order to comply with this paragraph it will be necessary to identify precisely the coverage throughout Australia of the proposed restaurant and catering industry award and consider its terms, including those relating to hours of work, penalty rates and overtime. It will also be necessary, as a preliminary matter, to settle a procedure and a timetable for dealing with the proposed award and for any variation to the Hospitality Modern Award.
There it is—a statement from the AIRC.
Senator Fisher has left, but I will still raise this, and I may raise it again: there is consultation going on with the sectors. There has been consultation—there have been meetings—with the restaurant and catering sector. There have been meetings with the retail sector. There have been meetings with the horticulture sector, and last night I mentioned one of those meetings, which took place on 26 May. In relation to the wine grape growers, I am advised that correspondence has been received very, very recently. That matter will be pursued and examined and there will be discussions. But the correspondence was only received very recently. Senator Fisher has made a number of statements which I believe are ill informed.
Senator Fielding, in relation to some of your concerns I think Senator Marshall has told you that this is about providing flexibility. This is about streamlining the system. Business are calling for it. They have been asking for it for years and years and years. I will give you one quote which I think is very important. This is what the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in 2005:
Workplace relations policy is too important for horse and buggy era approaches to persist.
           …            …            …
… many businesses are subject to overlapping, multiple sets of regulation (both state and federal) within the one workplace. For example production staff may be under one federal award, transport staff under another federal award and clerical staff under a separate state award – all containing differing rights and obligations.
This creates a situation in which employers and employees face profound difficulties in identifying workplace rights and obligations.
This is a reform that is difficult. There is no doubt about it. But it is the right reform. It is the right reform for workers, to provide fairness, but at the same time it is the right reform for business, to provide simplicity and reduce red tape. It will be especially important for small business, and that is why we are opposing the amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—It seems that the Australian Labor Party can get away with simply renaming something and then can accuse the opposition of not having done anything about it in the past. It is a bit like AusLink 2. Allegedly we did nothing about infrastructure. ‘Forget AusLink 1 and AusLink 2; we’ll just rename it the Nation Building Program and, all of a sudden, we can accuse the coalition of never having had a nation-building plan.’ Well, we did not have a ‘nation-building plan’ because we actually called it AusLink 1 and AusLink 2.
It is the same with industrial relations. Sure, we did not have award modernisation. Senator Arbib is right. But anybody who has followed this debate knows that we used the term ‘award rationalisation’. That was part of the industrial relations discussion year after year with us. That is what our policy was. That is what we were pursuing. But Labor, instead of continuing to call it award rationalisation, change the name to ‘award modernisation’ and all of a sudden they can accuse the coalition of never having pursued award modernisation. That is right. It is because we had a different name for it: award rationalisation. This is the sort of spin—the 24-hour news cycle, the Hollowmen factor—that motivates the government, not only every day but every single hour and every single minute that they are in this place or around the country.
Senator Arbib gave us a quote from the ACCI, expressing concern about the horse and buggy era with awards. If that is the case, if business—and especially small business, allegedly—are clamouring for this, why are we being inundated with the sorts of complaints that we are by these very same business organisations, by the wine growers? I suppose they are not small businesses. I suppose the horticulture sector are not small businesses. I suppose the restaurant and catering sector—wait a minute, we have looked after them, haven’t we? There is a special little deal for them. But why not the others that fall into exactly the same category, the same circumstances that were outlined in Ms Gillard’s letter?
In writing to the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Ms Gillard, in the fourth paragraph of that letter, said: ‘Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that cafes, restaurants and catering services are characterised by comparatively low profit margins and high labour costs as a proportion of total expenses.’ Guess what? The aged-care sector has that. I do not think they even know what profit margins are these days. The horticulture sector is exactly the same. I suppose the one saving grace is that the restaurant and catering sector looks after the latte set, and that is why the Labor Party are willing to champion their cause. Of course Senator Arbib is laughing, but that is about the only rationale for it—that the Labor Party’s commitment to the latte set makes them indebted to the restaurants and caterers because they provide them with their caffeine fix every morning. I confess: I indulge as well.
As soon as you move out of the metropolitan areas with their cafes and restaurants and get into the horticultural sector—the stone fruit sector, the berry fruit sector, the wine growers—you will find they can be forgotten about. They are mainly in the rural and regional seats that, chances are, the coalition hold or that tend to vote in a particular direction. But the latte set will be looked after by Senator Arbib and his mates in the New South Wales Right.
Good luck to the restaurants and caterers. We say that what has been done for them should be done not by way of special deals and special pleading to the minister but through a transparent process that would be available to every sector on application, and not just because they have been able to curry favour with a minister. Once again, I think this highlights some of the fundamental differences in approach to government between Labor and the alternative government, the coalition. We look for transparency, we look for openness and we look for equal access for the various sectors of the economy; we are not into special deals.
Secondly—and I have said this a number of times throughout these debates on industrial relations—one of the key factors that we take into account in judging legislation and amendments is the impact on small business. There is no doubt that this amendment will be of great assistance to small business, and I would be interested to know if there were in fact a sector, be it aged care, against this amendment. The wine growers, the horticultural sector—the list goes on. I think Senator Arbib either knows in his heart of hearts that they want this amendment or—and this may also be the case—the government has not consulted with these people and that is why he is not necessarily aware of their concerns.
It was interesting to note that Senator Arbib told us certain things—if I got the note down right—‘will be examined’. They are in the future tense: ‘will be examined’. Why haven’t they been examined already and why should we be passing this legislation unamended on the promise that some time in the future Senator Arbib and his mates in government might examine it? We want the assurance now for small business, and that is why we as a coalition will be seeking to insist on this amendment. We have allowed a number of amendments to go through on the voices but this one is of such fundamental importance to the small business sector that we will be dividing.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-17,"—The Greens will be opposing this amendment. This amendment, if it went through, would effectively undermine the whole of the award modernisation process and would mean that every time the minister asked the AIRC to take into account other factors or to review a decision, as they did, for example, with the Clerks—Private Sector Award, basically all awards would have to be reviewed. We do not think that is acceptable. At the time that this was first debated, in March last year when the award modernisation process was started, we did express our concern. We recognised that this was an extremely complicated process. We indicated then our concerns about potential ministerial intervention and interference. This amendment takes that to the extreme. It is not something that we think we can support.
We also note that this is all about employers; it is not about looking at workers losing key conditions as a result of award modernisation. We have always said we are keen to ensure that there is a safety net for wages and conditions for workers, so this is not an amendment we will be supporting. We think it goes far too far. Having said that, we do recognise that there are issues. That is why we asked the government to agree to a review of the award modernisation process within two years not four years. The government has agreed to that. The minister has taken action, for example, in respect of the Clerks—Private Sector Award which, as I mentioned yesterday, would have exempted large numbers of employees. We think that there are provisions there if necessary. We do not think that this amendment should be supported, because it basically undermines the whole process. If that is what the opposition is about then that is what would be achieved by this amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-17,"—I indicate that I am not inclined to support the coalition’s amendment for a number of reasons. Firstly, under the current provisions that relate to the AIRC the commission must have regard to the state of the national economy and the likely effects on the national economy with specific reference to the likely effects on the level of employment and inflation. Secondly, the amendment that has just been passed, which was about the likely effects on the relevant industry or industry sector of any modern award including on productivity, labour costs and regulatory burden on business, would cover the concerns of the coalition.
My concern with the coalition’s amendment is that it is so prescriptive that it takes away any degree of flexibility for the commission in order to do its work. There is a framework for the commission to take into account issues, such as productivity and labour costs, which I think are a key concern of the coalition, and I understand that. Also I commend Senator Abetz for referring to the specific instances in the horticulture industry for the wine grape growers. I too have had representations, particularly from the Riverland horticulture industry. Firstly, can the minister indicate in respect of the horticulture industry, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin where things are pretty tough through a combination of drought, climate change and overallocation, whether he is aware of those concerns? Secondly, what steps is it likely that the minister will take in relation to those concerns? Does the minister say, in relation to the current factors that the AIRC must consider, that those concerns would have to be considered, including the state of the Murray-Darling Basin, in the context of the horticulture industry?",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—In response to Senator Xenophon’s question I confirm that the minister’s office has met with representatives of the horticulture industry. The Deputy Prime Minister will be carefully examining their concerns.
—What about the wine grape growers?
—If she is satisfied that there has been a departure from the principles laid out by the government for award modernisation then she will act appropriately. We will also, Senator Fisher, engage with the wine growers, who have very recently written to the minister. At the same time, given the AIRC is yet to consider their issues and on 22 May asked for submissions from them, the government strongly encourages those employers to engage with that process. I think that answers both questions.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-17,"—Can the minister indicate when the meeting with the horticulture industry took place? I understand it was recently. Specifically, on the issue I raised about the state of the Murray-Darling Basin and the difficulties that growers and producers are having up and down the basin, in some parts more so than in others, will that be a factor that the Deputy Prime Minister will consider in relation to the representations made and with respect to her decision-making process?",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I think last night I made the point that there was a meeting with representatives from the horticulture sector. Obviously, it could not cover the whole sector. That was held on 26 May with the Deputy Prime Minister’s office. Further correspondence and submissions have been received, including in the last couple of days. The department is analysing that material to make considered recommendations. Yes, Senator, I will pass on your sentiments and thoughts in relation to the Murray-Darling.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—I confess I rise with some hesitation because I said I was giving the last amendment to Senator Fisher with the hope that we might actually win a vote in the chamber—and we have. So I would be delighted if Senator Fisher could provide ongoing assistance to me! I thank the chamber for the last vote. We are now at opposition amendment (6) dealing with the default superannuation request. On behalf of the opposition, I move opposition amendment (6) on sheet 5817 to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009:
(6)    Schedule 5, page 66 (after line 11), at the end of the Schedule, add:
Part 6—Superannuation
Fair Work Act 2009
20  At the end of paragraph 139(1)(i)
Add “but ensuring that employers can nominate any complying superannuation fund as the default fund”.
Workplace Relations Act 1996
21  At the end of paragraph 576J(1)(i)
Add “but ensuring that employers can nominate any complying superannuation fund as the default fund”.
In moving that amendment, we are in fact covering a discussion and debate that we had when the Fair Work Bill was considered by this place. It is the coalition’s very strong view that there needs to be some consideration of this yet again, in fairness to workers, employers and the superannuation industry.
This amendment will retain superannuation as a matter that can be included within a modern award but it will provide discretion for an employer to nominate an alternative complying superannuation fund as the default. This does not impinge upon existing freedom of choice obligations. The amendment changes both the provisions in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Fair Work Act 2009.
The amendment will work in the following way. First of all, the employee of course should have a say. Then there would be, as Labor has it, the default system of having a particular fund. But we say that between those two positions there should be the opportunity for an employer to nominate an alternative default super fund—for example, if you want a green friendly, a religious friendly or whatever friendly super fund; or indeed if you want a state based super fund as an alternative to the existing fund or funds as nominated by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in the award modernisation process. An employee could choose to use the employer’s nominated fund or of course any other fund using their choice of fund entitlement. It would be fair to say, and I am sure all senators have had representations from the superannuation industry outlining and confirming this in great detail, that there are concerns that there are now substantial monopolies being created in the superannuation sector under award modernisation.
For example, a monopoly has been awarded in relation to award covered employees in the following industries: textiles, clothing and footwear; hair and beauty—something that Senator Arbib and I of course are keenly interested in, and Senator Marshall, not to leave him out of the picture—general retail; fast food and higher education. Many of these industries are major employers of award covered employees. In other industries competition is restricted to a limited number of industry funds. Award modernisation will effectively lock all other superannuation funds out of a large segment of the market. There is no real rationale expressed by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to indicate why it supports the particular fund that is nominated in a particular award. There is no robust mechanism where the Australian Industrial Relations Commission says, ‘We have checked out all the super funds and we believe this is the best one for the workers and the industry.’ It is just a deal done in relation to the award that then puts it in there and gets the tick from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.
We believe the employee should have a say. In the event that the employee does not nominate then it is up to the employer, should they wish, to nominate a super fund. And in the event that the employer does not wish to nominate a super fund either then we say that, yes, it makes sense to have the default fund in the award. We have no difficulty with injecting this degree of competition—and what is more it will ensure that the award nomination funds remain competitive and responsive to their members if they know that individual employers and individual employees can nominate other superannuation funds. My time speaking here today is short so I will contain my remarks there in relation to this matter. But I do refer honourable senators to the more extensive debate that we had during the Fair Work Bill discussion. I commend the amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2009-06-17,"—I have to apologise to the chamber for not being here for the last vote. That was due to inadvertence in my office—my own inadvertence, that is. I was on my way to the chamber when the vote was held. I seek leave of the committee for that vote to be recommitted.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—by leave—Madam Chair, the chickens have come home to roost for Senator Brown. We all recall when a coalition senator, for exactly the same reason as Senator Brown, inadvertently missed a vote in this place. And there was Senator Brown, high and mighty, condemning the coalition for being incompetent and unable to run themselves. ‘What a rabble the opposition was,’ he said. But of course when the self-righteous Leader of the Australian Greens does exactly the same thing it is covered with glory—it must be something good because it is Senator Bob Brown who has somehow inadvertently missed a vote.
I say to Senator Brown: read the Hansard. I am not addressing anybody personally; I am saying that Senator Brown should read the Hansard of the comments he made when a coalition senator missed a vote. He should read it and delete the word ‘coalition’ and instead insert the words ‘Australian Greens’. The hypocrisy will hit you in the face like nothing else. We said at the time that these things happen to senators on all sides and that for those who seek to make cheap political capital when there is such an occasion it will undoubtedly be revisited upon them.
Can I say to this chamber I am one of the fortunate ones, having been here even longer than Senator Brown and not having missed a division. That is more by good luck than good management, because inadvertence and other factors come into play from time to time. That is why a sensible—and I know that is a foreign word to the Australian Greens—approach to these matters and an acceptance of mistakes by senators all around the chamber is something that will occur in the day-to-day activities of the chamber as a whole and in the individual lives of senators in this place. But when you come into this place and seek to make cheap political capital and say how well organised the Australian Greens are, how good the Australian Greens are, what wonderful leadership the Australian Greens provide to the community and, ‘We do not miss votes’—
—Jealousy is a curse, Senator Abetz.
—Here we go. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens is saying, ‘Jealousy is a curse.’ I suppose I should be jealous for not having missed a division like the Leader of the Australian Greens. Really, this is the Australian Greens mentality writ large. If anybody else makes a mistake, it is to be condemned; if the Australian Greens do—the untouchable Australian Greens—it is to be seen as a virtue. When we point it out to them, it is only because we are jealous we did not make the same mistake. This is how small-minded the Australian Greens are and this is the sort of intellectual robustness that they bring, unfortunately, to serious policy debates in this chamber as well.
Can I say—and I said it at the time, and other coalition senators said it at the time—when you try to make cheap political capital out of somebody else’s misfortune, be careful the same misfortune does not befall you. Today that same misfortune has befallen Senator Brown, and I invite Senator Brown—and all those in the media, by the way, who put Senator Brown on the evening news saying what a rabble the coalition was—

(Senator Hurley)—Senator Abetz, you have leave to make a short statement. The question is that leave be granted to recommit—
—I am sorry, I was not aware that there was a time limit, Madam Temporary Chair.
—Please go ahead, but I am just pointing out that this is not a debate. This is a statement by leave.
—I sought leave to make a statement; leave was granted. I accept the chair’s intervention but I am not sure on what basis. If I may continue, what I was saying, Madam Temporary Chair, was this: if you seek to make cheap political capital out of another colleague’s misfortune—
—Remember that, Senator Abetz.
—I do not know who made that interjection, but can I say—and I said this before—that the same misfortune has not befallen me, not because I am inherently better. As I said before, it was more by good luck than good management. But what I am pointing out today is what we sought to point out last time when Senator Brown made cheap political capital against the coalition: be careful it does not befall you, because you will look exceedingly foolish. Today that look of exceeding foolishness has fallen upon Senator Brown by his own misfortune, by his own inadvertence.
—He was probably out counting his money.
—Senator Macdonald makes a cheap interjection, or not such a cheap interjection—
—A very expensive interjection!
—a very expensive interjection—saying that Senator Brown was, chances are, counting out his $739,000, plus or minus what he has not properly declared.
—Senator Abetz, I ask you not to respond to interjections.
—But I will not go down that track. I would simply say that, Senator Brown, we understand your misfortune, your inadvertence. We will not stand in the way of the recommittal of the vote, but next time this sort of misfortune befalls somebody in the coalition, the Labor Party or the crossbenches keep in mind your own misfortune and you will take a much more mature and considered approach than you did last time.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2009-06-17,"—by leave—I think it is really important that Senator Brown realise, if he is going to recommit this vote, what it is about. What Senator Fisher moved is something terribly important to horticultural producers, especially in the requirements they need to keep them viable. In our area, in areas such as St George, this is going to have overwhelming ramifications. Those producers have been watching this vote and they believed that at that point in time they had actually got somewhere—and now, because Senator Brown missed a division, we have to go through the process of recommitting it. This has huge ramifications for people in that industry. I ask Senator Brown, if he wants the vote recommitted, to strongly consider his position, the ramifications for those people in the horticultural industry and the effect it will have if we go forward and change it.
I would also like to bring this to Senator Brown’s attention. Senator Brown came in here yesterday with a motion that he had never actually lobbied anybody over. It regarded Caroona and the coalmining in that area—an extremely sensitive issue. We were trying to get the numbers and trying to actually get somewhere on this issue, but in a point of theatrics he came in here and moved a wedge motion to try to divide the place, to blow the place to pieces, to lose support all around the shop. We were really looking forward to being engaged in this process and getting somewhere, but no, we did not do that. Yesterday it was the wedge to blow support up; today it is forgetting to turn up to the chamber to vote. This is starting to show a pattern and on both issues it is extremely unsavoury.
—Order! Senator Joyce, you are starting to debate the amendment that was put before the chair. There is an appropriate time to do that. What we have in front of us is the fact that Senator Brown sought leave to have the amendment recommitted. If you wish to speak on that then you can, but you cannot debate the amendment. That was already dealt with on the floor of the chamber.
—I would like to speak on the process of recommittal.
—You did get leave to make a short statement.
—In both instances this recommittal is an extremely important thing. I am absolutely 100 per cent behind what Senator Mary Jo Fisher put up in that amendment. It is absolutely vital that people in the horticulture industry understand that there was a process here a short while ago where we had actually got somewhere and delivered something back to them that is vitally important for employment in that area. I ask Senator Brown to clearly understand the ramifications of what happens if he now changes that vote and changes that position. I think it should be clearly spelt out to all the people in those horticulture industries that what Senator Brown is about to do is to make so many of those industries unviable because of the overhead that will come on top of where they are currently.

"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-06-17,"—by leave—I want to refer to Hansard and quote what Senator Brown said in the Senate when Senator Scullion missed a vote earlier in the year:
… this does show the opposition is in some disarray. … My only advice to the opposition is you need to get yourself in order—
Those were his exact words in Hansard. I am not going to harp on this; I am just going to say that I said that night to now Minister Arbib, ‘Those who live in glass houses should never throw stones.’ It was only 10 minutes or so later that we had another division in which one of the Labor senators was not present—I think it was Senator Bishop. The point I make is that when we make a mistake Senator Brown gets up and gives us one large spray.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2009-06-17,"—by leave—Of course the opposition will be following the conventions and allowing this amendment to be recommitted. We are honourable when it comes to that. But it does highlight the hypocrisy of the Greens political movement in the way that Senator Brown, when any of us—not the Labor Party—happen to miss a vote of any sort, is most scathing—
—Sanctimonious.
—Thank you, Senator Fisher. He is sanctimonious in his approach. It is simply the same as the Greens political party generally. You will recall in the Queensland election campaign that they went out telling everyone they were going to save the Traveston Crossing dam, then they gave preferences to their mates in the Labor Party, who had committed to building the Traveston Crossing dam. It shows the hypocrisy of the Greens political movement.
Senator Abetz’s magnificent speech last night again highlights the hypocrisy of the Greens political movement. I am distressed about it in my state of Queensland and it is relevant to what is happening now in that the Greens say something to get a vote in the Queensland state election, promise they will hold up—they will ensure the Traveston Crossing dam does not go ahead—and then give preferences to the only political party committed to building that dam. As a result of Greens preferences and Greens support, the Labor Party was returned in Queensland and the Traveston Crossing dam will be built. Who do we thank for that?

Maybe Senator Brown would like to use my red scooter to get here on time, but I will not go there. This does smack of complete hypocrisy by the Greens. I am sick and tired of hearing them say some things that account for one side and when someone else makes a mistake they ping them something shocking. We are all going to make mistakes, and, fair is fair, we will recommit the vote and that is okay. I must say even the Hon. Don Chipp in his book warned Australia about the Greens ever having the balance of power.

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-06-17,"—This amendment concerns the default superannuation fund, where the Industrial Relations Commission makes a decision on who is going to have the default super fund for a particular award. The concern I have—and this debate came up last time—is about there being a fair and open process for how the Industrial Relations Commission chooses such a default fund. This is a very important issue, because when people join a new company maybe they should pay a lot more attention to their superannuation decision, but they do not, and most of the time they are left in the default fund. If we are going to be left with a default fund that is set up through awards, we certainly have to ask the question: how is that decision being made? How does the Industrial Relations Commission make a decision about which is going to be the default fund for that award? By what process is the decision made? Is there public scrutiny of it? Guess what: there is not.
In the last debate we had, I raised the issue about having a process where the Industrial Relations Commission has an open tender to allow everybody to have a fair go at competing. That is certainly good for making sure that we have market forces at work—which the Rudd government likes to use from time to time—rather than the Industrial Relations Commission using a process that is hidden, secret and not open and that certainly means that people are just a little more concerned about what is actually going on. It was quite a simple thing that I put forward last time. It was not supported in the chamber, and that is the chamber’s decision, but I am not going to give up on this issue. The Industrial Relations Commission should hold an open, public tender for the default super fund for each award. It is a big issue.
What I have got back is some review of the process again. I am looking for an absolute commitment from the Rudd government. I do not want some wishy-washy review; I want a guarantee that the Rudd government will ensure that the Industrial Relations Commission holds public tenders on a frequent basis—say, every three years—for the default fund for each award. It is a simple issue; it is not a complex one. It is a simple proposition. It has merit. I have spoken to a lot of people in the industry—some may not like it, but it has a lot of merit—about opening it up to industry funds, corporate funds and hybrids. It is competitive forces tendering, open tendering with open criteria that allow us to make sure that each award has the best possible default fund. It is an open tendering process that is held every three years so that, if things change over those three years, it can happen; you can allow the competitive forces to reopen it again.
It is a simple issue, and I want that commitment from the government. I have been after that commitment since the last time we spoke. I got some correspondence about another review. Great. That may get by for the public, but it does not get by me. I want a commitment that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will hold a public tendering process for the default super fund for each award rather than just nominating on the basis of who knows what criteria. If this commitment is not given, I am inclined to support the opposition in leaving it open to the employers to make that decision.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-17,"—The Greens are taking the same position on this amendment as we took when a similar amendment was put up during the substantive debate on the bill.

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—The government does not support the opposition’s amendment. I do not think that is any surprise. The AIRC has provided for default funds in modern awards. These are funds which an employer can pay into on behalf of the employee who has failed to exercise their right to nominate a fund of their own choosing. The commission sought the views of stakeholders on appropriate funds and has decided to allow any fund to which an employer was contributing at 12 September 2008 to be listed as a default fund.
I make the point that all Australian employees will continue to be entitled to choose their own superannuation fund when modern awards commence on 1 January 2010. Providing safety net protection for Australians who do not exercise superannuation choice of fund is important. Employers and employees are free to agree upon a different default fund to those set out in the modern award in any enterprise agreement that they make.
Senator Fielding, in relation to the question that you asked me, I know you have had discussions with Senator Sherry—not to your agreement, obviously—but certainly you can continue those discussions with Senator Sherry and also with the new minister, Minister Bowen.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-06-17,"—There was a letter from the Deputy Prime Minister to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It was referred to before in this debate. It was quite easy for the Deputy Prime Minister to pick up a pen and write a letter and say, quite rightly, that restaurants and caterers deserve special treatment. The Deputy Prime Minister or the Prime Minister could write a similar letter instructing the Industrial Relations Commission to have an open and fair process in deciding which is the default superannuation fund for each award. It could do that—it could absolutely do that. It is quite clear that they are quite happy to write to the Industrial Relations Commission and give it directions and instructions, but, when it comes to default superannuation, for some reason they do not want to open it up.
The government is happy to do a review. Maybe at the end of that review we will actually get to a common-sense process that does open up the decision-making process of the Industrial Relations Commission to work out which is the default fund. This involves very big dollars and very big business, and it affects most Australians when they change companies. Unfortunately, a lot of Australians do not pay close enough attention to their default superannuation fund when they start new employment because they have other things on their minds. It is a good process—it is good governance—to open this up to public scrutiny.
It is a simple thing to write a letter, as the Deputy Prime Minister has previously shown on a different issue, to instruct the Industrial Relations Commission. Answer me this question: why won’t you instruct the Industrial Relations Commission to hold a public tender on a frequent basis, a reasonable basis? If you want two years or you want four, I am happy to have that debate, but they should have an open, public, tendering process for the default super fund. I worked in this industry for a while; I know the issue. It is common sense. Can you answer the question: why won’t the Rudd government instruct the Industrial Relations Commission to have an open and fair process of selecting a default superannuation fund?",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

Quite clearly, what you are discussing has nothing to do with the amendment. As you know, it is a very complex issue, but the government is happy to discuss this further with you.
—Madam Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. It has to do with this amendment. It is talking about the default superannuation—

(Senator Hurley)—That is not a point of order.
—As I was saying, Senator, this is an extremely complex issue. It is a very important issue, and I understand your passion for it. Superannuation is something that the Labor Party has always been passionate about, given that it was former Prime Minister Keating who introduced that legislation.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—Is it not amazing that here we are discussing this legislation—one minute to midnight, so to speak, in relation to this amendment—and the government finally offers a meeting to Senator Fielding to discuss this issue? This was in fact canvassed by Senator Fielding in March this year—some three months ago—during the Fair Work Bill discussions. These issues were canvassed then. We as a coalition moved amendments then. Three months have elapsed, with no need to consider or treat this issue with the seriousness that now, all of a sudden, Senator Arbib tells us it deserves—only because they are desperate for a Senate vote today. What happened in the three months in between? Senator Fielding’s concerns were completely ignored and completely forgotten, and the issues that were raised three months ago were treated with contempt. And now, desperate for a vote, the government says, ‘We’ll finally open the door of Ms Gillard.’ It simply is not good enough.
A very, very reasonable question has been posed by Senator Fielding: why shouldn’t the AIRC go through such a process? Indeed, why won’t the government actually support our amendment which would allow the employer to have a bit of an individual say in superannuation funds as well? I think I know the reason in relation to the AIRC possibly not putting up these super funds for, if you like, public tender in each award. I think the AIRC would say, ‘We are not qualified to make those judgments. Our expertise is in matters of industrial relations, not in matters of superannuation investment funds and dividends, who gets what, what the fees are, what the management fees are et cetera.’ I think that is why the AIRC may well be reluctant. And, potentially, I can understand that. But I would have thought—and I do not know why I am doing the minister’s work for him here—that the AIRC could potentially, with the support of the government, outsource the issue of analysing superannuation fund tenders for the default award provisions. And, as a result, this proposal by Senator Fielding clearly could be implemented if Labor wanted to.
But I come back to the proposition that I have put here now on a number of occasions. It is amazing, isn’t it? If it is a deal with the restaurant and caterers, you do a special deal with Labor and you get a special outcome. Labor do not want a fair, open and transparent system in relation to the issues that I raised before in another discrete debate in this raft of amendments about allowing the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to determine the factors that might apply to a particular industry for the no detriment rule or for award modernisation. It is the same here: Labor do not want an open, transparent system for the default superannuation fund. Why? It is so the big unions can do big deals with big superannuation funds—rub shoulders; do the deals. That is what Sussex Street, New South Wales Labor, represented here by Senator Arbib, are all about. This is, unfortunately, Sydney, New South Wales Labor coming to Canberra to wreak the same sort of havoc on the nation as they have wreaked on New South Wales.
If the government were genuinely concerned about the best superannuation outcome for workers rather than doing the deals and the handshakes and then counting your fingers afterwards, and if Labor were genuinely concerned about the workers, why wouldn’t they allow the opposition amendment? I say this to Senator Fielding: there is nothing inconsistent between our amendment and what Senator Fielding is suggesting, and that is allowing the employer to choose a superannuation fund in the event the employee has not chosen one; and, if neither the employee nor the employer has chosen, you have a default fund and you go through the appropriate tender process. It just seems to me that, with the rise of companies that are based on all sorts of—let us use a neutral term—‘ethical’ grounds, be it environmental concerns or religious concerns et cetera, the question is: why wouldn’t you give those companies the right to invest their superannuation dollars in superannuation companies that have a similar ethic to that business? Why would you deny them that right in a country such as Australia, unless you were into the big deals—the big unions doing big deals with big superannuation companies? That is why the Labor Party are so determined not to allow choice in this vital area. Senator Fielding, I agree with you. I think that your idea has a lot to commend it. I simply say that the offer to discuss it should be of no comfort to you, because by the time you get to discuss it with Ms Gillard, if you ever do have a discussion with Ms Gillard about this—and I hope you never had that kiss, by the way—it will be after we have voted on this bill and then it will all be too late. That is why, the government having had more than three months to allow you the opportunity to discuss it, the promise from the table this morning by Senator Arbib is a very hollow one. I commend the opposition amendment to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2009-06-17,"—It has never been a problem of getting access to ministers, or even the Prime Minister. The issue is trying to get a common-sense result. I think that is the key, so that is the real issue here. I am genuine on this issue. I know that both sides are coming at this from a different angle. Maybe one comes from the industry side, industry funds, and one comes from the corporates. What I am trying to do is to open it up to get the best possible deal for the workers of Australia by making sure there is a competitive process, an open process and a fair process that allows a default fund that, when it is selected by the Industrial Relations Commission, is public, open and transparent so that we can be sure we are getting the best fund for that award—rather than it being broken up on history only. That is all. That is what the issue is about: making sure that we get the best possible default superannuation fund for that particular award.
There has been a lack of movement. Yes, I have had letters; yes, I have had correspondence; yes, we have had that. The issue is not about the ongoing interactions but about getting the result that I think is important for Australia and all workers when it comes to a default fund. That is the issue. I am not coming at it from being favourable to industry funds or corporates or even hybrids. I am about getting the best default fund for that particular award. And the best way of doing that is through a competitive, open tendering process. Given that the opposition’s amendment adds the words ‘but ensuring that employers can nominate any complying superannuation fund as the default fund’, I have not got anything else, and that seems to be another way of getting around it.

(Senator Hurley)—The question is that opposition amendment (6) on sheet 5817 to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009, moved by Senator Abetz, be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—I move opposition amendment (7) to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009:
(7)    Schedule 5, page 66 (after line 11), at the end of the Schedule, add:
Part 7—State‑based differences
Workplace Relations Act 1996
22  Section 576T
Repeal the section, substitute:
576T  Terms that contain State-based differences
         (1)    For a period of 5 years starting on the day on which a modern award commences, the award is to reflect the State and Territory differences in previously existing awards.
         (2)    If, at the end of the period of 5 years starting on the day on which a modern award commences, the modern award includes terms and conditions of employment that:
              (a)    are determined by reference to State or Territory boundaries; or
              (b)    do not have effect in each State and Territory;
those terms and conditions cease to have effect at the end of that period.
         (3)    The Commission may reduce the 5 year period referred to in subsection (1) only if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, having regard to:
              (a)    the views of the sector which the modern award is intended to cover; and
              (b)    the impact on employment within the sector which the modern award is intended to cover.
This amendment repeals the existing provisions and requires that modern awards are required to retain state based differences for a period of five years from when the modern award takes effect. This makes the five-year transition period the default position to be adopted by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission when making modern awards while affording it discretion to work to a lesser period where appropriate and having regard to the views of the affected parties and jobs within the relevant sector.
We believe that the amendment will work in the following way: the AIRC will be required when making a modern award to hear the views of the sector about the timing of phasing out state based differences and, in addition, about the impact on employment, which in our view is a very important consideration. After taking these matters into account, the commission may phase out state based differences over any period it sees fit, with the default period being a maximum of five years. There may be a lesser period stipulated if the impact on employment is negligible and the parties are happy to phase out any differences in a lesser period. For example, the retail sector may say: ‘We will have an increase in overtime penalties on Sundays by 25 per cent. At the moment, given the current economic situation, that would cause us to lose staff or reduce trading times. Let’s transition in the penalty rate equally at an additional five per cent over five years.’ The retail sector may also say: ‘Let’s transition it at zero per cent in year 1, two per cent in year 2, three per cent in year 3, 10 per cent in year 4 and 10 per cent in year 5.’
Other sectors, such as mining, for example, already have a federal award, and the impact of award modernisation may be negligible. The sector may agree that the impact on employment is also minimal and that the award should come into total effect straightaway.
The ability to phase out the state based differences, or transitioning, is referred to at item 12 of the latest award modernisation request. The AIRC has set aside specific time to hear from sectors about the timing of transition. Therefore it just seems to the coalition to make sense to provide that flexibility to ensure that we do not have a further attack on the cost of employment in this country.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—The government is not supporting this amendment. This amendment would entrench state based differences in awards for five years. All such differences would cease to operate after five years. This ‘big bang’ approach is a recipe for chaos. It would deprive employers and employees of a sensible and smooth transition to the new system and would prolong current inconsistencies in terms and conditions. By contrast, the government has created an orderly process. This process is already underway and the commission is well advanced in consulting with stakeholders in developing the provisions.
The AIRC is able to determine award-specific transitional arrangements after consideration of submissions from interested parties. In doing so, it is open to the commission to use the full five-year period to phase in these arrangements where appropriate. Importantly, this recognises that the representatives of employers and employees are best placed to develop transitional arrangements that take account of any particular characteristics of their industry or occupation, including the staging of any phase-in arrangements and the period over which phasing in occurs.
This amendment would pull the rug out from under the AIRC and send the parties back to the drawing board, and for no real purpose. The commission is already acutely aware of the need to consider a smooth and orderly transition. It is acutely aware of the need to ensure a gradual adjustment to any cost increase. Passing this amendment would not make any difference to this but would create massive inconvenience for all concerned. For these reasons, again, the government opposes the amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—With great respect: I do not know if the minister was reading from briefing notes, but I would invite him to listen to what was actually said and have a look at exactly what the amendment is. To suggest that this would entrench state awards for five years is completely fallacious. It is wrong. I said in my introductory comments in support of the amendment that it would be up to the AIRC to phase out—and I even gave the example of the mining sector, which might not even want any transition period—but that there should be flexibility. So to say that this would be entrenching it for five years is patently wrong. I do not know where the minister got that idea from.
Further, to suggest that we would be pulling the rug out from under the AIRC—I think that was the term used by the minister—is also patently wrong. I said in my comments—and the amendment will bear it out—that the AIRC may phase out state based differences over any period it sees fit, with the default period being five years. In other words, the AIRC would be empowered. That is hardly pulling the rug out from underneath it. So the two reasons the minister tried to give in opposing this amendment have fallen flat. Undoubtedly he will come up with another reason, because the idea of flexibility is something that Labor clearly have an ideological difficulty with.
Given the propensity of the minister to quote, I quote the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who said on 11 June:
The Government’s award modernisation process should not come at the expense of increasing employers’ costs or introducing new or additional inflexibilities. If it does, the Government should have no hesitation in directing the tribunal to have another go.
It would be a perverse outcome that employers, when faced with the alternatives, may prefer the former array of “outdated” awards.
The government’s ham-fisted approach in relation to this transition bill is unfortunately going very much to a scenario where employers will say that the outdated or ‘horse and buggy’ era of awards that the minister referred to may well be preferred to that which the Labor Party, with their usual spin, are now describing as award modernisation.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I just respond by saying to Senator Abetz that all the necessary flexibility is already in the system. The AIRC has taken all its submissions on the basis of the current laws, passed in March 2008—passed, I might say, by the opposition too. If this amendment were passed, the AIRC would presumably have to tear up the many submissions already received and rehear the issues, for no practical effect. The AIRC already has the flexibility it needs to phase in over the five years. Again, that is why we are opposing the amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—The argument before was: ‘It’s going to entrench state awards for five years; that’s why we’re against it.’ Now, having had that argument exposed as flawed, the minister has changed the argument to say: ‘There’s no need for this amendment because the flexibility that we are seeking is already in the legislation.’ It is that sort of mixed message that is confusing employers and causing great uncertainty within the economy. It is little wonder that unemployment is heading north at a very, very fast rate. Time is short.

That is just one of the arguments—not the whole argument but one of the arguments—that I spoke about. But I will resist any further comments as well.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Abetz’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments (8) to (10) to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009:
(8)    Schedule 22, page 257 (after line 15), at the end of section 137A, add:
Application of right of entry penalties to employers
         (8)    An employer who refuses entry to an employee organisation on the grounds of seeking an order or interim order under this section, and acts expeditiously and in good faith in seeking that order, is not subject to right of entry penalties under Part 3‑4 of this Act.
(9)    Schedule 22, page 257 (after line 32), after paragraph 137B(1)(e), insert:
            (ea)    the views of the employer; and
(10)  Schedule 22, page 257 (after line 33), after subsection137B(1), insert:
      (1A)    For the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), any agreement or understanding includes prior judicial and administrative decisions under previous legislation or involving related or predecessor employee organisations.
The purpose of these amendments it to provide for the application of right of entry penalties to be suspended where an employer has acted expeditiously and in good faith in seeking a representation order. Allow me to seek to explain. Where an employer has a site and there is a dispute about union representation, the employer can seek the assistance of Fair Work Australia to resolve the dispute. While this is occurring, our amendment would protect the employer from being penalised for stopping entry to union officials as that employer would not know which union is entitled to represent employees until after the union representation order has been made by Fair Work Australia. A key requirement is that the employer would have had to act quickly and in good faith to seek an order and cannot use it as a way of shutting unions out in nefarious circumstances.
Our amendments would require Fair Work Australia to have regard to the views of the employer when making an order. The current provision focuses on the nuances of union rules and may result in a lengthy proceeding about historical coverage and such matters. An employer should be entitled to make its views known to Fair Work Australia, and Fair Work Australia should be required to take those views into account just as it is already required to take into account the views of employees.
Our amendments would also require Fair Work Australia to have regard to previous demarcation decisions and outcomes. There is a large history of such cases and there is a danger that Fair Work Australia may have to go over old ground once again, which is unnecessary and inefficient. Our amendments merely allow Fair Work Australia to take account of those previous decisions and outcomes when making any new orders. This will allow union representation orders to be obtained much more quickly and effectively while minimising any operational disruption, job delays, job losses or productivity. In short, the reason we are moving these amendments is once again to assist small business in this vexed area of union right of entry and representations. There are clearly circumstances that can be foreseeable where the employer can act in good faith and simply not know what is required and, as a result, if they act expeditiously and go to Fair Work Australia, the issue can be resolved. In those circumstances a small businesses should not have the threat of penalties being imposed in that very small, very discrete area of circumstance that I have just detailed. I commend opposition amendments (8) to (10).",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-17,"—The Greens do not support the provision in the bill for new representation orders and consequently it will come as no surprise that we do not support the opposition amendments. As I said in my speech on the second reading, the purported reasoning for these new orders is to deal with the new rules for right of entry and the fears expressed by business that demarcation disputes between unions would increase as a result. However, we note that the new orders are not limited to right of entry disputes; indeed, there may not even need to be any actual dispute at all. We note the amendments the government moved in the House that clarify the dispute need only be threatened, pending or probable, and, like the senators who contributed to the majority report of the committee inquiry, we do not believe additional representation orders are necessary. We believe they will have the potential to breach the rights of workers to freedom of association and therefore believe they do not have a place in our industrial relations system. So, as we do not support the provisions in the bill, we will not support these amendments.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-17,"—I indicated in my second reading contribution that the coalition’s proposed changes to 137A appeared to be in response to a request for greater clarity from persons submitting to the committee inquiry. Could the government address those concerns? I did indicate the rationale in relation to the changes to 137B, especially as to the views of an employer in relation to the making of an order. It does not seem so clear to me, but perhaps Senator Abetz could further clarify that. I thought it was actually covered broadly in the legislation in any event. I do have a concern in relation to rights of entry, given the debate we had on the previous bill. I think it is important that that not be held up particularly in relation to the issue of outworkers, something I have been quite concerned about. If I could get some further clarification from both the government and the opposition, I would appreciate that.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—Senator Xenophon, the first question you raised was actually raised in the House, and the government have moved an amendment in the House which will have that effect. So my understanding is that that matter has been resolved.
We are opposing opposition amendment (8). This amendment allows employers to refuse right of entry when a business is subject to a demarcation dispute, which would deprive employees of access to their union at the workplace merely because there is an application for a representation order. This amendment is draconian and unnecessary. It would create a perverse incentive to make such applications and delay the resolution of those applications in order to avoid a union seeking access to its members. This could, for example, be misused by an employer in a bargaining situation to prevent a union representing people. But it is important to note that where a demarcation issue is causing difficulties there is already the capacity to seek an interim representation order. For these reasons, the amendment is opposed.
Amendment (9) requires employers’ views to be considered when making a representation order. This is unnecessary as the consequences for the employer of not making an order are already a factor that Fair Work Australia must consider. An amendment requiring greater regard for existing representation orders is also unnecessary as the bill already prevents Fair Work Australia from making a new order that would be inconsistent with an existing representation order.
The government oppose amendment (10). We believe this amendment is unnecessary. The bill already requires Fair Work Australia to have regard to any development agreement or understanding of which Fair Work Australia becomes aware that deals with the right of an organisation of employees to represent the industrial interests of a particular class of employees. This is dealt with in schedule 22, part 3, 137B of this bill. As well, the government has moved amendment (15), which allows for the recognition of a demarcation order made in a state industrial relations system. These provisions make the amendment unnecessary and confusing and it is therefore opposed.

(Senator Trood)—Senator Arbib, you said you were opposing opposition amendments (8) and (10). I take it you are also opposed to (9); is that correct?",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—I will respond to Senator Xenophon. In relation to our amendment seeking to include the views of the employer, I would have thought that it would not be a matter of concern for anybody in this chamber. Employers are actually the people doing the employing, and I would have thought it would make good sense for the employers to have a say. If I understood the minister correctly, he said that this would be allowed anyway. If that is what the minister is saying, the worst case that can be made against this particular amendment is that we will be protecting employers with a belt and braces and there is nothing to undermine the regime. We are not so sure that the employers have got the belt on the trousers courtesy of the government legislation and that is why we are seeking to affix the braces. We believe there has in fact been no cogent argument other than it might just be otiose or duplicating. If that is the only danger, for the sake of looking after the employers, we see no difficulty with that.
In relation to Senator Xenophon’s concerns about outworkers, firstly, as I understand the regime, there is a specific, separate regime in relation to right of entry dealing with outworkers. Secondly, as I understand the industry, there is no real difficulty in determining which union represents those workers. They are very clearly looked after by one particular union. Thirdly, I would say to Senator Xenophon that our amendments will only apply—and I stress this—when there is an application already before Fair Work Australia to determine the rights of representation. When a proactive step has been taken and an application is already before Fair Work Australia for their consideration but for which there has not yet been a determination, to visit a penalty upon an employer who is confused but has acted in good faith and is saying, ‘I’m waiting on Fair Work Australia to make a determination, but I honestly do not believe this union to be covering the workers,’ I would have thought that an employer in those circumstances should avoid having a penalty applied to them.
That is the very discrete area that we are looking at in relation to our amendments. I commend them to the Senate. If Senator Xenophon has any other questions, I would say to him: given the hour, only ask them if there is a real chance of me being able to convince you to vote for the amendments.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-17,"—I have nothing further to ask Senator Abetz—
—I get the drift!
—but I do have a question for the minister. I do not support the amendments but I understand the concern of the opposition on the views of the employer. The government has said that that has already been squared off in other parts of the legislation. Can the minister give an unambiguous undertaking that in the review of the act that will occur in two years time this specific issue on how the views of employers are taken into account with respect to demarcation disputes will be specifically looked at and that it will be something that will be the subject of not only review but reporting, taking into account its operation with respect to this particular issue?",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,—We commit to examining those provisions. If there is ever any evidence that an employer’s views are not being taken into consideration then of course we will certainly look at that.,SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—The minister has just countenanced the very real possibility that an employer’s views might not be taken into account. That will be reviewed in two years time and in the event that that is proven to be the case they will then change the legislation. That is exactly the point I was seeking to make, Senator Xenophon, and that is why I would commend to you having our braces on this piece of legislation—because even the government doubts the efficacy of the belt that they say they are providing for these trousers for the employers. We are saying that our braces will actually work. And if after two years when the legislation is reviewed it is shown that the braces are no longer needed then that is fine—repeal our amendment then. But in the meantime the concession, I think unwittingly made by the minister, clearly shows the need for this amendment.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-17,"—I am more of a belt than a braces man, and I think that the belt here ought to work. I did not quite interpret it in that way, to address the point made by Senator Abetz. As I understand it there will be a general review, and this issue of how it works in the context of employers’ views being taken into account would be one of the matters that would be looked at. If there are ways to improve the system and if there are indeed anomalies, they could be dealt with. But I am satisfied that what is proposed will provide sufficient safeguards and that to support this amendment at this stage in the current context could lead to some ambiguity, from the discussions I have had with the government in relation to this, with some unintended consequences. I am assured by the minister’s assurances and I will stick with the belt not the braces this time.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—I wonder if the minister would be so kind as to share with the whole Senate what the ambiguity and unintended consequences might be of this particular amendment. It just seems to me that when a government is flummoxed, does not have an argument and cannot put forward something cogent then resort is had to ‘ambiguity and unintended consequences’ as the catch-all argument as to why you should reject an amendment when there is no other argument on offer. So I would be interested to hear what the minister has to offer in that regard.

(Senator Trood)—We will hear from you when you are ready, Minister. The minister has the call. But perhaps, in light of his indisposition, I might call Senator Abetz.
—The minister has needed all this time to find out what the ambiguity and uncertainties might be. It is a pity the Hansard does not record the time taken through these long silences to indicate the difficulty the minister has with this particular matter.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I am just trying to get you a detailed answer, Senator Abetz. I might just take another second and then come back to you.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—We believe that this would create an imbalance in terms of ‘what about the employees views and how would they be taken into account?’. It also duplicates existing obligation. Again, the inconsistency there is in relation to how employees are taken into account. That is why we are opposing it and that is the answer to your question.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—I daresay that out there in radio land a lot of people are chuckling at the moment in relation to that response. The assertion was that there was ambiguity and uncertainty with the opposition amendments. We had this embarrassingly long, deathly silence and then finally the minister comes up with, and is armed with, this absolutely explosive response: it will create imbalance. That is just another word. Undoubtedly someone looked up a thesaurus or something and said, ‘What’s another word for ambiguity or uncertainty?’ And then they said, ‘Let’s try the word imbalance this time.’
—Next it will be, ‘It’s the vibe.’
—Yes, that lawyer from The Castle that I was able to refer to last night in another speech referring to Senator Brown’s three-quarters of a million dollar slush fund comes to mind, Senator Fifield. It’s the vibe. That is what Minister Arbib is relying on here—the vibe. He says that there will be an imbalance. But I cannot see how there is an imbalance by allowing employer representation. At worst, as the minister said before, employers’ views are already there and are already taken into account; but we are told that the factors to be taken into account are the wishes of the members of the workplace group, and the extent to which particular employee organisations represent the employees in the workplace and the nature of that representation.
So it seems to me that we still do not really have a situation where employers are looked after in 137B. The employees’ views are already in the legislation, as I read out. Just for clarity, that is in 137B(1), subclauses (b) and (c). So the employees’ views are taken into account. I would be interested if the minister could point out in that regime of (a) to (f) where the employers’ views are taken into account. Fair Work Australia will take into account the consequences of not making the order for any employer or organisation concerned, the wishes of members of the workplace and the extent to which particular employee organisations represent the employees in the workplace and the nature of that representation. Why would it create an imbalance if you allowed the employers to have a say as well? This is just a one-way street and, if I might say, that is one of the tests that I have said we apply to this legislation and to amendments. We ask: does it impact small business or jobs adversely and does it have an unwarranted increase in union power? Clearly this allows the union to have a say but not the employer or employer organisations.
I think the minister then, after the word ‘imbalance’, relied on the word ‘inconsistency’ again but has not actually explained to us the inconsistency. Time is dragging on. I am sure I will not convince the minister otherwise, but for anybody who wants to study the development of public policy I suggest to them that these last few pages of Hansard would not be a good read for them in relation to government responses to opposition questions as to the detail of legislation.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—In relation to the question that Senator Abetz raised about employers, under 137B(1)(e), in order for Fair Work Australia to consider this they will need to take the views of employers into account.
—Where?
—That is (e). For Fair Work Australia to be able to consider it, they will need to take into account the views of the employers.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—Given the minister’s response, let us go through this in some considerable detail. Proposed section 137B(1) says, amongst other things:
In considering whether to make an order under subsection 137A(1) in relation to a particular workplace group, FWA must have regard to—
a number of things, including—
the wishes of the members of the workplace group …
Where on earth does it say in that section that Fair Work Australia must have regard to the wishes of the employer? It does not say that anywhere. What it does say is that Fair Work Australia may have regard to ‘the consequences of not making the order for any employer, employees or organisation concerned’. But that does not mean that they need to take the wishes of the employer into account. If that is what subsection (e) means, why do you need the specific subsection (b), which says that Fair Work Australia ‘must have regard to the wishes of the members of the workplace group’?
If this is going to be dealt with equitably, you would then be saying the opposition amendment is not needed but that you will delete subsection (b). We say it does make good sense to take into account the wishes of the members of the workplace group, and to specifically state that, but we also say it makes good sense to specifically state that the wishes of the employer of that particular workplace group should be taken into account as well. With great respect, Minister, what you are asserting is not in the legislation. Can I say to Senator Xenophon that the belt he has been told about by the government is fraying and I am not sure it is going to be doing the job that he was told it would do.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—Of course, this has a direct effect on the worker. It comes back to freedom of association. That is why the workplace group is mentioned. But can we just go back to (e) again. For Fair Work Australia to consider the consequences of not making the order for any employer, they therefore must consider the views of employers. How can they take that into consideration without taking into consideration the views of employers? That is obviously just common sense, Senator.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—If it is so commonsensical, the minister might explain to us why you have subparagraph (b), because subparagraph (e) refers to:
the consequences of not making the order for any employer, employees or organisation concerned …
I happen to agree with the minister that subparagraph (e) is a cover-all. It covers employers, employees and organisations concerned, which I assume could be either employer organisations or employee organisations, and covers the field quite neatly. But what is also in the clause is subclause (b), that Fair Work Australia ‘must have regard to the wishes of the members of the workplace group’, so why not the wishes of the employer? You cannot have this argument both ways. If the employer is sufficiently catered for in subclause (e), can you explain why the employee is not sufficiently covered in subclause (e)? Why do you need this—to use my own analogy—belt and braces approach for the purposes of employees but definitely not for employers?",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—Senator, I think I answered that question directly when I talked about the effect this will have on workers in relation to freedom of association with regard to (b). But can I just add that 137B(1)(e) requires Fair Work Australia to consider the consequences of not making the order for any employer, employees or organisation. It is reasonable to look at the consequences on an employer. Not all employees are members of a union. We look at the wishes of members and consequences to other employees and, of course, the employer.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2009-06-17,"—I think I am going to save myself breath from now on because clearly the minister does not have a response to this. I fully agree with the minister that there are employees that are not members of unions. Subclause (e) says:
(e) the consequences of not making the order for any employer, employees or organisation concerned;
This clearly countenances employees. It does not just say, ‘employees who are members of a trade union’. It says ‘employees’ generically, irrespective of whether they are a member of a union or not. So, once again, the argument falls over. Having started off with ambiguity, uncertainty, imbalance and all the other excuses, with great respect, the rationale does not fit. But of course we know why the minister is insisting, in the face of overwhelming logic, and it is this. It is the ideology of the Labor Party and the fact that they know that they bought their way to power courtesy of the trade union movement’s contributions at the last election. Whenever there is a possibility to favour the trade union movement in legislation they will do so, even if it is at the expense of employers.
As I have said a number of times in this debate, employers are actually called employers for a very simple reason: they are the people that employ our fellow Australians. When employers lose confidence in the system, you see unemployment rise, and that is something that is starting to hang around the neck of this government in larger and larger proportions each and every single day. It is because of legislation such as this, not only because of the global financial crisis.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—In response—and again I note that you were very brief given the time—we think this legislation does the job. As you have said in relation to subclause (e), it covers all. As you have also said, it does provide for the views of employers to be taken into consideration. It does do that. We are not going to redraft this on the floor of the Senate. Of course we have faith that Fair Work Australia will interpret it in the way it is written and certainly that employers’ views will be taken into consideration.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

I daresay, despite the overwhelming logic and good argument, Senator Xenophon will not find his way clear to support the opposition amendments. As a result, I would not wish anybody to think that the fact that we will not be seeking to divide is an indication that we do not hold a very strong view in relation to this. I believe that the discussion in the Hansard will show that the coalition has put a very strong case forward, but given the time constraints we will not be seeking to divide.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-17,"—I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 5818 to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009:
(1)    Schedule 3, page 25 (after line 29), after item 9, insert:
9A  All kinds of transitional instrument: application of better off overall test
(1)    FWA may make a determination under this item on application by a person covered by a transitional instrument.
(2)    If FWA is satisfied that the transitional instrument would not pass the better off overall test in section 193 of the FW Act, FWA may make any order that FWA considers appropriate to remedy the situation, including:
              (a)    an order terminating the instrument;
              (b)    an order varying the instrument to comply with the better off overall test.
This amendment relates to allowing Fair Work Australia to terminate transitional instruments that would not pass the better off overall test. We believe the biggest gap in the government’s transitional arrangements is letting unfair Work Choices AWAs continue virtually indefinitely. I raised this during my speech on the second reading and in fact raised it in debate on the forward with fairness bill in March last year. The ALP, quite rightly, spent the previous three years strenuously opposing Work Choices AWAs and their ability to undermine the award safety net. AWAs that ripped away wages and conditions from workers were at the forefront of the campaign against Work Choices and of course the ALP election victory. Yet the ALP is prepared to let those workers continue to be ripped off and denied collective bargaining until their agreements pass their nominal expiry date, and that can be as late as 2013. As I said in my speech on the second reading, Work Choices is not quite dead yet. It will have a slow death and it will not be dead until the last AWA is terminated.
The Greens do not believe the presence of statutory individual agreements that fall below the safety net represent a fair and just industrial relations system. The Australian Greens have held a consistent position since before the last election that substandard agreements, individual or collective, should be able to be terminated and the employee employed under the more favourable conditions of the award or a superior collective agreement that covers the employer. We moved amendments in respect of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward to with Fairness) Bill 2008 to provide a mechanism for employees to terminate unfair AWAs. These amendments were unfortunately not supported by the government and many workers have stayed on unfair AWAs ever since.
Workers must be given the opportunity to terminate agreements that do not meet the conditions of the new safety net. I include here, too, a number of employees who were employed on AWAs subsequent to the ALP being elected and then bringing in their legislation. The point of a safety net is that it is universal. It provides for wages and conditions that we as a community believe are the minimum that all workers should enjoy. The new, modern safety net must therefore be available to all workers. The Greens amendment provides for employees to apply to Fair Work Australia and for it to terminate or vary an agreement that would not pass the better off overall test. It is an amendment implementing recommendation No. 1 of the majority ALP senators’ report on this bill.
We believe that Australian workers must not be condemned to working under recognised substandard conditions. We do not believe they should be under those conditions any longer. We believe that the government had an opportunity to fix that. They have not taken it and we cannot understand, quite frankly, why they believe it is okay for certain workers to be under substandard conditions when the government had the opportunity to ensure that they are not. Because the government did not take that opportunity, this amendment provides for that. Nobody can say that AWAs are dead until workers are off them, which could be as far away as 2013. That puts paid to the government’s claims that AWAs are dead. They are not dead and the government have not done anything about getting those workers who are still subject to them off them. This amendment does that.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—This amendment is based in large part on a recommendation made by the majority of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations in its report into the inquiry into the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009. The government did not agree with that recommendation and accordingly will not be supporting this amendment. From 1 July until 31 December 2009, enterprise agreements will be assessed under the current ‘no disadvantage’ test, not the ‘better off overall’ test. This amendment would require Fair Work Australia to assess workplace instruments under different tests, depending on when they were made. This is simply not feasible from an administrative standpoint.
This amendment would also in effect require Fair Work Australia to retrospectively apply a test against instruments that, for the most part, have operated for some time. The government believes that it is simply not reasonable to shift the goalposts on employers and employees by having Fair Work Australia unilaterally terminate or vary agreements that were validly made between the parties under the laws in place at the time. It is true that under Work Choices employees were placed on unfair agreements. The Fair Work Act will consign those agreements to history. However, the government is mindful of the need to give certainty to all parties. The bill provides that once these agreements have reached their nominal expiry date, all of the options of the Fair Work system, including good faith bargaining, become available. As well, employees who are on substandard Work Choices agreements will have the full benefits of the National Employment Standards from 1 January 2010 as well as entitlement to be paid the relevant minimum wage for the employee’s classification. This will be the case whether or not the agreement has passed its nominal expiry date.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2009-06-17,"—by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments (2) and (3) on sheet 5818 to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009:
(2)    Schedule 3, item 18, page 29 (line 4) to page 30 (line 7), omit the item, substitute:
18  Individual agreement-based transitional instruments: automatic termination when enterprise agreement comes into operation
(1)    This item applies if:
              (a)    an enterprise agreement (the proposed enterprise agreement) is made that covers the employee and the employer; and
              (b)    the proposed enterprise agreement comes into operation.
(2)    If the employee and the employer are covered by an individual agreement-based transitional instrument, that agreement is terminated when the proposed enterprise agreement comes into operation.
(3)    Schedule 13, item 2, page 166 (lines 9 to 37), omit subitems (2) and (3), substitute:
(2)    The employee is taken, for the purposes of the FW Act, to be at that time an employee who is or will be covered by an enterprise agreement or a proposed enterprise agreement.
These two amendments pick up what we think is a persuasive argument made by Professor Andrew Stuart that new enterprise agreements should automatically replace any individual transitional arrangements. Again, these amendments implement a recommendation from the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations inquiry into the bill. The amendments provide for AWAs or ITEAs to be terminated when an enterprise agreement covering an employee on an AWA or an ITEA comes into operation. Amendment (3) allows for employees on AWAs covered by a proposed enterprise agreement to engage in bargaining for that agreement.
Work Choices AWAs serve two purposes. They allow employers to provide substandard wages and conditions but also to de-unionise workplaces and thwart collective bargaining. The Greens amendments are an extension of the primary role of collective bargaining under the Fair Work Act. We believe that all workers who will be covered by an enterprise agreement should have the ability to participate in the negotiations for that agreement and to have that agreement apply to them. The conditional termination provisions in the bill do not go far enough in achieving this aim. The requirement for employers to agree to a conditional termination where the individual transition instrument has not passed its nominal expiry date means that few of these workers who are stuck on unfair AWAs for the next four years will have the opportunity to collectively bargain.
Both unions and employer groups indicated to the Senate inquiry that the conditional termination provisions would not be effective. We must remember that the workers stuck on the worst AWAs are likely to be the most vulnerable workers. Conditional termination provisions relying on the support of employers are going to be useless for this particular group of employees and workers. The amendments put forward by the Greens are designed to ensure that those workers who have lost the most under Work Choices have the best chance to regain fair conditions of employment. We do not want to see workers subjected to grossly inferior agreements for any longer than is absolutely necessary. I have articulated in this place, in debates on the various pieces of legislation on industrial relations, how Work Choices has impacted most significantly on vulnerable workers, and these amendments are particularly focused on those vulnerable workers. I commend the amendments to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—The government will oppose Australian Greens amendments (2) and (3). The government considers that the transitional arrangements contained in the bill will ensure a fair, certain and orderly transition to the new system for all employees and employers, including those covered by AWAs and ITEAs. The bill gives certainty to employees and employers by providing that AWAs and ITEAs will continue to apply until they are terminated. Once an AWA or ITEA has been terminated, an enterprise agreement that covers the employee and employer would then apply. It is important to emphasise that as soon as an AWA or ITEA reaches its nominal expiry dates either party may terminate the agreement unilaterally 90 days after Fair Work Australia has made its approval decision. The parties may also agree to terminate an AWA or ITEA at any time.
In addition to these termination provisions, the bill also provides that employees and employers covered by an AWA or ITEA may enter into a conditional termination which would enable the employee to fully participate in and benefit from collective bargaining for the proposed new enterprise agreement whether or not their individual agreement has passed its nominal expiry date. Conditional terminations will facilitate the orderly transition of employees and employers covered by an AWA or ITEA to a new enterprise agreement by terminating the individual agreement as soon as the proposed new enterprise agreement comes into operation.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

I must admit I cannot see them being effective either, particularly for that group of workers we are talking about who are most vulnerable. I know the minister will have seen the research that showed that the workers most affected by Work Choices were our most vulnerable workers in the community. They are the ones who have been subjected to no bargaining and unfair AWAs and have lost the most wages and conditions. You are talking about a group of people who are in situations where their employers are highly unlikely to use the conditional termination provisions. So I am asking why the government thinks the provisions are going to be effective when employers, employees and unions have indicated that they do not think they are going to be effective. A lot of this depends on that provision being effective. I would really like to know why the government thinks these provisions are going to be effective, particularly for that group of our most vulnerable workers.",SENATE,<title>FAIR WORK (STATE REFERRAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER AMENDMENTS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1

I asked why you do not think this process would be orderly if one of the reasons for not supporting it is that you wanted an orderly process and you promi-sed an orderly process. One of the issues that you raised in response to my previous question was the nominal expiry date. Can you confirm that in some instances the nominal expiry date is in fact 2013?

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—There is a simple answer to that. To do what you say—to take away all the conditions under an agreement, an AWA or a ITEA, and replace it with a collective agreement—would mean those workers would not get a vote on it, so they would lose those conditions.

—And the coalition does not support these amendments!

I suppose you did make the comment that you were following in my footsteps. At the beginning of the debate last night I did not say we were opposing all your amendments, so I suppose I should have done so and not kept you in suspense. It would have been fairer. I do agree.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on a matter of public interest. A report was recently tabled by the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Communications and the Arts called The reporting of sports news and the emergence of digital media. The ECA committee conducted four public hearings as part of this inquiry, with particular reference, among other things, to:
(a) The balance of commercial and public interests in the reporting and broadcasting of sports news;
(b) The nature of sports news reporting in the digital age, and the effect of new technologies (including video streaming on the Internet, archived photo galleries and mobile devices) on the nature of sports news reporting;
(c) Whether and why sporting organisations want digital reporting of sports regulated, and what should be protected by such regulation;
(d) The appropriate balance between sporting and media organisations’ respective commercial interests in the issue;
               …              …              …
(f) The appropriate balance between the public’s right to access alternative sources of information using new types of digital media, and the rights of sporting organisations to control or limit access to ensure a fair commercial return or for other reasons;
               …              …              …
(h) The current accreditation processes for journalists and media representatives at sporting events, and the use of accreditation for controlling reporting on events; and
(i) Options other than regulation or commercial negotiation (such as industry guidelines for sports and news agencies in sports reporting, dispute resolution mechanisms and codes of practice) to manage sports news to balance commercial interests and public interests.
The inquiry provided the opportunity for issues of concern to both media organisations and sporting bodies to be raised. The ECA committee received 43 submissions and heard evidence from media organisations and agencies and sporting bodies and representative organisations. The convergence of media technologies and the emergence of new media platforms have created new opportunities for news media organisations, sports broadcasters and sporting organisations, bringing with them challenges as existing businesses and organisations attempt to adapt to the new media environment.
It is fair to say from evidence presented to the committee that these changes to the media landscape have led to some conflict as stakeholders endeavour to avail themselves of the new opportunities as they emerge. It is important to point out, however, that there were areas of common ground, including agreement that the delivery of news had been radically affected by the emergence of digital media and that public or audience expectations of news media had changed. Both sporting and media organisations believe that there is a need for news coverage of sport and wish for sports news reporting to continue. I am sure that sports reporters and presenters, sporting organisations, media organisations and the general public are pleased with that agreement. Both sporting and media organisations also acknowledge the commercial benefits of reporting sports news.
The committee believed that freedom of the press is as important in the new media environment as it ever was, and this includes ensuring the media have access to events and places, as well as having the freedom to report news about those events and from those places. While all participants in the inquiry indicated their support for a free media, it was apparent that giving practical effect to that principle, in particular in relation to access to events, is presenting some challenges in the new media environment. Having a free media is crucial to any healthy democracy. While the commercial interests of sporting bodies are of significance, issues raised in submissions and, in particular, in evidence presented to the committee showed a marked increase in restrictions on the freedom of the media with regard to access to sporting events. In some cases, this included the imposition of restrictions on how news is reported.
As suggested by the title of the inquiry, a significant consideration for those involved in hearings was the way the delivery of news, including sport, has been evolving as digital and online formats have taken hold across the media landscape. These new platforms have created new opportunities for engaging the public across the scope of stakeholders from sporting bodies to news media outlets and sports broadcasters. But these new opportunities have also spawned new conflicts between the interest groups as each side of the debate sees the other as encroaching on its traditional turf.
With a free press comes responsibility, and there are few who would argue against a journalists code of ethics. The Media Alliance journalists code of ethics overriding principle states:
Respect for truth and the public’s right to information are fundamental principles of journalism.
Journalists—
… search, disclose, record, question, entertain, comment and remember. They inform citizens and animate democracy … they scrutinise power, but also exercise it, and should be accountable.
The industrial and professional body representing journalists, the Media Alliance, acknowledges that technological advances mean that demand is overwhelming for continuous news of important sporting events on multiple platforms and that existing legislation allows fair use of data, footage and pictures from sporting events to be used for news purposes.
The Media Alliance says that it would be opposed to any regulation that would lead to a statutory body deciding what is considered to be legitimate news coverage of a sporting event. It believes that news organisations need to strike a balance with sporting bodies as to what is and is not considered fair use of material from sporting events. It is of the view also that the news industry, through the alliance code of ethics and the Press Council’s complaints procedure, has shown it is able to self-regulate. It says that this should continue and news organisations and sporting bodies should continue to negotiate in good faith over what is and what is not considered to be legitimate news coverage.
Even before sports news and entertainment gets to the point of being disseminated there is really prickly ground, particularly in the realm of media accreditation agreements. Evidence presented to the inquiry highlighted some stringent media accreditation processes demanded by some sporting bodies, which appear to be smothering media outlets’ abilities to disseminate the news. As the inquiry report states:
Some news media organisations claimed that sporting organisations were attempting to use accreditation agreements as a means “to alter or even displace the fair dealing provisions contained in the Copyright Act, the public policy underlying it and the right of news organisations to exercise their rights as copyright owners in the material they create”
                   …              …              …
The committee does accept that in some cases media organisations may be testing the boundaries of what constitutes news, and some sporting organisations are “testing the boundaries” of what can reasonably be asked of news reporting organisations in their accreditation agreements.
So the committee has recommended that media and sporting bodies—the stakeholders generally—negotiate a set of principles for news media access to sporting events for bona fide journalists, including photojournalists and news agencies, to be able to access sporting events regardless of the technological platform.
This is just one of the recommendations of the committee. The committee also urges the government to take into account challenges presented by digital media to sports organisations’ current and future revenue prospects and options. It recommends that the current Crawford review of sports pay particular attention to the capacity of sport to invest in digital innovation. I encourage those interested in sport and the media to log on to the ECA website to access the report and read the submissions presented as part of the inquiry, because it really makes for interesting reading and highlights the arguments of the main stakeholders.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Sports News and Digital Media</title>,Miscellaneous,2,1
"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2009-06-17,"—Yesterday in question time, Senator Siewert asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I have some further information which I seek leave to incorporate.
Leave granted.

The document read as follows—

On 16 June 2009 during question time, Senator Siewert asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts enquiring why phytophthora management is not listed as a priority for funding in the Caring for Country business plan. Senator Siewert also asked whether the government was funding or considering funding any part of a coastal road that the state government has proposed to put through Fitzgerald River National Park.
The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator’s question:
For Caring for Country a series of national priorities were established that focus on securing improved strategic outcomes for the management of Australia’s natural environment and productive agricultural lands.
This strategic and very targeted approach ensures that our investment is sharply focused on achieving national priorities and avoids the risk of spreading available funds so thinly that improvements fall short of their potential and cannot be measured or reported.
Whilst there is no specific target addressing phytophthora management in the 2009-10 business plan, stakeholders could consider where other targets (such as those relating to biodiversity conservation) may align with this area of focus. Actions relating to phytophthora management may be considered where a contribution to Caring for our Country targets is clearly identified.
Significant work has been undertaken investigating the extent and management of phytophthora in the past. This work provides a good grounding for local, regional and state-based activities to be developed and implemented.
A Caring for our Country business plan will be released each year. A review is currently being undertaken of the 2009–10 business plan and targets as part of the process in developing this next plan. An important part of the evaluation is through public consultation via the Caring for our Country website, www.nrm.gov.au,
On the question of funding for a proposed road, there is no proposal before the Australian Government to fund the construction of a road through Fitzgerald River National Park.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Environment: Dieback</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,4,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-06-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Employment Participation (Senator Arbib) and the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to employment services and to funding for schools’ infrastructure.
Senator Conroy might well believe that he is completely on message, but people listening today would be entitled to ask just who in the government has responsibility for spending. The stark reality, from answers given today, is that the Rudd Labor government has simply let spending get out of control. No-one, it seems, not the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation or, indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister, is capable of prudently managing the nation’s finances.
Mr Tanner is very fond of lecturing the coalition. He gets himself asked a dorothy dixer in the House of Representatives and then, as he did yesterday, wants to see what the coalition is doing about savings. I can only assume that these homilies to the House are an attempt to cover his own, no doubt acute, embarrassment as the finance minister on the beat who has presided over reckless spending. There has been $124 billion in new spending racked up just since Labor took office. That is the largest debt and deficit in modern Australian history.
There is a growing concern in the community that Labor has lost control of the nation’s finances with runaway spending, debt and deficit. If any clearer evidence were needed of Labor’s inability to manage money, it is now revealed that the $14.7 billion of borrowed taxpayers’ money for the Building the Education Revolution program is replete with examples of waste, inefficiencies, duplication and bungled administration of public finances that have been asked about in the House and the Senate with completely unsatisfactory answers. The public is entitled to an explanation.
The Deputy Prime Minister, of course, has got form when it comes to bungled policy. The computers in schools program comes to mind; her costings blew out from $800 million to $2.2 billion. She is now delivering half of what was promised and it is costing more than twice, which is hardly value for money. This would hardly instil confidence in the Deputy Prime Minister’s managerial skills, but now, of course, she has been allowed to administer the $14.7 billion stimulus for schools. Should we be surprised at the unfolding debacle?
This is a government addicted to spending, and the finance minister has failed to keep it in check. After frittering away $20 billion in cash handouts, ministers are now running around in hard hats trying to convince the Australian public that the money they are splashing around now is being better spent. The truth is that this rushed $14.7 billion tsunami of spending on Australian schools is being poorly implemented. It is undeniable. There are no checks in place on the value for money for individual projects. Ms Gillard and Mr Tanner are content to play the global financial crisis defence every time their accountability on spending is called into question. Yes, we are all concerned about Australian jobs, but this is simply a cloak that Labor is hiding behind.
It is not too much to ask the government of the day to show Australians how they are achieving value for money with this $14.7 billion stimulus, how they are meeting probity guidelines or if they are properly accounting for hard-earned taxpayers’ dollars. Senator Conroy’s reaction today in question time was simply extraordinary. Why are the government so sensitive if, indeed, they have nothing to hide and if, indeed, everything they have spent in this $14.7 billion stimulus stacks up? Why are they so worried about showing the Auditor-General?
When poor examples continue to surface in regard to large amounts of mismanaged public funds, Australians deserve answers. A perfect example of poor decision making was highlighted in the Australian only yesterday. A school in Senator Conroy’s own state of Victoria, a Montessori school, was found to have been given some money, but it no longer complies with the prescribed minimum standards for registration as a school. What is going on with this debacle of a program? If the government are confident that they are beyond reproach, they should not hide from scrutiny from the Auditor-General on the apparent waste and mismanagement. Australian taxpayers expect and deserve accountability. Instead of worrying about the coalition, Mr Tanner needs to clean up the Labor government’s waste, inefficiency and mismanagement in his own backyard.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Employment</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2009-06-17,"—Again in question time today we saw the coalition taking the political low road. It is not surprising, because they are a coalition of no policies. They have got no idea what to do. All they want to do is beat things up—get baseless allegations and repeat them here as if that gives them some evidentiary base. It is simply not true. Let us talk about the new Job Services Australia tendering process, which Senator Fifield asked Minister Arbib about today—in another example of taking the low road. Senator Fifield well knows about this, because the Senate is actually doing an inquiry into the process right now, and only last week Senator Fifield and I and other senators held hearings with the stakeholders, some of the successful applicants to the tendering process and some of the unsuccessful applicants. He already has answers to all those questions he asked. Strangely enough, during the Senate inquiry process he asked them in a measured, sensible way. But what do we find here, when we get on the broadcast, when we may be on TV or radio? We get this feigned indignation, this absolute beat-up, about some of these issues.
That is really taking the low road. You are trying to put uncertainty and doubt in the minds of unemployed people about the safety and security of the new system that we are putting in place. I think that is a cruel thing to do to some of our most vulnerable people, when you know it is not true because you questioned the department, you questioned the witnesses before us and you know that there is a structured, measured, properly accountable system being introduced by this government and by the department. You know that is true, Senator Fifield. To take the political low road and to put uncertainty and doubt into the minds of unemployed people that the system will not be up and running is a cruel thing for you to do. It is taking the political low road and it is a cruel thing to do.
We are going through major reform in this new system that we are setting up, Job Services Australia. It rolls seven existing programs into one program, one that offers pathways and gets rid of all the red tape. It actually takes unemployed people and puts them into the right pathway rather than putting them on the conveyor belt which Minister Arbib talked about before and just hoping that they get off in the right area. This is the right program for the times and we are effectively putting it in place.
With regard to the competitive tendering process, I want to remind the Senate and remind Senator Fifield, even though I do not think he needs reminding, that it was the Liberals who actually introduced competitive tendering into this service area. Whenever we have competitive tendering, there will be losers and there will be winners. Strangely enough, when the winners came before the committee they were very satisfied with the tendering process; when the losers came before the committee they were unhappy. But the evidence put clearly before the committee was that the tendering process was a clear and straightforward process. There were no tricks involved, and it relied on an independent assessment through the department. The probity commissioner monitored that tendering process. People were selected on the merit and the strength of their tender. That is what a tendering process is.
I have a lot of sympathy for some of the organisations that have been working in this area for some time and missed out. Of course they do not believe they missed out because they did anything wrong or they were not providing the best service they could provide at the time. I do sympathise with them. I feel sorry for them because, in this industry, people are very dedicated, but the reality is that, when you go into a tendering process and compare one tender to another, there are going to be some winners and some losers. Of course some of the losers are looking for someone else to blame, because it would be hard to admit—especially if they were already existing in the service area—that they did not stack up well enough against people who maybe were not existing in the area but who obviously put in a better tender. Of course they will be looking for others to blame. But that is the nature of the tendering process, and it is no different to the tendering process that was put in place by the previous government and exercised by the previous government.
This government has done more to enable those people who have missed out on tenders to move on. We have put in place an adjustment fund which will deliver approximately $100,000 to a lot of those organisations that missed out. Under the previous Liberal government, if you missed out, you got nothing. (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-06-17,"—Senator Coonan was of course right. With this government there is a history of government waste and a cavalier attitude towards taxpayers’ money. From the beginning, the education revolution has been a shambles, and it has been debated many times in the Senate. The computers in schools fiasco was just that, a fiasco. Eighteen months down the track less than eight per cent of the computers have hit the desk. More importantly, the program is way, way over budget. It is a billion dollars over budget already.
As Senator Coonan has already indicated, Building the Education Revolution is even more of a fiasco. This is the problem: schools are not getting what they need and what they want; they are getting what the state bureaucrats believe they need. There is a diktat from the state governments about what they need. There are templates—template A, template B, template C; take your pick. ‘You’ve got a library? Do you want another one?’ That is what is happening. It is a totally inefficient, centrally planned approach, as always. On the government’s own words, there were two aims involved in Building the Education Revolution. One was to provide jobs. The other was to enhance educational outcomes. Neither of those has been achieved. There is little flexibility in what schools can receive. There is this whiff of central planning.
And what about overcharging? Already this week in the Senate in question time the ministers on the other side have been very reluctant to talk about the tendering process. Yet the evidence is coming in that schools themselves have wanted cheaper projects but they have been denied them by state governments, which have forced more expensive projects on them or projects they do not even want. They are projects that the schools do not want and they are more expensive. This is a centrally planned shambles, with a whiff of Leonid Brezhnev in it. It is thus far a total fiasco.
I mentioned today Mulgildie State School, west of Bundaberg. I will be interested to find out what Senator Arbib finds out on notice about that school. I think he will find that the government is spending money it does not need to and, worse, the school is not getting what it wants. That really is the point about this. That is where government waste is. Schools are not getting what they want and what they need. They are being told by state governments what they should get. Ultimately that is the theme of the entire Building the Education Revolution. It is all about spend, spend, spend, but it is not a good spend.
What did we discover from estimates? We discovered that the primary aim of Building the Education Revolution was to create jobs. That was the primary aim. Yet in the first round $2.6 billion was given out, and did the Commonwealth government or the state government ask any successful tenderers how many jobs would be created on each individual project? Did they? No, they did not. The government, Commonwealth or state, never asked how many jobs would be created on each individual project. Job creation was not the key here; rather, it was for the Prime Minister and Ms Gillard to be seen in a high-visibility vest, a hard hat and a bulldozer. It was all about PR and spin. That is what this is about, and that is why it is such a damn shame—$12.7 billion, and it could have done so much. But it is not about education outcomes. We know that because the schools are telling us that. And it is not about creating jobs, because the government did not even ask how many jobs would be created. So on both counts, both primary aims of Building the Education Revolution, the government failed. This is not even a facet of best spend or indeed even a good spend; this is just a spend. This is about spend and spin, not value for money. And $12.7 billion will be sacrificed for photo opportunities for the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, and it will not maximise job creation or maximise educational outcomes.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Employment</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,5,1
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—It is my pleasure to rise today to talk about new employment services, which is the subject of this debate. We went to the election in 2007 on a platform of reforming the antiquated process of Job Network. We were left by the previous government with a network that was out of date, based on one size fits all, bogged down in red tape and incapable of dealing with Australia’s chronic skills shortage. Previously, before my involvement in this chamber, I can recall speaking to copious numbers of employers about their concerns about getting skilled employees, getting people available to fill trade jobs or manual handling jobs. They had genuine concerns about getting people skilled for those positions. And here we are today hearing complaints from the opposition about a job network that is going to be able to fix those skill shortages.
There was a political decision to roll over 95 per cent of business in the last tender of the Job Network in 2006, initiating no improvements. Through 2008 we consulted with employment service providers, employers, job seekers and community groups to hear their views on how we should improve services, and I think we have fulfilled that promise by announcing Job Services Australia, which will tailor service to each job seeker, scrap waiting periods for services for more jobseekers and promote the value of real training that leads to job opportunities. The government have invested $2 billion in this productivity based program which will provide 319,000 training places for job seekers. I do not understand how any party can oppose or have an issue with those aids to employment growth at a time when employment is critical to ensure we stimulate the economy. It is beyond me. It will cut red tape for providers, freeing them up to help job seekers. It will retain and expand access to specialist services for highly disadvantaged job seekers. It will be uncapped and demand driven, unlike the previous position, where we had a waiting list of over 20,000 for personal support programs.
Naturally, as we go through a tendering process there are always issues we need to deal with. This process is all about ensuring that we have a more responsible set of employment services for job seekers. They deserve and need the best possible service in these difficult economic times. Fundamentally the reform is not easy. Due to the previous government’s laziness, we had no choice but to undertake a full tender, which has made some changes for providers. However, it is important to reflect and note that there is increased demand for workers with skills and experience in employment services, and the government do not want to see people with those skills lost from the new services. We do not want to see them on the scrap heap; we want to make sure that they are protected and that they are allocated appropriate employment. That is why we are providing resources to the peak provider association, NESA, to establish a website to help new providers seeking skilled staff and help staff affected by the tender allocation during the transition to Job Services Australia, which will begin on 1 July.
The government’s new business adjustment fund will offer a range of assistance to community based organisations that have not gained work under the new tender. The fund will provide grants to help organisations continue to operate while they develop new business plans, including identifying and developing new opportunities, with access to a panel of business advisers to help with restructuring business strategies and identifying new opportunities. No doubt there will be some impact on job seekers. The tender process was designed to throw it out there and see who is in the mix to be able to tender for the positions. The tender process was designed to ensure that job seekers have access to the best performing employment service providers to give them greater opportunities to find work.
We heard from the previous speaker, Senator Mason, that job creation is not the key here. I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that it is the key here. In tough economic times we need to ensure that people are employed in appropriate areas for their skill base and to make sure they are allocated jobs that assist and grow the economy. You have only got to look at some of the positioning at the openings where opposition members line up for photo opportunities. (Time expired)

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2009-06-17,"—In speaking to the motion to take note of the answers of Senator Conroy and Senator Arbib, I want to highlight the fact that in terms of managing this economy they are demonstrating indiscriminate and reckless behaviour, particularly with respect to education but not just with respect to education. They have no interest in ensuring that value for money is being received by the taxpayers. In terms of outcomes, what is the story? They do not know. They have no idea how jobs have been created by the government’s spending. In terms of educational outcomes, they have no idea. We had the farcical arrangements with the laptops in schools where the original budget was $1.2 billion and that blew out to $2 billion. That is a 66 per cent increase in expenditure. It is a problem with the government’s mismanagement and maladministration not just of government services but of our economy. They failed to take into account the operational costs of the laptops—such a basic, fundamental management procedure, but they did not take those costs into account. We saw a 66 per cent increase for the taxpayer.
As Senator Mason indicated earlier, this is a government of PR and spin. That is what it is interested in. I call the Prime Minister the grand spinmeister. He is the grand spinmeister, and his troops and his ministers are doing his bidding. But it is not just education. I want to list some of the other areas of waste, mismanagement and maladministration by this government. We have had the tax bonus waste, where we have seen millions of dollars going out to dead people, to deceased estates. There have been 15,934 of those, to a few weeks ago, and over 27,000 Australians living overseas have received the tax bonus, when the key objective was to strengthen and grow the Australian economy. We had the $14 million splashed on wasted policy reviews. The government has spent $14 million on 140 policy reviews but it has only acted on a handful of those findings. We had taxpayers’ funds wasted on the Prime Minister’s bid for a UN Security Council seat, and you would know, Mr Deputy President, being on the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, that the budget reports a direct cost for this bid of $11.2 million over a two-year period, but there are potentially tens of millions of extra dollars to be used from other parts of the budget, including the foreign aid budget. We have seen the $164,000 splurge on a blatantly political website—yes, a $164,000 bill for a blatantly political website promoting the Rudd government’s budget. Senator Michael Ronaldson, our shadow special minister of state, highlighted these concerns just some weeks ago. We had some issues with the 2020 Summit. The government expended $2 million of taxpayers’ funds on that talkfest. And what has it done? The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, has agreed to fund only nine of the 962 recommendations. As the Australian editorial said at the time, it is big hype, small ideas; none of the ideas proved visionary and most are recycled.
Then we had the issue of government legal costs exceeding $500 million. Remember that the Labor Party in opposition attacked the Howard government’s spending on lawyers, and Attorney-General Robert McClelland has been forced to defend the Rudd government’s 2007-08 legal bill of $510 million—up from $408 million under the Howard government. So it was a $100 million increase in costs for lawyers under this government. The government also now has the reputation of having the highest consultancy costs in the history of the Australian government. It spends more on consultants than any government in Australian history. As of just a month or so ago, consultancy costs have totalled more than $500 million since the government has come to office. Of course the shadow minister before the election, Lindsay Tanner, promised to cut consultancy costs back by $395 million. So the government’s waste, inefficiency and mismanagement knows no bounds.

"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2009-06-17,"—I rise to talk about a situation to do with the Rudd government’s changes to youth allowance in the May budget. I can understand where the government were coming from when they first made these changes. The situation was simple. A student completing year 12 and, say, living in Sydney, not far from the university that they wished to attend, could take a gap year. Under the old regulations, they could go out and earn some $19,500. That would then declare their independence from their parents, and hence they would qualify for youth allowance. When you have a situation where a student completes year 12, defers uni for one year, has a gap year and lives at home with their parents—and their parents might be earning $400,000, $500,000 or $600,000 a year—I think it is only right that the government target that situation. Why should taxpayers be supporting that student who is living at home with parents on that sort of money to the tune of some $9,600 a year in youth allowance?
So what the government did was to target this situation—and rightfully so, as I said. Why should a bricklayer or a shearer pay tax each week, only to find that they will prob-bly never set foot on a university campus in their life? They should not be subsidising students in that financial situation. But, in the crossfire, what the government has done is taken out those in rural and regional areas who do not live close to universities—those who have to go off to university, pay for accommodation, and suffer the costs of travel and the standard costs of purchasing books et cetera. The government has done two things that are very wrong. The first thing it has done has had a huge effect, through this policy, on those in their gap year.
I will give you an example. Eli Kimmince is a good young fella. He lives in Inverell, the town I come from. He has taken a gap year and he is working as a manager at McDonald’s in Inverell. Eli comes from a family that I would say does not have much money at all. His parents probably bring in a standard wage; they might earn about $40,000 a year. I am aware of the fact that they earn less than $42,000 because that is the amount below which parents have to earn for their student children to qualify for youth allowance. Eli has deferred university for one year while he is working at McDonald’s, and his goal in life is to next year attend the Australian National University here in Canberra to study a course and then join the Federal Police. What has happened to this young fella? His life has been tipped upside down. Because of the changes to the govern-ment’s regulations and the change in the budget, he must now go and work for 18 months. He cannot start university at the start of next year, and he is not one bit impressed, like thousands of others in gap years who are now facing this situation. They have been held back from university. They will have to work for another six or eight months next year.
We have the situation, as I said, that the government has targeted these people who are in cities or who live close to their univer-sity and can live at home. It might be in places like Armidale, where we have a rea-son-able university. We are very proud of it, since it was the Country Party that first got the University of New England on its feet. They can get the youth allowance and per-haps do not deserve it. But those who have to travel away cannot live at home, and we now have these people who are deeply concerned about whether they are going to get to uni-ver-sity next year. That is the thing that is so wrong about these changes in the budget.
These people want to be educated. Tell me this: if we do not get them to university, what will we do for doctors, nurses, dentists, law-yers, vets—all the providers of those vital ser-vices that regional Australia requires as well as those in the cities? What do we do in the future for those specialist services if we can-not get our students off to universities? That is the problem here, and that is why it is so wrong. I was glad to call a rally recently at the Inverell RSM Club, at which we had 120 people on a Saturday morning. There were teachers, students and concerned par-ents. Like all parents, all those parents want is the best for their children and to give them a good start in life, and they are very con-cer-ned that theirs will not be going to university next year. So that is problem No. 1.
What the government also did in the budget was to make a change such that those who are taking a gap year—instead of working the 12 months, grossing the $19,500 and declaring independence from their parents—now have to work for 18 months. What are the problems with working 18 months? For a start, you have to defer university for two years. What university will defer for two years? The universities have acceded to the situa--tion, which was mentioned in today’s Australian in an article titled ‘Flexible on gap-year deferrals’. It states that, in a move that shields the federal government from a pol-itical storm over its changes to youth allowance, the universities are showing some flexibility. But when someone defers for two years, the problem is that they will go and get a job—it might be at McDonald’s, at Coles or at some other supermarket—they will probably get a car, and, if they are a young bloke like me, they will probably find a girlfriend. They will probably lose interest in study, and that is the problem. The longer they defer the more likely they are not to actually attend university.
The next point I make is that when students leave year 12 in rural and regional areas—probably out somewhere where you have never visited yourself, Senator Jacinta Collins—where do they find a job? Your forecasts are for 8½ per cent unemploy-ment—one million unemployed next year. Where do they go to get a job for 18 months when the jobs are not there? If they cannot get a job then they cannot qualify for youth allowance. If they cannot qualify for youth allowance then how do they get to university? How do they get through their studies, their tertiary education? How do they qualify to be our nurses, our doctors, our dentists—those vital people who I mentioned earlier on.
Government senators interjecting—
—We have got female interjections in stereo, Mr Acting Deputy President, but I will continue. The point I make is this: I can see where the government were coming from in changing these regulations, but in the crossfire they have taken those in regional areas who wish to get a tertiary education right out.
As I said, where do they find the jobs, especially in the smaller country towns—somewhere like Trundle, Gilgandra or Condobolin—when they want to go off to carry out tertiary study and better themselves for the rest of their lives? They are left out of the equation. In fact, Philip Ruddock made the point when we met a week or so ago that he has a constituent in Sydney who wishes to attend the medical school at the University of New England in Armidale—which we were very proud to see kick off two years ago—who faces the same problem, because he will have to move out into the country, find accommodation and face those extra costs. That is where this is so wrong. I am sure Minister Gillard has been bombarded with emails, letters and phone calls. It is certainly the biggest issue that has come to my office in my brief time in the Senate. In almost 12 months, I have never seen an issue that people are so disgruntled and concerned about—that is, the tertiary education of their youngsters and giving them a fair go.
I can say with confidence that, when this legislation comes to the Senate, the Senate will do its job. We know that we have many here in the Senate to support us. We will get this legislation off to a committee. We will see that those people who are on a gap year now, who have had the goalposts changed halfway through the game as the government have done, are able to get to university next February, when they should get there, instead of six or eight months later. The Senate will do its job. Amendments will be put through the Senate to protect the education of our country students who wish to commence a tertiary education. The legislation will then go to the House and, if the government do not accept the amendments, they will live with the consequences. If they bring on an election and the parents, the teachers and the students are as angry as I have seen them in meetings that I have attended, the government will face the consequences. Come election time, there will not be a regional seat in Australia held by the Labor Party if they are going to pull the rug out from under our students and prevent them from undertaking a tertiary education and providing those vital services that we require in rural and regional areas—and I point to the situation with doctors and, especially, nurses. With our ageing population, there is a huge demand for nurses not only in our hospitals but also in our aged-care facilities. We need that service, and we will certainly do our utmost to see that these changes are brought about and that a fair system of youth allowance is in place so that all people in rural and regional areas can get a fair go, can get their tertiary education and are not held back—as the government have certainly done with these changes in the budget.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Independent Youth Allowance</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I rise today to provide a contribution in this matter of public importance debate in relation to the changes to the youth allowance, but I want to put this debate in the context of the previous government and of the reforms that we have undertaken since coming to government. I also want to emphasise throughout my contribution, Senator Williams, that it is vitally important—but probably irrelevant to and disregarded by the likes of you and your colleagues—to provide your constituents with an accurate and holistic report of the changes. Once I go through and outline the changes, you will see that there will be a lot of benefits for people who come from rural and regional Australia. In fact, people who have contacted my office, whom we have personally rung and assisted, were not aware of the numerous other changes and benefits that are part of this package. So, if you are going to hold public rallies and answer queries from your constituents, you had better do it on a basis of knowledge—a total knowledge—of the changes and benefits in this package.
But let me put this debate in context. We had 12 long years of a coalition in government who just sat on their hands and took no action when it came to addressing student poverty in this country. That was a government that stood back and did nothing at all while we saw only 15 per cent of university students in this country come from a low SES background. That was a government that failed to act while, under their watch, regional and rural participation in universities actually declined. Yet today we see from the opposition—if I could be so bold as to suggest this as a senator from the Northern Territory—crocodile tears being cried on the other side of the chamber. They are only too happy to complain when we have a reform agenda in front of us, but they do not have—and have never had—a plan for addressing the welfare of our students. They have had no plan for ensuring that students from a low socioeconomic background or those from regional and rural Australia are able to afford to go to university. In comparison, since the election of the Rudd Labor government, we have tackled the issue of student poverty head on in a comprehensive and thorough manner.
Let me take you back in time. In 2005 I participated in the Senate employment, workplace relations and education references committee, and we tabled a report in our inquiry into student support measures. There are those who will remember former Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, who was quite passionate about this issue in relation to university students. In our report we were critical of the inadequacy of student income support. Among other things, the report found fault with the harshness of the youth allowance eligibility criteria, specifically relating to the age of independence and the parental income test threshold—two areas of critical comment by the Senate committee. These failings, the committee argued, both penalised those students who were in most need of financial assistance and had a detrimental impact on these students and their academic participation rates and success. That report was handed down in 2005. There was no response from the previous government—no changes, no action, no change in their policy direction and not even a plan to attempt to change it in the lead-up to the 2007 election. Yet they now have the audacity to sit on the other side of the chamber and complain about the changes that are being undertaken to student youth allowance and the benefits that will bring to students across the country.
The first action that Minister Gillard took when we came to government was to commission an expert panel, headed by Professor Denise Bradley, to undertake a broad review of tertiary education to try to assess the damage that was caused by the 12 years of neglect under the previous government. It is following the provision of this expert advice that we have now acted. The Bradley review, as it has now come to be known, is publicly available. That review exposed the untenable situation that the coalition had created, where those students who needed income support the most did not receive it, while students who did not need the support were receiving the payment.
It was found that the Howard government had created a situation where even students on the maximum benefit reported that the amount available was insufficient to meet basic living expenses. It was found that the purchasing power of student income benefits was almost half of average income support. But we have heard no plan from those opposite about how to fix the situation—not before the last election and not since the election. The level of youth allowance was so inadequate that it drove nearly 71 per cent of full-time domestic undergraduate students to take on work while studying. These students were working, on average, 15 hours a week—one in six full-time undergrads were working more than 20 hours a week on top of their studies. Despite the huge impact this was found to have on learning outcomes and the quality of the student experience, the Howard government had no plan to fix the situation. Bizarrely, while students from low socioeconomic conditions did it tough, the Bradley review found that 36 per cent of students who were living at home and were receiving youth allowance through having been considered ‘independent’ were actually from families with incomes above $100,000 and 10 per cent of those students were from families with incomes above $200,000. The Howard government had no plan at all to redirect student income support from those who had it and did not need it to those who did need it.
The Rudd Labor government, on the other hand, is opposed to the provision of welfare payments for the benefit of those who do not need them. That is why, after a comprehensive review by the expert panel, we have announced that the working eligibility criteria should be tightened to ensure that this sort of abuse of welfare does not continue. In line with the recommendations of the Bradley review, we have tightened the independence criteria so that it is a true measure of independence from parents. It is based on full-time attachment to the labour force—that is, 30 hours per week rather than part-time work over two years or earning around $19,000 over an 18-month period. Be very clear about this: time frame and the number of hours have not changed. There were, in fact, three options in terms of workforce participation criteria, and one of those is there.

Senator Nash interjecting—

—So, if you want to talk about the change in hours or the length of time, you are wrong. That has not changed. We have invested the savings—$1.8 billion over the next four years—in expanding eligibility by increasing the parental income test. I do not hear you talking about that, Senator Nash—

Senator Nash interjecting—

—And we are bringing down the age of independence—and you do not talk about that either—and creating new scholarships. That is the third thing that you do not talk about when you try to discuss this issue. You want to focus on one aspect, not four aspects. This will mean that parental income will now be the primary measure for eligibility. So, in fact, what your parents earn and their threshold will be the primary measure. For many students, this means that they will no longer have to prove their eligibility for youth allowance by working. I would have thought that is what you would want to achieve, because more students than ever will be eligible for youth allowance automatically under the raised parental income test.
This reform will allow 67,800 young people to access income youth allowance or ABSTUDY to support their participation in post-compulsory secondary education, vocational education, higher education, Australian Apprenticeships or a combination of activities. In addition, 34,600 existing recipients who currently receive a part payment will receive an increase in their payment—I don’t hear you talking about that either, Senator Nash—often to the full payment rate. Those who have worked full time and are independent of their parents can still access support in this way.
Under Labor’s system, a family from the bush with two kids at university, who might be aged 17 and 21 and living away from home, will now be able to automatically receive some support if they have a family income up to $139,388. That is up from the previous cut-off, for this type of family, of around $75,324. That is a major increase in the eligibility criteria for parents’ income. But I do not hear the coalition talking about the benefits and gains from increasing the threshold. Under our new system, families who receive one dollar of student income support will be entitled to the entire Student Start-up Scholarship, worth $2,254 for each year—not once but each year—the student is in university and is eligible for student income support. This new scholarship is equivalent to an increase in payments of around $43 per week.
Under existing arrangements, a young person on youth allowance or ABSTUDY is considered to be dependent on their parents until they turn 25, unless they establish their independence through other means. The package of student income support reforms will progressively lower the age of independence to 24 in 2010, 23 in 2011 and 22 in 2012. So we will lower the age of independence to ensure that the age of independence accurately reflects when individuals become independent of their parents.
These reforms are a major achievement. They will increase access to student income support and provide stronger and more equitable assistance for the students who need it most, including students from low-income backgrounds, those from rural and regional areas and, of course, Indigenous students. Of course, what this whole issue does is to remind the electorate what a mess the coalition left us with, with regard to student support and tertiary education. You sat on your hands for 12 long years and did nothing to address the situation when it came to supporting students.
The Nationals will have you believe that these reforms disadvantage regional and remote students. However, they clearly have not read the detail of the policy. The changes actually provide for more regional and remote students to be able to access Youth Allowance. But the other side does not want to hear about the good news and the positive changes in this. They just want to focus on a single issue without looking at the whole package.
A 75 per cent discount will now be applied to the parental income test when considering business assets, including farm assets. I do not hear them talking about that part of the package. This means that Youth Allowance and Abstudy can be received by dependent young people from small business and farming families with assets up to the value of $2.286 million. In addition, more regional and remote students will now be able to apply for the new relocation scholarship. The relocation scholarship provides $4,000 in the first year and $1,000 in subsequent years. In comparison to the old Commonwealth accommodation scholarship, the relocation scholarship represents a 28 per cent increase in the number of accommodation related scholarships that will be available to students living away from home.
After years of neglect, the coalition have prepared a range of half-baked amendments to our policy before the legislation has even entered the Senate. The coalition aim to delay the implementation of the new saving measures for a year and will pay for this by slashing scholarships for 146,600 needy students. They also want to create a targeted scholarship pool for rural and regional students, whose scholarships would only amount to a small portion of the money they intend to rip out of scholarships for all students, regional and metropolitan alike.
The coalition is leading a concerted misinformation campaign, which has caused much anxiety for students who are undertaking a gap year and their families. They suggested students who are currently working and who might previously have been hoping to access Youth Allowance under old workforce participation criteria—that is, earning about $19,000 over 18 months—will now no longer be able to access Youth Allowance. What you do not tell many of the students is that, in some circumstances, many of those students who are currently in their gap year will not need to work any more, because they will automatically become eligible for Youth Allowance under the changes to the parental income test.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Independent Youth Allowance</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-06-17,"—I rise today to contribute to this important debate. I must say, I have never seen an issue become so hotly debated in the community so quickly. The budget was handed down on the Tuesday night and by Friday morning my inbox was full and the phones in my electorate office were running hot. I received phone calls from concerned parents, teachers, students and grandparents. These were people who had contacted their local member of parliament and who had definitely never thought of picking up the phone and speaking to their Greens senator. It is an issue which has galvanised the community. The concern is not coming from those people who know that they should not have been twisting the rules to get that money. The government keeps referring to those families on $200,000 to $300,000 a year receiving Youth Allowance and staying at home, but the concern is not coming from those people—it is coming from people who are halfway through working to earn the required amount of money.
I want to bring the debate back to why this is an issue. The fundamental flaw, despite a whole raft of changes that the government has announced in relation to Youth Allowance—many of which, I must put on the public record, the Greens support—is that there was absolutely no investment in student income support in this budget. There was no extra investment at a time when we know young people are going to have to gain further skills because of job shortages around the country, when the cost of living for students around the country is rising and when, as we know, the rate of Youth Allowance has not risen for the last five or six years. The fundamental problem is that the government has set up a scheme that pays more people but with the same amount of money. It is the same pie; it is just cut differently. Of course, when you do that, people miss out.
The changes that the government announced to the workplace participation criteria have removed the two fundamental ways that young people could meet those independence criteria so that they could get the maximum amount—that is, $371.40 a fortnight. They have removed that option halfway through. Because they are talking about bringing it in on 1 January 2010, those people who are already working to meet the independence criteria are being caught short. Therefore, the legislation, when it comes to the Senate, will effectively be retrospective, which is not a good way to manage public policy. If there was ever a clear example of where politicians did not accept this, it was in 2004 when politicians’ superannuation rates were discussed. The rates for those senators who entered in 2004 were different to those who were here beforehand. There was no argument that the laws for those senators should be retrospective or different from those for the senators sitting in the chambers here today. It is a classic example of one rule for some and another rule for other people.
The issue facing young people who want to access education is a huge one. I could talk about this issue for a long time, particularly about young people in rural Australia accessing opportunities for higher education. We know that young people in rural and regional Australia have to move and have to leave home when they finish their higher school certificates if they are to go to university, because there is no university down the street or in the next suburb. The government talks about these changes being targeted to those people most in need. As I have said, there are a number of changes that we do support. I support the idea of bringing the age of independence down. I think it should be coming down to 18, frankly. If you need to move out of home, if you have moved out of home and if you are standing on your own two feet then you should be considered independent.
The government is not introducing that independence rate-drop straightaway; it is phasing it in over three or four years. Yet the fundamental change that rips money out of the pockets of students who have earned it and are working desperately towards earning it—and the government’s own figures are that 30,700 students are going to be affected by this—is proposed to happen from 1 January 2010.
The students who are contacting all of us—and I am sure you have all had the same emails, the same letters and the same phone calls from grandparents—are saying, ‘We’re doing this based on the advice that we were given from the government.’ Centrelink went into schools and advised students in year 12 that the best way for them to support themselves when going to university was to take a gap year, earn the $19½ thousand and get the youth allowance. This is young people’s first experience of dealing with a government that has not taken their considerations on board.
I understand the need to target the youth allowance to those in need, but the government has missed the mark. For those who are most in need in terms of income support: let us deal with the parental income levels; let us deal with bringing the independence rate down. Let us also not forget the extra disadvantage that young people from rural and regional Australia face if they are to attend university. That is an extra burden that they have to bear.
The government talk about the fact that, because the parental income levels are proposed to be changed, most of these kids are going to be okay. They cannot tell us, however, how many students will get what. They say they have consulted with regional communities but cannot tell us how many students take the gap year in order to qualify for youth allowance. They tell us that they have consulted regional communities, yet they say they do not understand their concerns. They talk about misinformation and miscommunication of the message. I can say that the worst communication of these changes has come from the government themselves—from the minister’s office and from the department. Even the naming of their scholarships does not make sense—an annual scholarship that is called a ‘start-up’ scholarship? The basic misinformation and miscommunication have come from the government themselves.
We can debate all of the other changes, but it is about what we want to prioritise and how much value we think student income support deserves. I think it deserves a whole lot more, which is why I was pushing, before the budget, to see an increase in that pool of money instead of having to spread it more thinly, which is what the government have done. We can debate those things, and obviously the different parties in this chamber will have different opinions about that, but the one part that is indefensible is the retrospective nature of the removal of the workplace participation criteria. It is absolutely indefensible. You do not change the rules halfway, with no consultation, no compromise and absolutely no guarantees that those students will now be able to fund their time at university.
The government talk about a relocation scholarship that will be available to those students who have to move from the country to the city or from, say, Adelaide to Melbourne if they get accepted at Melbourne university for medicine instead of at Flinders. But they cannot tell us what the criteria for that relocation scholarship are. While they say it is available, they cannot tell us who it is available to. I have asked those questions directly of the minister. I have asked the minister’s office. I asked the department during estimates. No-one can tell us what those criteria will be. There is no guarantee for any of these 30,700 students of what level of income support they will get come 1 January 2010.
Before I finish, I want to welcome the strong stance that the coalition have taken in jumping on board and supporting the Greens in moving amendments to this legislation when the legislation comes to the Senate. I am thankful that the coalition have moved beyond their original position of only amending the private healthcare rebate measure, because this measure is just as important. This measure must be amended. It is absolutely indefensible to bring in legislation that is effectively retrospective, with no consultation and an absolute lack of information and advice as to how it is going to affect people for whom you are moving the goalposts halfway through.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Independent Youth Allowance</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Nash, Sen Fiona",NATS,2009-06-17,"—I rise to contribute to the matter of public importance discussion about the youth allowance this afternoon. I do not believe I  have ever seen, in recent times, such an example from a Labor government of a complete disconnect with regional communities. It is incredibly apparent—not only with regard to the youth allowance but in a whole range of areas that we have seen, particularly since the last budget—that this government is completely disregarding regional Australia. There are absolutely no two ways about it.
I congratulate my good colleague Senator Williams for putting this MPI forward this afternoon, because this is one of the most important issues to hit rural and regional Australia for years and years. As my other colleagues have already pointed out, we have been inundated by concern from students and families right around the country. These are not form letters or form emails; students and parents are sitting down and taking the time to write incredibly lengthy letters because they are absolutely at their wits’ end to think that this measure is going to be taken away.
There are a lot of measures contained within the package, but the one that is of particular concern is the issue of the students currently doing their gap year. Senator Crossin said earlier that we were being misleading and not talking about the changes properly and that there was still something in place about the 15 hours a week that a student could work over the 18-month period. That in itself is correct, but what the changes do is remove the capacity for a student right now, this year, to earn $19½ thousand before the beginning of next year and then qualify. So all those students who were finishing school at the end of last year and in good faith took advice—from counsellors, from parents, from teachers, from advisers or from Centrelink—that a way that they could qualify for independent youth allowance was to earn $19½ thousand over a 15-month period now simply will not qualify. Just imagine if that were you or if you were a parent of one of those students who have been working incredibly hard since the end of last year—because they want to be able to help; they want to be able to contribute; they do not want to be a burden on their families in asking for assistance to get them to tertiary education.
One of the issues around this that are so important is that regional Australia is doing it incredibly tough. We have had years and years of drought. We have families who are absolutely right against the wall out in regional communities and they still want to do everything they possibly can to get their kids into a decent tertiary education system. A lot of them simply cannot afford it without the assistance from the youth allowance. So what we are seeing is thousands of students being disaffected because of this government’s stupid policy. If I were being kind, I might say it was an unintended consequence. Perhaps the minister should come out tomorrow and say: ‘Actually, that is quite right. This was an unintended consequence. We didn’t intend for this to happen and we are now going to change the arrangement so these students qualify.’ I hope that the minister does, because the hundreds and hundreds of students and families that this is affecting deserve to have the minister come out and give them some comfort so they know that those students will be able to start with the assistance of independent youth allowance next year.
The other requirement that is going to be incredibly burdensome for these families is this issue of having to work 30 hours a week. Senator Crossin referred to this earlier. She has actually been quite misleading, because there is now absolutely no way to qualify for independent youth allowance unless you defer for two years. There is no way at all you can do it. So when you look at that and at the situation where we have students in regional areas who actually want to stay at home while they are doing gap year, or at least stay in the regions, you see that those jobs simply are not going to be there. If the government had any sense whatsoever, they would realise that so much of the work on offer in regional areas is seasonal work. And guess what: they are not allowing students to average out this 30 hours a week component. They have to do 30 hours every single week.
What I find quite extraordinary is the fact that the department could not give us any answers of any great substance during estimates. They did not know about the deferral capacity of universities—whether or not universities would be able to defer or would be inclined to defer for the second year. They said, ‘That is a matter for the universities.’ So we have thousands and thousands of students being affected and they cannot give us an answer. They did not even know the number of students that were going to be affected. There was some wishy-washy figure of 3,000, but we know it is up to 30,000. When asked, ‘How many students do you assess are currently taking a gap year?’ the answer from the secretary was, ‘We would not know.’ So they are making policy around an issue and they simply do not know what the ramifications are.
What is even more worrying is that the Labor government simply do not understand the ramifications of this. Indeed, they are being dismissive of it. In estimates, when I was raising these very serious points that we know are important to regional communities, the minister, Senator Carr, called it political hysteria. I do not see that those thousands of families in regional Australia that are going to be affected by this are being hysterical in any way, shape or form. The minister herself, Minister Gillard, was asked in the House on 25 May: ‘Will the minister guarantee that students currently in their gap year will not be financially penalised under the government’s changes to eligibility criteria for the independent youth allowance?’ The question was asked by my good colleague the member for Gippsland, who is doing a lot of work on this. Guess what Minister Gillard answered: ‘What a very silly question.’ I do not think there is anything silly at all about those families out in regional communities who are so very concerned about this.
The government have been talking about an education revolution, and my very good colleague Senator Mason has been doing a lot of good work on this, saying, ‘What revolution?’ and pointing out the flaws in that term. They say one thing and they do another. Minister Gillard said back in 2007:
What that says is that we value the education of every child and we will continue to do that. We want to make sure kids right across the country, irrespective of what family they’re born into, whether they’re in the centre of the city, in a regional centre or outback Australia, that they all get the support they need for their education.
If she were serious about that, she would be coming out right now and saying: ‘We’re going to change this. I meant what I said and we are going to either change the date or quarantine the arrangement for these gap year students to make sure they have a future.’ She has promised students a bright future in tertiary education and she should simply come out and say that this is going to be changed. It is not fair on regional Australia, it is not right and it is not on.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Independent Youth Allowance</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2009-06-17,"—On considering this debate so far, I wonder whether Senator Williams might be contemplating amending the original resolution, so perhaps I will take us back to that point. The MPI reads:
The Rudd Government’s ill-considered, ill-conceived and discriminatory changes to the Independent Youth Allowance announced in the Federal Budget.
When I read this when it was first circulated and then withdrawn yesterday, I was anticipating some sort of assessment and critique of the Bradley review. But we have heard none of that. What the government did, after a considered review, was to respond to it in the last budget. I am certainly prepared to accept that there is quite a degree of disquiet about what that might mean for some students currently within what has been termed their gap year. I too have received those emails and I too have raised issues and questions in Senate estimates about the potential impact.
It was suggested that the government was not aware of issues such as university deferral arrangements. It was in fact in my case that we raised this issue in Senate estimates because unfortunately there has been a scare campaign that is informing some of the emails that are now being circulated and that has not been looking at the various options that apply to young people as a result of these budget measures. I commend senators in their discussion in the debate today, because if I look at some of the language, for instance, I see we are talking about young people who feel as if their life has been tipped upside down or who have been effectively caught short. That is reasonable language. But some of the language that has been encouraged in the emails that have been circulating and some of it that came out during the Senate estimates discussion is the result of a scare campaign. When you hear young people saying, ‘My life is at an end; this destroys my future,’ it really is taking this issue well and truly out of perspective.
Senator Hanson-Young selectively picked one other issue where the application of measures in these types of situations needs to look at the application of potential retrospectivity. She chose, I suspect deliberately, to focus on the parliamentary superannuation issue. Senator Sherry quite rightly highlighted that there are many people planning retirement who have had to deal with the issue of goalposts being shifted, not only by the current government but also by the former government and by many governments before that. This issue is not a new issue. In some senses, I have more sympathy for the predicament that people planning for retirement who are at the end of their working life are caught in than I do for young people for whom, at the end of the day, it may simply mean that, after exhausting the various options, achieving independence is the only realistic option they have left and they may need to spend a further six to 12 months working. I myself worked for two years before I entered university. I know many people who have worked before university, whether it was for 12 months or for 24 months.
I take up Senator Williams’s discussion about what impact that has on whether students will actually enter university. That has not been well explored to date, but I add a new context to that. I want Senator Williams to consider a different issue, which is: why are young people being forced by the system to take a gap year in the first place, and is that, indeed, the best system—the one we should be encouraging in the future? Is it best for young people to spend 12 months in the workforce before they enter university? If in a policy sense we are encouraging a system which says to young people in rural and regional areas, ‘What you should do is go and work for 12 months and then go to university,’ I am still not convinced that that is the best policy option either. I know many students at university who probably could have benefited from that additional level of maturity rather than flunking their first year at university—and Senator Mason shakes his head in understanding of that point.
Also, Senator Williams, I should make a different point to you, which is that you should not make assumptions about the experience of other senators in this chamber. The point I made earlier when you were referring to stereo interjections was in response to Senator Nash, because I said my first paid work was on a farm near Jerilderie in New South Wales. She reflected, ‘Lovely town.’ I responded, ‘Yes.’ So my first paid work was on a farm near Jerilderie doing lamb marking. So, please, keep to the question, keep to the debate and do not insult other senators in the process about what experience they may or may not have had in rural and regional Australia.
Senator Crossin addressed a range of issues and highlighted some of the aspects of the changes and how they will benefit regional Australia. In the limited time I have, I want to respond to some of the other points raised. Senator Hanson-Young also referred to the figure that came out during our estimates discussion indicating that we are looking at around 30,700 young people potentially being affected. But I stress—and she did acknowledge this—that that is an effect. The effect may be positive; the effect may be negative. Unfortunately, at this stage, it is very difficult to assess the net effect—and not because the government is being intransigent; it is because it applies in a very difficult policy area.
We have had some comments about universities. Senator Williams rightly pointed to the article today in the Australian talking about flexibility on gap year deferrals. I have dealt with students who have needed to defer for exceptional circumstances, and they have been able to extend their deferrals. I welcome this statement from Glenn Withers recommending that Australian universities apply flexibility and look at exceptional circumstances for students. But let us look at when we might be dealing with those exceptional circumstances. It will be after individual students assess their circumstances in relation to changed benchmarks. But those changed benchmarks, the retargeting of the system, allow significant improvements in terms of how they might be assessed were they still caught under the dependency criteria in relation to their parental income test and in relation to their personal income test. This package improves the financial wellbeing of students, and in particular those students for whom income support will be the main issue that determines whether they can be at university or not.
But when an individual student then compares their circumstances—how far off they are from achieving independence, what the criteria will mean in terms of their parental income and what the criteria will mean in terms of their potential personal income—they will be in a position to decide whether they still want to strive to be financially independent or whether they accept the alternative options that are still available to them. This is a prospective assessment, and that is why the department cannot say clearly, ‘This is our assessment of the net impact.’ Senator Mason knows that, I know that and I suspect Senator Nash really does know that aspect of it too. Were she able to come forward with a couple of examples that could demonstrate severe disadvantage, that might be a different issue. But I have not seen those cases. What I have seen are the cases of people who are yet to be able to assess their circumstances, and I have seen the result of some level of scaremongering where young people are making some pretty extreme statements about what this really means.
I think that is most unfortunate. I know many students who have started out with a view to taking a gap year who have then decided to extend their deferral and still gone on to university. They have had to change their choices because of other shifted goalposts. Goalposts in this area do shift, and that shift may be as a result of government policy or it may be as a result of other life circumstances. Unfortunately, this is what does happen and over time young people will come to terms with the fact that goalposts might shift in the future. As I have said, for students who want to access university the gap year issue may be considerable, and this is why I have stressed that universities are capable of extending their deferral circumstances.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2009-06-17,"—I think all honourable senators do agree that the prospective changes to youth allowance are a very important issue. Senator Collins was quite right—I think all of us in this chamber have received a lot of correspondence about the issue. I have received many emails, and I know all honourable senators have. Senator Collins said something very interesting, and she was dead right. The Bradley review and also the government have spoken about equity and access to tertiary education and higher education. This fundamentally is the point. The Deputy Prime Minister, who is the Minister for Education, has spoken many times about the importance of having more people graduate from Australian universities and attending higher education. Equity and access has been one of the themes of the Deputy Prime Minister’s crusade on higher education. Let me just say that a lot of it I agree with. I think it is a good thing that more people go to university and I think it is a good thing to attract students to higher education from whatever background. Australia should be a meritocracy and certainly people should not be precluded on the basis of coming from a disadvantaged or Indigenous background. But neither should they be disadvantaged or have access reduced by where they happen to live. It was easy for me to go to university because I caught a bus to it. So many students in this country do not have the option of doing that. They live far too far away to even drive to it. So this is a question, as the Deputy Prime Minister likes to say, of equity and access. If that is the fundamental test—and that is the test that Professor Bradley raised in the Bradley review—what about rural students? They are disadvantaged. This is the litmus test. They are disproportionately disadvantaged by the changes to the youth allowance scheme.
I accept what Senator Collins said—that many of these prospective students will not qualify because their parents earn too much. That is true and I accept that. But the bottom line is that these young Australians do not have the option of staying at home to go to university. Their access to university is much less than the vast majority of Australians. That is the fundamental flaw in the government’s position. I have heard so often from the Deputy Prime Minister—indeed, nearly ad nauseam—about equity and access to higher education. I agree with a lot of it. I agree with her on much of that. I think a lot of other honourable senators in the opposition do as well. But you cannot argue that and talk about disadvantaged students and Aboriginal students and then say it does not apply to students living in rural and regional areas. It just does not work and it does not wash.
Secondly, as Senator Nash and Senator Williams have put so eloquently this afternoon, there is a transitional period. I have to agree again with Senator Collins that technically this bill is not retrospective. I accept that. Technically it is not retrospective. Senator Sherry is right to suggest that sometimes goalposts change. But so many prospective students have put their lives on hold on the basis that the rules would be as they are now. What about them? The government intends to introduce this on 1 January next year and again we are going to have tens of thousands of students miss out. It is all very well for the government to talk about equity and access—and, as I say, I agree with a lot of that—but rural students and students undertaking transition will both miss out. It is not fair and it upsets equity and access. The government cannot have it both ways.
The government’s approach to youth allowance is symptomatic of their approach more generally to education. They have big ideas and really lofty rhetoric but they are defeated in detail and often a shambles in implementation. We have heard so much about that in question time today and over the last 18 months since the election. Who could forget the then opposition leader, Mr Rudd, standing there with a laptop computer saying, ‘This is the toolbox of the 21st century.’ Eighteen months later only eight per cent of the computers promised have landed on desks. Even then it was underbudgeted by $800 million. It is a shambles in implementation. It is a toolbox without any tools. It is an absolute farce. It was great rhetoric, but in implementation it has been a total, unmitigated disaster.
Also, the Prime Minister promised there would be an internet connection, that all these laptop computers would be connected to fibre at 100 kilobytes a second and we would have a great new education system. But there have been no new connections to fibre from the government, and when you ask about this at estimates you are told: ‘It is okay. You do not need to worry about it because Senator Conroy has it under control. The National Broadband Network will fix the problem.’ How long will it take? According to Senator Conroy, it will take five to seven years—by which time, I might add, all the laptop computers that the government has promised will be redundant. Not only have the laptops not arrived; when they do arrive they are going to be redundant. It is a total farce.
As we heard today in relation to the Building the Education Revolution and primary schools, the two aims of that project were to provide jobs and to enhance education. We now know the government did not even ask how many jobs would be created when they sought the tenders. So the problem with the youth allowance, as has been put so eloquently by my colleagues, is symptomatic of a broad problem. The broad problem is this: the government is great at rhetoric, is great on spin, has lofty promises but is absolutely woeful on implementation.
 (Senator Troeth)—Order! The time for this debate has now concluded.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Independent Youth Allowance</title>,Matters of Public Importance,14,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission on the examination of the annual report of 2007-08 of the Australian Crime Commission, together with the Hansard record of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Before I report on the committee’s findings, I want to thank my colleagues on the committee for their contributions to this examination, in particular senators Boyce, Parry, Polley and Fielding, along with our colleagues in the other place. I would also like to thank the witnesses who appeared on behalf of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and the Australian Crime Commission board, particularly the Australian Crime Commission Chief Executive Officer, John Lawler; the former Chief Executive Officer, Alistair Milroy; and the chair of the ACC board, Mick Keelty. Finally, a special thank you needs to go to the committee secretariat, headed by the dedicated and indefatigable Dr Jacqueline Dewar, supported by Nina Boughey and Danielle Oldfield, for all the assistance they have provided.
Since our last report, we have lost our minister and our chief executive officer and we are about to lose our chairman—that is, Bob Debus, Alistair Milroy and Mick Keelty. I would like to thank them on behalf of the committee for their exceptional contribution to public life and their efforts in law enforcement. This report has been undertaken as part of the committee’s statutory duty under the Australian Crime Commission Act to examine each annual report of the Australian Crime Commission and report to parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of any such report. As a result of the examination of the report and the evidence received at the public hearing in Canberra in March, the committee has made four recommendations for the government and the ACC to consider.
The first recommendation relates to the need to expedite the judicial process for contempt proceedings relating to ACC contempt matters. This matter was first brought to the attention of the government and the parliament in the Trowell report. During the public hearing the ACC reiterated its concern that the commission does not have mechanisms that are broad, strong or fast enough to deal with contempt arising out of the exercise of the ACC’s coercive powers. The difficulties posed by contempt proceedings were highlighted by Mr Lawler, who indicated that the ACC has intelligence suggesting that certain high-risk crime groups have directed their members to frustrate ACC examinations by refusing to comply with and to provide evidence to the commission. It is an intolerable situation where organised crime groups are able to disrespect the legal powers granted to the commission by relying on the delay that arises when contempt proceedings are pursued. This is not the first time the committee has made this recommendation, but I would hope that it will be the last. It is imperative for the efficacy of ACC investigations that the government issues a response to the Trowell report recommendations and considers how it will enhance definitions of contempt and extradite contempt proceedings.
The second recommendation relates to the shifting focus of the ACC towards financial crime under Wickenby and Midas determinations and the need to address this shifting focus in the ACC’s structure. To address this the committee is suggesting that the Commissioner of Taxation be included as a member of the ACC board, a view supported by the board, according to its chairman. Again this recommendation goes back as far as 2005, when the committee made the same recommendation in its report on the review of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. I am aware that this recommendation has featured in at least two subsequent reports as well. We have been advised that the board has taken some action in the interim by inviting the Commissioner of Taxation to attend meetings as an observer, but it is the view of the committee and the ACC board that, in the long term, the increased focus on the financing and assets of serious and organised crime will be best served by having the commissioner as a permanent voting member.
The third recommendation deals with establishing a practice of reporting and publicising a list of corruption complaints received and investigated by the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity in an appendix to the ACC annual reports. We recognise the concerns of ACLEI that reporting these process cases in an inappropriate manner could jeopardise ongoing investigations or unduly tarnish the reputation of individuals whose guilt has not yet been established. Nevertheless, ensuring the accountability and transparency of ACC reporting processes is a key responsibility of the parliamentary joint committee and as such we firmly believe that this process is necessary. At the same time, we are fully supportive of ACLEI and ACC collaborating on a reporting mechanism that does not compromise or cast aspersions on any case or individual so long as it continues to provide the information in an open and accountable way.
Finally, the ACC is a unique organisation in that, unlike every other law enforcement organisation, the ACC’s CEO has no ability to remove a staff member based on loss of confidence in that staff member’s integrity. I am sure I do not need to tell senators just how critical it is that our law enforcement agencies have the ability to monitor their officers’ integrity and act to deal with potential or prospective breaches. Every state police force has this ability, as does the Australian Federal Police. The CEO of the ACC does not even have the power to suspend employees under investigation.
This is an untenable situation for an organisation that is taking the fight to organised crime in Australia, where the potential for security breaches is enormous and the stakes are high. As such, the committee recommends that the Australian government review existing arrangements for the suspension and dismissal of Commonwealth law enforcement agency employees believed on reasonable grounds to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption and that the government take action as appropriate, bearing in mind the need to respect the rights of employees.
In conclusion, I would like to commend the ongoing work of the Australian Crime Commission in their fight against serious and organised crime. The agency is performing exceptionally well and continues to meet its key performance indicators. The recommendations arising from this report will assist the commission by removing some serious impediments to its effective operation. I table this report. I encourage senators to give it due consideration, to read it and to assist us in prosecuting the recommendations that we have made to this parliament and to this government.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Australian Crime Commission Committee</title>,Committees,15,1
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2009-06-17,"—I would like to endorse the comments made by the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission and also endorse his thanks to the members of the committee and to the secretariat for the outstanding work they do. I have great pleasure in speaking to the tabling of this report on the 2007-08 annual report from the Crime Commission. The establishment of the Crime Commission in January 2003 was a proud achievement of the Howard government and I believe has been well borne out by the great work that the commission has done since. The commission replaced the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments. It has become a truly national criminal intelligence and investigation agency, with a greater focus continuing to be put on the intelligence side of its work.
The ACC started with a budget of $65 million in 2003-04 and in 2009-10 it will have a budget of $111 million, which I think demonstrates the growth in its work. However, we found during a hearing that arrest rates have fallen. The number of people charged by the ACC in 2004-05 was 294, and this dropped to 176 in 2006-07 and went to 210 in 2007-08. Some of the submissions made to the committee’s review of the ACC noted these figures and suggested that they represented a decline in the commission’s effectiveness. The investigative journalist and author on organised crime Mr Bob Bottom pointed out that during 2006-07 the New South Wales Crime Commission was responsible for 445 arrests, compared with the ACC’s 176. The New South Wales figure was achieved with a staff of just 110, compared to the 619 employed by the ACC. The budgets were also compared: there was $14 million for the New South Wales commission and well over $100 million that year for the ACC.
The ACC, I think quite rightly, explains the drop in the arrests by emphasising the change in the focus of its operations, as I noted. They told our committee that the investigations of many offences are best carried out by Australia’s police forces, with the ACC working more on national intelligence. Certainly, an overarching intelligence role is the ideal use of the commission’s resources, but we as a committee feel that this must also be accompanied by a rigorous accounting of this move towards more qualitative KPIs for the ACC. We can measure arrests and the like, but intelligence by its very nature is a far more difficult measurement to make, and so we must rely very carefully and heavily on qualitative KPIs to be sure that the money given to the ACC is being effectively used.
The intelligence services provided by the ACC to its partner organisations are invaluable to those organisations in their ability to make arrests. Eighty-seven per cent of the ACC’s operations are conducted with its 16 partner organisations, including the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Australian Taxation Office. The ACC reports that the feedback and success of its collaborations with partner organisations has been positive. This, of course, is an area that we must continue to watch with great vigilance and to investigate very thoroughly.
The first indicator of the ACC’s performance is the provision of effective and efficient criminal intelligence systems, which includes the storage of intelligence data, in collaboration with partner organisations. I am pleased that the commission is continually upgrading and revising its data capabilities. Last year saw the launch of its latest version of the Australian criminal intelligence database, which includes new capabilities in text analysis and socionetwork analysis tools to detect and map criminal networks—putting two and two together so that you get four, right across Australia, not just in small areas and not just in one city. These networks will be invaluable in the time to come.
Recently, data intelligence regarding tax avoidance, tax evasion and large-scale money laundering has been a strong focus of the commission through Project Wickenby. Project Wickenby, of course, is a cooperative partnership between the ATO, the AFP, ASIC, the Commonwealth DPP and the Australian Crime Commission. In March this year the ACC reported to us that Project Wickenby had resulted in 23 criminal investigations, three convictions and 40 people being charged with indictable offences, as well as $287.3 million in tax liabilities being raised. Given the links that organised crime has with tax avoidance and money laundering, collecting and analysing intelligence on taxation is going to be a growing and ever more important part of the commission’s work.
The links between the ATO and the ACC are very important in detecting organised crime through taxation data. This committee has continually advocated that the Commissioner of Taxation have a permanent position on the Australian Crime Commission board, and that view has been supported by Commissioner Keelty, who said, ‘There is great benefit in having the tax commissioner on the board.’ Therefore, we recommend to the government that the process to include the taxation commissioner as a full member of the Australian Crime Commission board should be expedited.
The second performance indicator of the commission’s operations is to provide investigation of intelligence operations on federally relevant criminal activity. A very necessary component of its work in this area—to investigate and to gather intelligence—is its powers to coerce witnesses to appear and to provide information. In 2007-08 the ACC issued 895 summonses to attend an examination and they conducted 760 examinations. These coercive powers of the ACC are invaluable in their investigation of cross-border organised crime and for gathering information that can be used by both the AFP and state police bodies. For instance, under Strike Force Wolsley the commission recently executed 31 search warrants in relation to the alleged criminality and acquisition of illegally obtained assets by the Hells Angels outlaw motorcycle gang. Strike Force Wolsley was established in August last year and has so far resulted in 123 charges being laid, 36 arrests and the seizure of 31 illegal firearms as well as illegal drugs with an estimated street value of $5 million. The commission’s work with the Joint Asian Crime Group has also had success with the recent prevention of $25 million worth of methamphetamines going onto Australian streets. It was in May, last month, that this shipment was prevented from entering the Australian drugs market.
However, the committee has noted that the ACC needs to have stronger and more expedient mechanisms for dealing with contempt when a person fails to cooperate with the examiners and the examination process. We have heard from the commission that delays in the court’s hearing of contempt matters have often resulted in ‘the importance, relevance and value of the information that comes from those hearings being greatly degraded’. In short, it is too easy for people called as witnesses to frustrate the process by using court appeals to destroy the timeliness and the value of the information they have. Naturally enough, it is the criminals or the alleged criminals with the deepest pockets who have the most opportunity to delay and frustrate the process of uncovering evidence which will assist the Australian community. So certainly we need to work in that area to support this extraordinarily valuable organisation in the work that it is doing to save and protect the Australian community. I commend the report to the house.

This, of course, is an area that we must continue to watch with great vigilance and to investigate very thoroughly.
The first indicator of the ACC’s performance is the provision of effective and efficient criminal intelligence systems, which includes the storage of intelligence data, in collaboration with partner organisations. I am pleased that the commission is continually upgrading and revising its data capabilities. Last year saw the launch of its latest version of the Australian criminal intelligence database, which includes new capabilities in text analysis and socionetwork analysis tools to detect and map criminal networks—putting two and two together so that you get four, right across Australia, not just in small areas and not just in one city. These networks will be invaluable in the time to come.
Recently, data intelligence regarding tax avoidance, tax evasion and large-scale money laundering has been a strong focus of the commission through Project Wickenby. Project Wickenby, of course, is a cooperative partnership between the ATO, the AFP, ASIC, the Commonwealth DPP and the Australian Crime Commission. In March this year the ACC reported to us that Project Wickenby had resulted in 23 criminal investigations, three convictions and 40 people being charged with indictable offences, as well as $287.3 million in tax liabilities being raised. Given the links that organised crime has with tax avoidance and money laundering, collecting and analysing intelligence on taxation is going to be a growing and ever more important part of the commission’s work.
The links between the ATO and the ACC are very important in detecting organised crime through taxation data. This committee has continually advocated that the Commissioner of Taxation have a permanent position on the Australian Crime Commission board, and that view has been supported by Commissioner Keelty, who said, ‘There is great benefit in having the tax commissioner on the board.’ Therefore, we recommend to the government that the process to include the taxation commissioner as a full member of the Australian Crime Commission board should be expedited.
The second performance indicator of the commission’s operations is to provide investigation of intelligence operations on federally relevant criminal activity. A very necessary component of its work in this area—to investigate and to gather intelligence—is its powers to coerce witnesses to appear and to provide information. In 2007-08 the ACC issued 895 summonses to attend an examination and they conducted 760 examinations. These coercive powers of the ACC are invaluable in their investigation of cross-border organised crime and for gathering information that can be used by both the AFP and state police bodies. For instance, under Strike Force Wolsley the commission recently executed 31 search warrants in relation to the alleged criminality and acquisition of illegally obtained assets by the Hells Angels outlaw motorcycle gang. Strike Force Wolsley was established in August last year and has so far resulted in 123 charges being laid, 36 arrests and the seizure of 31 illegal firearms as well as illegal drugs with an estimated street value of $5 million. The commission’s work with the Joint Asian Crime Group has also had success with the recent prevention of $25 million worth of methamphetamines going onto Australian streets. It was in May, last month, that this shipment was prevented from entering the Australian drugs market.
However, the committee has noted that the ACC needs to have stronger and more expedient mechanisms for dealing with contempt when a person fails to cooperate with the examiners and the examination process. We have heard from the commission that delays in the court’s hearing of contempt matters have often resulted in ‘the importance, relevance and value of the information that comes from those hearings being greatly degraded’. In short, it is too easy for people called as witnesses to frustrate the process by using court appeals to destroy the timeliness and the value of the information they have. Naturally enough, it is the criminals or the alleged criminals with the deepest pockets who have the most opportunity to delay and frustrate the process of uncovering evidence which will assist the Australian community. So certainly we need to work in that area to support this extraordinarily valuable organisation in the work that it is doing to save and protect the Australian community. I commend the report to the house.

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2009-06-17,"—I rise to speak on the Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009, a bill which the opposition will not be opposing. This bill presents two key elements: firstly, it undertakes to provide a new temporary training supplement of a proposed $41.60 per fortnight to eligible job seekers on Newstart allowance or parenting payment who undertake approved training to assist them to achieve a year 12 completion or its equivalent because they currently do not hold it; secondly, it undertakes to amend the participation requirements for certain young people requiring them to either earn or learn—to use the government’s language—in order to be eligible for youth allowance.
The temporary training supplement is, as I mentioned, a supplement which the opposition will not be opposing. Not every person leaves school with year 12 or equivalent qualifications, and their reasons for doing so are quite varied. At the time of their leaving, joining the workforce immediately may have been inviting but, as history has shown, more often than not those without qualifications are indeed in a high-risk group for becoming unemployed during times of economic downturn. With this supplement, it is envisaged that these people will use it to return to training to upgrade their qualifications in order to find employment, an opportunity that some will utilise and make the most of. However, there are some who may not take up this opportunity and it is therefore important that, for the short time—just two years—that this supplement is going to be available, it will actually provide benefit to the people it is aiming to assist.
It is obvious that the introduction of this supplement is because of the economic downturn, a downturn which those opposite have certainly exacerbated. As we know, all too sadly, in economic downturns one of the first indicators is rising unemployment, and clearly this training supplement is to provide assistance to those most likely to be unemployed during the difficult times we are currently experiencing. Having said that, the supplement certainly should not be used to hide or mask the unemployment level as it rises. What we are seeing is that, rather than address the issue of future rising unemployment levels, the Rudd government, to some extent, want to disguise them behind a temporary training assistance support payment. There is no real guidance from the government on how they will guarantee that people undertaking this training will find employment afterwards or about training areas which will give more assistance to those people undertaking it and seeking to find a job after they complete that training.
To find employment you need to hold a set of skills or qualifications which business and employers are in need of. Obviously the needs of employers and businesses are constantly changing, and the sort of training that is offered should certainly reflect the changed needs of business and employers. Business needs to be convinced that the short training that is being undertaken will in some way be of benefit to them if they are to subsequently employ that person. Training for training’s sake is not the answer and it is not an automatic pass into the workforce. Businesses do need to be encouraged to employ. Business confidence needs to be boosted and encouragement given for those employers to recruit employees back into the workforce as economic conditions improve.
Businesses and employers have to be encouraged to sign up to taking on these job seekers once they have completed this training. Again, the Rudd government has failed to define how it will achieve this. The Rudd government has indeed failed to define a clear pathway between training and job. The opposition is obviously not opposed to training, but we do believe that it is only one element in assisting someone to get a job. As I have said, the opposition does not oppose the supplement, but we do believe that it is critical to demonstrate how it will lead to employment.
Young people can find it particularly hard to obtain employment during a time of economic downturn. The age range 15 to 24 years is hard hit, and the second part of this bill proposes to remove qualification to youth allowance for those aged 15 to 20 years who are unemployed and looking for full-time work. It amends the participation requirements for these young people, requiring them to either earn or learn to be eligible for youth allowance. The opposition obviously supports any measures that will re-engage youth, and therefore supports this approach. Over the last 12 months we have seen the number of teenagers who are not in full-time education or employment increase from 205,500 to 244,800. In economic downturns, as I mentioned, youth unemployment does increase proportionately.
The coalition supports the offer of training for young Australians who wish to gain additional skills. However, I must repeat that training itself will not help reduce youth unemployment. Providing training and education can certainly boost employability, but it cannot guarantee employment if there are no jobs to give. If there are no jobs, training should not be used as a ploy to keep the unemployment figures down. The opposition will watch carefully over the labour force figures, particularly the figures on youth unemployment. It is important to keep people engaged in the workforce, to keep job seekers actively looking for employment and to encourage business confidence so that they will employ these job seekers.
Sadly, the track record of this government has been one where they have taken a car door to business confidence and consumer confidence. We recall all too well straight after the 2007 election and through 2008 when the government were talking down the economy and when the government were axing business and consumer confidence by talking of inflation genies escaping from bottles. There is no doubt that that led to a slowing of growth in Australia before we started to feel the effects of the global financial situation. Sadly, that has resulted in unemployment rising higher and faster than it needed to, so I certainly hope that the government have learnt their lesson from 2008. When you are in a responsible position as a Prime Minister or a Treasurer, you have a particular responsibility to talk about the strengths and the positive fundamentals of the Australian economy. I would urge the government to adopt that tack because, when you are a government, when you are a Prime Minister and when you are a Treasurer, language certainly does matter.
In conclusion, the Rudd government should not be attempting to distort and manipulate unemployment levels by pushing people who would otherwise be actively seeking work into training in order to claim income support payments. We want to see an official employment rate which is truly reflective of the number of people who are employed and the number of people who are not employed in Australia. We as an opposition support anything which can assist people who are seeking work to get better trained and to be more employable, but we would urge the government to be positive about the fundamentals of the Australian economy and to not seek to use this measure to in some way mask the true unemployment rate.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (TRAINING INCENTIVES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2009-06-17,"—I rise to speak to the government’s Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009, which implements the Compact with Young Australians, and to indicate that the Greens will not be opposing the legislation. While we have indicated that we will support the bill, the government must assure the young people of Australia that the additional training places announced by COAG on 30 April will provide young Australians with skills to match the jobs of the future. Given that we are beginning to see the need to transition our workforce into a low-emission economy, the government must ensure that the Jobs and Training Compact with young Australians is directed towards investing in sustainable jobs for the future. Let us not make this just Work for the Dole for young people. The Greens are concerned that the message that the youth compact sends is not necessarily the right approach to encourage young people of Australia to get education and training. Rather, it demonises them and plays into the outdated stereotype that suggests that all young people are lazy. At a time when young people are under increasing financial pressure, students and those in guaranteed training places need to be better supported if they are to stay on and excel in their chosen path.
As I mentioned earlier, at the COAG meeting on 30 April the Commonwealth, states and territories agreed to a Compact with Young Australians. The aim of the compact is to ensure that every person under 25 is able to access an education and training place. The government is framing it as if all young people will have an entitlement to an education or training place for any government subsidised qualification. Participation in education, training or employment will be compulsory for all young people until they are 17. To support the participation requirement, this legislation is proposing to change the eligibility for youth allowance so that young people under the age of 21 who have not completed year 12 or an equivalent level of education must be in full-time study or complying with the terms of an employment pathway plan before they are considered eligible for youth allowance. Those who have not completed year 12 or an equivalent qualification will need to participate in full-time training of 25 hours a week in order to receive the youth allowance, essentially  playing into the earn or learn argument. This amendment has effectively ensured that an early school leaver will now not be eligible to receive youth allowance (other) simply by actively seeking and being willing to undertake suitable paid work, as was originally permitted.
To exclude access to youth allowance for those aged 15 to 20 who have not completed year 12 or its equivalent and for those who are not undertaking full-time education or training is a radical policy that does not necessarily address problems associated with youth unemployment. For some young people, it is simply not possible to attend training courses or further education studies or to obtain solid employment, especially if they do not know where they will be sleeping each night. What about a young person who has been in trouble at school and is unable to attend any of the schools in their area, and is therefore not able to secure any work? Will these people be punished? What about young people who, despite not being able to attend school, cannot find the suitable 25 hours paid work but who are volunteering their time or gaining work experience? Will these people be able to access youth allowance? I would like to think that this provision does not exclude encouraging young people to volunteer in their communities, especially as a way of upskilling and gaining experience to take into their futures.
What we need to see is a commitment to the bigger picture and an assurance of a continued safety net for homeless young people, with a commitment through the Compact with Young Australians to safe and decent housing. That should be addressed by the government as a bare minimum requirement, acknowledging community calls to tackle housing affordability for young Australians. We know that in the 2006 census it was revealed that more than 32,000 young people in Australia were homeless, which suggests that there is a danger that many will be further disadvantaged by this earn or learn policy, unless of course we can find a way of ensuring that they are not disadvantaged. To simply take away financial support from a young person who is not in full-time study or training without consulting with individuals concerned and key stakeholders is ill-thought-through policy. I would encourage the government to outline what assurances will be provided to guarantee that vulnerable young people are not further disadvantaged by this compact.
Minister Gillard has accepted that there are young people living in difficult circumstances such as homelessness, and has stated that:
… with creative provision of education, they can be back, back learning, back gaining self esteem and self respect and back gaining opportunities that are going to make a difference for the rest of their lives.
While this statement is encouraging, what we need to see is a solid commitment to continued safety for homeless young people through extending the proposed compact for young Australians to include guaranteed access to safe and decent housing. Minister Arbib, you would have to agree that it is pretty hard to stay in school or keep a job if you do not know where you are sleeping at night.
In my home state of South Australia, only last week we saw figures suggesting that, despite the overall fall in jobless numbers in South Australia, the level of youth unemployment jumped by 7.7 percentage points, up to 24.9. That is one-quarter of young workers unemployed. These figures are clearly disturbing, and we will be watching with interest to see whether the youth compact can address these issues for these young unemployed effectively. I hope that they do. Aside from the concerns we have for vulnerable and disadvantaged youth, the Greens and many in the youth sector are also concerned that the compact must offer relevant and engaging training, not just anywhere, anytime, for young people. As I said, let us not just make this Work for the Dole for those under 25. The Greens are by no means opposed to committing to an increase in training and education places—in fact, we welcome that. But we believe that this compact must be targeted and tailored to the individual needs of young people, ensuring that the path they choose to take—whether university, TAFE, apprenticeships or work experience—is an option that they are able to pursue.
The National Union of Students also expressed concerns over the message that the changes to youth allowance send to young people, arguing that young people simply stripped of their youth allowance payments are being unfairly categorised as dole bludgers. What the Greens would like to see is a commitment to increasing the fortnightly rate of youth allowance. I spoke about that this afternoon in this chamber. We need to see an investment in the amount that we give to young people to financially support themselves.
This compact was forged seemingly without any substantial dialogue with young people or the community sector, and the fact that a key component of the legislation includes the withdrawal of benefits for young people not learning or earning means the government must outline that young people under 21 will no longer receive youth allowance because of these proposed changes. We need to ensure that we are not undermining the benefits of giving people more educational and training experiences by punishing them because they are in difficult circumstances. So, while the Greens support the government’s commitment to increasing training and education places, we will be watching with interest how this legislation is rolled out and in particular whether the training and education places match the needs of young people.
Supporting our youth is essential during a time when unemployment levels are on the rise, and we know that youth unemployment rather than other employment is higher in all of the stats. It is becoming more and more difficult for young people to make ends meet. It is fundamental for the government to actively support its young citizens and encourage them to remain engaged and active in society and in the labour force, and the Greens will continue to look closely at the changes to youth allowance under this legislation to ensure that young Australians are not unfairly penalised and further disadvantaged. I will have some questions during the committee stage which I hope the minister can answer.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (TRAINING INCENTIVES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I thank Senator Fifield and Senator Hanson-Young for their comments and also for their support in not opposing the amendments in the Social Security Amendment (Training Incentives) Bill 2009. This is something that the Rudd government and the Labor Party is passionate about. We all remember the 1990s and the hardship that young school leavers and many young people felt in unemployment and the disadvantage they experienced, and that takes years and years to overcome. As the new Minister for Employment Participation, I am passionate about helping young people through the difficulties of the global recession. I am also 100 per cent committed to trying to ensure that young people who have fallen into long-term unemployment and who are disadvantaged are helped as much as possible during these times not just with training but with training that prepares them and provides a pathway into employment and not just Work for the Dole schemes but real jobs which give them employment well into the future. You only need to talk to young people who are unemployed, who are looking for work or who have just found a job to understand how important it is to their self-esteem, how important it is to their confidence and how important it is to their livelihood. It is not just about financial security. It is about who they are as an individual. These become the building blocks for us as a society and for families. This is something that the government and I will be focused on during the hardships of the global recession. I therefore thank the senators for their comments.
Moving into some of the detail of the amendments, the temporary training supplement will provide an extra $41.60 per fortnight to people who are among the most vulnerable to long-term unemployment, recipients of Newstart and parenting payment who have not completed year 12 or an equivalent qualification. The training supplement will be paid to around 50,000 eligible recipients who commence an approved course between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2011. To qualify, eligible Newstart or parenting payment recipients will need to undertake an approved certificate II to certificate IV course that is included in their employment pathway plan. This is a plan between the job seeker and their employment service provider which outlines the activities that they will undertake to help them move into work.
In this economic climate it is crucial that retrenched workers can access income support, training incentives, training places and employment services. The targeted practical assistance that the training supplement will provide to help with study costs builds on the $1,158 training and learning bonus introduced by the government earlier this year. The training and learning bonus provides substantial financial support and study incentives for unemployed people who undertake approved training over the period 1 January 2009 to 30 June 2010. To be clear, people who receive the fortnightly training supplement may also receive the training and learning bonus. This combined assistance provides a substantial incentive for job seekers to undertake training to get the skills they need for sustainable, long-term employment.
In addition to these payments, the government is providing $4.9 billion over three years for Job Services Australia to help job seekers move into paid work. Some $300 million has also been committed to ensure recently retrenched workers get access to immediate intensive support with their employment services provider to find another job. The government has made it easier for retrenched workers to access immediate income support by relaxing the liquid assets waiting period so that people do not have to deplete nearly all of their savings before they can commence getting income support. Through the Productivity Places Program, job seekers have access to more training places to help them gain qualifications from certificate II to certificate IV level.
The second measure in this bill will introduce new participation requirements for young people without year 12 or the equivalent qualification in return for receiving youth allowance. This measure is about proactively addressing the risk of high and sustained youth unemployment in this economic downturn. The changes to youth allowance (other) in this bill will assess young people against new learn or earn participation requirements until they complete year 12 or an equivalent qualification. It is important for us to remember the lessons from the recession of the early nineties, which clearly demonstrated—and I did make this point—that early school leavers and young people with low skills are often the most disadvantaged during a downturn and subsequent recovery. Young people without year 12 or an equivalent qualification are particularly vulnerable to becoming unemployed or being on the long-term job queue.
The changes to youth allowance (other) in this bill will ensure that more young people remain in study or training until they complete at least year 12 or the equivalent—if they have the capacity, of course. This measure is not about penalising unemployed young people. There will be safeguards for young people who have complex needs or who may have only a partial capacity because of work or parental responsibilities. Arrangements for young people will be flexible, and young people with substantial barriers, such as homelessness or substance abuse, will be offered alternative ways to comply with their requirements.
These new arrangements are part of a coordinated strategy between the Australian government and other jurisdictions through the youth compact. Through the Council of Australian Governments, all states and territories have agreed to establish a compact with young Australians which will entitle every Australian under the age of 25 to an education or training place and encourage them to attain higher qualifications and to apply the skills necessary to play a productive role in Australia’s economic recovery. This strong and decisive leadership by the Rudd government has been welcomed by a range of stakeholders, including the National Welfare Rights Network, which has described the youth compact as having ‘the potential to save a generation of young people from a bleak future of long-term employment and poverty’.
The training incentives bill provides a much needed incentive for people to continue to train and learn during periods of downturn and to be skilled for the recovery ahead. The measures in this bill will provide timely and targeted assistance to improve long-term employment outcomes, protecting vulnerable Australians from the full effects of the global recession. The government is determined to position Australia to maximise the benefits of the economic recovery by investing in skills to equip income support recipients to actively participate in the workforce when the economy recovers. I commend the bill to this house and urge all senators to support the bill.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT (TRAINING INCENTIVES) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-06-17,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the coalition on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009. This bill was introduced at the end of the last sitting and contains eight schedules that deal with various technical aspects of amending taxation law. At the outset, I would like to indicate that the opposition will be supporting this bill, but I do want to briefly run through each schedule within the bill.
Schedule 1 amends several acts, including the Banking Act 1959, the First Home Saver Accounts Act, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It removes the unintended tax implications arising from a failed authorised deposit-taking institution’s relationship with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, or APRA, with respect to payments made under the financial claims scheme. The schedule will ensure that payments made under the scheme are treated as if they were made by the failed authorised deposit-taking institutions, or ADIs. It also prevents tax implications from arising for farm management deposit account holders who have their account with failed ADIs when they start a new account with a separate authorised deposit-taking institution.
For individuals with retirement savings accounts with a failed authorised deposit-taking institution, this schedule will ensure that the payments made by APRA into a new retirement savings account in a separate ADI will have the same tax treatment as a rollover superannuation benefit. Similarly, a payment made by APRA into a new first home saver account will be treated as a transfer from one provider to another. This will prevent individuals from claiming the government contribution twice. This schedule also contains certain reporting and withholding requirements for APRA in the case where an ADI fails and payments must be made under the scheme.
Schedule 2 of this bill makes amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and other ancillary legislation to provide greater accessibility to small business capital tax concessions for owners of a capital gains asset used under a passive asset structure. In 2007 the coalition government introduced a range of capital gains tax concessions for small businesses. At that time, changes were also made to the small business entity test and the net asset value test. Businesses in situations where an entity owns a CGT asset but another related entity uses the asset in carrying on a business will now have greater access to those capital gains tax concessions for small businesses.
The coalition welcomes these amendments. Indeed, we have advocated for the small business capital gains tax concessions to be expanded further. Our approach was first outlined by the former Leader of the Opposition, Dr Nelson, in his budget-in-reply speech a little over a year ago. This would be pursued, of course, under an elected coalition government. It will further expand the small business capital gains tax concessions by reducing the active asset test down to five years, giving small business access to these concessions.
Schedule 3 proposes changes to clarify the law with respect to capital gains tax. It amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. This is, I have to say, a highly technical area. The schedule is seeking to remove beyond any doubt what could be a technical interpretation of the law that might, in a worst case scenario, see taxpayers having a capital gains tax liability on receiving a tax offset and the like. This schedule removes any doubt of unintended consequences occurring, which can only be positive.
Schedule 4 provides a refundable tax offset for certain projects approved under the National Urban Water and Desalination Plan. The offsets are to be available for the 2008-09 to 2012-13 income years by way of issuing certificates. Taxpayers who qualify through eligible projects will be able to receive up to 10 per cent of the capital costs, up to a maximum of $100 million per project. I am supportive of these changes, as water supply is very important to everyone. As the government tries to improve the security of water supplies to major cities, this measure will help, I believe, both small and large businesses to ensure that projects proceed as we would want to see them proceed.
Scheduled 5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the deductible gift recipient list to include four new entities and extend the eligible time period of three organisations. The four new entities are the Australasian College of Emergency Medicine, ACT Region Crime Stoppers Ltd, the Grattan Institute, and Parliament of the World’s Religions Melbourne 2009 Ltd. The three entities whose eligible time period will be extended are Bunbury Diocese Cathedral Rebuilding Fund, St George’s Cathedral Restoration Fund, and Yachad Accelerated Learning Project—and I can see Senator Sherry over there; maybe he can tell me if I have got that pronunciation right!
Schedule 6 of the bill would expand the operation of the Australian Business Register. The ABR was established by the former coalition government to reduce administrative costs for small businesses by reducing the number of times a business would be asked for the same information by different agencies. Schedule 5 will expand the operation of the ABR by using certain contact information provided by a business to a government agency for updating information at other government agencies. This schedule also allows the ABR to act as the Multi-agency Registration Authority to facilitate electronic dealings with businesses.
Schedule 7 removes the requirement for a business to be a member of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus Program to be eligible to claim more than $3 million of fuel tax credits. This requirement was included by the former coalition government to encourage large fuel-consuming businesses to reduce their emissions. However, this program will cease operation on 30 June 2009; therefore, businesses will not be able to claim more than $3 million of fuel tax credits after 30 June 2009. Schedule 7 will ensure that larger fuel-consuming businesses will still be eligible to claim fuel tax credits.
Finally, schedule 8 will provide a tax exemption for payments made under the clean-up and restoration grants scheme. On 18 February 2009 the Australian government and the Victorian government announced a $51 million assistance package to assist small businesses and primary producers affected by the Victorian bushfires. I think this has been a good package. It includes a $5,000 clean-up and restoration grant, which can be increased up to $25,000 if the sustained damage is significant. What this schedule does is ensure that these grants are not treated as assessable income, and the exemption will apply to 2008-09 and 2009-10 income years.
In conclusion, the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill deals with a number of necessary and technical tax matters to ensure the correct operation of the law. The opposition does support these efficiencies and clarifications being made to allow the better operation of the tax law. The capital gains tax changes are valuable. The changes to the Australian Business Register, I think, are positive and assist. The amendments to the Fuel Tax Act on fuel tax credits will no doubt be very useful. For small business involved in the clean-up and restoration in Victoria after those horrific bushfires, the exemption from tax on those grants will certainly be well received. The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics on 19 March 2009 and no submissions were made to the Senate inquiry, which means that there must be almost a full score of support for these particular measures. The committee reported on 7 May and recommended that the bills be passed. I see absolutely no reason to take a different view and I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2009-06-17,"—I rise this evening to make a few comments on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009. In particular I want to speak to schedule 7 of the bill. Schedule 7 amends the Fuel Tax Act 2006 to remove the requirement for business entities to be members of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program in order to claim fuel tax credits above $3 million.
The Greenhouse Challenge Plus program will cease operation from 1 July this year, and we need to remind ourselves that the Howard government introduced fuel tax credits in 2006 for business on the proviso that they became members of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program. That condition was intended to encourage large fuel users to monitor and reduce their emissions. Sadly, that has not happened, and I would be very interested to know the government’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program in encouraging large fuel users to monitor and reduce their emissions. They may well have monitored them, and I would be interested to know what they say about the actual total of emissions, because from my reading of it emissions from fuel transport and fuel use is a fast-growing area of greenhouse gas emissions in Australia.
A few weeks ago the World Business Summit on Climate Change called upon political leaders to agree to an ambitious and effective global climate treaty in Copenhagen in December, including a call that:
Governments should strive to end the current perverse subsidies that favour high emission transport and energy infrastructure and promote deforestation.
They particularly said in the Copenhagen call that governments should end subsidies for fossil fuel use. I would be very keen to hear from the government what the justification is for continuing the subsidies that they have here. For a technical reason this is removing the linkage to the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program, and I would like to know what the justification is for ongoing fossil fuel subsidies. The Copenhagen call came from a mainstream summit. It was organised by the Copenhagen Climate Council, and the participants came from a wide range of business, government and NGO organisations including HSBC, Unilever, McKinsey, Swissray, Coca-Cola, Greenpeace International, Carbon Disclosure Project, Business for Social Responsibility and so on.
As I understand it, the government spent $4.7 billion during 2007-08 on providing subsidies to fossil fuel users right across the economy. This represents a nine per cent increase in fuel tax subsidies from 2006-07. Government statistics do not allow for a proper analysis of who is and who is not receiving the fuel tax credits, but by way of example they do reveal that in 2007-08 the mining industry received $1.5 billion, about 30 per cent of the total. I will repeat that: the mining industry received $1.5 billion in fuel tax credits. Anyone who thinks that there is a serious attempt being made at transformation to a low-carbon or zero carbon economy needs to look very carefully at that because we are still spending billions in Australia subsidising fossil fuel use.
If you were to assume that fossil fuels were unlimited, infinite in their supply, and that there was no problem with climate change, you would still have to ask: what is the excuse for this level of corporate welfare? There is no excuse in a climate constrained world where we have reached peak oil. While we have President Obama talking day in, day out about the need for America to develop its own energy security policy, to get off foreign oil, to make the transition out of fossil fuels and to invest in public transport and so on, we have this government, the Rudd government, talking about the climate challenge with, at the same time, no intention whatsoever of getting rid of the fuel tax credits act. We should be abolishing the fuel tax credits act and directing the forgone revenue towards clean transport and production technologies. When is Australia going to have a plan for peak oil? When are we going to wake up to the fact that this dependence on fossil fuels, particularly in the mining industry, is going to mean we suffer major dislocation?
We had what constituted an oil price spike—or minor shock, if you like—when prices started going through $100 and higher last year. Because oil prices have come down it is assumed that that will continue. It will not. ABARE has it wrong. It has had it wrong in relation to oil prices for generations. The reality is that we are going to see oil prices go up again. If the government actually took the time to look at who owns the oil in the world they would find that it is owned by national regimes that can switch off the oil if they choose to do so. There is plenty of evidence to show that the reserves being touted are inflated, that those reserves are not there.
When I was elected to the Senate in 2005 we had the inquiry into Australia’s future oil supply and alternative transport fuels. I do not know how many times the government has to be presented with evidence that we are running out of oil. Now we have a subsidy for ongoing fossil fuel use, and in the next tax bill to come before the Senate we will be providing subsidies to go out and find more oil. We will have a subsidy to use more oil and a subsidy to find more oil. At what point are we going to realise that it is running out, that we need to be getting off it and that we need a strategy to move away from our oil dependency, not one to subsidise its use to make it cheaper, assuming that by subsidising exploration we are suddenly going to find oil?
We need a national strategy which looks at not only oil depletion but energy security in Australia. I am surprised that the mining industry in particular has not realised its own vulnerability. I can only assume it is because the government’s next step will be to say that it is okay to liquefy coal. That has been ABARE’s answer up till now—that it does not matter if we run out of foreign oil because we can always liquefy coal. If we liquefy coal we will accelerate global warming. We know that is exactly what would happen with liquefied coal because carbon capture and storage is not real and, if it is ever going to be real, will not be real within the next 15 to 20 years.
So what are we going to do? Where is Australia’s plan? My colleague Senator Ludlam put this question yesterday to Mr Conroy, who squibbed it by saying: ‘Yeah, the government’s got a plan in here. It’s somewhere under the environmental provisions.’ I am talking here not about environmental provisions but about energy security provisions. I am asking how this economy is going to cope when oil goes through $150, if not $200, per barrel. What are we going to do then? What possible justification could you have then for providing this level of subsidy to force increased use of oil by making it cheaper, at the same time giving out subsidies—as we will see in the next tax bill that comes through—for imagining you can find more?
The oil companies themselves will tell you that they are now in deeper, more dangerous waters, that it is more and more difficult, that they are into areas where there is less certainty of being able to pump at an economically viable level. It is utterly and totally irresponsible to be continuing the fuel tax credits act. Rather, we should be getting rid of that and not the Greenhouse Challenge program.
Having said that, of course, we have always been sceptical about the Greenhouse Challenge program. It was a Howard government initiative and relied on voluntary action by industry to achieve abatement. It was an inadequate response to the challenge posed by climate change, because it was a purely voluntary scheme. Yes, it was a good idea to have it but, being voluntary, it was never going to end in the kind of systemic shift that you would expect. For too long it was used as an excuse not to implement effective policies on climate change. I assume that the reason behind the timing for its abolition is that the government thought its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would be passed and that the start times for the changes were meant to be complementary. However, the government’s capitulation to business and to the very industries that benefit massively from the subsidies I have just been talking about means that the legislation the government imagined would be there will not be there and we will not have the CPRS or the Greenhouse Challenge program.
While we thought, and still think, that the Greenhouse Challenge program, because it was voluntary, was not as effective as it might have been, it was one of only two programs that compelled large-scale industries to implement any kind of abatement activities. Removal of this membership requirement and the abolition of this program mean that, until the current uncertainty with the CPRS is resolved, there will be no government program that engages with large-scale emitters on abatement issues. That is because the government has refused to force these emitters to implement the energy efficiency opportunities that they have been required to identify under the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Act and because they have not required them to implement it. So they get off the hook on that front as well. It is notable that for many other issues the government is seeking to extend the life of a program until relevant inquiries are completed. As I mentioned, the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 3) Bill 2009 seeks to extend the life of current exploration tax incentives under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act until the Henry review reports in December and that future tax policy can be clarified. So it is notable that the government is prepared to extend programs that subsidise fossil fuel use by industry but not programs that are focused on delivering any kind of environmental benefit.
This raises the question of whether the government will now indicate whether it is going to extend the life of the Greenhouse Challenge program until agreement is reached on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the date for implementation is finalised. I am particularly keen to hear from the government what the justification is—when we are trying to reduce fossil fuel emissions and are faced with peak oil—for continuing a fuel tax credit act that gives to the mining industry, which had one of the biggest booms of all time in the last decade. In 2007-08 we gave them $1.5 billion as a result of these subsidies. We gave the transport, postal and warehousing sectors $1.2 billion, another 25 per cent. The construction industry received $226 million, and the manufacturing industry received $276 million. The mining industry and the transport, postal and warehousing sectors received 55 per cent of the total. I come back to the fact that a total of 30 per cent went to the mining industry while it was making record profits. It made its record profits, it paid a lower level of company tax and then it had huge amounts sent back to it in fossil fuel subsidies. Under the CPRS it would receive its permits. The coal fired generators would be receiving yet more corporate welfare in one-off payments, and emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries will be getting massive numbers of free permits.
This is precisely why the Greens criticise the government. The government constantly talks about a whole-of-government approach to climate change, yet what we see is an entirely counterproductive, internally inconsistent policy position. It is a silo position. You have the minister for the environment or the minister for climate change saying the government wants to do something on emissions, and you have the minister for resources and the Treasury giving subsidies and undermining anything you might be doing on emissions reduction by saying: ‘Don’t worry about them. Just use more oil—we’ll subsidise it. Build more roads—we’ll subsidise it. Build a bigger coal port—we’ll subsidise it. Get those emissions out there. Get them flowing faster.’ It is internally contradictory. It is counterproductive, and I am very keen for Minister Sherry to inform the Senate, from the government’s perspective, how the tax office and the Treasury are facilitating a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and energy security for Australia, particularly in terms of transport fuels. Explain to me how this initiative helps on the greenhouse challenge that we face and how it helps on the energy security challenge that we face. Minister Sherry, I look forward to some creativity in your answer.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2009-06-17,"—I indicate my support for the second reading of the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 2) Bill 2009, and I note in general terms that tax offsets are allowed for urban stormwater and desalination, which I think is an unambiguously good thing. I note that the stormwater offsets start at $4 million, which was one of the outcomes of the stimulus package, and it is a good thing to encourage those sorts of projects. I want to focus on one particular aspect of this bill, the Greenhouse Challenge Plus and fuel tax credits, so that I can put my concerns and questions on the record so they can be responded to in the committee stage.
My first question is in relation to Minister Bowen’s second reading speech on 19 March, specifically the comments made by the minister in relation to the amendments detailed in schedule 7 noting that the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program will cease after 30 June 2009. With these amendments, businesses will still be able to claim fuel tax credits that previously relied on participation in the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program. These arrangements, as I understand them, allowed large fuel users to claim fuel tax credits in excess of $3 million in the financial year as an incentive to reduce carbon emissions.
My questions to the minister in relation to this are as follows. What environmental criteria will large fuel users no longer be required to meet after 30 June, while still being eligible for fuel tax credits? Further, as I understand it, Minister Bowen has indicated that the government believes that the CPRS will better achieve the carbon emissions reductions required for fuel tax credits, given that it is unlikely that the current version of the CPRS will pass the Senate by the end of next week, or is it true that large fuel users will still be able to claim fuel tax credits for little to no environmental benefit? Does the minister agree that in the absence of Greenhouse Challenge Plus the standards for large fuel users to claim fuel tax credits are not onerous and are too easily met? Those are my questions and concerns in relation to this particular aspect of the bill. I think I told the minister that I would be speaking for no more than three to four minutes and I think I have done it in under three.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES NO. 2) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,27,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-17,"—Thank you for your three-minute time limit, Senator Xenophon. It is just as well you did not mention superannuation, or we might have been here for a while. I would like to thank Senators Coonan, Milne and Xenophon for their contributions in this debate. I will cover the concerns raised by Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne a little later in my contribution. They were essentially the same issue, although I think Senator Milne was a little more broad ranging than you, Senator Xenophon, in her themes and contributions.
Schedule 1 makes amendments to a number of acts which are required as a result of payments which might be made under the Financial Claims Scheme which this parliament enacted in October last year. Under the scheme, APRA can make payments to claims under general insurance policies with failed insurance companies and to account holders in failed financial institutions. These amendments ensure that no inappropriate tax consequences will occur if payments are made under the scheme.
Schedule 2 amends the tax law to expand access to the small business capital gains tax concessions for taxpayers owning passively-held CGT assets whose circumstances mean they are currently ineligible. This will extend access to taxpayers who own a CGT asset used in a business by an affiliate or entity connected with the taxpayer and partners owning certain CGT assets used in the partnership business. These taxpayers will have access to the small business CGT concessions via the small business entity test from the 2007-08 income year. Schedule 2 also refines and clarifies aspects of the existing small business CGT concession provisions so that they operate flexibly and as intended. This is done via a number of minor amendments.
Schedule 3 amends the law to provide a general exemption from CGT for capital gains or capital losses arising from a right or entitlement to receive a tax offset deduction or similar benefit. This amendment will ensure that the value of these benefits is not reduced by the possible application of the CGT in these circumstances, or where taxpayers have a right or entitlement to other similar taxation benefits.
Schedule 4 amends the 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act to provide a refund tax offset in relation to certain projects approved under the National Urban Water and Desalination Plan. Under the plan, the government will provide assistance to large infrastructure projects which assist cities and towns to meet future water demand. Eligible projects may receive assistance at a rate of 10 per cent of eligible capital costs, up to a maximum of $100 million per project. This financial assistance will be provided as refundable tax offsets for private sector applicants. The plan finishes in 2013-14. Accordingly, the provisions are repealed with effect from 1 July 2014.
Schedule 5 amends division 30 of the 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act to specifically list four new organisations and extend the listing of three organisations as deductible gift recipients—DGRs. Taxpayers can claim income tax deductions for certain gifts to organisations with DGR status. DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. The schedule specifically lists or extends the listing of the Australian College for Emergency Medicine; the Grattan Institute; ACT Region Crime Stoppers Limited; PWR Melbourne 2009 Limited, which is the Parliament of the World’s Religions; Yachad Accelerated Learning Project Limited, and apologies if I have mispronounced that; the St George’s Cathedral Restoration Fund; and the Bunbury Diocese Cathedral Rebuilding Fund.
The amendments in part 1 of schedule 6 assist the registrar of the Australian Business Register to prepare to take on the role of the multiagency registration authority and they improve the integrity and efficiency of the Australian Business Register. The amendments in part 2 of schedule 6 establish the role of the multiagency registration authority to facilitate the standard business reporting program, which will enable businesses to streamline their reporting to government agencies through the use of the Australian Business Number. The amendments assist the registrar to identify representatives of businesses for the purpose of online reporting to multiple government agencies. The program is designed to reduce reporting burdens by eliminating unnecessary or duplicated reporting.
Schedule 7 deals with some issues raised by Senator Xenophon and Senator Milne, and I will come back to that at the end. Schedule 8 amends the 1997 Income Tax Assessment Act to exempt from tax the clean-up and restoration grants which form part of the government’s assistance to small business and primary producers affected by the Victorian bushfires in February this year. This exemption applies to the 2008-09 and the 2009-10 income years and involves a cost to revenue of less than $7 million.
I will now deal with the issues raised in respect of Schedule 7. Senator Milne took the opportunity—as many of us do—to enter into a reasonably wide-ranging commentary and debate. That is not a criticism. She has long had concerns about peak oil and she took the opportunity to raise a range of issues which, without being critical, are not integral to the matters we are dealing with in this bill. However, she, like Senator Xenophon, raised some issues around what is known as the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program. In schedule 7, amendments to the Fuel Tax Act 2006 and related provisions elsewhere in the tax law to remove the provision that businesses must be a member of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program to claim more than $3 million of fuel tax credits in a financial year will have effect from 1 July 2009. The Greenhouse Challenge Plus program will cease after 30 June 2009. This bill is not bringing it to an end; the program known as Greenhouse Challenge Plus ceases automatically.
—So what is the compliance?
—I will get to that in a moment. The Greenhouse Challenge Plus program provision in the Fuel Tax Act was originally included so that large fuel users would monitor and take measures to reduce their carbon emissions. This outcome will be better achieved through the government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Without this amendment—this is a cross-reference amendment—business would be unable to claim fuel tax credits in excess of $3 million in a financial year after 30 June 2009. This would be inconsistent with the policy intent of the fuel tax credits system. As I have mentioned, a condition that businesses may not claim more than $3 million worth of fuel tax credits in a financial year unless they are a member of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus, GCP, was included in the Fuel Tax Act 2006 so that large fuel users would monitor and take measures to reduce their carbon emissions.
In November 2008, Minister Garrett advised that Greenhouse Challenge Plus, GCP, will lapse after 30 June 2009, so this was announced some seven months ago. The GCP commenced in 1995 and was always scheduled to finish and lapse in mid-2009. There is no legislation required; it lapses automatically. The lapsing of the GCP was supported by the Wilkins review of Australian government climate change programs. The key elements of the Greenhouse Challenge Plus program—emissions, inventory reporting and assisting companies in reducing their greenhouse emissions—have been superseded by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System, NGERS, and the Climate Change Action Fund, CCAF, respectively. So that is what has replaced it, Senator Xenophon. This is a removal of a cross-reference to the Fuel Tax Act. This act does not bring to an end Greenhouse Challenge Plus. That is coming to an end via another mechanism. The GCP required reporting on (1) emissions and (2) any reduction programs from 1 July 2008. Large fuel users are required by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System to report on these emissions.
So that is the explanation. I thank Senator Xenophon for his brief and probing question and I thank Senator Milne. I acknowledge her longstanding interest in, particularly, peak oil. I have heard her contributions on many occasions—and she has a perfect right to raise them. I understand the reasons she has done so; however, the particular concern around Greenhouse Challenge Plus lapsing—not being brought to an end by this legislation—is not directly relevant to any actions that flow from this particular piece of legislation. I thank senators for their contribution and commend the bill to the Senate.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2009-06-17,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the coalition in response to the proposed International Monetary Agreements Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2009. This bill is not controversial, and I am not going to delay the Senate very long with my comments. The bill proposes to amend the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 so that the process for Australian acceptance of amendments to the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development is simplified.
At present, when an amendment to the articles of agreement is agreed to by the IMF or the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, an amendment of the International Monetary Agreements Act is required to change the schedules to reflect the new articles of agreement. This bill proposes to alter the definition of ‘articles of agreement’ in the International Monetary Agreements Act to include any amendments that enter into force for Australia without the need for further legislation to amend the act. It will not have any financial impact. It does make commonsense to do this, because it will allow governance changes approved by the IMF and the IBRD to be accepted by Australia without an amendment bill passing through parliament. An example of the benefit of this action is the speedy approval of the new funding model for the IMF. The current financial crisis has served to highlight the need to be able to respond quickly to changes introduced by these global bodies. Expediting Australia’s formal acceptance of amendments to the IMF and IBRD agreements will ensure that we continue to work together with these bodies in a seamless manner.
While I am aware that there are some concerns that this bill will undermine parliamentary democracy and scrutiny in the chamber and indeed national sovereignty by allowing legislative changes to occur without reference to parliament, we must also acknowledge that there are already similar provisions in place which allow updates to international treaties to which Australia is a party. In addition, as the IMF and IBRD agreements are international treaties, amendments to the agreements will still be tabled in parliament and considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. So there will be an opportunity to voice concerns that may be wished to be raised. Also, if there are any funding requirements arising from amendments to the IMF or IBRD agreements, they will still be dealt with through an appropriations bill, ensuring that nothing will, in that sense, slip through the cracks.
We in the coalition do support the role that the IMF and the IBRD play in assisting and supporting global financial stability, particularly in times such as these which we now encounter. We also acknowledge the need for swift reaction to enable the full potential of the power of these important international bodies to be realised. I had thought that this was in the non-controversial business list of the Senate, but it does not really matter where it is dealt with. The coalition will be supporting the bill as drafted and, in those circumstances, I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2009-06-17,"—I would like to thank Senator Coonan for her contribution in the debate on the government’s International Monetary Agreements Amendment (Financial Assistance) Bill 2009. The purpose of this bill is to extend provisions currently contained in the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947—the IMA Act—that enabled the Treasurer to lend money or enter into a currency swap with a country in support of an international monetary fund, IMF, program. The amendments are based closely on the IMA Act provisions and will extend the current arrangements to include support for World Bank and Asian Development Bank, ADB, programs.
On 10 December 2008, the Prime Minister announced that Australia will enter into a stand-by loan agreement with Indonesia, should it be required. This loan arrangement will form part of a World Bank-led arrangement and will include contributions from the ADB and government of Japan. The amendments will enable Australia to provide the stand-by loan to Indonesia, if it is needed, as well as to enter into a loan or currency swap with other countries to support World Bank or ADB programs in the future, should the need arise.
The loan is a stand-by facility. There is no certainty that Indonesia will need to draw down on the loan. If activated, the loan will be paid back in full and an appropriate interest rate will be charged on the loan. It is in Australia’s national interest to support stability and economic recovery, particularly in our region—an issue on which there is bipartisan support. It is particularly important in the current circumstances of the world financial and economic crisis. During the debate on the bill in the House of Representatives the shadow Treasurer indicated that the coalition support this legislation, and they undertook similar activities in the past during the Asian financial crisis. I also note—and Senator Coonan has referred to this—the tabling requirements and the necessity for appropriation bills. Consistent with the 1998 IMA amendment bill, this bill will allow Australia to continue to play its part in international cooperation efforts, particularly during this time of international financial and economic crisis—the worst crisis we have seen in some 75 years.
In concluding, I do have some direct knowledge of the Asian Development Bank, its administration and its programs, because I have been the Australian ministerial representative to the ADB for the last two years. Both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are very strong, reputable organisations with good governance and very effective programs. I have no doubt that if the stand-by loan arrangements with Indonesia are activated, both these organisations—and I have first-hand knowledge of the ADB—are well placed to deliver effective assistance in this time of international financial and economic crisis. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2009-06-17,"—The Public Works Committee yesterday brought down its report recommending proposed works at the RAAF Base Edinburgh stage 2. The development of the Edinburgh base will enable the 7RAR mechanised battalion to relocate to Adelaide and will upgrade facilities for the RAAF. This work is very important for South Australia—the northern suburbs of Adelaide in particular. I have a very particular interest in this site because for nearly 12 years I lived a block or so from the air base. For part of that time I was also the state parliament member for the area, and I was very well aware of the benefits of having the defence forces based there. A couple of years ago I also had the privilege of participating in the Defence Force program that allowed me to do a tour in one of the Orions that are based at Edinburgh and which happened to have a navigator who had been a close neighbour of mine.
The Defence Force plans will not only benefit the northern suburbs of Adelaide, with the Edinburgh redevelopment and the associated defence housing, they will also support the associated development at the Cultana Training Range between Whyalla and Port Augusta. Although that area of South Australia is doing very well in terms of employment and growth at the moment with the development of the mining sector, it will still be a welcome development to have that defence establishment there. The federal and state governments are not just working towards upgrading physical infrastructure but also putting effort and resources into building skills with the defence industry sector.
In December last year, the Rudd government announced a $61 million investment in defence industry skilling, and South Australia will benefit from a significant proportion of that funding. I believe this skilling is an important and essential part of South Australia’s involvement in defence projects, and it also contributes to the impressive pool of expertise that already exists in South Australia. Apart from the engineers and technicians that work at RAAF Base Edinburgh, the Collins class submarine employs a great many engineers and technicians. We also have an associated facility, the DSTO, out in the northern suburbs, which has tremendous expertise in signals communications and other defence related technical areas. It is a great employer of scientists and engineers from South Australia.
The $61 million announced by the Rudd government enables that pool of skilled people to increase and relates to a number of programs. Up to $6 million will be available to establish the South Australian Advanced Technology Schools Pathway program, which will provide career pathways to the defence industries for young people in South Australia. There is also $5.9 million for the professional doctorates program in systems engineering. This program will ensure PhD candidates receive the most up-to-date coursework and research in systems engineering and ensure that they have a clear appreciation of its application to the defence industry and the military. The first round of scholarships for this program will be offered nationally early in 2010. Another $6 million will be invested to establish the masters program in systems support engineering, which will equip senior engineering and project managers with the knowledge and understanding to deliver integrated support solutions. An Adelaide based company, BAE Systems, will coordinate the development of the course with RMIT and with substantial input from the University of South Australia, Saab and the ASC.
The final prong of this funding will be $2.5 million invested with the University of South Australia to convert its existing masters of military systems integration to a flexible delivery mode. Again, this was developed in partnership with a number of bodies: the University of South Australia and three defence industry companies, BEA Systems, Saab and ASC. As I said, we already have an impressive pool of talent and we look forward to improving that pool of talent with the benefit of the funding that has been provided by this program. South Australia has a number of very impressive educational facilities, and I know that there is a concerted effort by schools and facilities, including in the northern suburbs, to tie in with these defence industry related programs. It is part of a resurgence in the northern suburbs in providing jobs and skills for people in the area.
The defence contribution to the South Australian economy is enormously important for South Australia and for the northern suburbs of Adelaide in particular. It has been something that has been worked on by the South Australian government very assiduously. They have been very strong in negotiating and in pushing their case with the federal government and the defence industry generally about the skills base that we have in South Australia and the potential to develop that even further.
A part of that push for recognition of South Australia as a state of excellence in the defence industry and defence generally has been the formation of the Defence SA Advisory Board. The defence board advises the South Australian government about defence matters and is chaired by General Peter Cosgrove. In March this year, Professor Kim Beazley, who has a well-known interest and expertise in defence matters, joined the board, and that was welcomed by the South Australian government. There are a number of eminent people on the board, including South Australians Mr Andrew Fletcher, who is chief executive of Defence South Australia, and Mr Malcolm Kinnaird, who is a leading South Australian businessman in the area of engineering. Emeritus Professor Paul Dibb is an adviser to the board on strategic policy matters. This has been a matter of great strategic importance to the South Australian government, and South Australia is benefiting substantially from the involvement of the defence forces in the South Australian economy. South Australians everywhere welcome that involvement and look forward to an increased involvement by the defence forces.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>RAAF Base Edinburgh</title>,Adjournment,30,1
