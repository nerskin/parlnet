Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (10:10):  I present the delegation report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia from 26 August to 7 September 2012. The delegation's report is a summary of the key issues covered during the visit to two of Australia's most important bilateral partners, China and Indonesia. The visit to China was part of the official parliamentary exchange agreement with the National People's Congress. It also coincided with the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, a far-sighted step that was taken by the Whitlam government as one of its first acts in 1972. As I entered the National People's Congress in Beijing I was struck by the enormous historic significance of this event and I could only think of the great man himself, Gough Whitlam, as he walked up those very same steps 40 years ago. Nobody then could have imagined the changes to take in place in China over the coming four decades. The relationship between Australia and China has developed way beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic commentator back in 1972.


The delegation first held bilateral discussions with members of the National People's Congress. The issues covered included agricultural cooperation, food security, food safety, investment and how to deal with an ageing population. The delegation proposed a number of mechanisms for deepening the connection between our two parliaments, including holding regular meetings between our delegations at IPU meetings and the greater use of video technology so that committees in both Australia and China can exchange views more often. The delegation also travelled to Kunming and Chengdu for further meetings and to meet with Australian businesses in China.


Throughout the visit, one of the clear concerns put to the delegation by Chinese business was a perception of unequal treatment when attempting to invest in Australia. The delegation was able to address specific cases as they were raised and we also made the point that Australia has a non-discriminatory investment regime. But the point remains that there is disquiet in China at the political and business level, with perceptions about Australian unease with Chinese investment.


In Indonesia, the delegation visited Jakarta, Bogor and West Sumatra. Our discussions in the Indonesian National Assembly with the Australian parliamentary group and commission 4 revealed the dynamism that now exists in Indonesia's democracy. They also revealed a considerable appetite for greater engagement between the parliaments of Indonesia and Australia. Visits are important. But this is something that could easily be achieved by greater use of videoconferences between parliamentary committees here in Canberra and in Jakarta.


The delegation spent several days in West Sumatra with AusAID looking at the impact of Australia's aid. We visited an Islamic school that was rebuilt after the 2009 earthquake, a health clinic that services some 24,000 people, a village that had no running water until Australian aid money provided taps and sanitation and a village devastated by the earthquake where houses were being rebuilt to earthquake-proof standards. In each of these cases it was clear that this was money well spent and projects that all Australians can be proud of.


Before concluding, I would like to place on record the delegation's thanks to those who assisted us during the visits. First, I would like to thank our ambassadors to China and Indonesia, Frances Adamson and Greg Moriarty, for the time that they took to brief the delegation. We also appreciated the interaction and participation of the various section heads at both embassies throughout the visit. I would like to particularly thank the second secretary in China, Armaity Bradley, for her tireless efforts in putting together the program and accompanying us throughout. Armaity, you were a delight to travel with. I also want to make special mention of David Dukes, the senior trade commissioner, who coordinated our corporate meetings and travelled with the delegation. David is doing great work. His extraordinary love for and knowledge of China rubbed off on us all. Special thanks go to Geoff Matthews, the third secretary in Indonesia, who coordinated our program and travelled with us. Geoff's first aim was always to please, as he was keen to show us as wide a view of Indonesia as allowed in the few days we had available.


To Rachael Moore, and your colleagues in the AusAID team in Jakarta: you are an impressive group of Australians. Thank you for showing us the valuable development work Australia is doing in West Sumatra. Thanks also go to Australian federal agent Marco Corinaldelsi, who travelled with us in Indonesia and ensured that the security put in place by the Indonesian National Police was as unobtrusive as possible, though that was not always easy. Thanks also to Fiona Way from the International and Community Relations Office for coordinating the visit from this end.


I also feel the need to acknowledge particularly Peter Stephens, the secretary of the delegation, who is in the gallery. Peter made everything so much easier with his willingness to assist the committee with his knowledge of what was required, with his capacity to coordinate with officials and, other than being confused with being the partner of a good senator who was also on the trip, he was a delight to be with.


Before concluding I would like to express appreciation to my colleagues for their support throughout the visit. It was a visit that was well worth doing. (Time expired)

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (10:15):  I endorse the remarks by the member for Bruce. I too was on the delegation. It was indeed the 40th anniversary of our relationship with China, and we were warmly welcomed wherever we went and had excellent access to Chinese officials—who were too numerous to mention in the short time that I have available, but we did appreciate the very open discussion we had with the Chinese leadership.


Australians are mostly focused on our trade with China in raw commodities—that is, the mining products from Australia—but in fact the relationship goes far deeper and Australia operates a huge surplus with China. They are our biggest trading partner and our trade includes more than $6 billion worth of agricultural sales from Australia to China. We met with a number of businesses while we were in China, and some of the opportunities that are there for Australian business at the moment are really starting to reveal themselves. There is an emerging middle class in China, which is focusing on clean, green and healthy food. The echoes of the contaminated infant formula are still repercussing—if that is a word!—throughout the Chinese nation. So there is a keen interest in products from Australia.


While Chinese investment in Australia was raised on a reasonably regular basis—and the member for Bruce has already brought that point up—the officials were keen to point out that China should not be treated differently from any other nation when investing in Australia. In the light of this debate it was particularly interesting, for me at least, to be meeting with an Australian company called Lynch Trading, who are cut-flower wholesalers—the largest in Australia—operating in the Hunan Province, where in fact they have negotiated a 50-year lease, with another 50-year right of renewal—to develop a framing cut-flower industry in China. So just in that line of debate of foreign investment in Australia, and the oft-raised point that we cannot invest in China: in fact there are many companies investing in China at the moment, and that was quite interesting to me.


There are a range of other Australian industries operating in China, and they are very confident of expansion. Energy supply and greenhouse abatement were raised. One of the interesting points made to me was that the Chinese estimated that they utilised just 30 per cent of their hydro-electricity assets up to this stage, which is worth comparing with the restrictions we put on these areas in Australia. Of course, defence arrangement with the US was raised.


In Indonesia I was very pleased to be on the delegation. Indonesia is the most important country, I believe, to Australia—a moderate, democratic Muslim nation of 240 million; our biggest wheat customer and also our biggest thermal coal competitor. We covered a broad range of issues, and the meetings with Indonesian members of parliament were excellent and ranged across the spectrum. I was particularly interested in our visit to the Centre for International Forestry Research in Bogor, where we talked about the effects of palm oil, both on the environment and the economy; and the likely effects of the recently passed anti-logging bill in this parliament on their economy and their ability to manage their industry.


We went to Western Sumatra, as the member for Bruce raised. I won't go back through those projects, but they were very good for us to see firsthand. Of course, boatpeople were raised. And, once again, Australia's relationship with the US and the establishment of American troops on Australian soil.


I would like to thank those who assisted in any way with the delegation—particularly Ambassador Frances Adamson in China and all her staff, and Ambassador Greg Moriarty in Indonesia and all his staff. I would also like to thank the member for Bruce, Alan Griffin, Senator Ursula Stephens and Senator Richard Colbeck for their very good company and fine manner throughout the delegation. I particularly, once again, thank Peter Stephens, our delegation secretary, for his great work ethic and the well structured way he put together the delegation.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:20):  On behalf of the Standing Committee on Education and Employment, I present the committee's report incorporating a dissenting report entitled Workplace Bullying: We just want it to stop, together with the minutes and proceedings and evidence receiving by the committee. As you can see it is quite extensive.


In accordance with standing order 39(f), the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms RISHWORTH:
  by leave—The Productivity Commission estimates that workplace bullying costs the Australian economy between $6 billion and $36 billion annually. The human costs are enormous. People's health—both physical and mental wellbeing—productivity and personal lives suffer immeasurably when subjected to bullying.


The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Bill Shorten, referred the inquiry to the committee in June to examine the nature, causes and extent of workplace bullying and consider ways to address bullying cultures and prevent their development in the workplace.


The committee received over 300 written submissions—the majority from individuals recounting personal experiences of bullying—and from organisations and experts who have extensive knowledge and experience either in assisting those who have been bullied at work or educating employers on how to prevent and manage this issue. The committee travelled to all states and territories to hear heart-rending stories of resultant ill-health, financial strain, loss of self-esteem and suicide as a direct consequence of workplace bullying. Bullying has devastating and long-lasting impacts on affected individuals and their loved ones as well as on our community. No-one should feel unsafe at work, be pushed out of their job, or feel that their life is in peril by remaining in a toxic work environment.


The inquiry was announced amidst a nation-wide harmonisation process of work health and safety legislation—the primary area of regulation of the risks of bullying at work. Harmonised work health and safety laws have now been adopted in all jurisdictions, with the exceptions of Victoria and Western Australia. In addition to this harmonisation effort, governments, unions and employer groups are working to develop a nationally consistent code of practice on managing the risks of bullying. The committee supports the code and hopes to see it expedited and promoted, with guidance materials for employers that detail appropriate responses to and outcomes for reports of workplace bullying. The committee also recommends the introduction of regulations setting a minimum standard of action that must be taken to minimise bullying in the workplace, to establish employers' clear obligations.


Although the committee learnt Australia is considered an international leader in best practice by taking a risk-management approach to workplace bullying, there is still much to do.


The inquiry considered the extent to which Brodie's law in Victoria—an amendment to the Crimes Act brought about to ensure greater sanctions against workplace bullying behaviours—should be nationalised. The committee encourages state and territories to collaborate and ensure their criminal laws are as extensive as Brodie's law so that there is a clear message across Australia that bullying in the workplace is a serious issues. 


We must not let bullying get to the point endured by Brodie Panlock. Our report subtitle, 'We just want it to stop', was a constant refrain from targets. Prevention and early intervention are critical to ensure that we reduce the human toll of bullying in the workplace.


Our report contains 23 recommendations that focus on practical solutions we believe will help incidences of bullying in Australia's workplaces. First, there is a lack of clarity about what does and does not constitute bullying behaviour. We support the national adoption of the definition of workplace bullying as repeated, unreasonable behaviour directed towards a worker or workers that creates a risk to health and safety.


Witnesses spoke repeatedly of confusion about where to go for help, and frustrations with different laws and regulations operating in each jurisdiction. People who are bullied do not have recourse to antidiscrimination laws unless the bullying falls under protected attributes such as race, sex and age. Similarly, industrial relations laws are restricted in dealing with bullying. The committee also heard that workers compensation laws do not provide an easy avenue for redress.


For these reasons we recommend that the Commonwealth government establish a one-stop shop—a national advisory service to provide advice, assistance and resolution services to employers and workers. The committee also recommends that a feasibility study be undertaken on the establishment of independent investigation as well as an adjudicative process for individual recourse for individuals affected.


I thank all of those who provided evidence to the inquiry, particularly the many individuals who courageously relayed their stories. I would like to thank my committee colleagues for the work they put into the report, and also the secretariat support staff—in particular, Lauren Wilson, Stacey Tomley and Sara Edson. This is an important issue, and I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (10:25):  I rise to speak on the report, Workplace bullying: we just want it to stop. The coalition members—that is, the member for McPherson, the member for Aston and myself—broadly support many of the recommendations within the report. We reject the notion, however, that bullying in the workplace is normal and that we can afford to ignore the issue. We support from the outset the need for the common definition that was outlined in one of the earliest recommendations in the report.


We have chosen to put in a dissenting report, because there were a small number of recommendations that we felt we were unable to endorse. I would like to particularly thank the government members for their cooperation in working their way through what has been a very challenging inquiry indeed. We had 319 submissions, and many of those came from people who have identified themselves as victims of workplace bullying. Of course, we had no way of ascertaining the veracity of those claims, but certainly the human tragedy of people dealing with multiple issues in their life that they believe originated in the workplace is not to be understated. I particularly thank them upfront for revealing that part of themselves to the committee, because I think it gave a very human perspective to what it was we were trying to talk about.


Interestingly, during the inquiry bullying was often compared to having a guard missing from a machine. But it is much more complex than that, because if a guard is missing from a machine it is quite obvious that the guard is missing. It is a much harder thing to actually identify bullying in the workplace when it may occur behind closed doors or between two individuals who have different thresholds to things that may be said. So it is a very difficult issue for us all to deal with.


The coalition members, as I said, supported most of the recommendations, but we were concerned that we not endorse another raft of compliance and regulation on employers who are already struggling in this area and may already be exemplary employers. If we then place regulatory requirements upon them when they are in fact already ticking all the boxes, that would be a concern. Those are some of the reasons we have pulled back in a couple of areas.


As I said, there were 319 submissions. It occurred to us that it was unlikely we would see businesses and individuals coming forward if they were working in a good, positive environment. So we could not ascertain the level at which workplace bullying is operating in Australian workplaces, but certainly there was enough evidence to say that there is an issue out there. In particular, we were opposed to recommendation 5, calling for the establishment of regulations to force employers to meet a code of practice that is still under negotiation. We believe that code should first be established and have a chance to work before we overstep the mark in this area. We are also opposed to recommendation 23, which is calling for the right of recourse. We are unconvinced that this would be a positive move because, as the name of the report says, we just want it to stop. It seems to me that, when we come to the point of recourse, the relationship with an employer has completely broken down and it is not about just getting it to stop; it is about trying to get some retrospective justice.


In that sense, we felt that broadening the right of recourse is likely to lead to more antagonism in the workplace. The thing that we do not want to see is a division within workplaces, to see that being a source of confrontation. We need to sell the positive message about what a better place it is to employ people—why it is better for the workers and for the employers to have a workplace which is cooperative and considerate of people's feelings.


I too would particularly like to thank the secretariat for the very hard work that they put in through this inquiry. I would like to thank all those who contributed and I would like to thank the government members for their cooperation.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (10:42):  In recommending the bill to the House, I have just come back from a tour of the Murray-Darling area. To see what this place has done to the Murray-Darling would make any patriotic Australian blush with embarrassment and shame. It should make every member of this place feel utterly ashamed of themselves. At Mildura, we were told that 85 shops in the town have closed. I drove around the vineyards and the orchards and I felt one in 10 were closed down and was informed that the figure was much closer to one in five. In Griffith, they said 120 shops were closed. I do not know if this is true or not, but these are the things that were being told to me. There most certainly seemed to be many shops closed. In Deniliquin, we were told that there were normally 60 or 70 houses for sale; there are now 155 houses registered for sale.


This place has destroyed the economic base of all inland New South Wales. This place has destroyed the economic base of Northern Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. This place has not destroyed Queensland, because Queensland's Murray-Darling allocation is mostly Cubbie Station. No, this place has kept all the water intact at Cubbie Station and handed it all over to a foreign corporation, when there were other bidders in Australia. What the government should have done was to break up Cubbie Station into 10 or 12 civilised sizes where there would be owner-operators instead of fly-ins from the coast. Most of Cubbie Station is done by fly-in work out of Brisbane, in the main. But instead of doing that they sold it as one big heap, and they sold it to a foreign corporation.


The allegations in this case are very interesting because they are similar to the allegations in the case concerning—and it is not sub judice at the present, so I can speak up—the South Johnstone sugar mill, which was sold. Two mills smaller than it had been sold for over $130 million. We are talking about a mill worth $150 million. It was sold for $2 million because the people that are liquidators are people who are corruptible to a point of being illegal and should be committed to jail. This is happening again, again and again.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh
):  The honourable member for Kennedy is reminded that particular allegations against individuals are best pursued through a substantive motion.




Mr KATTER:
  I have not made any allegations against any individuals. I have made general remarks concerning liquidators.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am simply reminding the honourable member of the standing orders.




Mr KATTER:
  I take the Deputy Speaker's comments. In this case it has been sold to foreigners. In the last five weeks the biggest farm in Australia, Cubbie Station, has been sold to foreigners—the biggest water licence. It has not been bought by the government for environmental flows. It has been sold to foreigners—the biggest water licence. This place sold the biggest fishing licence in Australia. Only through the actions of my colleague from Hobart here beside me, seconding this resolution—on other issues completely, environmental issues—was the decision reversed. But the government had already made the decision to sell.


I came back from Tasmania, where another 20 per cent of their second biggest industry—and it is one of their only two industries—the timber industry, has been chopped away, leaving the economy of Tasmania almost a basket case because of the actions of this government. So they have wrecked an area—not this government, mainly the last government, actually; but this government most certainly have been up to their eyeballs in it—leaving an area stretching throughout all of New South Wales. Two-thirds of New South Wales: gone. Two-thirds of Victoria: gone. One quarter of South Australia: gone, destroyed by government action. And now of the 20 per cent of what is left of poor little Tasmania, half of it has been given to some subcommittee of UNESCO over in New York. All human activity on half of Tasmania is controlled by a UNESCO subcommittee. I know, because north Queensland suffers the same fate, so I speak with authority.


But let me go over it. The biggest farm: sold. The biggest water licence: sold. The biggest fishing licence: sold. The biggest dairying area in Australia: sold. The 10th biggest cattle station in area in Australia: sold. The daddy of them all, the big, grand, colossal Santa Claus of all destructive decisions is the Ord. Here is one of the great achievements of the Australian people—to bring irrigation and development into the north-west, the most outback and most unpopulated part of Australia. It is a great dream of all Australians. The second stage could have been put up as 1,000-hectare farms.


The government of Western Australia or the government of Australia could have put up ethanol to give us something that we could grow there—they could have done that. They continually refused. This government is the only governments in the world that does not have biofuels by law in petrol tanks. People die when you have not got oxygenated petrol in their petrol tanks. That is why they put biofuels and ethanol in their petrol tanks. We are the only country on earth not to do that.


The Chinese will not buy ethanol off Australia. Now that they are producing ethanol in Australia, they will buy it from their own operation in Australia. But they were given a huge area—some 20,000 hectares, an area bigger than Cubbie Station. It carries a $600 million subsidy with it. The government will not subsidise Australian farmers; they will not give us a cent. The Liberal Party will not and the Labor Party will not. They will not give Australian farmers a single cent. And yet they will deliver to a foreign corporation a $600 million subsidy. The Ord dam was built by the taxpayers of Australia. The delivery channels, which cost as much as the dam, were built with Australian taxpayers' money. And yet the government has taken it upon itself to sell them.



If they had given us ethanol and they had given us 15 or 20 1,000 hectare farms you would have been killed in the rush. But the ALP believes in corporate farming, the biggest disaster in agriculture in Australian history. The Liberal Party believes in corporate farming even more. That means that it has to be a corporation; we could not possibly have an owner operator! The only farms in Australia that operate at a profit are the owner-operator farms. Every corporate farm in this country, to my knowledge, have gone broke, not once but again and again. Collie farm has gone broke six times. The two big mango farms have gone broke four times. Then there is the disaster in grapes and wine. I do not have to tell anyone in this place about Great Southern. All the cattle stations— (Time expired)

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-11-26,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (10:42):  In recommending the bill to the House, I have just come back from a tour of the Murray-Darling area. To see what this place has done to the Murray-Darling would make any patriotic Australian blush with embarrassment and shame. It should make every member of this place feel utterly ashamed of themselves. At Mildura, we were told that 85 shops in the town have closed. I drove around the vineyards and the orchards and I felt one in 10 were closed down and was informed that the figure was much closer to one in five. In Griffith, they said 120 shops were closed. I do not know if this is true or not, but these are the things that were being told to me. There most certainly seemed to be many shops closed. In Deniliquin, we were told that there were normally 60 or 70 houses for sale; there are now 155 houses registered for sale.


This place has destroyed the economic base of all inland New South Wales. This place has destroyed the economic base of Northern Victoria and south-eastern South Australia. This place has not destroyed Queensland, because Queensland's Murray-Darling allocation is mostly Cubbie Station. No, this place has kept all the water intact at Cubbie Station and handed it all over to a foreign corporation, when there were other bidders in Australia. What the government should have done was to break up Cubbie Station into 10 or 12 civilised sizes where there would be owner-operators instead of fly-ins from the coast. Most of Cubbie Station is done by fly-in work out of Brisbane, in the main. But instead of doing that they sold it as one big heap, and they sold it to a foreign corporation.


The allegations in this case are very interesting because they are similar to the allegations in the case concerning—and it is not sub judice at the present, so I can speak up—the South Johnstone sugar mill, which was sold. Two mills smaller than it had been sold for over $130 million. We are talking about a mill worth $150 million. It was sold for $2 million because the people that are liquidators are people who are corruptible to a point of being illegal and should be committed to jail. This is happening again, again and again.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh
):  The honourable member for Kennedy is reminded that particular allegations against individuals are best pursued through a substantive motion.




Mr KATTER:
  I have not made any allegations against any individuals. I have made general remarks concerning liquidators.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I am simply reminding the honourable member of the standing orders.




Mr KATTER:
  I take the Deputy Speaker's comments. In this case it has been sold to foreigners. In the last five weeks the biggest farm in Australia, Cubbie Station, has been sold to foreigners—the biggest water licence. It has not been bought by the government for environmental flows. It has been sold to foreigners—the biggest water licence. This place sold the biggest fishing licence in Australia. Only through the actions of my colleague from Hobart here beside me, seconding this resolution—on other issues completely, environmental issues—was the decision reversed. But the government had already made the decision to sell.


I came back from Tasmania, where another 20 per cent of their second biggest industry—and it is one of their only two industries—the timber industry, has been chopped away, leaving the economy of Tasmania almost a basket case because of the actions of this government. So they have wrecked an area—not this government, mainly the last government, actually; but this government most certainly have been up to their eyeballs in it—leaving an area stretching throughout all of New South Wales. Two-thirds of New South Wales: gone. Two-thirds of Victoria: gone. One quarter of South Australia: gone, destroyed by government action. And now of the 20 per cent of what is left of poor little Tasmania, half of it has been given to some subcommittee of UNESCO over in New York. All human activity on half of Tasmania is controlled by a UNESCO subcommittee. I know, because north Queensland suffers the same fate, so I speak with authority.


But let me go over it. The biggest farm: sold. The biggest water licence: sold. The biggest fishing licence: sold. The biggest dairying area in Australia: sold. The 10th biggest cattle station in area in Australia: sold. The daddy of them all, the big, grand, colossal Santa Claus of all destructive decisions is the Ord. Here is one of the great achievements of the Australian people—to bring irrigation and development into the north-west, the most outback and most unpopulated part of Australia. It is a great dream of all Australians. The second stage could have been put up as 1,000-hectare farms.


The government of Western Australia or the government of Australia could have put up ethanol to give us something that we could grow there—they could have done that. They continually refused. This government is the only governments in the world that does not have biofuels by law in petrol tanks. People die when you have not got oxygenated petrol in their petrol tanks. That is why they put biofuels and ethanol in their petrol tanks. We are the only country on earth not to do that.


The Chinese will not buy ethanol off Australia. Now that they are producing ethanol in Australia, they will buy it from their own operation in Australia. But they were given a huge area—some 20,000 hectares, an area bigger than Cubbie Station. It carries a $600 million subsidy with it. The government will not subsidise Australian farmers; they will not give us a cent. The Liberal Party will not and the Labor Party will not. They will not give Australian farmers a single cent. And yet they will deliver to a foreign corporation a $600 million subsidy. The Ord dam was built by the taxpayers of Australia. The delivery channels, which cost as much as the dam, were built with Australian taxpayers' money. And yet the government has taken it upon itself to sell them.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:03):  I move:


That this House:


(1) promises to remember all children with type 1 diabetes; and


(2) notes that 100 young Australians with type 1 diabetes will be in Parliament House on 29 November 2012 as part of Kids in the House.


This week the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation will be bringing in 100 young Australians living with type 1 diabetes to Parliament House to meet with federal members of parliament and to raise awareness and gain support for young people with type 1 diabetes. Dane Boyd, from Shortland electorate, will be one of those young people. Dane and his mother, Kim, walked with me on 18 November in the JDRF Walk to Cure from Warners Bay to Speers Point in Lake Macquarie.


The 100 young people living with juvenile diabetes will also be accompanied by their families, leading diabetes scientists and high-profile individuals that have been affected by type 1 diabetes to hear personal accounts of their experiences of living with type 1 diabetes and of how it affects all elements of their lives such as school, hobbies and at home. Type 1 diabetes is very common. In fact, one of my staff, Mark, has a grandchild who has type 1 diabetes and has experienced many difficulties over a long period of time. Talking to him has shown me the challenges that those young people face.


The Kids in the House event will be widely supported by all members of parliament because it transcends our political philosophies. We all know that these children need our help and support. Type 1 diabetes—or juvenile diabetes, as it is often called—is a lifelong autoimmune disease. It strikes both children and adults, but it is most common in children and it is usually diagnosed before the age of 15. It is the most common chronic disease in children. Approximately 1,825 Australians are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year. That shows just how significant it is. The incidence is increasing by 3.2 per cent per year. The disease is not fully understood, but there is cutting-edge research and each day we hope there will be a cure found for this disease. The body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, removing a person's ability to produce insulin.


People with type 1 diabetes take multiple insulin injections daily and test their blood sugar level by pricking their finger for blood four or more times a day. The insulin pump has been quite a breakthrough that has helped a number of young people. Mark's granddaughter is one of the young people who has recently had an insulin pump installed and has benefited enormously from that. The destructive disease is not caused by lifestyle or diet. That is a misconception a number of people have. It cannot be prevented and there is no cure. Ninety-five per cent of all children under the age of 18 with diabetes will have type 1 diabetes. Insulin allows a person to stay alive; it does not cure it. Australia has one of the highest rates of type 1 diabetes in the world. Over 122,000 Australians live with this difficult disease, which represents about 10 to 15 per cent of all people with diabetes. The number of people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes has increased by an enormous 37 per cent in the last decade. The majority are children and young adults.


This motion is important. This motion gives members of both sides of the House the opportunity to show their support for the children who will be visiting parliament this week. I pledge my support for all children suffering with type 1 diabetes and guarantee that I will do all within my power to support and assist them. (Time expired)

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (11:08):  I would like to thank the member for Shortland for bringing this very important motion forward. On Thursday, as she said, 100 young Australians from across the country will come to Parliament House with one request: 'Promise to remember me.' These young Australians are but a handful of more than 120,000 people, mostly young people, already diagnosed with juvenile diabetes, for which there is no known cure and we do not know the cause. Diabetes is a debilitating illness that can impair a person's quality of life. It requires a lifetime of complex intervention. It is a major cause of limb amputation, blindness and renal failure, amongst other things. People with diabetes have a much increased risk of developing heart disease and other vascular diseases. So it is a very serious illness.


Whilst we do not know the cause of juvenile diabetes we do know at least two critical points. We know that insulin is not a cure. We are very grateful to Frederick Banting for having found insulin, because without it people would simply die, but it is not a cure. There is a flame in Canada which burns brightly. It will continue to burn until the next step is taken—that is, a cure is found for diabetes—and then the light will be extinguished. The other critical point is that diabetes disproportionately affects Australians. Worryingly, Australia is ranked seventh highest in the world for the number of people with type 1 diabetes, when our total population is not even in the top 50 countries. The number of newly diagnosed cases also continues to rise each year.


If we in this place are serious about our promise to remember—I know that many members over the years have ben deeply moved by the presentations of young people who have come to put their case to this parliament—the action that we really need to take speedily is to ensure that there is a consistent, coherent approach to research for a cure for diabetes. We have some of the best researchers in the world, and they are working very hard to collaborate with other leading researchers in diabetes not just across Australia but also globally, so that the money we put into research is well used. Our chances of success are enhanced by these national and international collaborations.


We do not know when the day will come that a cure will be found but we know that it will never come unless the first steps are taken along that journey. The opportunity is with us now, today, this year. Kids in the House are asking that the government commit to $35 million in funding for a clinical research network to test potential breakthroughs—and there have been some amazing breakthroughs. I do not have time to go into those, unfortunately, at this point of time, but I would just like to say that along with research we need to ensure that our young people have access to best-practice medicine. One of the programs that we tried to get implemented—it is still not working as efficiently as it might—is an insulin pump and continuous glucose sensors.


I had a very sad letter from a constituent who is now deceased. She wrote this letter to me and never got to post it because, as a result of a hypoglycaemic episode and her inability to afford continuous glucose sensors after her endocrinologist suggested it would be life-saving for her, she passed away. She became unconscious in her bed, having worked a night shift. This young woman was not wearing a continuous glucose sensor. She was unable to be revived and passed away. It is a sad fact that there are many Australians for whom that is the reality, including very young children. So I ask members of the parliament to support a move to make sure these devices are available. (Time expired)

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (11:14):  I rise in support of the motion of the member for Shortland, and commend her for bringing it to the attention of this place. Type 1 diabetes is a life-long autoimmune disease, that usually occurs in childhood but can be diagnosed at any age, affecting over 122,000 people in Australia alone. Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system mistakenly turning on itself, destroying beta cells within the pancreas and removing the body's ability to produce insulin.


I represent an electorate in Western Sydney, an area which has the highest prevalence of diabetes in New South Wales, with seven out of the state's 10 hotspots for diabetes. In fact, between 2005 and 2010 the rate of diabetes in Western Sydney has more than doubled. There is therefore a special obligation on me to support this motion and to highlight the importance of diabetes awareness, including understanding the differences between the various forms of the disease.


In my electorate of Greenway, 6,877 people are living with type 1 diabetes. I have had the privilege of meeting with a number of these constituents and listening to their stories, and I bring them to the attention of the House today. I recently sat down with my constituents, Claudia Jane Wood and her mum Jo, to talk about the type 1 diabetes that Claudia Jane suffers and the Promise to Remember Me campaign. What a brave and positive young woman. I could not even contemplate—and I am sure that many of us here could not either—having such a disease and living with it so positively. I was so impressed by her outlook on life, on living it to the full, as well as the support of her family. She self-medicates, but that has not stopped her from going on beach holidays and remaining an active sportswoman.


As a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation advocate, Ms Wood is working to find a cure for type 1 diabetes and its complications through the support of research. I look forward to joining Ms Wood and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation this Thursday for the Kids in the House event in the Great Hall, and I encourage all members to visit.


I also acknowledge my constituents Kenneth Shepherd and Sarah Pyke for their work as members of the Australian Diabetes Council. Both Mr Shepherd and Miss Pyke have highlighted to me the challenges faced by people with diabetes, including the need for access to essential services. Miss Pyke is insulin dependant and required four injections every day. Both Mr Shepherd and Miss Pyke have conveyed to me that access to health professionals and good management of diabetes can prevent complications and help people with diabetes to live long and healthy lives. And there are scores of other constituents who have contacted me in recent weeks who have brought their own stories of type 1 diabetes to my attention. Although time does not permit me to name you all individually today, I acknowledge each of you and your commitment and advocacy.


Since 2010 I have fought to improve health services in my electorate, and I am very proud of the investment that we have been able to make, including more hospital beds and investments in elective surgery at Blacktown Hospital, $17.6 million for the Blacktown Clinical School, $15 million for the Blacktown GP superclinic, more GP registrations, massive investment in primary care infrastructure and the Healthy Communities Initiative. But these are, of course, in response to huge regional challenges that we face in Western Sydney. So we need to respond now, and we need to keep it up.


I also note that the Commonwealth government funds the Australian Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Research Network, the CRN, which helps to facilitate faster progress towards curing, treating and preventing type 1 diabetes. Through clinical trials, successful type 1 diabetes research can be turned into new, accessible therapies and treatments for people suffering from type 1 diabetes.


In closing, I again thank my constituents for bringing this important issue to my attention, and I acknowledge the member for Shortland for bringing this important motion to the House. As the tagline goes, I 'promise to remember' all people suffering from type 1 diabetes and to continue fighting for better health services for people in my electorate, including research into type 1 diabetes, to stamp out this cruel disease once and for all.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (11:18):  I too would like to thank the member for Shortland for bringing this motion to the House. One of the privileges of our role as parliamentarians is the opportunity to meet with and listen to the stories of a wide variety of people in our electorates. It was in this way that I first came to hear the personal story of somebody in my electorate with type 1 diabetes. I will never forget that meeting or hearing the story of young Josie Hingst, a grade 6 student at St Joseph's Tobruk Memorial School in Beenleigh. This bright-eyed, smiley, confident young lady is the last person you would suspect of being unwell. Josie invited me to her school to listen to her presentation in front of her classmates about living with type 1 diabetes, a condition she has had since she was five years old. This young lady could most certainly have a future in politics, as she gave a flawless, entertaining and, at times, humorous presentation on the misconceptions and realities surrounding living life with type 1 diabetes. For starters, Josie shared with her classmates the fact that diet has absolutely nothing to do with getting type 1 diabetes and she said it made her very angry for people to assume she has the disease because of some form of self-neglect. There are a lot of people who do not understand the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease—it just happens. The pancreas stops making insulin, which we need because without it the cells in our body cannot break down the sugar from our food into energy. This means the body cannot do what it needs to do to stay alive.


Josie is a passionate ambassador for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's 'Promise to Remember Me' campaign and is one of two young ambassadors whom I have had the pleasure of getting to know in the electorate of Forde. The other is Caitlin Watt, a young lady who also suffers type 1 diabetes. She is a grade 11 student at Trinity College in Beenleigh. She was diagnosed when she was 22 months old and has been living with the condition ever since. At seven years of age, Caitlin said she had to worry about where to do her finger pricks at school and what was going to happen if she had a 'hypo attack' in class. Most seven-year-olds only have to worry about making friends and their plans for the weekends. It is just so different for young people who suffer from this disease.


To give you an idea of what it is like for these two young ladies, Caitlin has had over 22½ thousand insulin injections and has pricked her fingers to check for blood sugar levels over one million times. Josie used to have at least 1,500 needles a year before moving to a 24/7 insulin pump. It is not easy to monitor insulin and blood glucose levels, either. They have to measure the exact amount of carbohydrates they consume to ensure the right dosage of insulin to avoid having a hypoglycaemic attack.


For these bright young ladies, all they want is a lifestyle that is free from the daily regime of needles, cleaning out cannulas and getting run down, a freedom that the rest of us take for granted. Not even on their birthdays or for Christmas do they get to take a day off from the hourly checks and insulin balancing acts. It also puts an awful lot of pressure on the parents and families, as they learn how to look after their children all over again. It is never easy to have a sick child, and I would like to thank the parents with children in the same position as Josie and Caitlin for helping their children with this burden to ensure they are able to live as normal lives as possible.


As other speakers have mentioned, this week children living with type 1 diabetes will attend Parliament House as part of the annual Kids in the House awareness program for type 1 diabetes. Josie, along with 100 other children from around Australia, will be taking part. I hope they all have a wonderful experience at Parliament House later in the week and that we as parliamentarians get out and support these children and the juvenile diabetes campaign.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (11:23):  I would like to thank the member for Shortland for bringing this motion to the House and acknowledge the contributions by the members for Pearce, Greenway and Forde. It is nice to be having a bipartisan debate about a very important issue. We have heard all the members talk about their electorates and the people they have met. The member for Forde said it is a member of parliament's duty to get a window into the lives of other people. We do that around our electorate. We often come across situations that really strike at and call on your empathy. That is certainly true of juvenile diabetes.


There is no doubt that this is a very grave and serious illness. You would not wish it on anybody. The idea that a child could die in their sleep without warning is terrifying, particularly for parents. That is the terrifying reality for some people. It is something that we should be cognisant of when we are discussing this issue. It is a terrible disease. It is just lucky that the 123,000 Australians who suffer from it have such great advocates. Those advocates are often at the national level. They work in electorates around the country. The people who have come to see me most often are people like Karen Aswell and Jasmin Smith, who just graduated the other day from Trinity College and has her licence. She is looking to see what she will do in the world. That is a wonderful time in a young person's life. She is a tremendous advocate. I think that she is coming up for the Kids in the House event.


The other people who have been to see me are Marsanne Kerr and her daughter Imogen Kerr, who is a very active advocate; a very active emailer. Her mother, Marsanne, is famous in my electorate. The Barossa Herald, which is a very good paper, reported that she had taken to the skies and been part of a group of about 50 people from South Australia who skydived to raise money for and awareness of this issue. The jumpers were called 'Imogen's Heroes'. It was a big crowd—50 people, like I said—jumping from a height of 14,000 feet. Marsanne managed to do two somersaults in mid-air before sailing down to the ground with her instructor. That event raised $30,000. That is part of a massive fundraising effort.


It is a worldwide effort. This is not something that is suffered by just Australian families or Australian children. If you Google JDRF and particularly Kids in the House, some of the first links that come up are about an event that is being held with the Canadian parliament. This is a worldwide advocacy effort to help children and adults who have this rather terrible affliction. The money raised will fund clinical trials and fund things like insulin pumps and other things that help manage this illness and allow people—hopefully—to lead normal lives even with the disease. We hope in the longer term to find a cure.


Obviously, everybody in this House will be furiously lobbied towards the end of the week. We can only hope that there is a bipartisan consensus to keep up the fight against juvenile diabetes, to keep the research going, to keep the clinical trials going and to keep our focus on the 123,000 Australians who suffer from this disease.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (11:28):  I rise today to add my voice to this campaign to raise public awareness of children suffering from diabetes. Type 1 juvenile diabetes is a serious condition that impacts nearly 125,000 Australians, and many more around the world. One of my own part-time staff members has diabetes and I have seen firsthand the impact that this has on his life.


Juvenile diabetes occurs more frequently than cancer, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy and yet it is a condition that is little understood by the community and has significant stigma attached to it. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition caused when the immune system destroys beta cells within the pancreas and inhibits the body's ability to produce insulin. Type 1 diabetes is a condition that can be managed, albeit with difficulty. This is a fickle condition that requires close monitoring to ensure that the sufferer maintains the fine balance between hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia. As we slowly gain more understanding of types 1 and 2 diabetes and their causes, it is important that our approach to managing these conditions changes to reflect our growing knowledge.


The challenge that we face at this point is that our learning through research is not informing our management of the condition. It is becoming increasingly clear that lifestyle factors make a significant contribution to the development and management of juvenile diabetes. With this knowledge, it is vital that we take steps towards creating better understanding in the general community about diet and the wide-reaching impact on the health of all Australians, including those with juvenile diabetes. There is no doubt that we need better education and the availability of more information to parents of children with juvenile diabetes. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is working hard to understand type 1 diabetes and to find a cure, but there is much more that we, as policy makers and legislators, can do to support the community. As I have said before in the parliament, cultural change is best achieved through education and understanding. It is important that there is a discussion in the public sphere about the nature of juvenile diabetes.


Every win that we have had in the war against juvenile diabetes has been achieved through the activities of volunteers. Over the last four decades we have seen breakthroughs in islet transplantation, beta cell regeneration, preventative vaccine development and reduction of complications. But despite these advancements we have seen little change in the way that this disease is managed in the community.


I would like to share with the House two quotes, the first from Mary Tyler Moore, the actress. She said diabetes changes everything about a person's life:


And to add to the day-in, day-out hassles of living with diabetes—the balancing of diet, exercise, and insulin, the shots, the terrible episodes of low blood sugar, the weird feelings of high blood sugar—is the knowledge that even if you do all you can to be as normal as possible, you're not, you're different, and you face the uncertainty of an adulthood visited upon by early blindness, kidney failure, amputation, heart attack or stroke.


Michael Wooldridge adds international context to the debate as well:


Juvenile diabetes is an insidious and elusive disease that affects some 100,000 young Australians who have to inject insulin several times a day and balance this exercise and … avoid life threatening hypoglycaemia.


Our community approach needs to catch up with the research available, and one way to do this is through advocacy. I am impressed with the commitment that young people with diabetes have in increasing public awareness of this condition. I have met with many youth ambassadors and seen their efforts in sharing the challenges that they face with juvenile diabetes. This week 100 young people from across the country are visiting parliament to meet with parliamentarians and to share their stories and personal challenges surrounding this disease. I am anticipating an engagement with the young ambassadors that will enlighten even my own understanding of the issue and the challenges in a far better way than I currently have. It is through the telling of stories and the sharing of those experiences that we gain an understanding of the breadth of impact that it has on an individual's life, the challenges they face, and the way in which they rise to those challenges and become engaged within the community in which they live. I am happy to support the motion put forward by the member for Shortland.

Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (11:33):  I am very pleased to be able to contribute to this debate and commend the member for Shortland for bringing the matter to the House and also commend each of the other participants in the debate so far. I am extremely pleased that the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is in the parliament this week, together with so many young people facing juvenile diabetes and their families. This includes, from my own electorate, my constituents Jo and Livinia Martin.


Jo and Livinia came to see me earlier this year to tell me their story. Livinia has experienced juvenile diabetes for some time now and continues to be a very strong ambassador, both for the research effort which JDRF pursues and also for increased awareness within her school community and the broader community. I certainly commend Livinia, her mother Jo and their family on the work that they have already done to explain what juvenile diabetes means for Livinia and the thousands of other young people facing the disease.


I must say I was struck by the maturity of Livinia who, at a relatively young age, has had to contend with the daily practicalities and realities of her illness. She has certainly managed admirably the responsibilities that go with that. I was also struck by the extent to which she was aware of the risks that might present themselves to her and other juvenile diabetes sufferers later in life. It is an extraordinary thing to contend with at such a young age.


As many members in this debate have remarked, type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but most commonly it is diagnosed from early childhood to the late-30s. Extraordinarily, it presently affects over 122,000 people in Australia alone. As members will no doubt know, with type 1 diabetes a person's pancreas produces little or no insulin. Although its causes are not entirely known, it is believed to be caused by the immune system mistakenly turning on itself and causing the destruction of beta cells within the pancreas and removing the body's ability to produce insulin.


People with type 1 diabetes, as many of us will also know, must inject insulin several times every day or have a constant supply of insulin through an insulin pump just to stay alive. For young people in particular, the reality of having to deal with that each day and families having to administer the arduous regimen of insulin is an extraordinary task which many young people have to face but really should not have to face. Most newly diagnosed cases are children aged under 15 years. Around 1,825 Australians are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year, which is a considerable number. The incidence, however, is increasing at a rate of around three per cent per year. In Australia, around 95 per cent of the diabetes found in children is type 1 diabetes.


Members who have spoken in this have remarked on the symptoms that present themselves, of which it is recommended the community be aware in the assessment of potential risk of type 1 diabetes. Those symptoms include extreme thirst, constant hunger, sudden weight loss, blurred vision and extreme tiredness, amongst other things. Treating juvenile diabetes requires ongoing vigilance and monitoring and it is a significant task for many young people and their families. But timely and routine treatment is essential because the risk of complications arising from the disease is also significant. Members have remarked—and no doubt those who are present in the House this week from JDRF and are supporting its efforts—will be happy to explain to members in this place that the risks associated with diabetes, and the complications arising from it, include such things as eye disease, nerve damage, kidney disease, heart disease and stroke.


Once again, I am very pleased that the JDRF are in the House this week. I look forward to joining them and Jo and Livinia from my electorate at the Kids in the House event on Thursday to support JDRF. It is clearly a very significant organisation in its research effort and in raising awareness of type 1 diabetes. It has taken a significant role also in leading the agenda in terms of scientific research and I am sure that we will all continue to support its efforts. (Time expired)

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (11:39):  I thank the member for Shortland for her motion recognising the devastating impact that juvenile diabetes has on our society. I welcome the 100 young Australians suffering from this chronic disease who will be visiting this place later in the week as part of the Kids in the House program. This motion draws on the great work performed by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which runs the Promise to Remember Me campaign to start a conversation with members of parliament about type 1 diabetes and the importance of supporting those suffering from type 1 diabetes and to aid research. JDRF is the leading not-for-profit funder of type 1 diabetes research. Worldwide they have invested over $1.6 billion in research since 1970, including more than $100 million in Australian research. JDRF estimates there are 122,300 Australians suffering from type 1 diabetes.


This motion follows our recent recognition of World Diabetes Day on 14 November, which is an official United Nations world day. This day is recognised worldwide every year and brings together millions of people in over 160 countries to raise awareness of the challenges of diabetes. The theme of this year's World Diabetes Day campaign was: 'Diabetes education and prevention'. In my electorate of Bennelong we are fortunate to have several large pharmaceutical and medical device companies that create jobs, invest in research and development, and work towards a brighter future for those suffering chronic disease like diabetes.


As I did last year, I attended the World Diabetes Day event at Eli Lilly headquarters in West Ryde. This event invited all staff to join in a celebration of their great work and to hear from a Diabetes Australia representative about how the personalised solutions they provide can make a difference in the daily lives of those affected by this disease, particularly those suffering from juvenile diabetes. This includes working with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to offer the best range of support and advice for diabetes patients. This World Diabetes Day event was also a call for action on our fastest-growing chronic disease. There are 1.15 million Australians who have been officially diagnosed with diabetes. Perhaps even more alarming is that the New South Wales diabetes population is approximately 410,000, which is larger than the population of our nation's capital. I told those assembled at this event that, as diabetes becomes a national health priority, we need to take action and make changes in our lives to protect our health and the health of our children.


With type 2 diabetes representing the most common form of preventable illness, it is vital that we as community leaders promote the benefits of healthy living and a range of support services available to people suffering from diabetes. As chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Medicines, I have been a strong advocate in this place for sufferers of a wide range of diseases, both generic and preventable. The growth of type 2 diabetes warns us of a frightening future when the cause of deaths in our society is linked to the underlying illness. Type II diabetes has become the biggest killer in Australia. There is no greater challenge in health than to effect a combination of prevention and treatment of this disease. We should acknowledge the genuine concern for outcomes by the pharmaceutical industry at large on the issue of prevention, which they raise with me time and again as an area of great concern. Essentially, in the time that we will see the middle class of Asia grow from 500 million to 3.5 billion, this middle-class disease will become the greatest health challenge for our region. It is our duty as policymakers to meet this challenge.


I again thank the member for Shortland for raising this motion and making sure that we in this place promise to remember those suffering from juvenile diabetes. I also applaud the work of companies like Eli Lilly Australia and their managing director, Chris Miskel, who so eloquently and passionately advocate treatments and actions to treat both types of this disease.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh—Second Deputy Speaker) (11:43):  I rise to speak in favour of this motion by the member for Shortland and its recognition of all children with type 1 diabetes. It is always sad to see young people afflicted with such a disease—children who are trying to lead a carefree life with their friends, exploring the world and testing their limits. It is sad for people so young to be confronted with such an issue with their health and having to face their survival every day. It is a fundamental issue. We know that people with diabetes, whether it is type 1 or type 2, are up to four times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. Over two-thirds of Australians who died of cardiovascular disease had diabetes or pre-diabetes five years prior to their heart attack or stroke.


It does not have to be that way. I love speaking to young people. This week we have many young people joining us to talk about diabetes, including type 1 diabetes. I love giving them a personal story about diabetes. My father, who is 85 years old, has been a type 1 diabetic for well over 45 years. He has led a healthy lifestyle, he is active and is far more fit than I am, I would say. He rides his bike, walks every day and has two to three injections every day, and has been doing so for over 45 years.


That is the other side of it: if you do look after yourself and manage your diabetes carefully, you can have a normal life like anyone else. My father is living proof of that. As I said, he is much fitter than I am; he still rides his bike eight to 10 kilometres three to four times a week at 85 years of age. I certainly hope that young Australians who learn to manage their diabetes at a relatively young age have its management as a central element of their routine throughout their lives and that, with that superior management, they will defy the statistics that I read out earlier and join those of us who are more likely to live a longer, more complete and healthier life.


Australian researchers are leading the world in their work towards finding a cure for type 1 diabetes, through several highly regarded organisations. I, for one, have had most to do with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which conducts a fundraising walk in my electorate every year. I am very honoured to be invited every year to do the opening and sound the siren for everyone to take off in their walk from Glenelg to Somerton Park. It is always a terrific occasion, with many enthusiastic participants and supporters, generating a great crowd every year. Fundraising is necessary for the ongoing research toward a cure. Some discoveries have happened by accident, without apparent effort, but in this case a tremendous amount of work is required for relatively modest gains.


I would like to pay my respects to the consummate professionals in the medical research field, who all of us here in this place see and speak with on a regular basis, here in Australia and around the world—those who conduct the studies and those in the organisational wing which make the research possible so we can find a cure in the future. I must say how much I respect each and every young Australian with type 1 diabetes, for taking on board the knowledge of the disease, informing us as their members of parliament, maintaining the management regime that is required, and putting up with the limitations and complications that result from being just that little bit different to others—and just that little bit more special as well.


One such young Australian, who sets a very good example of maturity and grace for us all, is Casey Stubing, whose company I will have the pleasure of sharing at the JDRF Kids in the House luncheon in the Great Hall, Parliament House, on Thursday. I have met with her and her parents in my electorate office as well as on the walk we conducted in my electorate. I presented her with an award at her primary school's year 7 graduation ceremony. We met again a couple of months ago when she visited to discuss the walk, and it will be an absolute pleasure this week to speak with her again and spend time with both her and her family here in Parliament House.


Meeting and speaking with people like Casey reminds us all of the reality of type 1 diabetes, its presence, prevalence and impact, and our need to continue to work towards solutions to improve to the management that Casey and so many others maintain each and every day. Thank you, Casey, and all those who have come to Canberra this week to remind us of and keep us focussed on type 1 diabetes and the funds required to do the necessary research toward better management techniques, prevention and a cure.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (11:48):  I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Shortland. I should note that, while 100 young Australians will be visiting parliament this Thursday, they certainly will not be alone. Many staff in Parliament House and in our electorate offices around the nation live with diabetes. Even in my office, one of my staff members has lived with diabetes since he was 13 years of age.


Type 1 diabetes, often referred to as juvenile diabetes, is among the most common chronic diseases among our young people, with more than 1,800 young Australians being diagnosed with the disease each year. However, it should be remembered that children with type 1 diabetes become adults with type 1 diabetes, for this is an autoimmune disease that is with you for life. So perhaps in this motion, although we should remember all the children, we should also remember all other Australians with type 1 diabetes.


The National Diabetes Services Scheme is a government program designed to assist those with diabetes to afford the exorbitant costs associated with the ongoing medical treatments. The NDSS celebrated its 25th anniversary this year. It is a highly successful program that has evolved and expanded over its 25 years of operation. I am pleased to say it has done so with bipartisan support.


Many suffering with diabetes, especially older Australians, fondly remember the Howard government's initiative to completely subsidise insulin syringes back in the 1990s. But this is not to say that some of those costs associated with the treatment of diabetes are not still prohibitive. This is made particularly the case when new developments and technological breakthroughs are made. The costs of running an insulin pump and the associated lines of cannulas are not cheap. Even under NDSS subsidisation it is still expensive and can be a financial impost that is simply too high for some families to sustain, let alone when you look to include unsubsidised continuous monitoring technology. So we in parliament must keep an ever present eye on the developments in the treatment of diabetes to ensure that the successful scheme maintains its effectiveness. However, we should also remember that the NDSS subsidises treatment. While some in the field have described the insulin pump as a vital cure, it is not a cure. It should not be forgotten that continued research, whether it be in islet cells or in other fields, must retain our strong bipartisan support.


Finally, I am pleased to speak in this debate because it provides a further opportunity to raise a particular timely issue faced by those people who are living with diabetes. In March this year Austroads and the National Transport Commission, released the updated assessing fitness to drive regulations, which incorporated blood sugar benchmarks for the very first time. Needless to say, much concern has arisen from the inclusion of the benchmark of what would be a HbA1c result of nine, which is both arbitrary and without clinical evidence. Even more frightening is the concern that these benchmarks will be strictly enforced without due consideration to extenuating circumstances such as a particularly high stress level in the three-month period or an unrelated illness such as the flu pushing up blood glucose levels. The concern is inflamed as there are many GPs who are simply unaware that the benchmarks contained in the assessing fitness to drive regulations should be treated with discretion. This rule has put one million Australians at risk of losing their licence, even without having a strong backing of clinical evidence. 


This recent case is not alone. There has been a wave of arbitrary regulations developed to target Australians living with diabetes. Work is being done on the second initiative designed to encourage diabetics not to drive with blood sugar levels under five millimoles per litre. While this benchmark, which usually packages 'above five to drive', is well-meaning, it is again arbitrary. Hypoglycaemia is a significantly more dangerous driving risk than is hyperglycaemia, especially due to the immediacy of the symptoms. However, few diabetics will suffer the effects of hypoglycaemia until they record results in the three.


I support this motion. However, in the area of diabetes we must be sure further research is done in this area before bureaucrats race in to regulate.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-11-26,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (11:53):  Diabetes myelitis type 1, also known as juvenile diabetes, is a form of diabetes which results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin producing beta cells of the pancreas. This type of diabetes accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of cases of diabetes worldwide. That means there are about 20 million people living with type 1 diabetes in the world. In Australia, more than 123,000 people are affected by type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in children, occurring more frequently than cancer, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. In Australia 1,825 Australians are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes every year. The incidence of this disease is increasing at a rate of 3.2 per cent in Australia. That is an alarming statistic. Furthermore, of the children diagnosed with diabetes, 95 per cent are diagnosed with type 1. Complications from type 1 diabetes include kidney problems, visual impairment and nerve damage due to damage to the small blood vessels. Larger vessels can also be damaged, which can lead to coronary artery disease, stroke and narrowing of limb arteries.


Currently there is no cure or preventive measure for type 1 diabetes; those who live with the condition are dependent on insulin injections for the rest of their lives. Currently underway is the type 1 diabetes prevention trial, a major Australian clinical trial to determine whether an insulin nasal vaccine can help prevent type 1 diabetes. Since the trial began in 2006 more than 7,500 people have been screened in Australia and New Zealand to assess their eligibility, with 76 participants being enrolled to participate in the trial. If successful, this vaccine could prevent type 1 diabetes and the need for daily insulin injections for people at risk.


In my electorate of the Riverina, a seven-year-old boy by the name of Bruno Romeo and his mother Lisa and his family have been forced to leave the city of Griffith to seek medical treatment for Bruno's diabetes. Mrs Romeo has worked hard to try to assist in attracting a qualified diabetes educator to Griffith but, unfortunately, she has been unable to do so. So Mrs Romeo has made the big call of moving to Canberra for the sake of Bruno's health, where he will have an insulin pump fitted in January.


The Area News wrote a very moving story about this little boy. He is a brave child, as are all children who suffer from type 1 diabetes. And Mrs Romeo is also a very brave mum. She wants to do the best for the young fellow and for her family. She said a steady decline in her son's health had cemented the decision to move to Canberra, where he will have an insulin pump fitted in January. 'Bruno is having five or six injections a day. It is a big upheaval for our family but the doctor in Canberra said Bruno is the type of child who will thrive on a pump. He said that, if he put one on, he would have to move so he can be monitored properly. If he has a pump, we might actually be able to sleep through the night for the first time in four years.' You can imagine that poor family not being able to sleep through the night whilst Bruno is suffering from this terrible condition. 'People do not understand what is involved in having a child with diabetes,' Mrs Romeo said. 'The sooner he gets the pump the better. I know this isn't going to be easy, but this is going to be life-changing in every way.'


The Australian Diabetes Council Griffith group president, Tom Marriott, said there was no doubt that Griffith should have an educator who can supervise pumps. 'They keep saying we cannot attract anyone here, but they will not allocate the money.' Of course, any money that goes into health and into education programs for this type of thing has to be a priority of this government and of this parliament. We all know that health is the most important thing that we as parliamentarians can fund and make sure is available for all communities and especially regional communities, where the tyranny of distance is such a factor.


I met last week with 11-year-old Thomas Zambon and his mum, Melissa, to discuss how he copes with having type 1 diabetes. I am pleased to say that Thomas will be in parliament on Thursday at a function called Kids in the House, which will recognise type 1 diabetes. Young Thomas is a fighter. Despite his ailments, he will lead the very best life that he can because he is such a brave little fighter.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (11:59):  by leave—Today as Minister for Defence I deliver an apology on behalf of the government to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have suffered sexual or other forms of abuse in the course of service to the Australian Defence Force and their country. The men and women of the Australian Defence Force—past, currently serving and future—are entitled to be, and deserve to be, treated with the highest levels of admiration and respect, not just by the Australian people but also by fellow members of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian defence organisation generally. These are the men and women who volunteer to serve their country, placing their country's safety and security above their own. They have left their families and their loved ones to train and serve, often in difficult and dangerous conditions. These are the men and women who are prepared to pay the highest cost in their commitment to their country and their duty.


Since Federation, the Australian military has rightfully held a high place in the regard of the Australian people. The Australian Defence Force is an organisation which has demonstrated the highest standards of professionalism, of courage and of sacrifice in peace and in wartime. But, terribly and sadly, the experience of some members of the Australian Defence Force over the years has not always reflected these high standards. Not all members of the Australian Defence Force have been treated with the necessary respect required to meet both common decency and these high standards.


Since the so-called ADFA Skype incident in April 2011, Australians have again seen stories emerge of sexual and other forms of abuse in Defence—shameful treatment by members of the Australian Defence Force of their own colleagues. These stories range from experiences in the 1950s right through to the present day. Young men and women have suffered treatment which no member of our defence force or our community generally should experience. Young men and women have endured sexual, physical or mental abuse from their colleagues, which is not acceptable and does not reflect the values of a modern, diverse, tolerant Australian society.


We have also seen claims that people who have occupied positions of trust in the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence have abused that trust through their behaviour, including through the turning of a blind eye. Such experiences have had a lasting, serious and traumatic adverse impact on the people who have experienced them.


We also recognise that there are people in the Department of Defence who work alongside members of the Australian Defence Force in the service of Australia and in the service of our national interest. The Department of Defence is an institution which also seeks to uphold the highest values of ethics and behaviour. Sadly, men and women in the Department of Defence have also experienced abuse. In the aftermath of the ADFA Skype issue people have told me that after years of suffering from the memory of the abuse they experienced they seek recognition of their experience and an apology which acknowledges that it should never have occurred. To those men and women in the Australian Defence Force or the Department of Defence who have suffered sexual or other forms of abuse, on behalf of the government I say sorry. You should never have experienced this abuse. Again, I say sorry.


Allegations of abuse have been addressed in April through the DLA Piper review into sexual or other forms of abuse experienced. This process has seen a preliminary review of allegations from over 1,000 people. Action on these allegations will now be taken under the leadership of the Hon. Len Robert-Smith QC, a former justice of the Supreme Court and judge of the Court of Appeal of Western Australia.


Acknowledging the past and taking responsibility for it is only the first step. We must ensure that such abuse can never be tolerated again. We must place the safety and wellbeing of the young men and the young women of the Australian Defence Force above all else. The Australian Defence Force, the Department of Defence and their leadership are committed to change and to taking action to protect the young men and women in their care. This is best expressed through the Pathway to Change strategy adopted by Defence in March this year. It states:


Recent events and a suite of Reviews remind us that we need to ensure our people demonstrate exemplary behaviour commensurate with the nation's expectations, in and out of uniform, on and off duty.


…   …   …


We have learnt, to our cost, that we do not consistently meet these high standards and, more worryingly, that our culture has tolerated shortfalls in performance.


…   …   …


We will … take actions to shift attitudes and willingness to speak up when we become aware of inappropriate behaviour by a colleague in Defence.


The government and the Defence leadership are committed to ensuring the ongoing reform and systemic change in Defence necessary for Defence to ensure zero tolerance into the future of such inappropriate conduct.


This commitment is demonstrated by the presence in the House of the Chief of the Defence Force, General David Hurley, and the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Dennis Richardson. General Hurley will himself release a statement of apology today to members of the Australian Defence Force. They are joined in the chamber by Len Roberts-Smith and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Liz Broderick.


Our words today and our actions, and commitment into the future, will ensure that the apology given today in this House to those men and women in the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence, who have been subject to abuse, will never have to be repeated. I thank the House.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (12:07):  Today in the House the coalition offers its strongest and unqualified support to the government as it offers a formal apology to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have suffered abuse in the course of their service to our nation. Ours is a unique fighting force—a small but potent military that has delivered a disproportionate effect upon every battlefield on which we have fought. We have a rich military history and we can rightfully hold our heads high amongst the concert of nations when it comes to defending freedom. Our history of military endeavour is second to none. Yet despite this overwhelming battlefield success, there has been a flood of complaints, some going back to the 1950s, of abuse within the ranks. 


Our military personnel are our greatest asset. Their wellbeing will always be our No. 1 priority. Their care while serving our nation is not a price we pay; it is a duty we all undertake. By any standard, the litany of abuse allegations are completely unacceptable, let alone by the standards of the finest fighting force in the world, the ADF. This conduct does not accord with the values of our society let alone the values of our military. Our military is a disciplined force; however, the DLA Piper review has made it clear that there have been elements and individuals within the Defence Force who used their power or position and inflicted abuse on those who sought only to serve their nation. We deeply sympathise with and say sorry to those who have experienced abuse at the hands of those who were to be trusted with their leadership and their care. Theirs was a great betrayal. 


This abuse should never have happened and every effort must and will be made to ensure that it does not happen again. Our military must train hard and it must fight hard, but as they do we must not allow our men and women to suffer any type of abuse in any way. This is not who we are as a nation and certainly not who we are as a military. Abuse destroys lives, it limits our operational capability and it undermines public confidence in our Defence Force. 


We are always at our best when we pause, walk in the shoes of others and reflect on their experiences, when we acknowledge their pain and commit to right that which is wrong. This is the start of that journey. Accordingly, the government will enjoy the full support of the coalition as it establishes its Defence abuse task force and the process it undertakes. We will provide every support to senior Defence leadership and we have faith in their capacity to work with the task force to both assist it in its work and implement its recommendations. Today we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the government in our absolute commitment to care for those who care for us.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (12:11):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following reports: Report 433: Annual report 2011-12 and Report 434: Annual public hearing with the Commissioner of Taxation, 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the reports.


Leave granted.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  These reports mark the 10th time the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has met with the Commissioner of Taxation and are the first reports made on an annual basis. Firstly, I note the Australian Taxation Office's agreement to all recommendations directed towards it at last year's public hearing, as well is the joint recommendation agreed to by the Australian National Audit Office, the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Inspector-General of Taxation. The adoption of these recommendations has improved scrutiny of ATO, the reporting of ATO's service standards and the conduct of the committee's review into tax administration. However, the Australian government disagreed with the committee's recommendation to publish ATO notifications on tax administration and legislative problems within 12 months, nor will it publish the government's response to these notifications. Although recognising that this recommendation may mean that sensitive information is realised to the public, the committee remains convinced that the increased transparency and additional incentive for timely action from government would be of overall benefit.


Considering this year's review, the committee found that the administration of Australia's tax system remains robust. Although the committee covered a range of important areas, a handful of issues warrant additional comment. These areas include service standards, increasing complaints to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, calculating the tax gap, and tax reform. Looking at service standards, the committee found some clear improvements in taxation administration in the past year. In particular, the committee was pleased to hear of the positive comments towards the ATO on their service during the tax time period as this was an area that had been of concern in the past—in particular, in the previous year.


However, the committee also found some deficiencies in administration, with the Commonwealth Ombudsman reporting that ATO complaints for the 2012-13 period were at a 10-year high. Further, the Ombudsman reported occasional deficiencies in ATO complaint handling and referred these matters back to the ATO for further consideration. The committee is supportive of the ombudsman doing this but believes the ATO should be properly handling complaints in the first instance rather than having its deficiencies identified by an outside body.


Discussion also took place about calculation of what is known as the tax gap. A tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax payable if there were complete compliance versus the amount actually collected over a defined period of time. The committee believes that development of practical methodology needs to be given more consideration in Australia, as it is done in other jurisdictions, and looks forward to the response to the recommendation made which calls for this analysis to be undertaken. The hearing also briefly discussed general tax reform, identifying the need to consider broadening the tax base, reducing compliance costs and eliminating inefficient taxes. The need to examine interactions with state taxes was also identified. These issues should be examined and addressed as a priority.


This is an ongoing private and public debate that involves the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit but also the executive, the opposition, the parliament, state parliament and many tax experts. Keeping our tax base robust and certain so that we can confidently deliver the services Australians need and expect is our most important duty as parliamentarians. As stated before, this work on comprehensive tax reform should be a priority for government.


On a final note, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the departing Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael D'Ascenzo, and thank him for his cooperation throughout this process. I note that it was clear in the public hearing that the commissioner was held in high esteem by his colleagues, the scrutineers of the ATO and the taxation community of practice. Many of the improvements to tax administration in recent years have occurred under his watch, so, upon his departure, he can be proud of the robust system and organisation he leaves behind.


In closing, I thank all witnesses involved in this process. I thank the committee members once again and the secretariat for their assistance in the conduct of this public hearing and the preparation of this final report. I commend the report to the House.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the reports were made parliamentary papers.

Discussion also took place about calculation of what is known as the tax gap. A tax gap is the difference between the amount of tax payable if there were complete compliance versus the amount actually collected over a defined period of time. The committee believes that development of practical methodology needs to be given more consideration in Australia, as it is done in other jurisdictions, and looks forward to the response to the recommendation made which calls for this analysis to be undertaken. The hearing also briefly discussed general tax reform, identifying the need to consider broadening the tax base, reducing compliance costs and eliminating inefficient taxes. The need to examine interactions with state taxes was also identified. These issues should be examined and addressed as a priority.


This is an ongoing private and public debate that involves the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit but also the executive, the opposition, the parliament, state parliament and many tax experts. Keeping our tax base robust and certain so that we can confidently deliver the services Australians need and expect is our most important duty as parliamentarians. As stated before, this work on comprehensive tax reform should be a priority for government.


On a final note, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the departing Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael D'Ascenzo, and thank him for his cooperation throughout this process. I note that it was clear in the public hearing that the commissioner was held in high esteem by his colleagues, the scrutineers of the ATO and the taxation community of practice. Many of the improvements to tax administration in recent years have occurred under his watch, so, upon his departure, he can be proud of the robust system and organisation he leaves behind.


In closing, I thank all witnesses involved in this process. I thank the committee members once again and the secretariat for their assistance in the conduct of this public hearing and the preparation of this final report. I commend the report to the House.

Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (12:16):  I present the report of the Australian delegation to the assembly of the 125th Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Bern, Switzerland and the bilateral visit to Germany and Austria on 16 to 25 October 2011. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted.




Mr ADAMS:
  I thank the House. I am pleased to present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation which participated in the 125th Inter-Parliamentary Union assembly in Bern, Switzerland and also undertook bilateral visits to Germany and Austria in October 2011. As the report attests, this was another successful and hardworking parliamentary delegation at the IPU assembly. The delegation were active participants in the proceedings. This report outlines the various presentations and meetings that featured in the delegation's program.


Australian delegations at assemblies of the Inter-Parliamentary Union have established a reputation for making a significant contribution to the IPU through their hard work, often behind the scenes, to facilitate dialogues and broker agreements across a wide range of global issues. The high regard in which Australia is held within the IPU is reflected in the election of Australian representatives to key positions in drafting committees at the assembly in Bern. Senator Ursula Stephens was appointed chair of the drafting committee for the emergency resolution 'On the plight of people of famine-stricken Somalia and relief efforts by the IPU members parliaments'. I was appointed chair of the draft committee on the Standing Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade. Both resolutions were adopted unanimously by the assembly. Mr Patrick Secker MP, Senator Sue Boyce and Senator Stephens were active representatives of the delegation in the work of the standing committees.


The assembly continued its examination of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament through a series of panel discussions. Australia's leadership in this area was reflected in the appointment of the former Speaker, Mr Harry Jenkins MP, as chair of a panel session of the Committee on the United Nations Affairs on 'Nuclear weapons: the road to zero'. These discussions drew together a number of prominent experts, including Mr Gareth Evans, co-chair of the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament and former Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs. The delegation was honoured to meet the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon. The Secretary-General commended Australia on its support of preventative diplomacy efforts in the Pacific and on the important leadership role Australia continues to play in the region. He also expressed his gratitude to Australia for logistic support during his historical visit to attend the 42nd Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland.


The delegation's visit to Austria and Germany provided excellent opportunities to explore issues around sustainable energy production, nuclear non-proliferation, education and the Eurozone crisis. I found the series of meetings on Germany's dynamic approach to renewable energy policy particularly interesting. Many of the issues we discussed around market and system acceptance, land use and the debate around food versus fuel are familiar to Australian parliamentarians. It was also of benefit to be able to explore the successes and lessons learnt from alternate models for encouraging and supporting diversity and innovation across all sectors of the renewable energy industry.


It was also hugely beneficial for the delegation to be able to receive such comprehensive briefings from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Organisation and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and to discover how highly valued Australia's contribution to the work of these important organisations is. The delegation came away with a clear impression of the importance of continuing to support and strengthen the capacity of such agencies to undertake their roles.


Parliamentary delegations are an important part of building inter-parliamentary relationships. The delegation was grateful for the opportunity to meet with parliamentary counterparts in the German and Austrian parliaments and continue the already well-established parliamentary dialogue between our parliaments. The discussions we had were frank and good humoured and provided honest insights to a number of significant issues of common interest.


At the Austrian Parliament, Ms Barbara Prammer, President of the Austrian National Council, generously made time available on the eve of celebrations to mark Austria's national day. In Germany, Mr Jurgen Herrmann MdB and his colleagues on the Germany Australia New Zealand Parliamentary Friendship group were equally generous with their time. The delegation was saddened to hear of the sudden death of Mr Heim Neumann in August this year. He was a good friend to Australia, with a firm commitment to fostering inter-parliamentary relations.


I would like to commend the many people who contributed to the success of the delegation's visits. I would also like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their high level of assistance to the delegation. They provided both advance briefing material and on-the-ground support at the IPU Assembly in Bern and throughout Germany and Austria. Australia's ambassadors to Germany and Austria, Mr Peter Tesch and Mr Michael Potts, and their staff put together outstanding programs and provided practical support to the delegation. I make special mention of Mr Phillip Anderson, the delegation's Foreign Affairs adviser to the IPU Assembly in Bern, for his advice and professional support throughout the assembly.


I would also like to thank staff of the Parliamentary Library, the parliament's International and Community Relations Office and the Department of the Senate, who provided briefings, advice and assistance with the arrangements for the delegation.


In closing, may I again congratulate my fellow delegates for their hard work and good humour throughout this highly successful series of visits. I commend the report to the House.

Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (12:23):  On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform I present the committee's advisory report, incorporating dissenting reports, on the National Gambling Reform Bill 2012, the National Gambling Reform (Related Matters) Bill (No. 1) 2012 and the National Gambling Reform (Related Matters) Bill (No. 2) 2012 together with evidence received by the committee. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted. 




Mr WILKIE:
  Thank you. On 21 January this year the Prime Minister announced a package of poker machine reforms, and the bill which the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform has now inquired into reflects that announcement.


In essence, the bill requires—and the committee supports—that all poker machines in Australia be fitted with pre-commitment technology and dynamic warning displays and for virtually all ATMs in poker machine venues to have a $250 daily withdrawal limit. Regarding precommitment, the legislation specifies that all new machines must have the technology from the end of 2013 and that the remainder of the national fleet must be progressively retrofitted. Venues with more than 20 machines have until the end of 2016, venues with 11 to 20 machines have until 2020 and venues with 10 or fewer machines can change over their machines in the normal replacement cycle.


Crucially, while the use of the precommitment system is to be voluntary, machines and/or systems must be capable of preventing unregistered play. In other words, they must be capable of mandatory precommitment at the flick of a switch. To further strengthen this arrangement, the committee suggests players should be able to set their limits away from venues and poker machines, that decreases to the limit a person can lose should take effect immediately and that transaction statements be provided on request and regularly to help people keep track of their losses.


The committee also recommends that the Productivity Commission's review of the implementation of this legislation include the ban on biometrics, the issue of linking precommitment to loyalty schemes, whether or not there are grounds for further exemptions or extended deadlines for smaller venues in regional and remote areas, and the issue of including EFTPOS transactions in the $250 per day ATM withdrawal limit.


The pokies industry has expressed concern about the one-size-fits-all time lines and conditions placed on the states and territories in the bill. But this concern is unwarranted, because the bill is not prescriptive and solutions can be determined on a state-by-state basis from a broad range of technical options. In any case, there are a number of precommitment systems already running in Australia, giving the committee confidence the industry can meet the time lines.


Industry is also concerned about the cost. The poker machine industry is not being asked to replace all its machines overnight as it would have us believe; in fact, the conversion of most machines is more than four years away, as is the deadline for jurisdictions to have installed or upgraded their networks.


In any case, let us put all this in perspective and remember the Productivity Commission found that in 2008-09, national expenditure on poker machines was $11.9 billion. How much of this was lost by problem gamblers? The answer is some $5 billion. That is right: some $5 billion was lost by problem gamblers on the pokies in just one year. Yet the industry says the spending of just a fraction of one year's loss spread across a number of years is unacceptable. Frankly, I do not know how some of them sleep at night.


The bill also establishes $250 daily withdrawal limits on ATMs in gaming machine premises other than casinos. The ATM Industry Reference Group wants this amount increased plus a 12-month lead-in time. While the committee cannot support the increase limit, it does agree more time is warranted and recommends an end 2013 deadline.


While the committee welcomes the establishment of the Australian Gambling Research Centre within the Australian Institute of Family Studies, I wish to correct the impression that this fully delivers on the recommendation made in the committee's earlier reports. What is needed is a genuinely independent, fully transparent centre with the strongest possible research credentials. Only time will tell if the Australian Gambling Research Centre has what is needed and whether or not governments are genuinely committed to fund it.


The bill is much less than what might have been, and the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform's report includes a number of dissenting and additional comments. Nonetheless, the bill is a significant first step towards meaningful poker machine reform in Australia and it has the support of the committee majority. On behalf of the committee, I thank all those who assisted the inquiry. I would also like to thank the deputy chair and the committee secretariat for, again, doing a fine job in sometimes difficult circumstances. I commend the report to the House.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (12:29):  by leave—As the deputy chair of the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, it is a pleasure to speak on the tabling of the committee's fourth report that covers the National Gambling Reform Bill 2012 and related bills. The government takes seriously the need to act to make poker machines safer. We need to help protect problem gamblers, whose addiction is hurting not only themselves but their families and others. The bills intend to reduce the harm caused by poker machines. They are based on the evidence and recommendations of the Productivity Commission.


In May 2011 the Council of Australian Governments Select Council on Gambling Reform agreed to support the required infrastructure for precommitment technology in all jurisdictions in every gaming venue. The committee heard that an extensive consultation process with industry and community stakeholders occurred in early 2012 after the exposure draft was released. In addition, consultation on specific issues was undertaken by the department, the minister and her office outside the formal consultation period. Precommitment is a tool that poker machine players can use to set a budget and limits around their play, and the system can assist them to remain within those limits. The system is voluntary and its use is free for players.


The bill requires that all gaming machines in larger venues are part of a state-wide precommitment system by the end of 2016 so that those who choose to set limits can ensure they apply wherever they play. We recognise that small pubs and clubs, many in our regional areas, just are not the same as the big gaming venues in the city. The bill gives longer time frames for small venues to make the changes, and more than half of all venues nationally have more time. The bill establishes minimum requirements for the system, but states and territories will be able to impose stronger measures. The committee makes a number of suggestions in its report for enhanced functionality to assist players, based on evidence from previous inquiries.


While concerns were expressed to the committee about implementation, the committee heard that the bill is not prescriptive regarding precommitment technology. The bill sets parameters, and the technical solutions to meet those parameters can be determined by each state and territory. This recognises that states and territories have different monitoring systems in place and allows them to choose from the range of technical options available. Technology options range from network options to machine based options. Multiple systems are also possible.


Allowing jurisdictions to determine their own systems encourages innovation by industry. I also note there are already a number of precommitment systems operating in Australia which may be compliant with the legislation. The government has been working to minimise the cost to industry and minimise the regulatory burdens. Regarding the time lines for venues, there has been consultation with industry as well as independent work around that aspect which found that the initial time line and extended time line for smaller venues are achievable. Mindful of the concerns expressed around smaller venues, the committee recommended that the Productivity Commission review this aspect when conducting its review of implementation, to take an evidence-based approach to whether any additional time should be provided to very small and regional and remote venues. The committee called for an education campaign, and it is the government's intention to implement a campaign, in collaboration with the regulator, industry and other key stakeholders. Education within gaming venues will be an important component of initiatives to support the introduction of the gambling reforms.


The bill introduces complementary reforms to further support problem gamblers. There is a $250 per day ATM withdrawal limit for gaming machine premises other than casinos and exempted premises in smaller communities where access to cash is not readily available from non-gaming outlets. Taking into consideration the self-imposed moratorium throughout the Christmas-New Year period and technical issues, the committee did not oppose extending to the end of 2013 the time frame of May 2013 to achieve this measure.


The bill also establishes the Australian Gambling Research Centre within the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which will start in July 2013. It will help address the current lack of robust evidence and consistent data available to inform problem-gambling policy development. The centre will receive ongoing funding from the government of $1.5 million per annum. 


This is the first time the Commonwealth has legislated to help problem gamblers and their families. Recognising that there is no single solution to address problem gambling, the measures outlined in the bill form part of a suite of measures announced by the government on 21 January this year. I would also like to note in this context, separately from the recommendations of the report, the ACT trial of mandatory precommitment will be independently reviewed by the Productivity Commission upon completion.


In closing, I want to thank the member for Denison for very capably chairing the committee and for running this inquiry very smoothly. I thank the committee members for their contributions and I thank the witnesses who provided evidence to the committee. I also wish to express my sincere appreciation of the excellent and dedicated support given by Lin Beverley from the secretariat—often on weekends and often late at night. I commend the report to the House.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (12:35):  by leave—I rise to speak to the report from the Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform tabled this morning. I must say I am particularly surprised to hear the comments from the deputy chair. Today represents the tabling of a report which could only be described as woeful. I am not commenting on the report itself but on the process. Based on one day of hearings, we have a report being tabled on new legislation that is being introduced by the government and supported by the member Denison that will adversely affect an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people.


Before the deputy chair leaves the chamber, I would highlight the deputy chair's comments about industry consultation and the time frames involved in the rollout of voluntary precommitment that the government is implementing. Apparently industry says that it is possible to do so within the time frames outlined in the draft legislation that the report alludes to. How completely wrong. For the deputy chair to come into the chamber and say that industry believes this is achievable is highly misleading because the deputy chair knows full well the evidence that coalition members heard, the evidence the chair heard and the evidence the deputy chair heard.


The advice from industry was that there will be mass noncompliance. They were their words: mass noncompliance. Industry made it clear that this was effectively a kiss of death, not because of voluntary precommitment but because of the time frames involved. This government is running headlong into trying to achieve its result for no other purpose than it happens to suit the member for Denison.


The member for Denison is a sincere man. I believe that he sincerely holds the views that he holds. I think that he does not particularly care about the impact this is going to have on industry—that is my view. I believe it is his view that in the balance between impact on industry and impact on problem gamblers, he would rather side with the problem gamblers—and so be it.


The impact of this draft legislation will be profound. It will cost jobs. It will result in mass noncompliance. The committee's report does not address these facts. There is only one group that the department consulted with that says the time frame is achievable. From industry consultation and from stakeholder consultation, it is not possible for this time frame to be complied with. Mass noncompliance will be the consequence and job losses will be the consequence—and to hell with the impact of that, say the majority of the committee. Not so the coalition. We support voluntary precommitment. The government was out there saying it wanted mandatory precommitment because that was a part of the deal that was done before the Prime Minister turned her back on the member for Denison and double-dealed him on this—as she did the Australian public on climate change but that is another debate for another day. When the Prime Minister did that, the reason we were out there then saying we should have voluntary precommitment was that we understood there is no silver bullet. There is no panacea to problem gambling in the same way there is no panacea to alcoholism or to those that face morbid obesity; yet for some reason the majority of this committee took the view that they have got the solutions. Well, it is simply not going to result in any meaningful outcome. In fact, it is going to threaten livelihoods and threaten the industry.


In addition to that, the draft legislation does outline mandatory withdrawal limits on ATM machines within licensed venues. We have tried to be constructive as coalition members and to work with the majority with respect to the amount of money that can be withdrawn. The amount of money that was first recommended by the Productivity Commission will be indexed. 


In addition, I think there is a greater principle at stake here—that is, government policy which says to people who do not have a gambling problem, which is of course the vast majority of recreational poker machine users as well as the vast majority of the Australian population, that there is a limit on how much of their own money they can access from an ATM based on its location. The government has now deemed it okay to say how much of your own money you can withdraw from a machine based on the location. Safeguards already exist of course and problem gamblers can be excluded from using ATMs in licensed venues. They can have lower daily withdrawal limits—arrangements they can choose to enter into with their bank provider, in the same way that they might choose to have voluntary precommitment. Notwithstanding that, when it comes to ATMs the government is happy to mandate behaviour that it believes is appropriate.


My final point is about the most insidious issue. It is a point that is not really addressed in the majority report. It is absolutely the case that this is shaping up to be the precursor to a biometric system of identification across the Australian population, especially for those who want to use poker machines. There are members on the committee who I understand hold the view that in order to achieve the compliance required under this draft legislation and to achieve state based regulation around voluntary precommitment, a database will be needed at each of the state regulators that monitors players' activities. In the absence of a biometric system, such a database would be useless. It would not be possible to monitor players' activities if you do not know who the player is. Believe it or not, some problem gamblers may resort to using two, three, four or five cards, and this is why it has to be linked back to identity. The chairman and I have had this debate before and, based on views and comments on the public record, I know that that is absolutely where this is going. This is the first door. For that reason, coalition members do not support the majority report and why we have lodged a dissenting report.

The impact of this draft legislation will be profound. It will cost jobs. It will result in mass noncompliance. The committee's report does not address these facts. There is only one group that the department consulted with that says the time frame is achievable. From industry consultation and from stakeholder consultation, it is not possible for this time frame to be complied with. Mass noncompliance will be the consequence and job losses will be the consequence—and to hell with the impact of that, say the majority of the committee. Not so the coalition. We support voluntary precommitment. The government was out there saying it wanted mandatory precommitment because that was a part of the deal that was done before the Prime Minister turned her back on the member for Denison and double-dealed him on this—as she did the Australian public on climate change but that is another debate for another day. When the Prime Minister did that, the reason we were out there then saying we should have voluntary precommitment was that we understood there is no silver bullet. There is no panacea to problem gambling in the same way there is no panacea to alcoholism or to those that face morbid obesity; yet for some reason the majority of this committee took the view that they have got the solutions. Well, it is simply not going to result in any meaningful outcome. In fact, it is going to threaten livelihoods and threaten the industry.


In addition to that, the draft legislation does outline mandatory withdrawal limits on ATM machines within licensed venues. We have tried to be constructive as coalition members and to work with the majority with respect to the amount of money that can be withdrawn. The amount of money that was first recommended by the Productivity Commission will be indexed. 


In addition, I think there is a greater principle at stake here—that is, government policy which says to people who do not have a gambling problem, which is of course the vast majority of recreational poker machine users as well as the vast majority of the Australian population, that there is a limit on how much of their own money they can access from an ATM based on its location. The government has now deemed it okay to say how much of your own money you can withdraw from a machine based on the location. Safeguards already exist of course and problem gamblers can be excluded from using ATMs in licensed venues. They can have lower daily withdrawal limits—arrangements they can choose to enter into with their bank provider, in the same way that they might choose to have voluntary precommitment. Notwithstanding that, when it comes to ATMs the government is happy to mandate behaviour that it believes is appropriate.


My final point is about the most insidious issue. It is a point that is not really addressed in the majority report. It is absolutely the case that this is shaping up to be the precursor to a biometric system of identification across the Australian population, especially for those who want to use poker machines. There are members on the committee who I understand hold the view that in order to achieve the compliance required under this draft legislation and to achieve state based regulation around voluntary precommitment, a database will be needed at each of the state regulators that monitors players' activities. In the absence of a biometric system, such a database would be useless. It would not be possible to monitor players' activities if you do not know who the player is. Believe it or not, some problem gamblers may resort to using two, three, four or five cards, and this is why it has to be linked back to identity. The chairman and I have had this debate before and, based on views and comments on the public record, I know that that is absolutely where this is going. This is the first door. For that reason, coalition members do not support the majority report and why we have lodged a dissenting report.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (12:51):  I rise to speak on this bill that is now before the House and which seeks to implement the government's third tranche of legislation implementing MySuper, replacing existing default superannuation fund products. The bill contains eight schedules, all dealing with various reforms, to implement MySuper. I can state at the outset that the coalition has deep reservations in relation to schedule 6 of this bill, which deals with the transition to MySuper. We will seek to move amendments to excise this schedule from the bill. If this is not successful, we will seek to move an amendment to improve the schedule.


The coalition also takes a principled stance against the legislative changes contained in schedule 4 of this bill, regarding amendments to the Fair Work Act, so that only funds offering a MySuper product can be included in modern awards and enterprise agreements. The problem the coalition has with these changes is that not every MySuper product will be able to compete freely as a default superannuation fund under modern awards. The coalition has a fundamental objection to the closed-shop approach taken by the government. We will be moving amendments to address this issue. As I said, if we are unsuccessful in improving schedules 4 and 6, we will not support passage of the bill.


I will deal with schedule 1 first. This schedule seeks to ban conflicted remuneration payments from MySuper products. Schedule 1 contains changes which prohibit trustees from deducting any amount from MySuper products that relates to making a commission payment to a financial adviser. The changes contained within schedule 1 also implement restrictions on personal advice that superannuation trustees may charge for collectively.


In addition, schedule 1 prohibits financial advice provided to employers from being recovered through fees charged to members of the fund. The aim is to prevent commissions being charged to employees to cover the costs of an employer seeking financial advice. This schedule of the bill also contains changes to general fee rules which prohibit entry fees and limit exit switching and buy-sell fees for amounts over and above a cost recovery basis.


The parliamentary joint committee inquiry into the bill heard a range of evidence which highlighted concerns that the industry sector had in relation to schedule 1. The Association of Financial Advisers commented that intrafund advice would not serve the best interests of clients, as the advice could be provided without being based on a client's personal circumstances. The association also expressed concerns that the legislation was inconsistent when distinguishing between complex and basic advice.


The Law Council of Australia raised concerns regarding the potential conflict for trustees arising from the different grandfathering arrangements contained within this bill and the interaction these will have with the government's FoFA changes. The coalition has called on the government to withdraw this bill, to allow further consultation to remedy industry concerns, but the government has not heeded this warning and instead is choosing to pursue the change.


Schedule 2 of the bill that seeks to mandate that MySuper funds includes life and total and permanent disability insurance on an opt-out basis. The changes contained within this schedule also seek to align insurance definitions with conditions of release, to improve consistency with the purpose of the superannuation fund and to ensure payments flow through to members where an insurer pays out to the superannuation fund under the insurance policy. These changes will also prevent a situation where members are paying premiums on several types of insurance coverage but are unable to have payments released to them as they do not meet the superannuation fund's conditions of release. We view this as a sensible change. Schedule 2 also prohibits superannuation funds from self-insuring benefits of the fund, particularly life and total and permanent disability insurance. This ban will not extend to defined benefit funds. Such prohibition will seek to mitigate the risk of any shortfall in insurance benefits funded by other members' balances, which is pretty sensible, Madam Deputy Speaker. I hope you are paying attention.


Schedule 3 of this bill provides additional powers to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, in order to link further data from superannuation funds holding registrable superannuation entity licences. This will provide a large dataset over time and will ultimately provide policymakers with a more accurate picture of the superannuation sector. For example, it will provide more information on the structure of assets within the superannuation sector and more transparent information on expenses, such as fees being charged to policyholders. The changes contained within this schedule also require APRA to disclose quarterly information on MySuper fees, costs and returns.


The legislation further requires the publication on a website of a product dashboard that will show each MySuper and choice product's investment return target and—importantly—how often this has been achieved, the level of investment risk, a statement on liquidity of the product, and information regarding the average number of fees and other costs related to the product. The legislation also makes readily available a remuneration of superannuation funds' directors and executive officers as well as a breakdown of portfolio holdings. This information should already have been available to members of super funds and we remain sceptical as to whether these measures will actually achieve their aims, following the government's track record on the implementation of other websites. It always gives them a little bit of a shiver down their spines when I mention GroceryWatch and FuelWatch. In fact, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services heard a range of views from industry stakeholders who expressed concern about the workability of this schedule. We the coalition have called on the government to withdraw this schedule from the bill, to allow further consultation to be undertaken, and for the government to hear at least some of the concerns of industry. 


The changes contained within schedule 4 of this bill amend the Fair Work Act so that only funds offering MySuper products can be included in modern awards and enterprise agreements. While every default fund has to be a MySuper product, not every MySuper product will be able to compete freely as a default superannuation fund under modern awards. The decision on the selection of default funds under modern awards remains with Fair Work Australia. This process is widely discredited to the point where the current government recognised this before the last election.


This government made a commitment to instruct the Productivity Commission to design a transparent evidence based and competitive process for the selection of default funds under modern awards. But we all know the difference between what the government says before an election and what it actually does after an election. It took this government until early this year to commission the Productivity Commission to commence the review. But before they handed it down Minister Shorten had already ruled it out. Get a load of that, Madam Deputy Speaker Rishworth. You, Madam Deputy Speaker, would be as appalled as I am at the fact that a minister commissioned a review and then ruled out its findings before the review was even handed down. You of all people, Madam Deputy Speaker, would be appalled at that, and rightly so—as I am.


But it is typical Labor, isn't it? It is typical of the government. That is what they do. They make it up as they go along. Of course, the minister is quite happy protecting his union mates given that he was the head of the Australian Workers Union. He has always given the union dominated super funds a leg up over alternative market based providers. Well, the coalition will seek to move an amendment to the schedule. If our first amendment to remove schedule 6 is unsuccessful, we will not support the bill.


The changes contained within schedule 5 seek to allow defined benefit fund schemes to continue to be used by employers for the contributions of employees who do not have a chosen fund. This is an exemption to the general requirement that employers must make contributions to a fund that offers a MySuper product for an employee who does not have a chosen fund. The changes also exclude defined benefit members from being counted in working out whether an employer is a large employer. This will mean that defined benefit employees are exempt from the 500-employee rule when employers are looking to be deemed a large employer.


Schedule 6 of this bill implements provisions that impose requirements for certain existing member balances to be moved into MySuper products, and it also contains a whole new raft of transitional rules. As I stated at the outset, we have deep reservations in relation to this schedule of the bill. We will be seeking to move an amendment to excise the schedule from the bill. Again, if we are unsuccessful, the coalition will then move an amendment that seeks to improve this schedule, along with schedule 4. It aims to restore competition and choice to super.


Schedule 6 amends the SI(S) Act to introduce a new concept of an accrued default amount. The new concept defines those parts of a member's interest within an existing superannuation fund which in turn must be moved into a MySuper product. These are amounts whereby a member has not exercised an investment choice or amounts held in a default investment option of a fund. This broad definition will mean that fund members who have chosen a specific super fund as well as fund members who have their superannuation invested in the default investment option of that specific superannuation fund will have their balances transferred to a MySuper product unless they choose to opt out. So funds have until 1 July 2017 to transfer all accrued default amounts to a MySuper product unless the member opts out in writing. This will significantly expand the amount that is being transitioned into MySuper, with significant financial consequences for individual fund members, including those who have previously exercised their right to actively choose their own super fund. This will mean that, under the proposed accrued default amount definition contained within this schedule, all existing default fund workplace accounts, as well as the balances of individuals who have previously exercised choice of funds but who have remained with the default investment option of their chosen fund, will be swept up into the new default MySuper product. Given that this transfer will take place on an opt-out basis, a member who does not choose to opt out will have their superannuation account balance transferred out of its current investment option or fund into a MySuper product chosen by someone else.


The proposal to transfer such a wide range of accounts into MySuper gives rise to a number of consumer protection issues. Many members who have exercised choice will be inappropriately swept up and are likely to find that, post transition, they are now invested in an investment option which they do not want. Such members will also have incurred transaction costs from the selling and rebuying of assets as a result of the transfer, unnecessarily crystallising capital gains.


This also has potential implications for insurance within super, as the MySuper death and total and permanent disability insurance cover is likely to be less than is currently enjoyed by a member of a chosen default fund. Some people who have not been covered within their chosen fund for a long time may not be able to qualify for life insurance or may only qualify on inferior terms given the changes in their personal circumstances since the original cover was taken out.


We will move amendments to excise this schedule from the bill. If this amendment is unsuccessful, we will move another amendment to ensure that a member who has chosen a super fund does not have an accrued default amount and is not moved to a MySuper product. This amendment follows generally the recommendation of the submission by the Law Council of Australia on the exposure draft and is strongly supported by the Financial Services Council, AMP and commercial super funds. As I have stated previously, if our second amendment is also unsuccessful, we will not be supporting this bill.


The final schedule of the bill relates to eligible rollover funds. ERFs have the sole purpose of being a temporary repository for the interest of members who have lost their super accounts. ERFs keep and preserve these balances until the member has been found. Schedule 7 amends the SI(S) Act so that trustees are required to apply to APRA in order to obtain authorisation to operate an ERF. All balances in an existing ERF will be required to be transferred into an authorised ERF or a fund that offers a MySuper product within 90 days where an application for authorisation has not been made or if APRA has refused authorisation.


I look at this bill and I say, 'Bring on the red tape.' That is what it is—just more red tape, more process—and all with a political purpose from the minister of trying to support some of his mates in the industry. So we will be moving an amendment to excise schedule 6 from the bill. If we are unsuccessful, we will move additional amendments to schedules 4 and 6.


In concluding, I would like to draw the House's attention to the government's failure to have an adequate regulatory impact statement on this legislation. The regulatory impact statement on the second tranche of the MySuper legislation was carried out in September 2011, long before the final version of the legislation was available. Further, a number of matters in various tranches of the legislation were exempted from the regulatory impact statement. The Office of Best Practice Regulation noted:


The Prime Minister granted exemptions from the requirements for regulatory impact analysis in relation to the ability of funds to offer tailored MySuper products to employees with more than 500 employees, and extension to the date by which trustees will be required to have transferred the balance—


and so on.


So the Prime Minister granted an exemption from any regulatory checks on this legislation. It is typical, really, isn't it? As my colleague the shadow minister for finance says, it is just a disgrace. The burden that you are placing on business, and small business in particular, is just enormous. So yet again we have a failure of good governance. These concerns that we have were echoed vigorously by the industry, and why not? There is no transparency. There is no up-to-date regulatory impact statement. There is policy on the run. There are amendments on the run.


The bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, but government members forced the committee to undertake a rushed inquiry with only a few hours of hearings. In fact, the original intent of government members was to have no hearing at all, to have an inquiry with no submissions. That is the way Labor operate. They have inquiries with no submissions and they have policy outcomes that fail. But we should not be surprised, because they introduce taxes that hardly raise a dollar but, gee, they know how to waste money.


They also know how to introduce regulation. Labor said it was going to be their commitment to abolish regulation when they were first elected in 2007. My numbers are pretty close, and from what I understand Labor have done a sterling job reducing regulation. They have abolished around 80 regulations since they were elected. The problem is they have introduced 20,000 more, and here you have another whole raft of new regulations. Labor must be so proud of themselves. Labor members must be doing cartwheels at the red tape they are inflicting on small business, on families, on large business. They are wrapping up the entire community like a Christmas parcel with all the red tape that is rolling around. Even Santa would blush at the amount of red tape that has been used in regulations here in Australia just in the last five years. Wouldn't he envy that when he is wrapping his Christmas presents for all those kiddies out there?


It was only after the coalition stood up that a short inquiry was held, and of course the government dominated committee backed its minister. What a surprise! Therefore, we will proceed with our amendments. As I said, if our amendments are unsuccessful, we will not be a party to this bill and we will oppose the bill in full.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (13:11):  I am very pleased to rise in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012. This bill represents the third tranche of legislation which implements the government's Stronger Super reform initiatives. Of course, the Stronger Super reform initiatives are part of a broader reform agenda for superannuation which has been initiated by the government. The government's Stronger Super response, following the Cooper review, is one of three limbs to the overall superannuation reform agenda. The other two limbs are the Future of Financial Advice reforms, otherwise known as the FoFA reforms, which were passed by the parliament earlier this year, and the government's Stronger and Fairer Superannuation reforms, including an increase in the superannuation guarantee charge from nine per cent to 12 per cent by 1 July 2019, which have also been passed by the parliament.


The bill before the House contains eight schedules and establishes various rules relating to the operation of MySuper products. Before turning to some of the specifics of the bill, I believe it is opportune to reflect on the state of play regarding superannuation and the financial services sector in Australia. Last week APRA released its 2012 super statistics, which revealed that the value of Australia's superannuation savings is now $1.46 trillion and grew 13 per cent over the year to September 2012. In an ongoing uncertain global economic climate, these figures are indeed phenomenal—double-digit growth rates for the retirement nest eggs of Australians.


The positive industry response to the government's superannuation reform agenda is also evident in the enhanced products and services now being offered to consumers. One example is the launch by the ANZ last week of its new Smart Choice superannuation product, which has been designed with the government's MySuper reforms in mind. Together with the ING Living Super launch in September, it is a clear signal that the industry is embracing the MySuper reforms and launching new simple and affordable products accordingly. This reinforces the fact that MySuper products will be low-cost, low-risk superannuation products which provide those members with greater security. These changes will benefit those 80 per cent of members who are in the default strategy in their respective super funds but will not disadvantage those members who wish to take a more active role in managing their superannuation.


In his second reading speech for the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011, the minister stated:


… around 60 per cent of Australians do not make active choices in relation to their superannuation.


And this government believes that Australians should not be charged for valet parking when they are catching the train.


…   …   …


Having created an industry which flourishes on the back of compulsory savings mandated by legislation, it is fair that this industry, which benefits so much from the compulsory saving system in Australia, contributes to higher retirement savings through greater efficiency and lower fees.


These comments go to the heart of the recommendations of the Cooper review. Specifically, in the case of MySuper the final report included a covering letter statement, which read in part:


We have developed ten recommendation packages aimed at benefiting members.


MySuper sits at the heart of our recommendations. It is designed to focus funds on the core purpose for which they exist: optimising retirement incomes for members.


Key recommendation 1.2 in the review highlights of the report states:


MySuper is a simple, well-designed product suitable for the majority of members. The MySuper concept is aimed at lowering overall costs while maintaining a competitive market-based, private sector infrastructure for super. The concept draws on and enhances an existing and well-known product (the default investment option). MySuper takes this product, simplifies it, adds scale, transparency and comparability, all aimed at achieving better member outcomes.


In its recommendations, the Cooper review used the terminology of the superannuation system architecture recognising four types of members. The first two are particularly relevant to the rationale for the MySuper model, namely members who simply want someone else to take care of all their superannuation services needs for them—MySuper is particularly designed to cater to these members—and members who want to exercise choice over the investment strategies applied to their superannuation balances but want to have their accounts administered for them. These members can elect to be in the choice segment—although they might decide that a MySuper product meets their needs and elect to have their money invested there—or in a combination of MySuper and choice products.


Recognition of this rationale is not isolated. In a September 2010 speech to the Australian Conference of Economists, Dr David Gruen of Treasury argued that, against the backdrop of increasing evidence from behavioural economics, we can no longer run with the conventional economic wisdom that suggests consumers of financial products are the best judges of their own interests. Market failure does occur and when it does it is appropriate for government to step in. He quoted from the Wallis inquiry final report in 1997, which stated:


For many financial products, consumers lack (and cannot efficiently obtain) the knowledge, experience or judgment required to make informed decisions. This is … a situation where further disclosure, no matter how high quality or comprehensive, cannot overcome market failure.


In these cases, it may be desirable to substitute the opinion of a third party for that of consumers themselves.


Dr Gruen also explained in convincing terms the policy rationale for MySuper and the initiatives contained in this bill. He said:


… a key driving principle behind MySuper is that, for those people who do not actively choose an option for their superannuation savings, we want public policy to mandate a default option with carefully designed features that we judge will promote the wellbeing of those who use this option.


Crucially, this mandated default option is not imposed on anyone. Freedom of choice is a central feature of the choice architecture model that underpins the MySuper proposal. Actively engaged people can choose a MySuper default option, or they can choose from a potentially wide array of alternative 'choice' options.


The evidence is that around 80 per cent of members of superannuation funds in Australia are invested in the default option in a super fund chosen by their employer or an award. Of that 80 per cent, anecdotal evidence suggests around 20 per cent explicitly choose the default option, with the rest making no active choice.


Turning to some of the specifics of the bill, I would like to highlight a selection in the time available to me. Schedule 3 addresses the collection and disclosure of information. It implements new data collection and publication powers for APRA in relation to superannuation and imposes new disclosure obligations on trustees, including publishing their full portfolio holdings and a product dashboard on their website. This provision improves transparency by expanding the coverage of APRA data collection, ensuring the publication of data on MySuper products and improving disclosure for superannuation. This is a direct result of the Cooper review's final report, which stated:


Transparency and comparability are critical to the efficiency and operation of a market‐based savings system, even where participation is compulsory. The Panel believes that there is presently a lack of transparency, comparability and, ultimately, accountability in the Australian superannuation system that can only be effectively improved through targeted and proportionate regulation.


The provisions in this bill will rectify this issue of a lack of transparency in the Australian superannuation system by expanding APRA's role in the collection and publication of data in superannuation entities. As outlined by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in its inquiry into the bill, this data will allow members, employers, the industry and other stakeholders with information to compare the performance of superannuation products, enhancing the accountability of trustees to their members.


There is a requirement for funds to disclose their full portfolio holdings. The rationale for this provision, similar to what I have discussed, is that superannuation fund trustees should be aware of what they invest members' savings in, and, given that superannuation is a compulsory system, members should have access to this information. However, the government has indicated that it will consider whether to extend portfolio holdings disclosure requirements to managed investment schemes, again as recommended by a PJC inquiry, this time into the collapse of Trio.


On accrued default amounts, the government has determined to define accrued default amounts broadly. The rationale here is that this will allow funds to convert their default investment option to a MySuper product rather than having to determine the status of every member. Importantly, this is consistent with the recommendations of the Cooper review. Members will be notified before a transfer occurs and will have the right to opt out. Therefore, no member is forced to transfer if they do not want to. Trustees will have up to four years to communicate with members about their options. Therefore, this approach ensures that all members that need to be protected are transferred to a MySuper product and any members who wish to make their own choice are free to do so.


There is the issue—and it is often said—that, if MySuper is about the disengaged, why should members who have chosen a fund be moved to MySuper? The important point to note here, as I have set out in the evidence and opinions from the Cooper review, Treasury and the industry itself, is that MySuper is not just about disengaged members. The Cooper review recommended that default investment options should be subject to heightened duties and specific rules. The review did not differentiate between how members were placed in a default investment option; rather, it recommended that all members in the default investment option should be within MySuper. The review noted that members would be placed in MySuper by default and that members would also be free to choose MySuper if they wanted a simple and low-cost product. Members who have made an investment choice in the past should not be excluded from being in a MySuper product in the future.


Why should members who have selected the default investment option be moved to a MySuper product? Again, the Cooper review recommended that members currently in default investment options should be placed in MySuper products. Some members who choose the default investment option simply want the trustee to make investment decisions for them. As the trustee will be responsible for the investment decisions in MySuper, these members should be moved to a MySuper product. Members who want to remain in the default investment option will be able to opt out.


Some of those opposite have argued that there has not been enough consultation on MySuper. Whilst these views are clearly misguided, we should not have high expectations in this regard following some of the mistruths and inaccuracy being peddled by some of those opposite. There has been extensive consultation with industry in relation to the MySuper reform initiatives. The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, a peak industry body in the superannuation sector, told a recent PJC inquiry into the bill that there had been a 'significant and extensive' consultation process over a period of 'about 20 months' dating back to the start of 2011.


The MySuper reforms are complemented by the SuperStream initiatives, which are designed to clean up the back office administrative elements of the superannuation industry. Treasury's regulatory impact statement on Stronger Super implementation in September 2011 described the SuperStream initiatives as designed to 'improve the productivity of the superannuation system and make the system easier to use'.


The benefits which will result from the implementation of the SuperStream and MySuper reforms are many and will touch members and industry participants alike. Fund trustees will be relieved of administrative inefficiencies which distract them from their duties to members, and members will benefit from greater confidence in the superannuation industry. Treasury estimates that the annual savings resulting from SuperStream and MySuper will amount to $1.55 billion in the short term and $2.7 billion in the long term and that the average member will see an increase to their final superannuation balance of $40,000. These are impressive developments that the government can indeed be proud of on behalf of all members of the Australian public, and I am delighted to be able to extend my support to such great initiatives.


There are several benefits associated with this bill. In the time available to me, I have sought to highlight some of them. With the passage of this bill, it is evident that many working Australians will receive a very tangible benefit from the measures implemented by this bill. These actions are also a genuine reminder of this government's continued commitment to policy delivery and achieving its vision for the future of Australia. This bill is a genuine illustration of this government's commitment to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian superannuation system. I urge all members to support this bill.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (13:25):  I rise today to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House. As members on this side of the House are aware, the coalition have always been consistent in supporting changes to superannuation in an effort to make the system more efficient, transparent and competitive, with the ultimate objective being to improve the value for super fund members. We have come to this House on regular occasions supporting bills that have come before the House. We get tagged with 'constant negativity', but the reality is—from the advice of the Parliamentary Library—that to date we have supported 87.3 per cent of the legislation that has come before us. We have supported 87.3 per cent, so I am perplexed as to where anyone could say that we were not cooperating.


On this particular bill, I am disappointed and appalled at the apparent lack of adequate scrutiny of the bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services because this Labor government has once again rushed an inquiry. The bill is more than 100 pages long and makes fundamental and controversial changes to Australia's superannuation retirement system. Witnesses had a very limited time to make submissions. The Superannuation Committee of the Law Council of Australia—this eminent body—stated:


It is not possible to prepare a well-reasoned and thought-through submission in a week. For the trustee obligations bill the submission timetable was shorter than the period within which the committee was meant to release its report. I suppose people have a lack of confidence in the system given this timing.


A previous speaker mentioned that we had been spreading mistruths and misinformation about the time frame allowed. Well, there you have it now on the record: the Superannuation Committee of the Law Council of Australia stated that there was not enough time. Australian public, you be the judge. When you talk about peddling mistruths and misinformation, nothing can ever beat the clanger 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' when it comes to this government spreading mistruths and misinformation.


This is extremely concerning, and I am sure constituents in my electorate of Wright will feel much the same way about it. Remember when we first came to this House? The Prime Minister said, 'We need to open up the blinds and let the sunlight in, let the transparency of this place be divulged.' I wondered where that phrase 'let the sunlight in' came from. I was watching an episode of Yes, Minister, the UK political comic show, the other day and the 'Prime Minister', Jim Hacker, said the very words: 'Open the windows and let the fresh air in.' This is comical, and you can draw parallels from Yes, Minister.


The bill is the third slice of legislation following the recommendations made by the Cooper review, which we are all aware was constructed with the aim of introducing a new, low-cost superannuation product known as MySuper to replace existing default superannuation products. The bill contains a number of what many Australians would deem to be miniscule changes. However, each one of these changes is crucially important. That is why I am proud to represent the people of Wright—because I want to make sure that we get this bill right.


The first part of the bill that I am talking about today legislates to ban conflicting remuneration and entry fees and limits other fees to cost recovery. Under this schedule, a superannuation fund that wishes to offer a MySuper product may not charge members of a MySuper product a fee that relates to a payment of conflicted remuneration. This prohibits the trustee from deducting any amount from a MySuper product that relates to making a commission payment to a financial adviser. And while performance based fees may still be paid to an investment manager in relation to assets of a fund that are attributable to a MySuper product, the trustee must demonstrate that the arrangement promotes the financial interest of MySuper members. This is where my concerns start. To demonstrate this concern, I quote from the Association of Financial Advisers, who stated that intrafund advice will not serve the best interests of clients. They go on to say:


… the payment for personal advice out of an administration fee is a less-than-transparent mechanism and also serves to detrimentally impact the perceived value of any advice that people get. Anything you get for free you do not properly value, and if you can get it for what appears to be free from your superannuation fund then why would you go to a financial advisor and pay for it?


These concerns are very real and indicative of the inadequate examination by the committee. I am appalled that in 2012 we continue to have to address matters such as this.


The next section of this bill looks at new data collection and the publication powers of APRA and requirements for product dashboards and portfolio disclosure. A range of concerns were raised in the inquiry about the practicality of the product dashboard. As stated by the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, there is clear potential for misleading information being supplied on the product dashboard—a real concern. The only consolation I have is that members of the committee have recognised that the legislation lacks clarity about what is required by the dashboard and are recommending greater certainty for industry participants regarding this measure. Unfortunately the recommendation is of little value, as it merely calls for APRA to conduct further consultation with industry; it does not call for any real change to the legislation. I concur with my colleagues in recommending that schedules 4 and 6 of this bill be amended to improve the structure of choice for members moving moneys, in view of the evidence that across many different sectors of the superannuation industry there is strong dissatisfaction about the practical workability of the product dashboard provisions set out in schedules 4 and 6.


The next section of this bill amends the Fair Work Act to ensure a MySuper product can be nominated in a modern award or enterprise agreement. To cut straight to the point of the issue, while every default fund has to be a MySuper product, not every MySuper product will be able to compete freely as a default superannuation fund under modern awards. As a result, the decision on which funds are selected as default funds under modern awards remains therefore with Fair Work Australia through the current widely discredited process.


Even the government had to recognise before the last election that the current process, which heavily and inappropriately favours union dominated industry superannuation funds, is not open, transparent and competitive.


It is appalling that the government of this country admits that their process operates in this manner. I question this, as any normal member of a superannuation fund should: if this system does not perform to standard then it is the member who will suffer, because their money—the money which they are counting on to support them in their retirement—will go towards administration. With this in mind I implore the parliament to use this opportunity to ensure the introduction of genuine competition in the default superannuation fund market by moving relevant amendments to this bill. It is imperative that employers be given the option to select any MySuper product as a default fund for employees who have not chosen a fund. Doing so would ensure genuine choice and competition in addition to assisting to maximise value for employees who end up in a default superannuation fund.


The final aspect of this bill that I want to speak about today is the requirement for existing member balances to be transferred to MySuper products, and the relevant transitional rules. This is a fairly extensive schedule, so I will keep my comments brief. Firstly, the bill casts a very wide net as to which existing member balances held in existing superannuation funds will be required to be transferred into a MySuper product. This means that in many cases members who have exercised a choice will have that choice overridden. Put another way, under the drafting, the government has not distinguished between default and personal—non-default—funds.


The second point I want to make relating to this schedule regards the 'opt-out' mechanism. Funds have until 1 July 2017 to transfer all accrued default amounts to a MySuper product unless the member opts out in writing. By that date the trustee of a fund must contact all members having accrued default amounts and notify them of the proposed transfer of those amounts into a MySuper product. If the member does not opt out by the end of a 90-day period, the trustee is obliged to go ahead and carry out the transfer. This means that, without members being aware that this is happening, the nature of their superannuation product is going to change—and in a material number of cases that change will be adverse to members' interests.


This action by the government is not only somewhat extraordinary; I believe it is also somewhat deceitful. Furthermore, it is disappointing that a government can choose to set such an example to the wider Australian business community. I can only hope that business owners will not take this lead in the way they conduct their own businesses. To finish on this point, I concur with my coalition colleagues in recommending that an amendment be moved to the bill to provide that any amount in respect of which a member has made an active choice is not an accrued default amount and should not be moved to a MySuper product, either within or outside their chosen fund.


In conclusion, it is very easy to see that this government has yet again done the Australian people over. The people of my electorate of Wright, whom I serve with honesty and integrity, deserve significantly better. The government has made every effort to deceive the Australian people through this bill. I conclude with the recommendations of my coalition colleagues. I strongly encourage those on the other side of the House to think carefully about the Australian people who will be affected by this legislation and what it means to them. I do not want the mums and dads and the hardworking business owners of my community to be left behind—everyday Australians who work hard to ensure they have a plan for the future. This is what will happen if we do not make every effort to work together for effective policy.


I encourage the government to withdraw this bill, pending further consultation across the superannuation industry and addressing the serious flaws identified by the inquiry. This in turn will allow for the preparation of a full and compliant Regulatory Impact Statement for the entire bill. If those on the other side of the House choose to proceed with this bill in its current form, then I can recommend that at least they adopt the amendments put forward to ensure that a member who has previously exercised choice of fund, while also opting for the default investment option of that chosen fund, cannot be automatically transferred into a MySuper product by having previous contributions defined as an 'accrued default amount' and that any product which qualifies as a MySuper product is able to compete freely in the default superannuation fund market. We recommend that schedules 4 and 6 be amended or removed for additional scrutiny before this bill is considered.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (13:38):  This is the third tranche of legislation as a part of the government's Stronger and Fairer Superannuation reforms. It includes seven key elements, the first being a ban on conflicted remuneration fees—effectively commissions for MySuper products. It provides an opt-out provision—that is, insurance in the form of life insurance and total and permanent disability insurance should be provided; however, MySuper Fund members can opt out of the provision of such insurance. It increases the disclosure obligations on trustees in relation to their portfolio holdings. It also provides for default placement via awards and collective agreements—that is, when members are placed by default into a superannuation fund it must be a MySuper superannuation fund. It makes it quite clear that defined benefit funds are excluded from these arrangements. It provides for the streamlining of transfer of pre-approved funds into MySuper accounts and it provides better powers for APRA to scrutinise eligible rollover funds.


My colleague the member for Greenway has gone through the background to these provisions in quite some detail. I do not intend in the time I have available to go back over that ground, but I would like to make some observations about another part of the transparency regime of our financial sector—and by that I mean our ratings agencies. Credit ratings play an important role in the Australian prudential regulatory framework. Ratings agencies are companies that charge fees to provide ratings on financial products and organisations. The work of ratings agencies helps to assess financial products. Ratings agencies, including Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, wield enormous financial power, yet they are essentially unregulated. Since the global financial crisis, the work of ratings agencies has come under increased scrutiny. I believe that this scrutiny is appropriate and in fact that there could be, and should be, more done in this area. There is no doubt that many investors, not just in Australia but in the United States and elsewhere, are still feeling the consequences of the global financial crisis and the collapse of investment institutions like Lehman Brothers.


Ratings agencies played a significant role in this crisis and contributed to the housing bubble in the United States by giving risky mortgage backed securities top ratings and underestimating the risk of default and disclosure. While the opinion of these ratings agencies is just that—an opinion—in practice the role these agencies play in financial markets is crucial. This is largely a user-pays system in which the ratings agencies receive income from the fees paid by those who issue certain financial products. I believe that there is a lack of transparency and often conflict-of-interest issues in this system that currently are not adequately addressed by regulation.


There can be no denying that there are many investor victims in Australia and globally because of their reliance on the work of ratings agencies. There have been two recent Federal Court cases that touch on this situation. Earlier this month the Federal Court made a landmark decision with regard to the use of Standard & Poor's AAA ratings in the lead-up to the global financial crisis by finding that the ratings agency was in part liable for the advice and distribution of complex financial products to 13 New South Wales councils. This recent decision came in the wake of an earlier ruling in October—again in the Federal Court—which found the Australian arm of a failed US institution, Lehman Brothers, liable for investment advice to councils regarding other complex financial institutions. I know about this very well, because one council in my electorate, the Wingecarribee Council, lost somewhere in the order of $30 million.


It is good news that the Federal Court made a decision in this case; it means that the council affected will recover some of the $30million loss. While this decision will no doubt be appealed, in the meantime it is important to note some of the findings in this decision. The Federal Court judge found that S&P's decision to give a AAA rating to the financial product was 'misleading and deceptive' and involved 'negligent misrepresentation'. As the judge said: 


The very purpose of a rating is to provide investors with independent information by persons expert in assessing the creditworthiness of an investment so that, by a simple system of letters, an investor can know and compare the creditworthiness of investments.


This is an issue that goes not just to financial products but to governments at the federal and state level as well. Many local government bodies and their ratepayers were essentially defrauded through false and misleading ratings assurances. I understand that it is likely that, following this decision, we will see more court cases.


I raise these issues in parliament today because I believe the time has come for the Australian parliament to play its part in applying proper scrutiny to these ratings agencies and companies—just as we quite rightly bring legislation before this House to ensure that members who are investing their money in superannuation products do so with the knowledge that those products are well-managed and that they have some control, knowledge and information about not only the superannuation fund but also the trustees of those funds and the whereabouts of those investments. That is because Australia's financial system depends on each player adhering to best practice and the highest standards of prudential rigour. I believe that more action needs to be taken in this parliament not only to improve the operation of our superannuation system but also to ensure that the work of credit rating agencies is done within an environment that is properly looking at the enormous responsibility that they have in pricing and in rating the creditworthiness of financial products and government bodies as well. I commend the legislation to the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (12:51):  I rise to speak on this bill that is now before the House and which seeks to implement the government's third tranche of legislation implementing MySuper, replacing existing default superannuation fund products. The bill contains eight schedules, all dealing with various reforms, to implement MySuper. I can state at the outset that the coalition has deep reservations in relation to schedule 6 of this bill, which deals with the transition to MySuper. We will seek to move amendments to excise this schedule from the bill. If this is not successful, we will seek to move an amendment to improve the schedule.


The coalition also takes a principled stance against the legislative changes contained in schedule 4 of this bill, regarding amendments to the Fair Work Act, so that only funds offering a MySuper product can be included in modern awards and enterprise agreements. The problem the coalition has with these changes is that not every MySuper product will be able to compete freely as a default superannuation fund under modern awards. The coalition has a fundamental objection to the closed-shop approach taken by the government. We will be moving amendments to address this issue. As I said, if we are unsuccessful in improving schedules 4 and 6, we will not support passage of the bill.


I will deal with schedule 1 first. This schedule seeks to ban conflicted remuneration payments from MySuper products. Schedule 1 contains changes which prohibit trustees from deducting any amount from MySuper products that relates to making a commission payment to a financial adviser. The changes contained within schedule 1 also implement restrictions on personal advice that superannuation trustees may charge for collectively.


In addition, schedule 1 prohibits financial advice provided to employers from being recovered through fees charged to members of the fund. The aim is to prevent commissions being charged to employees to cover the costs of an employer seeking financial advice. This schedule of the bill also contains changes to general fee rules which prohibit entry fees and limit exit switching and buy-sell fees for amounts over and above a cost recovery basis.


The parliamentary joint committee inquiry into the bill heard a range of evidence which highlighted concerns that the industry sector had in relation to schedule 1. The Association of Financial Advisers commented that intrafund advice would not serve the best interests of clients, as the advice could be provided without being based on a client's personal circumstances. The association also expressed concerns that the legislation was inconsistent when distinguishing between complex and basic advice.


The Law Council of Australia raised concerns regarding the potential conflict for trustees arising from the different grandfathering arrangements contained within this bill and the interaction these will have with the government's FoFA changes. The coalition has called on the government to withdraw this bill, to allow further consultation to remedy industry concerns, but the government has not heeded this warning and instead is choosing to pursue the change.


Schedule 2 of the bill that seeks to mandate that MySuper funds includes life and total and permanent disability insurance on an opt-out basis. The changes contained within this schedule also seek to align insurance definitions with conditions of release, to improve consistency with the purpose of the superannuation fund and to ensure payments flow through to members where an insurer pays out to the superannuation fund under the insurance policy. These changes will also prevent a situation where members are paying premiums on several types of insurance coverage but are unable to have payments released to them as they do not meet the superannuation fund's conditions of release. We view this as a sensible change. Schedule 2 also prohibits superannuation funds from self-insuring benefits of the fund, particularly life and total and permanent disability insurance. This ban will not extend to defined benefit funds. Such prohibition will seek to mitigate the risk of any shortfall in insurance benefits funded by other members' balances, which is pretty sensible, Madam Deputy Speaker. I hope you are paying attention.


Schedule 3 of this bill provides additional powers to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, APRA, in order to link further data from superannuation funds holding registrable superannuation entity licences. This will provide a large dataset over time and will ultimately provide policymakers with a more accurate picture of the superannuation sector. For example, it will provide more information on the structure of assets within the superannuation sector and more transparent information on expenses, such as fees being charged to policyholders. The changes contained within this schedule also require APRA to disclose quarterly information on MySuper fees, costs and returns.


The legislation further requires the publication on a website of a product dashboard that will show each MySuper and choice product's investment return target and—importantly—how often this has been achieved, the level of investment risk, a statement on liquidity of the product, and information regarding the average number of fees and other costs related to the product. The legislation also makes readily available a remuneration of superannuation funds' directors and executive officers as well as a breakdown of portfolio holdings. This information should already have been available to members of super funds and we remain sceptical as to whether these measures will actually achieve their aims, following the government's track record on the implementation of other websites. It always gives them a little bit of a shiver down their spines when I mention GroceryWatch and FuelWatch. In fact, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services heard a range of views from industry stakeholders who expressed concern about the workability of this schedule. We the coalition have called on the government to withdraw this schedule from the bill, to allow further consultation to be undertaken, and for the government to hear at least some of the concerns of industry. 


The changes contained within schedule 4 of this bill amend the Fair Work Act so that only funds offering MySuper products can be included in modern awards and enterprise agreements. While every default fund has to be a MySuper product, not every MySuper product will be able to compete freely as a default superannuation fund under modern awards. The decision on the selection of default funds under modern awards remains with Fair Work Australia. This process is widely discredited to the point where the current government recognised this before the last election.


This government made a commitment to instruct the Productivity Commission to design a transparent evidence based and competitive process for the selection of default funds under modern awards. But we all know the difference between what the government says before an election and what it actually does after an election. It took this government until early this year to commission the Productivity Commission to commence the review. But before they handed it down Minister Shorten had already ruled it out. Get a load of that, Madam Deputy Speaker Rishworth. You, Madam Deputy Speaker, would be as appalled as I am at the fact that a minister commissioned a review and then ruled out its findings before the review was even handed down. You of all people, Madam Deputy Speaker, would be appalled at that, and rightly so—as I am.


But it is typical Labor, isn't it? It is typical of the government. That is what they do. They make it up as they go along. Of course, the minister is quite happy protecting his union mates given that he was the head of the Australian Workers Union. He has always given the union dominated super funds a leg up over alternative market based providers. Well, the coalition will seek to move an amendment to the schedule. If our first amendment to remove schedule 6 is unsuccessful, we will not support the bill.


The changes contained within schedule 5 seek to allow defined benefit fund schemes to continue to be used by employers for the contributions of employees who do not have a chosen fund. This is an exemption to the general requirement that employers must make contributions to a fund that offers a MySuper product for an employee who does not have a chosen fund. The changes also exclude defined benefit members from being counted in working out whether an employer is a large employer. This will mean that defined benefit employees are exempt from the 500-employee rule when employers are looking to be deemed a large employer.


Schedule 6 of this bill implements provisions that impose requirements for certain existing member balances to be moved into MySuper products, and it also contains a whole new raft of transitional rules. As I stated at the outset, we have deep reservations in relation to this schedule of the bill. We will be seeking to move an amendment to excise the schedule from the bill. Again, if we are unsuccessful, the coalition will then move an amendment that seeks to improve this schedule, along with schedule 4. It aims to restore competition and choice to super.


Schedule 6 amends the SI(S) Act to introduce a new concept of an accrued default amount. The new concept defines those parts of a member's interest within an existing superannuation fund which in turn must be moved into a MySuper product. These are amounts whereby a member has not exercised an investment choice or amounts held in a default investment option of a fund. This broad definition will mean that fund members who have chosen a specific super fund as well as fund members who have their superannuation invested in the default investment option of that specific superannuation fund will have their balances transferred to a MySuper product unless they choose to opt out. So funds have until 1 July 2017 to transfer all accrued default amounts to a MySuper product unless the member opts out in writing. This will significantly expand the amount that is being transitioned into MySuper, with significant financial consequences for individual fund members, including those who have previously exercised their right to actively choose their own super fund. This will mean that, under the proposed accrued default amount definition contained within this schedule, all existing default fund workplace accounts, as well as the balances of individuals who have previously exercised choice of funds but who have remained with the default investment option of their chosen fund, will be swept up into the new default MySuper product. Given that this transfer will take place on an opt-out basis, a member who does not choose to opt out will have their superannuation account balance transferred out of its current investment option or fund into a MySuper product chosen by someone else.


The proposal to transfer such a wide range of accounts into MySuper gives rise to a number of consumer protection issues. Many members who have exercised choice will be inappropriately swept up and are likely to find that, post transition, they are now invested in an investment option which they do not want. Such members will also have incurred transaction costs from the selling and rebuying of assets as a result of the transfer, unnecessarily crystallising capital gains.


This also has potential implications for insurance within super, as the MySuper death and total and permanent disability insurance cover is likely to be less than is currently enjoyed by a member of a chosen default fund. Some people who have not been covered within their chosen fund for a long time may not be able to qualify for life insurance or may only qualify on inferior terms given the changes in their personal circumstances since the original cover was taken out.


We will move amendments to excise this schedule from the bill. If this amendment is unsuccessful, we will move another amendment to ensure that a member who has chosen a super fund does not have an accrued default amount and is not moved to a MySuper product. This amendment follows generally the recommendation of the submission by the Law Council of Australia on the exposure draft and is strongly supported by the Financial Services Council, AMP and commercial super funds. As I have stated previously, if our second amendment is also unsuccessful, we will not be supporting this bill.


The final schedule of the bill relates to eligible rollover funds. ERFs have the sole purpose of being a temporary repository for the interest of members who have lost their super accounts. ERFs keep and preserve these balances until the member has been found. Schedule 7 amends the SI(S) Act so that trustees are required to apply to APRA in order to obtain authorisation to operate an ERF. All balances in an existing ERF will be required to be transferred into an authorised ERF or a fund that offers a MySuper product within 90 days where an application for authorisation has not been made or if APRA has refused authorisation.


I look at this bill and I say, 'Bring on the red tape.' That is what it is—just more red tape, more process—and all with a political purpose from the minister of trying to support some of his mates in the industry. So we will be moving an amendment to excise schedule 6 from the bill. If we are unsuccessful, we will move additional amendments to schedules 4 and 6.


In concluding, I would like to draw the House's attention to the government's failure to have an adequate regulatory impact statement on this legislation. The regulatory impact statement on the second tranche of the MySuper legislation was carried out in September 2011, long before the final version of the legislation was available. Further, a number of matters in various tranches of the legislation were exempted from the regulatory impact statement. The Office of Best Practice Regulation noted:


The Prime Minister granted exemptions from the requirements for regulatory impact analysis in relation to the ability of funds to offer tailored MySuper products to employees with more than 500 employees, and extension to the date by which trustees will be required to have transferred the balance—


and so on.


So the Prime Minister granted an exemption from any regulatory checks on this legislation. It is typical, really, isn't it? As my colleague the shadow minister for finance says, it is just a disgrace. The burden that you are placing on business, and small business in particular, is just enormous. So yet again we have a failure of good governance. These concerns that we have were echoed vigorously by the industry, and why not? There is no transparency. There is no up-to-date regulatory impact statement. There is policy on the run. There are amendments on the run.


The bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, but government members forced the committee to undertake a rushed inquiry with only a few hours of hearings. In fact, the original intent of government members was to have no hearing at all, to have an inquiry with no submissions. That is the way Labor operate. They have inquiries with no submissions and they have policy outcomes that fail. But we should not be surprised, because they introduce taxes that hardly raise a dollar but, gee, they know how to waste money.


They also know how to introduce regulation. Labor said it was going to be their commitment to abolish regulation when they were first elected in 2007. My numbers are pretty close, and from what I understand Labor have done a sterling job reducing regulation. They have abolished around 80 regulations since they were elected. The problem is they have introduced 20,000 more, and here you have another whole raft of new regulations. Labor must be so proud of themselves. Labor members must be doing cartwheels at the red tape they are inflicting on small business, on families, on large business. They are wrapping up the entire community like a Christmas parcel with all the red tape that is rolling around. Even Santa would blush at the amount of red tape that has been used in regulations here in Australia just in the last five years. Wouldn't he envy that when he is wrapping his Christmas presents for all those kiddies out there?


It was only after the coalition stood up that a short inquiry was held, and of course the government dominated committee backed its minister. What a surprise! Therefore, we will proceed with our amendments. As I said, if our amendments are unsuccessful, we will not be a party to this bill and we will oppose the bill in full.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (13:11):  I am very pleased to rise in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012. This bill represents the third tranche of legislation which implements the government's Stronger Super reform initiatives. Of course, the Stronger Super reform initiatives are part of a broader reform agenda for superannuation which has been initiated by the government. The government's Stronger Super response, following the Cooper review, is one of three limbs to the overall superannuation reform agenda. The other two limbs are the Future of Financial Advice reforms, otherwise known as the FoFA reforms, which were passed by the parliament earlier this year, and the government's Stronger and Fairer Superannuation reforms, including an increase in the superannuation guarantee charge from nine per cent to 12 per cent by 1 July 2019, which have also been passed by the parliament.


The bill before the House contains eight schedules and establishes various rules relating to the operation of MySuper products. Before turning to some of the specifics of the bill, I believe it is opportune to reflect on the state of play regarding superannuation and the financial services sector in Australia. Last week APRA released its 2012 super statistics, which revealed that the value of Australia's superannuation savings is now $1.46 trillion and grew 13 per cent over the year to September 2012. In an ongoing uncertain global economic climate, these figures are indeed phenomenal—double-digit growth rates for the retirement nest eggs of Australians.


The positive industry response to the government's superannuation reform agenda is also evident in the enhanced products and services now being offered to consumers. One example is the launch by the ANZ last week of its new Smart Choice superannuation product, which has been designed with the government's MySuper reforms in mind. Together with the ING Living Super launch in September, it is a clear signal that the industry is embracing the MySuper reforms and launching new simple and affordable products accordingly. This reinforces the fact that MySuper products will be low-cost, low-risk superannuation products which provide those members with greater security. These changes will benefit those 80 per cent of members who are in the default strategy in their respective super funds but will not disadvantage those members who wish to take a more active role in managing their superannuation.


In his second reading speech for the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011, the minister stated:


… around 60 per cent of Australians do not make active choices in relation to their superannuation.


And this government believes that Australians should not be charged for valet parking when they are catching the train.


…   …   …


Having created an industry which flourishes on the back of compulsory savings mandated by legislation, it is fair that this industry, which benefits so much from the compulsory saving system in Australia, contributes to higher retirement savings through greater efficiency and lower fees.


These comments go to the heart of the recommendations of the Cooper review. Specifically, in the case of MySuper the final report included a covering letter statement, which read in part:


We have developed ten recommendation packages aimed at benefiting members.


MySuper sits at the heart of our recommendations. It is designed to focus funds on the core purpose for which they exist: optimising retirement incomes for members.


Key recommendation 1.2 in the review highlights of the report states:


MySuper is a simple, well-designed product suitable for the majority of members. The MySuper concept is aimed at lowering overall costs while maintaining a competitive market-based, private sector infrastructure for super. The concept draws on and enhances an existing and well-known product (the default investment option). MySuper takes this product, simplifies it, adds scale, transparency and comparability, all aimed at achieving better member outcomes.


In its recommendations, the Cooper review used the terminology of the superannuation system architecture recognising four types of members. The first two are particularly relevant to the rationale for the MySuper model, namely members who simply want someone else to take care of all their superannuation services needs for them—MySuper is particularly designed to cater to these members—and members who want to exercise choice over the investment strategies applied to their superannuation balances but want to have their accounts administered for them. These members can elect to be in the choice segment—although they might decide that a MySuper product meets their needs and elect to have their money invested there—or in a combination of MySuper and choice products.


Recognition of this rationale is not isolated. In a September 2010 speech to the Australian Conference of Economists, Dr David Gruen of Treasury argued that, against the backdrop of increasing evidence from behavioural economics, we can no longer run with the conventional economic wisdom that suggests consumers of financial products are the best judges of their own interests. Market failure does occur and when it does it is appropriate for government to step in. He quoted from the Wallis inquiry final report in 1997, which stated:


For many financial products, consumers lack (and cannot efficiently obtain) the knowledge, experience or judgment required to make informed decisions. This is … a situation where further disclosure, no matter how high quality or comprehensive, cannot overcome market failure.


In these cases, it may be desirable to substitute the opinion of a third party for that of consumers themselves.


Dr Gruen also explained in convincing terms the policy rationale for MySuper and the initiatives contained in this bill. He said:


… a key driving principle behind MySuper is that, for those people who do not actively choose an option for their superannuation savings, we want public policy to mandate a default option with carefully designed features that we judge will promote the wellbeing of those who use this option.


Crucially, this mandated default option is not imposed on anyone. Freedom of choice is a central feature of the choice architecture model that underpins the MySuper proposal. Actively engaged people can choose a MySuper default option, or they can choose from a potentially wide array of alternative 'choice' options.


The evidence is that around 80 per cent of members of superannuation funds in Australia are invested in the default option in a super fund chosen by their employer or an award. Of that 80 per cent, anecdotal evidence suggests around 20 per cent explicitly choose the default option, with the rest making no active choice.


Turning to some of the specifics of the bill, I would like to highlight a selection in the time available to me. Schedule 3 addresses the collection and disclosure of information. It implements new data collection and publication powers for APRA in relation to superannuation and imposes new disclosure obligations on trustees, including publishing their full portfolio holdings and a product dashboard on their website. This provision improves transparency by expanding the coverage of APRA data collection, ensuring the publication of data on MySuper products and improving disclosure for superannuation. This is a direct result of the Cooper review's final report, which stated:


Transparency and comparability are critical to the efficiency and operation of a market‐based savings system, even where participation is compulsory. The Panel believes that there is presently a lack of transparency, comparability and, ultimately, accountability in the Australian superannuation system that can only be effectively improved through targeted and proportionate regulation.


The provisions in this bill will rectify this issue of a lack of transparency in the Australian superannuation system by expanding APRA's role in the collection and publication of data in superannuation entities. As outlined by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services in its inquiry into the bill, this data will allow members, employers, the industry and other stakeholders with information to compare the performance of superannuation products, enhancing the accountability of trustees to their members.


There is a requirement for funds to disclose their full portfolio holdings. The rationale for this provision, similar to what I have discussed, is that superannuation fund trustees should be aware of what they invest members' savings in, and, given that superannuation is a compulsory system, members should have access to this information. However, the government has indicated that it will consider whether to extend portfolio holdings disclosure requirements to managed investment schemes, again as recommended by a PJC inquiry, this time into the collapse of Trio.


On accrued default amounts, the government has determined to define accrued default amounts broadly. The rationale here is that this will allow funds to convert their default investment option to a MySuper product rather than having to determine the status of every member. Importantly, this is consistent with the recommendations of the Cooper review. Members will be notified before a transfer occurs and will have the right to opt out. Therefore, no member is forced to transfer if they do not want to. Trustees will have up to four years to communicate with members about their options. Therefore, this approach ensures that all members that need to be protected are transferred to a MySuper product and any members who wish to make their own choice are free to do so.


There is the issue—and it is often said—that, if MySuper is about the disengaged, why should members who have chosen a fund be moved to MySuper? The important point to note here, as I have set out in the evidence and opinions from the Cooper review, Treasury and the industry itself, is that MySuper is not just about disengaged members. The Cooper review recommended that default investment options should be subject to heightened duties and specific rules. The review did not differentiate between how members were placed in a default investment option; rather, it recommended that all members in the default investment option should be within MySuper. The review noted that members would be placed in MySuper by default and that members would also be free to choose MySuper if they wanted a simple and low-cost product. Members who have made an investment choice in the past should not be excluded from being in a MySuper product in the future.


Why should members who have selected the default investment option be moved to a MySuper product? Again, the Cooper review recommended that members currently in default investment options should be placed in MySuper products. Some members who choose the default investment option simply want the trustee to make investment decisions for them. As the trustee will be responsible for the investment decisions in MySuper, these members should be moved to a MySuper product. Members who want to remain in the default investment option will be able to opt out.


Some of those opposite have argued that there has not been enough consultation on MySuper. Whilst these views are clearly misguided, we should not have high expectations in this regard following some of the mistruths and inaccuracy being peddled by some of those opposite. There has been extensive consultation with industry in relation to the MySuper reform initiatives. The Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, a peak industry body in the superannuation sector, told a recent PJC inquiry into the bill that there had been a 'significant and extensive' consultation process over a period of 'about 20 months' dating back to the start of 2011.


The MySuper reforms are complemented by the SuperStream initiatives, which are designed to clean up the back office administrative elements of the superannuation industry. Treasury's regulatory impact statement on Stronger Super implementation in September 2011 described the SuperStream initiatives as designed to 'improve the productivity of the superannuation system and make the system easier to use'.


The benefits which will result from the implementation of the SuperStream and MySuper reforms are many and will touch members and industry participants alike. Fund trustees will be relieved of administrative inefficiencies which distract them from their duties to members, and members will benefit from greater confidence in the superannuation industry. Treasury estimates that the annual savings resulting from SuperStream and MySuper will amount to $1.55 billion in the short term and $2.7 billion in the long term and that the average member will see an increase to their final superannuation balance of $40,000. These are impressive developments that the government can indeed be proud of on behalf of all members of the Australian public, and I am delighted to be able to extend my support to such great initiatives.


There are several benefits associated with this bill. In the time available to me, I have sought to highlight some of them. With the passage of this bill, it is evident that many working Australians will receive a very tangible benefit from the measures implemented by this bill. These actions are also a genuine reminder of this government's continued commitment to policy delivery and achieving its vision for the future of Australia. This bill is a genuine illustration of this government's commitment to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian superannuation system. I urge all members to support this bill.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (13:25):  I rise today to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012, which is currently before the House. As members on this side of the House are aware, the coalition have always been consistent in supporting changes to superannuation in an effort to make the system more efficient, transparent and competitive, with the ultimate objective being to improve the value for super fund members. We have come to this House on regular occasions supporting bills that have come before the House. We get tagged with 'constant negativity', but the reality is—from the advice of the Parliamentary Library—that to date we have supported 87.3 per cent of the legislation that has come before us. We have supported 87.3 per cent, so I am perplexed as to where anyone could say that we were not cooperating.


On this particular bill, I am disappointed and appalled at the apparent lack of adequate scrutiny of the bill by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services because this Labor government has once again rushed an inquiry. The bill is more than 100 pages long and makes fundamental and controversial changes to Australia's superannuation retirement system. Witnesses had a very limited time to make submissions. The Superannuation Committee of the Law Council of Australia—this eminent body—stated:


It is not possible to prepare a well-reasoned and thought-through submission in a week. For the trustee obligations bill the submission timetable was shorter than the period within which the committee was meant to release its report. I suppose people have a lack of confidence in the system given this timing.


A previous speaker mentioned that we had been spreading mistruths and misinformation about the time frame allowed. Well, there you have it now on the record: the Superannuation Committee of the Law Council of Australia stated that there was not enough time. Australian public, you be the judge. When you talk about peddling mistruths and misinformation, nothing can ever beat the clanger 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' when it comes to this government spreading mistruths and misinformation.


This is extremely concerning, and I am sure constituents in my electorate of Wright will feel much the same way about it. Remember when we first came to this House? The Prime Minister said, 'We need to open up the blinds and let the sunlight in, let the transparency of this place be divulged.' I wondered where that phrase 'let the sunlight in' came from. I was watching an episode of Yes, Minister, the UK political comic show, the other day and the 'Prime Minister', Jim Hacker, said the very words: 'Open the windows and let the fresh air in.' This is comical, and you can draw parallels from Yes, Minister.


The bill is the third slice of legislation following the recommendations made by the Cooper review, which we are all aware was constructed with the aim of introducing a new, low-cost superannuation product known as MySuper to replace existing default superannuation products. The bill contains a number of what many Australians would deem to be miniscule changes. However, each one of these changes is crucially important. That is why I am proud to represent the people of Wright—because I want to make sure that we get this bill right.


The first part of the bill that I am talking about today legislates to ban conflicting remuneration and entry fees and limits other fees to cost recovery. Under this schedule, a superannuation fund that wishes to offer a MySuper product may not charge members of a MySuper product a fee that relates to a payment of conflicted remuneration. This prohibits the trustee from deducting any amount from a MySuper product that relates to making a commission payment to a financial adviser. And while performance based fees may still be paid to an investment manager in relation to assets of a fund that are attributable to a MySuper product, the trustee must demonstrate that the arrangement promotes the financial interest of MySuper members. This is where my concerns start. To demonstrate this concern, I quote from the Association of Financial Advisers, who stated that intrafund advice will not serve the best interests of clients. They go on to say:


… the payment for personal advice out of an administration fee is a less-than-transparent mechanism and also serves to detrimentally impact the perceived value of any advice that people get. Anything you get for free you do not properly value, and if you can get it for what appears to be free from your superannuation fund then why would you go to a financial advisor and pay for it?


These concerns are very real and indicative of the inadequate examination by the committee. I am appalled that in 2012 we continue to have to address matters such as this.


The next section of this bill looks at new data collection and the publication powers of APRA and requirements for product dashboards and portfolio disclosure. A range of concerns were raised in the inquiry about the practicality of the product dashboard. As stated by the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, there is clear potential for misleading information being supplied on the product dashboard—a real concern. The only consolation I have is that members of the committee have recognised that the legislation lacks clarity about what is required by the dashboard and are recommending greater certainty for industry participants regarding this measure. Unfortunately the recommendation is of little value, as it merely calls for APRA to conduct further consultation with industry; it does not call for any real change to the legislation. I concur with my colleagues in recommending that schedules 4 and 6 of this bill be amended to improve the structure of choice for members moving moneys, in view of the evidence that across many different sectors of the superannuation industry there is strong dissatisfaction about the practical workability of the product dashboard provisions set out in schedules 4 and 6.


The next section of this bill amends the Fair Work Act to ensure a MySuper product can be nominated in a modern award or enterprise agreement. To cut straight to the point of the issue, while every default fund has to be a MySuper product, not every MySuper product will be able to compete freely as a default superannuation fund under modern awards. As a result, the decision on which funds are selected as default funds under modern awards remains therefore with Fair Work Australia through the current widely discredited process.


Even the government had to recognise before the last election that the current process, which heavily and inappropriately favours union dominated industry superannuation funds, is not open, transparent and competitive.


It is appalling that the government of this country admits that their process operates in this manner. I question this, as any normal member of a superannuation fund should: if this system does not perform to standard then it is the member who will suffer, because their money—the money which they are counting on to support them in their retirement—will go towards administration. With this in mind I implore the parliament to use this opportunity to ensure the introduction of genuine competition in the default superannuation fund market by moving relevant amendments to this bill. It is imperative that employers be given the option to select any MySuper product as a default fund for employees who have not chosen a fund. Doing so would ensure genuine choice and competition in addition to assisting to maximise value for employees who end up in a default superannuation fund.


The final aspect of this bill that I want to speak about today is the requirement for existing member balances to be transferred to MySuper products, and the relevant transitional rules. This is a fairly extensive schedule, so I will keep my comments brief. Firstly, the bill casts a very wide net as to which existing member balances held in existing superannuation funds will be required to be transferred into a MySuper product. This means that in many cases members who have exercised a choice will have that choice overridden. Put another way, under the drafting, the government has not distinguished between default and personal—non-default—funds.


The second point I want to make relating to this schedule regards the 'opt-out' mechanism. Funds have until 1 July 2017 to transfer all accrued default amounts to a MySuper product unless the member opts out in writing. By that date the trustee of a fund must contact all members having accrued default amounts and notify them of the proposed transfer of those amounts into a MySuper product. If the member does not opt out by the end of a 90-day period, the trustee is obliged to go ahead and carry out the transfer. This means that, without members being aware that this is happening, the nature of their superannuation product is going to change—and in a material number of cases that change will be adverse to members' interests.


This action by the government is not only somewhat extraordinary; I believe it is also somewhat deceitful. Furthermore, it is disappointing that a government can choose to set such an example to the wider Australian business community. I can only hope that business owners will not take this lead in the way they conduct their own businesses. To finish on this point, I concur with my coalition colleagues in recommending that an amendment be moved to the bill to provide that any amount in respect of which a member has made an active choice is not an accrued default amount and should not be moved to a MySuper product, either within or outside their chosen fund.


In conclusion, it is very easy to see that this government has yet again done the Australian people over. The people of my electorate of Wright, whom I serve with honesty and integrity, deserve significantly better. The government has made every effort to deceive the Australian people through this bill. I conclude with the recommendations of my coalition colleagues. I strongly encourage those on the other side of the House to think carefully about the Australian people who will be affected by this legislation and what it means to them. I do not want the mums and dads and the hardworking business owners of my community to be left behind—everyday Australians who work hard to ensure they have a plan for the future. This is what will happen if we do not make every effort to work together for effective policy.


I encourage the government to withdraw this bill, pending further consultation across the superannuation industry and addressing the serious flaws identified by the inquiry. This in turn will allow for the preparation of a full and compliant Regulatory Impact Statement for the entire bill. If those on the other side of the House choose to proceed with this bill in its current form, then I can recommend that at least they adopt the amendments put forward to ensure that a member who has previously exercised choice of fund, while also opting for the default investment option of that chosen fund, cannot be automatically transferred into a MySuper product by having previous contributions defined as an 'accrued default amount' and that any product which qualifies as a MySuper product is able to compete freely in the default superannuation fund market. We recommend that schedules 4 and 6 be amended or removed for additional scrutiny before this bill is considered.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (13:38):  This is the third tranche of legislation as a part of the government's Stronger and Fairer Superannuation reforms. It includes seven key elements, the first being a ban on conflicted remuneration fees—effectively commissions for MySuper products. It provides an opt-out provision—that is, insurance in the form of life insurance and total and permanent disability insurance should be provided; however, MySuper Fund members can opt out of the provision of such insurance. It increases the disclosure obligations on trustees in relation to their portfolio holdings. It also provides for default placement via awards and collective agreements—that is, when members are placed by default into a superannuation fund it must be a MySuper superannuation fund. It makes it quite clear that defined benefit funds are excluded from these arrangements. It provides for the streamlining of transfer of pre-approved funds into MySuper accounts and it provides better powers for APRA to scrutinise eligible rollover funds.


My colleague the member for Greenway has gone through the background to these provisions in quite some detail. I do not intend in the time I have available to go back over that ground, but I would like to make some observations about another part of the transparency regime of our financial sector—and by that I mean our ratings agencies. Credit ratings play an important role in the Australian prudential regulatory framework. Ratings agencies are companies that charge fees to provide ratings on financial products and organisations. The work of ratings agencies helps to assess financial products. Ratings agencies, including Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, wield enormous financial power, yet they are essentially unregulated. Since the global financial crisis, the work of ratings agencies has come under increased scrutiny. I believe that this scrutiny is appropriate and in fact that there could be, and should be, more done in this area. There is no doubt that many investors, not just in Australia but in the United States and elsewhere, are still feeling the consequences of the global financial crisis and the collapse of investment institutions like Lehman Brothers.


Ratings agencies played a significant role in this crisis and contributed to the housing bubble in the United States by giving risky mortgage backed securities top ratings and underestimating the risk of default and disclosure. While the opinion of these ratings agencies is just that—an opinion—in practice the role these agencies play in financial markets is crucial. This is largely a user-pays system in which the ratings agencies receive income from the fees paid by those who issue certain financial products. I believe that there is a lack of transparency and often conflict-of-interest issues in this system that currently are not adequately addressed by regulation.


There can be no denying that there are many investor victims in Australia and globally because of their reliance on the work of ratings agencies. There have been two recent Federal Court cases that touch on this situation. Earlier this month the Federal Court made a landmark decision with regard to the use of Standard & Poor's AAA ratings in the lead-up to the global financial crisis by finding that the ratings agency was in part liable for the advice and distribution of complex financial products to 13 New South Wales councils. This recent decision came in the wake of an earlier ruling in October—again in the Federal Court—which found the Australian arm of a failed US institution, Lehman Brothers, liable for investment advice to councils regarding other complex financial institutions. I know about this very well, because one council in my electorate, the Wingecarribee Council, lost somewhere in the order of $30 million.


It is good news that the Federal Court made a decision in this case; it means that the council affected will recover some of the $30million loss. While this decision will no doubt be appealed, in the meantime it is important to note some of the findings in this decision. The Federal Court judge found that S&P's decision to give a AAA rating to the financial product was 'misleading and deceptive' and involved 'negligent misrepresentation'. As the judge said: 


The very purpose of a rating is to provide investors with independent information by persons expert in assessing the creditworthiness of an investment so that, by a simple system of letters, an investor can know and compare the creditworthiness of investments.


This is an issue that goes not just to financial products but to governments at the federal and state level as well. Many local government bodies and their ratepayers were essentially defrauded through false and misleading ratings assurances. I understand that it is likely that, following this decision, we will see more court cases.


I raise these issues in parliament today because I believe the time has come for the Australian parliament to play its part in applying proper scrutiny to these ratings agencies and companies—just as we quite rightly bring legislation before this House to ensure that members who are investing their money in superannuation products do so with the knowledge that those products are well-managed and that they have some control, knowledge and information about not only the superannuation fund but also the trustees of those funds and the whereabouts of those investments. That is because Australia's financial system depends on each player adhering to best practice and the highest standards of prudential rigour. I believe that more action needs to be taken in this parliament not only to improve the operation of our superannuation system but also to ensure that the work of credit rating agencies is done within an environment that is properly looking at the enormous responsibility that they have in pricing and in rating the creditworthiness of financial products and government bodies as well. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (13:45):  I rise to express my support for the Millennium Development Goals, which set important targets for poverty reduction by the year 2015. While we as Australians enjoy access to fresh food, clean water and quality health and education services, many in the world do not. In fact, 2½ billion people are denied proper sanitation, 7.6 million children die before their fifth birthday, and 287,000 women lose their life in childbirth due to preventable causes. That is why the Millennium Development Goals make a difference—they focus the international community's attention on the challenge ahead.


The Millennium Development Goals include: halving the number of people living on less than $1 a day; the provision of universal primary education; empowering women and achieving gender equality; cutting the child mortality rate by two-thirds; reducing the maternal mortality rate by three-quarters; reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS, malaria and other fatal diseases; promoting environmental sustainability and biodiversity; and building a global partnership for development.


I am proud that thousands of people in the Kooyong area are doing their part. Many have joined the Micah Challenge, and many churches—such as Hartwell Church of Christ, Hawthorn West Baptist Church, Hawthorn's Immaculate Conception Church, St John's Anglican Church Camberwell, St Hilary's in Kew and St Columb's in Hawthorn—have seen their congregations deeply engaged.


But there is no time to waste. As we approach the Christmas period, when many Australians will enjoy a good meal with their families, we should spare a thought for those millions of people around the world less fortunate than ourselves.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:01):  I move:


That the House express its deep regret at the death on 19 November 2012, of the Honourable Joseph Martin (Joe) Riordan AO, a former Minister and Member of this House for the Division of Phillip from 1972 to 1975, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.


A decade ago, Alan Ramsey spoke of the Whitlam cabinet as 'a dwindling brotherhood'. Over the years, we have farewelled so many—Lionel Murphy, Fred Daly, Jim Cairns, Kim Beazley Sr and Reg Bishop to name a few. In the term of this parliament, it has been our sad duty to say goodbye to Ken Wriedt and Lionel Bowen. Now, with Joe Riordan's passing, the brotherhood grows even smaller. I ask the whole House to join me in honouring one of our own.


It is part of Australian political folklore to designate bellwether seats, those electorates whose capture or loss signal a change of government and a shift in the nation's sentiment. The electorate of Phillip, now abolished, in Sydney's eastern suburbs was one of those seats. In 1972, a 42-year-old unionist called Joe Riordan wrested the seat from Bill Aston, the Liberal Speaker of the House. The Whitlam government had arrived.


Joe Riordan was a member of this House for just three years, his brief ministerial career terminated by the action of his friend John Kerr and his parliamentary career terminated by the disillusioned voters of Phillip six weeks later. Many years later, in 1995, Joe told a conference on the dismissal about that Remembrance Day afternoon:


I went into the House of Representatives. Frank Crean was there speaking. I thought I'd go in and just sit behind him. I took a bundle of letters waiting to be signed and I was signing the letters listening to Frank making his speech to the Parliament. And there was a thump on the seat beside me and 'Himself' appears and he said, ""Don't sign any more letters. You're no longer a minister"".


All those hopes gone at the stroke of a vice-regal pen.


But those three years of service had a purpose as well as spectacular highs and lows. Joe Riordan once said of the Whitlam government that 'it dared to challenge.' It dared to challenge complacency and injustice. It dared to imagine a more vibrant and open Australia beyond the insularity of the Menzies era. Joe Riordan was one of those who paid a high price for the Whitlam government's daring.


Joe came to elected public office after a remarkable two-decade contribution to the Labor movement and he was to make an equally outstanding contribution to the cause of industrial fairness in the three years after he left politics. Joe's place in the union movement began with the Federated Clerks' Union. He was elected assistant secretary of the New South Wales branch at just 22 and headed that union federally from 1958 until his election to parliament in 1972. They were bitter, contentious years in our national life. As a loyal right-winger, Joe no doubt saw himself on the side of the angels. But he also knew that, in the end, the only way was to stick with the Labor Party—and so he did. 


As a loyal unionist and loyal Catholic, Joe had a strong and practical sense of social justice. His view was a simple one and it is shared by everyone on this side of the House: the workforce consists of human persons who are entitled to be treated with dignity and proper respect. Driven by those principles, Joe served in many capacities in the 30 years after his time in politics. Those roles included head of the New South Wales Department of Industrial Relations, Senior Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, chairman of WorkSafe Australia, chairman of the WorkCover Authority of New South Wales and chair of the New South Wales Ethical Clothing Trades Council. His constant preoccupation throughout those decades was the rights of working people, especially industrial safety, and the wellbeing of those in the textile, footwear and clothing industry who suffered such exploitation. These workers had a great friend in Joe Riordan—he spoke for them, he delivered change for them, and they are among the many who mourn his death.


On this coming Sunday, we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government. Joe did not quite make it, but he will be in our hearts as we do. He was born amid the privation of the Depression—an Aussie kid from the inner suburbs of Sydney long before they were trendy. He was educated by the Marist Brothers and did not go to university but rose up, union ticket in his pocket, to be a member of parliament, a minister of the Crown and to hold offices of high public trust for half a century. He did all that with the plain-spoken decency, integrity and constancy of purpose that so characterises his era. That is the generation we are farewelling; that is the brotherhood of which Alan Ramsey spoke, and as they go we are diminished.


On behalf of the government I offer our condolences to Joe's widow, Pat, who he cared for so much during her own long illness, to his six children, to his extended family, to his fellow parishioners and to his many friends. Like them we are proud of Joe's long and full life and saddened by his loss. I commend Joe's memory to the House and to the Australian people.

I feel a certain solidarity with Joe Riordan because before his election to this House he was for many years, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, a senior official of the Federated Clerks' Union—a union that was very dear to many people from those days who are close friends of mine. It was a union that was particularly well respected in those days but, sadly, it has subsequently fallen on much harder times.


As the Prime Minister has said, subsequent to leaving this parliament Joe went on to serve in various capacities in our industrial relations system. He was a good man—he was faithful to his party, he was faithful to his nation, he was faithful to his family and he was faithful to his religion. He was a fine representative of a disappearing breed of Labor man and will be much missed.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (15:19):  Today I am pleased to present to parliament the fourth annual report of the Anti-People Trafficking Interdepartmental Committee. The report provides comprehensive information about Australia's whole-of-government anti-people-trafficking strategy, covering the period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012. As Attorney-General, I have oversight of the strategy in collaboration with my colleagues the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for the Status of Women.


People trafficking destroys the lives of too many women and men around the world every year. Australia is not immune from this insidious form of modern-day slavery. It is wrong, it is a gross violation of human rights, and it is incumbent on us as a government, and the wider community, to do all we can to stamp people trafficking out.


In the last financial year, the government has continued to broaden the focus of its anti-people trafficking strategy to better reflect the scope of the problem. While the majority of victims identified in Australia continue to be women trafficked for exploitation in the commercial sex industry, authorities have increasingly identified both men and women exploited in a range of other industry sectors. Some identified victims were brought to Australia to work in restaurants, receiving little or no pay for very long hours and without rest periods or days off. Others were exploited as domestic workers in private residences, again working without adequate remuneration and with limited freedom of movement.


To ensure Australia's anti-people trafficking strategy remains responsive to emerging issues, its focus has continued to shift from combating sexual exploitation to addressing all forms of exploitation, regardless of industry.


To help combat trafficking in all forms and for all kinds of work, in 2011 the government awarded almost $500,000 to two non-government organisations, two union bodies and an industry association to undertake projects focused on labour exploitation. With support from the government, these organisations are currently working to raise awareness of labour exploitation through the development of training programs and materials, community and industry resources, and through outreach to vulnerable workers.


To further equip law enforcement agencies with the best possible tools to investigate and prosecute perpetrators, in May 2012 I introduced into parliament the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking) Bill. The bill broadens the existing slavery and trafficking offences in the Commonwealth criminal code to ensure all forms of exploitative conduct are captured and criminalised. For example, the bill introduces a separate offence of forced labour and expands the offences of sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting for sexual services so they apply regardless of industry.


I am also particularly proud that the bill introduces new offences criminalising forced marriage. Forced marriage places young people at risk, and can have harmful consequences including loss of access to education, restriction of movement and autonomy, and emotional and physical abuse.


Marriage in Australia must be entered into freely by consenting adults. Coercion, threat or deception to bring about a marriage has no place in a modern Australia and will not be tolerated.


These reforms send a clear message to those who believe they can commit such abhorrent crimes with impunity: slavery, slavery-like practices and people trafficking are unacceptable in Australia, and perpetrators will face serious penalties.


In introducing this legislation, the Gillard government is carrying on the great Labor tradition of standing up for the most vulnerable in society. We will give a voice to those who cannot always speak up for themselves


Strong laws are important, but they need to be enforced. In the last financial year, the Australian Federal Police undertook 41 new investigations and assessments into trafficking-related offences, and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions secured two convictions during the year. Importantly, one of these convictions represents Australia's first successful prosecution for labour trafficking.


Australia also provides a comprehensive range of support services for suspected victims of people trafficking, including tailored case management support and assistance to access accommodation, income support, legal and migration advice, health services and counselling. In 2011-12, the government's Support for Trafficked People Program, delivered by the Australian Red Cross, provided assistance to 77 clients, including nine new clients.


The case study of a woman I will call 'Ms K' is illustrative of a client's experiences on the Support Program. Ms K was trafficked to Australia for the purpose of sexual exploitation in 2007. On her referral to the Support Program, Ms K was provided with secure accommodation, financial support, trauma counselling and medical treatment. As time went on, Ms K was assisted with accessing English language classes and legal and migration advice, including accessing assistance to apply for victims of crime compensation. With help from her Red Cross case worker and counsellor, Ms K has adjusted well to life in Australia and continues to build a secure and positive future. After assisting police, and due to the danger she faced in returning home because of that assistance, Ms K was granted a Witness Protection (Trafficking) (Permanent) visa.


This is just one example of the support that this Labor government has delivered to people who have faced some of the most terrible violations of their human rights.


In 2011-12, 26 of these visas were granted to victims, many of whom have experienced trauma similar to Ms K, and to their immediate family members. These visas allow trafficking victims to remain in Australia permanently if they have assisted with a trafficking investigation or prosecution and, as a result, would be in danger if they returned home.


Fortunately, due to our strong border controls and geographic isolation, opportunities to traffic people to Australia are limited. However, Australia is a destination country for victims of trafficking, in particular for people trafficked from South-East Asia.


While the number of victims in Australia remains low compared with other countries in our region, it is important to remember the devastating effects these exploitative crimes have on individual victims, like Ms K.


In the fight against these crimes there is always more work to be done. That's why the government is committed to working domestically, regionally and internationally, in partnership with other governments and NGOs, to address the full cycle of trafficking, from recruitment to reintegration.


During 2011-12, Australia's collaborative approach to combating trafficking was recognised by the UN Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. The Special Rapporteur visited Australia on a fact-finding mission in November 2011, and presented her final report to the UN Human Rights Council in May 2012. In her final report, the Special Rapporteur noted Australia's role as a regional leader in combating trafficking, and commended the robust working relationship between the Australian government and NGOs. The government looks forward to continuing our productive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur, and is already progressing work on several of the recommendations made in her final report.


As noted by the Special Rapporteur, Australia takes an active role in efforts to prevent people traffickers from operating in our region. In May 2012, Australia co-hosted with Indonesia a Technical Experts' Meeting on trafficking through the Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime. A range of experts from member countries participated in the meeting, including from law enforcement, immigration, legal policy and prosecution agencies. Experts from my department, the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Federal Police, and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship gave presentations at the meeting, and participants shared lessons learned on measures to implement a coordinated approach to combating trafficking.


Australia continues to work with international partners, including ASEAN, to prevent trafficking in our region. Last week, the Prime Minister announced funding of $50 million dollars to support the continuation of the Asia Regional Trafficking in Persons Project (ARTIP) for a further five years. ARTIP aims to strengthen the criminal justice response to trafficking and improve cross-border cooperation in South-East Asia. Since its inception in 2006, ARTIP has trained over 7,000 police officers, prosecutors and judges, providing increased regional capacity to combat trafficking and reducing the opportunities for people traffickers to operate in our region.


As part of the government's ongoing dialogue with NGOs on people trafficking, on 28 November I will convene the fifth annual National Roundtable on People Trafficking in conjunction with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, and the Minister for the Status of Women. Each year, the national roundtable brings together anti-trafficking NGOs, service providers, support organisations and legal, industry and union bodies to implement a whole of community approach to combating trafficking in all its forms. In the fight against slavery, slavery-like conditions and people trafficking, government action is only part of the solution. Members of the national roundtable provide valuable advice to government on emerging issues, including, most recently, on the development of the new legislation.


In tabling the report today, I would like to thank the agencies that make up the interdepartmental committee. This report details the ongoing efforts of Australian government agencies and NGOs in their work to prevent these crimes, to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators, and crucially, to support and protect the victims.


Australia is often called the lucky country. And we may be lucky that Australia does not face the same degree of people trafficking as some of our near neighbours do. But, we cannot afford to rely on luck to stop this insidious trade.


That's why our government has dedicated both time and resources to combat people trafficking in all its forms. It's why we have supported strong laws to deter people trafficking and funded support system to help people in need.


As a society, we have relegated the very worst of large-scale slavery to the history books. It is time to see people trafficking relegated to the history books too.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (15:30):  I am very pleased to respond on behalf of the coalition to the statement from the Attorney-General on the government's response to people trafficking. The coalition welcomes moves to strengthen the law in relation to the people-trafficking offences which were introduced in May. These moves build upon the strong work started under the previous Howard government and continued since the change of government in 2007. We must, however, be careful to ensure that the government gets the balance right and that the people-trafficking net does not unintentionally capture those who do the right thing. 


As this is a government whose record on delivery is littered with failure, blunder and error, this must be one area where the government finally gets it right. We should be careful to ensure that those who operate lawfully and do the right thing are not penalised or discouraged from pursuing lawful options. That is why it is vitally important to get this area of law correct. Trafficking and exploitation are completely unacceptable in any circumstance and would never be condoned by any government or political party. But it is crucial for us to get these policy settings right and not to allow measures implemented to be viewed as a means to pursue other unrelated ends. 


The opposition is well known for its strong stance on all matters relating to border protection. Equally, we have a longstanding interest and record in combating cross-border crime. We therefore welcome opportunities to support any measures to further this aim and to further the important fight against trafficking which has resulted from the roundtable process on people trafficking. The coalition believe that we must not only make laws which criminalise and punish this behaviour but that we must also ensure that we enforce those laws—and that our police, immigration and border protection agencies have the resources to enable them to do that job. We are particularly concerned about sustained and deep cuts to enforcement agencies, including the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, which has been savaged by this Labor government, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Crime Commission—agencies which are integral to the fight against people trafficking and agencies which are going to find it harder to do that job with less money and fewer personnel. 


People trafficking is a complex crime and a major violation of human rights. It takes place for a variety of reasons, including sexual servitude, domestic labour, forced marriage and sweatshop labour. Women, men and children can be victims. While there is limited hard information on the number of people trafficked or on the target industries to which they are trafficked, evidence suggests that the trafficking of women into prostitution is the major, and certainly the most visible, form of trafficking taking place. 


It is widely recognised that people trafficking has become a well-established and, sadly, enormously lucrative business throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Australia, unfortunately, is viewed as a destination country for persons trafficked out of South-East Asia. There are several reports of immigrants, particularly from India, the People's Republic of China and South Korea, who voluntarily migrate to work in Australia but who are later coerced into exploitative conditions. 


I acknowledge the work of the former Howard government in this area. The former coalition government's response to people trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region included developing antitrafficking initiatives between governments and providing aid aimed at alleviating the economic and social conditions in the region which allow trafficking to flourish. In particular, the Howard government and Indonesia co-chaired two regional ministerial conferences on trafficking and smuggling in the years 2000 and 2003—now commonly referred to as the Bali Process. In October 2003, the then coalition government announced additional antitrafficking measures, including a $20 million package to target sex trafficking in particular. The package included a new Australian Federal Police unit, the Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Teams; new visa arrangements for victims of trafficking; victim support measures, including counselling and legal and medical support to be administered by the Office for Women; improvements to legislation to make people trafficking punishable by up to 20 years in jail; and a promise to ratify the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children. Notably, Australia was already a signatory and the treaty was subsequently ratified in 2005. In 2004, the then coalition government produced, in support of the 2003 announcement, an action plan to eradicate trafficking in persons. In the last budget of the coalition government, a further $38.3 million over four years was allocated, including $26.3 million for new initiatives. 


Since then, the coalition has continued to consider the issue a serious one and has supported a range of anti-people-trafficking measures, most of which have a sex-trafficking focus. The AFP's newly renamed Human Trafficking Team remains at the front line in tackling this problem. On behalf of the opposition, I pay tribute to the team—the men and women who work so hard, in very difficult circumstances, investigating trafficking cases and bringing them to court. 


We must remember that, where you find this type of crime, you will find other types of crime. It is vitally important that the Australian Federal Police are properly resourced to do the job we ask of them. I am sure that all members in this place will acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable for even one person to fall victim to the heinous crime of people trafficking. The coalition broadly supports the Attorney-General's statement and believes that Australia has a very important regional leadership role to play in this area. We will continue to support any moves this parliament adopts to combat what is a hideous crime.

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (15:36):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's advisory report, incorporating a dissenting report, on the International Fund for Agricultural Development Amendment Bill 2012.


The International Fund for Agricultural Development is a Rome-based UN agency whose mission is to enable poor rural people to overcome poverty through providing access to financial services, markets, technology, land and other natural resources. After concerns were raised about IFAD in the early 2000s, Australia withdrew from the fund in 2004. This was because, at that time, it was considered that:


IFAD was not delivering cost-effective and tangible returns;


only a small percentage of IFAD programs were located within Australia's priority countries of South-East Asia and the Pacific; and


at that time IFAD did not have a clear mandate or role.


Following various crises during 2007-08—a global food crisis and a fuel crisis as well as the global financial crisis—the government started contemplating the reasons for withdrawal and how this stood in view of Australia's investments in global food security.


In April 2011, AusAID released a report reviewing Australia's engagement with IFAD. The report concluded that there was a strong business case for Australia to rejoin IFAD. The bill was subsequently introduced into the House and is intended to allow Australia to legally accede to the Agreement Establishing IFAD.


The Selection Committee referred the bill to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee and asked the committee to determine whether IFAD had fully addressed the concerns which prompted Australia to withdraw from the organisation and to consider the additional financial and human resources required by AusAID to support Australia's engagement with IFAD.


The committee considers that the various reforms introduced by IFAD since 2004, in part as a response to Australia's withdrawal, have addressed Australia's concerns. Specifically:


IFAD's cost effectiveness has significantly increased;


its programs have become more aligned with Australia's aid program; and 


IFAD now has a clear mandate and role.


Further, by becoming a significant contributor to IFAD, Australia places itself in a prime position to influence the direction of the organisation and maintain its program of reform.


The report also identifies other benefits arising from Australia rejoining IFAD and these should not be ignored. These include:


providing another way to implement Australia's commitment to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification;


providing an opportunity to advocate Australia's position on food security, agricultural trade and development; and


potentially facilitating the ability of South Pacific countries to access funds from the IFAD-administered Global Environment Facility. 


The committee has also concluded that the burden on Australia's projected aid budget imposed by rejoining IFAD is small, and the additional staff employed, in particular Australia's Rome-based counsellor, will be able to promote Australia's interests with the other Rome-based UN agencies.


The committee concludes that there is significant benefit in Australia rejoining IFAD and has recommended that the bill be passed by the House.


In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who provided submissions to the review, and to AusAID, who provided evidence at the public hearing. I would in particular like to commend Hansard, which provided the proof transcript within hours of the conclusion of the public hearing. This enabled the committee to meet a very tight deadline for considering the bill. Finally, I thank my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Sub-Committee—particularly the member for Berowra, who I know has a keen interest in these things—and the secretariat. I commend the report to the House.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.

Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (15:41):  I was not aware that the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was being tabled precisely at this time, but let me say that the report on the International Fund for Agricultural Development Amendment Bill, which was considered by the relevant subcommittee, was not a unanimous report. In fact, there is some substantial dissent in which I and a number of my colleagues have joined, and that dissent really goes to the nub of this legislation that the House will be asked to consider: has the way in which this organisation has been conducted been effectively reformed in such a way as to justify this new decision by the government to rejoin the body and to make substantial financial contributions to it? 


It became clear that some issues had at least been raised, but it seems quite clear to me on the evidence that came before the committee that those issues have not been fully and adequately addressed. For that reason the dissent makes it clear that members of the opposition are not prepared to support legislation that will enable Australia to rejoin IFAD at this time and to commence making significant financial contributions to it. Our view might have been different if the reform process had been completed adequately, but when you find that the international diplomats that are party to a body of this type are ensuring that they and their circumstances are well looked after and that they are able to live in substantial premises in Europe on a very significantly subsidised basis, you do ask where our moneys might be going, particularly when they are our aid moneys that we see as being so very important.


There has been some attempt, but I think it has been marginal at best, to also commit some of the IFAD budget to programs within South-East Asia and the Pacific region, which we regard as being important. There have been some attempts to look at where they might be able to work in the Pacific but I do not think they are what I would regard as substantial commitments at this time and certainly they are not sufficiently substantial to warrant the size of the contribution that we are being asked to make. Those who are interested in the matter might find my remarks more fully spelt out in my more considered comments in the dissenting report, but I thought it was important to indicate that while this report has been proffered, having been sought by the House, and the recommendation is that we should approve the bill, that was certainly not unanimously supported and there was substantial dissent by members of the opposition.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (15:52):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012, a bill which forms part of the third tranche of legislation which purports to implement the recommendations of the Cooper review of Australia's superannuation system. The stated objective of the overall set of arrangements is to introduce a new, low-cost superannuation product, known as MySuper, as a replacement for existing default superannuation fund products. The policy intention is that key elements of the MySuper regulatory framework will be introduced over a series of bills. What the MySuper regulatory framework is supposed to do is to provide for the wide availability of a low-cost superannuation product designed to be suitable, in particular, for those Australians who are not closely engaged with their superannuation.


If that is the broad intention of the legislative scheme and, indeed, of a key provision of this bill, the reality that I want to draw to the attention of the House is that a key aspect of the bill before the House this afternoon is to give effect to the ongoing agenda of the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation to entrench and strengthen the position of certain parts of the superannuation industry—namely, the industry and public sector funds, which are the funds which typically have a heavy union representation on their board. And that, in turn, will tend to weaken the position of other types of funds, particularly corporate and retail funds, and I will explain why that is.


I should hasten to add that the coalition holds no brief for any particular part of the superannuation sector. What we want to see is a competitive industry and a level playing field, because we believe that that is the best way to deliver the best outcomes for members of superannuation funds, and that should be the overriding policy consideration. It is hard, however—when one looks at the range of measures which have been introduced in the MySuper framework and in other things which have been pursued by the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation—to overlook the fact that that the minister is a former director of AustralianSuper. So, too, is Senator Cameron a former director of AustralianSuper, as is the member for Charlton. The Labor candidate for the seat of Melbourne in the 2010 election, Ms Cath Bowtell, is also a former director of AustralianSuper, the largest of the industry super funds. I put it to the House that there is very unlikely to be any other economic entity in Australia which has four former directors who are either currently Australian Labor Party members of the federal parliament or who have sought in recent elections to become Australian Labor Party members of the federal parliament.


I want to make three points in the time available to me. Firstly, this bill would introduce provisions which set aside active choices which many, many Australians have made for their superannuation. Secondly, it does so in a stealthy and deceptive way. Thirdly, I want to put to the House that what needs to be done is for schedule 6 of this bill to be deleted or, at the very least, amended—and the opposition has moved amendments to give effect to this view.


Let me turn firstly to the proposition that what this bill does is to set aside active choices which many Australians have made about their superannuation. The key operative provision of this bill that I want to focus upon would have the effect of mandating that if you have put funds into a product which happens to be a default product of your superannuation fund then the relevant provision of this bill will have the effect of overriding an active choice which you may have made in putting your moneys into that default option.


I refer to the provisions in schedule 6 of the bill. These are the provisions which set out the requirement that existing member balances in superannuation funds are to be transferred into a MySuper product. So the context we are talking about is the way that this bill sets out the limits as to the kinds of superannuation holdings of Australians which will be captured by the provisions of the bill, should it pass into law, and which will thereby automatically be moved from the existing product in which those moneys are held and moved into a MySuper product.


The relevant provision is proposed section 20B of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. This is a section which will be inserted into that act if the bill before the House this afternoon passes into law. That proposed section introduces the new definition of 'accrued default amount', and it is the definition of 'accrued default amount' which determines whether money that you hold in a superannuation fund is required to be transferred into a MySuper product.


The first limb of that definition is relatively straightforward. It is an amount in respect of which you have not exercised an investment choice. The second limb of the definition, however, is highly controversial because it extends to any amounts held in the default investment option of a superannuation fund. Critically, this limb will apply even if you, as a member of the superannuation fund, have made an active choice for that particular option.


Let me give an example to make the point clearer. Imagine your superannuation fund has five options, ranging from 'high growth' at one end down to 'capital stable' at the other end. And let us assume that the middle option is called 'balanced'. Let us also assume that it is the policy of that fund that if you make no active choice your money will go into the balanced option. The key point is that the provision of this bill we are speaking about today will operate in respect of any moneys held in the balanced option.


Some of the moneys held in that fund's balanced option will be there because the members of the fund whose money is in a balanced option have not made an active choice. But, in some cases, members will have made an active choice. They will have actively ticked the form and signed it. They will have ticked the form to choose the balanced option. Yet, as a consequence of the provisions in this bill, their choice will now be overridden. Their money will automatically be taken out of the balanced option and will automatically be put into the MySuper product which this fund is now required by law to provide.


The consequence of this is that people who believe, quite correctly, that they have made an active choice for their superannuation product are to be deemed by this legislation as not having made an active choice and, therefore, their balance will be automatically moved into a MySuper product. Why does this matter? It could matter for a host of reasons. The product into which they are moved may have a very different allocation of risk assets than the one they have chosen. Moving their money into the new product may compromise the continuity of their insurance cover under this superannuation scheme. It may compromise the continuity of their life insurance cover, their TPD, their total and permanent disability cover or their income insurance cover. It may expose them to transaction costs and fees as assets are sold and repurchased in the new fund. It may even potentially expose them to paying higher fees in the MySuper product than in the product they happen to be in right now. There may be all kinds of unforeseen consequences as a result of the policy decision this government has taken which we in the opposition fundamentally disagree with to actively override a specific and conscious choice which a fund member has made.


The second point I want to make is that the bill does all of this in a stealthy and deceptive way. It has been drafted in that fashion and, furthermore, the government has conducted itself in relation to this bill in a stealthy and deceptive way. I will turn firstly to the way that the bill has been drafted. It operates through an opt-out mechanism. That means that if your money is captured by the definition of an accrued default amount because it happens to sit in what happens to be the default allocation of that fund your money will automatically be transferred across to a MySuper account unless you actively respond in writing within a designated 90-day period to a notification from the trustee. In other words, the trustee will write to you and say, 'We are about to move your funds into a different kind of product unless you come back to us and tell us not to do that.' As we all know, it is very easy to overlook communications from your financial institutions. All of us receive many of them every month and every year. The consequence of the way this bill is drafted is that, simply by failing to respond within 90 days, you will have your money moved from an account that you have actively chosen into a product you did not choose. Many Australians who have made an active choice are going to have that choice overridden.


I want to emphasise the point that this provision operates with considerably greater breadth than was proposed or contemplated by the Cooper review into superannuation and with greater breadth than was previously disclosed in prior ministerial statements. I put it to the House that, if this approach were taken by a private sector company seeking to change fundamental terms and conditions of its contract with a customer by writing to the customer and saying, 'Unless you come back to us within 90 days, we will automatically make this change,' the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission would be giving very careful scrutiny to what was going on. I and the rest of the opposition think that the drafting approach that has been taken here is not one that can be defended.


The second way in which this bill is sneaky and deceptive relates to the way the government has acted in developing this legislation. There was a truly deficient consultation process through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. This is a bill that goes for more than 100 pages and makes fundamental and controversial changes to Australia's superannuation system, yet the total amount of consultation that the government permitted was a mere half-day of hearings with witnesses limited to just 30 minutes for each organisation.


Ms Michelle Levy of the Superannuation Committee of the Law Council of Australia had this to say as she described the work of her committee in responding to the parliamentary inquiry:


I will spend one minute on process. We, the committee, spend a lot of time trying to prepare careful responses to legislation and often the time period—and I know it is not just for us; it is for everybody—is just too short. It is not possible to prepare a well-reasoned and thought-through submission in a week. For the trustee obligations bill the submission timetable was shorter than the period within which the committee was meant to release its report. I suppose people have a lack of confidence in the system given this timing.


Unfortunately, this kind of truncated and inadequate consultation process and very, very rushed approach is all too typical of bills brought before the House by the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation.


I want to highlight one particularly deceptive claim in the report produced by government members of this committee. At paragraph 4.5 the claim is made that there are two perspectives on the bill that the House is debating this afternoon: on one hand, the perspective of the retail funds and, on the other hand, the perspective of the industry and public sector funds. That claim is not right, as is evident from reading the submission made to the committee by a major public sector fund, First State Super, which has $32 billion in funds under management. It safeguards the retirement savings of New South Wales public servants.


Here is what First State Super had to say about the opt-out mechanism I described earlier:


… the Fund believes there is increased risk of a claim against the Fund in the event of a future change to these members' investment options, counter to their explicit instructions and acknowledgement.


They went on to note their concern that the automatic movement of balances where members have not made an explicit choice will confuse members and said they will 'not respond favourably'. They said:


First State Super considers it more appropriate that the legislation allow for recognition of members who have made a full or partial investment choice …


The third point I want to make very briefly is that this bill is deficient and the only way to solve it is either to expunge schedule 6 completely or to amend it heavily, and we will move amendments that will have that effect.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (16:07):  I rise to support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you have already been advised, this is one of three pieces of legislation that will be implemented by the government under its MySuper reforms as part of the Stronger Super program. The Stronger Super reform intends to make the process of everyday transactions in the superannuation system easier, cheaper and fairer, to improve the governance and integrity of our superannuation system and to increase community confidence in the self-managed superannuation funds within that sector.


This will be done through the MySuper default product, which all Australians will be able to rely upon. We have already introduced and passed two pieces of legislation necessary for the successful introduction of the MySuper product, the first being the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2011 and the second being the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustees Obligations and Prudential Standards) Bill, which was introduced earlier this year.


This bill is the last remaining aspect in respect of superannuation. It will give Australians access to the MySuper product from 1 July next year. MySuper is a simple, low-cost superannuation product designed to promote lower fees and more efficient superannuation funds with a particular focus on the benefits accruing to members. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would appreciate, MySuper ensures that Australians have a fair system of accumulating superannuation. The standard will be required by regulation and also the types of fees that may be charged. In fact there will be only six types of fees that will exist under the product, compared with the veritable plethora of fees and scales that apply in the superannuation market at the moment.


This is part of a large-scale change to the superannuation system as we know it operating in this country. This government has made many positive reforms in the area of superannuation, including those enabled by the introduction of the mineral resource rent tax, which will provide for the superannuation guarantee to be lifted from nine to 12 per cent. This increase will be transitioned over the next decade, increasing the national pool of superannuation savings from $1.3 trillion at the moment for 8.5 million Australian workers by another $550 billion over the next 20-odd years. That is a significant net increase in the pool of national savings and it is only right in those circumstances that we ensure that that pool is properly regulated and that employees whose money is being contributed to their retirement savings are protected. That is why MySuper is so critical at this point in time. With this pool of savings, we will continue to enjoy being able to invest in capital-intensive and social infrastructure into the future. This increased pool of savings will then go on to benefit all Australians.


Importantly, this superannuation savings pool works to address the issues of Australia's ageing population, assisting those who seek better opportunities in their retirement. After all, that was the very genesis of superannuation itself. I know it has had a rather tortuous history, and I might come to that a little bit later on, but superannuation is an ideal that has been sponsored for most Australian workers by a succession of Labor governments.


Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I will not comment on your age, but I put you in the category of baby boomers such as me. We are taking steps to live longer than our forebears may have done. The truth of the matter is that by the year 2050, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 25 per cent of Australians will be at retirement age. Therefore it is important that we have a pool of savings that provides for retirement. Otherwise, provisioning for the aged will simply fall to the remaining 75 per cent of taxpayers. So it is paramount for our nation's future and for our long-term sustainability to plan ahead, to ensure that we are prepared for those days. We must make appropriate plans for an ageing population and take appropriate steps to ensure that people are able to plan for sustainment in their retirement years. People work hard all their lives. They deserve to have the peace of mind of knowing that they will be able to retire with respect, dignity and comfort.


Low-income earners—and there are many in my electorate—will also significantly benefit from these provisions. In Fowler, some low-income earners fall even below the tax-free threshold, which has now been increased to $18,000. Those people, who are often working in a part-time capacity, will significantly benefit from this. For people who choose superannuation as their preferred saving model, this will ensure that their superannuation contributions are tax free. They will be exempt from the 15 per cent entry fee for superannuation contributions, which ensures fairness for them. This is a much fairer system of taxation on their superannuation. It will also act as an incentive for people on low to middle incomes to use superannuation as their preferred saving model.


I have said that the topic of superannuation is probably foreign to those on the other side, because after all it has been successive Labor governments that have championed it, going back for some time. Labor sponsored superannuation in 1986, when it was a Labor government that took the first steps to allow for award based superannuation. You would recall that, Mr Deputy Speaker. People were able to negotiate with their employers, but this freed up those who were covered by awards so they could go and get provisions and orders out of the Industrial Relations Commission to ratify contributions being made into superannuation. At that stage, it was three per cent. Back then it was effectively only the trade union movement, which was ostensibly covering award based employees, that was in a position to go out and get benefits for those employees in that respect. It did it by offsetting projected pay rises against superannuation. In those days, going back to 1986, various trade unions decided to forgo wage increases with a view to getting compulsory superannuation of three per cent established into their awards.


What followed was that the processes of the Accord established a pattern of superannuation guaranteed for all Australian workers. The significance of that was that it did not matter whether you were in a trade union or not, whether you were a white-collar worker or not; you were going to get the benefits of superannuation. For many, that was probably the first time they had seen anything about a retirement fund being set up in their name. Apart from establishing a system that would allow every Australian worker to benefit from superannuation in their retirement, it also left a platform and a positive legacy for this country in developing a systematic savings pool for all Australians. Following the implementation of that, from 1988 onwards, we now have—I am not sure how many noughts we put on this—$1.3 trillion that has been saved in the names of Australian workers.


The superannuation system in this country has come a long way. When the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted its first survey into superannuation, back in 1974, only 32 per cent of the Australian workforce was covered by superannuation, and that was mainly made up of white-collar employees, managerial staff and state and Commonwealth public servants. Prior to 1974, very few employees had the benefit of superannuation. Since 1988, superannuation has applied to all Australian workers. It started off with the revolutionary three per cent, which was traded off against wage rises, and it is now at nine per cent. With the passage of this legislation, and with the effect of the minerals resource rent tax coming into play, the platform is now set for increasing superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent, which will more adequately provide for retirement incomes for Australians into the future.


We are now at another significant point in the superannuation revolution in this country. We are at a point of securing proper managerial control of superannuation funds, with appropriate transparency vested in those funds and the trustees required to ensure that the rights and privileges of the members of those funds are fully observed and that those trustees are held accountable. It is clear that we want to make sure not only that those funds are well managed but that the members are being appropriately served in this modern and dynamic environment. Through this bill, the government intends to minimise the unnecessary and unfair fees and charges that often make significant deductions to the savings pool of employees. The bill primarily deals with APRA's data collection powers and disclosure requirements, achieving some of the key objectives of Stronger Super. It also ensures that superannuation fund trustees transfer all accrued default amounts of members to MySuper products by 1 July 2017, with an opt-out option. The bill also provides the industry with the information it requires to lodge an application to offer a superannuation product from the beginning of next year.


These are significant developments. This is the third tranche of the Stronger Super provisions to ensure that Australian workers from all industries, from all occupations, have the benefit of security when it comes to their superannuation. The bill establishes rules in relation to fees for all superannuation funds—for instance, there will be a ban on entry and limited exit fees and switching fees and also other fee rules and rule structures. Setting up clear guidelines in relation to fees for all superannuation funds will ensure that members of MySuper products will not pay unnecessary fees and that their ability to make and achieve a choice is not hindered or encumbered by a nuisance fee structure.


It is also important to note that the bill sets guidelines in relation to MySuper products, particularly in respect of life and TPD—total and permanent disability—insurance, again giving safety to those members who find themselves in— (Time expired)


Debate adjourned.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (15:52):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012, a bill which forms part of the third tranche of legislation which purports to implement the recommendations of the Cooper review of Australia's superannuation system. The stated objective of the overall set of arrangements is to introduce a new, low-cost superannuation product, known as MySuper, as a replacement for existing default superannuation fund products. The policy intention is that key elements of the MySuper regulatory framework will be introduced over a series of bills. What the MySuper regulatory framework is supposed to do is to provide for the wide availability of a low-cost superannuation product designed to be suitable, in particular, for those Australians who are not closely engaged with their superannuation.


If that is the broad intention of the legislative scheme and, indeed, of a key provision of this bill, the reality that I want to draw to the attention of the House is that a key aspect of the bill before the House this afternoon is to give effect to the ongoing agenda of the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation to entrench and strengthen the position of certain parts of the superannuation industry—namely, the industry and public sector funds, which are the funds which typically have a heavy union representation on their board. And that, in turn, will tend to weaken the position of other types of funds, particularly corporate and retail funds, and I will explain why that is.


I should hasten to add that the coalition holds no brief for any particular part of the superannuation sector. What we want to see is a competitive industry and a level playing field, because we believe that that is the best way to deliver the best outcomes for members of superannuation funds, and that should be the overriding policy consideration. It is hard, however—when one looks at the range of measures which have been introduced in the MySuper framework and in other things which have been pursued by the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation—to overlook the fact that that the minister is a former director of AustralianSuper. So, too, is Senator Cameron a former director of AustralianSuper, as is the member for Charlton. The Labor candidate for the seat of Melbourne in the 2010 election, Ms Cath Bowtell, is also a former director of AustralianSuper, the largest of the industry super funds. I put it to the House that there is very unlikely to be any other economic entity in Australia which has four former directors who are either currently Australian Labor Party members of the federal parliament or who have sought in recent elections to become Australian Labor Party members of the federal parliament.


I want to make three points in the time available to me. Firstly, this bill would introduce provisions which set aside active choices which many, many Australians have made for their superannuation. Secondly, it does so in a stealthy and deceptive way. Thirdly, I want to put to the House that what needs to be done is for schedule 6 of this bill to be deleted or, at the very least, amended—and the opposition has moved amendments to give effect to this view.

Those people, who are often working in a part-time capacity, will significantly benefit from this. For people who choose superannuation as their preferred saving model, this will ensure that their superannuation contributions are tax free. They will be exempt from the 15 per cent entry fee for superannuation contributions, which ensures fairness for them. This is a much fairer system of taxation on their superannuation. It will also act as an incentive for people on low to middle incomes to use superannuation as their preferred saving model.


I have said that the topic of superannuation is probably foreign to those on the other side, because after all it has been successive Labor governments that have championed it, going back for some time. Labor sponsored superannuation in 1986, when it was a Labor government that took the first steps to allow for award based superannuation. You would recall that, Mr Deputy Speaker. People were able to negotiate with their employers, but this freed up those who were covered by awards so they could go and get provisions and orders out of the Industrial Relations Commission to ratify contributions being made into superannuation. At that stage, it was three per cent. Back then it was effectively only the trade union movement, which was ostensibly covering award based employees, that was in a position to go out and get benefits for those employees in that respect. It did it by offsetting projected pay rises against superannuation. In those days, going back to 1986, various trade unions decided to forgo wage increases with a view to getting compulsory superannuation of three per cent established into their awards.


What followed was that the processes of the Accord established a pattern of superannuation guaranteed for all Australian workers. The significance of that was that it did not matter whether you were in a trade union or not, whether you were a white-collar worker or not; you were going to get the benefits of superannuation. For many, that was probably the first time they had seen anything about a retirement fund being set up in their name. Apart from establishing a system that would allow every Australian worker to benefit from superannuation in their retirement, it also left a platform and a positive legacy for this country in developing a systematic savings pool for all Australians. Following the implementation of that, from 1988 onwards, we now have—I am not sure how many noughts we put on this—$1.3 trillion that has been saved in the names of Australian workers.


The superannuation system in this country has come a long way. When the Australian Bureau of Statistics conducted its first survey into superannuation, back in 1974, only 32 per cent of the Australian workforce was covered by superannuation, and that was mainly made up of white-collar employees, managerial staff and state and Commonwealth public servants. Prior to 1974, very few employees had the benefit of superannuation. Since 1988, superannuation has applied to all Australian workers. It started off with the revolutionary three per cent, which was traded off against wage rises, and it is now at nine per cent. With the passage of this legislation, and with the effect of the minerals resource rent tax coming into play, the platform is now set for increasing superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent, which will more adequately provide for retirement incomes for Australians into the future.


We are now at another significant point in the superannuation revolution in this country. We are at a point of securing proper managerial control of superannuation funds, with appropriate transparency vested in those funds and the trustees required to ensure that the rights and privileges of the members of those funds are fully observed and that those trustees are held accountable. It is clear that we want to make sure not only that those funds are well managed but that the members are being appropriately served in this modern and dynamic environment. Through this bill, the government intends to minimise the unnecessary and unfair fees and charges that often make significant deductions to the savings pool of employees. The bill primarily deals with APRA's data collection powers and disclosure requirements, achieving some of the key objectives of Stronger Super. It also ensures that superannuation fund trustees transfer all accrued default amounts of members to MySuper products by 1 July 2017, with an opt-out option. The bill also provides the industry with the information it requires to lodge an application to offer a superannuation product from the beginning of next year.


These are significant developments. This is the third tranche of the Stronger Super provisions to ensure that Australian workers from all industries, from all occupations, have the benefit of security when it comes to their superannuation. The bill establishes rules in relation to fees for all superannuation funds—for instance, there will be a ban on entry and limited exit fees and switching fees and also other fee rules and rule structures. Setting up clear guidelines in relation to fees for all superannuation funds will ensure that members of MySuper products will not pay unnecessary fees and that their ability to make and achieve a choice is not hindered or encumbered by a nuisance fee structure.


It is also important to note that the bill sets guidelines in relation to MySuper products, particularly in respect of life and TPD—total and permanent disability—insurance, again giving safety to those members who find themselves in— (Time expired)

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (16:52):  I move:


That the amendments be considered immediately.


Question agreed to.




Mr SHORTEN:
  I move:


That the amendments be agreed to.


On 3 November 2011, I introduced the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2012. Australia's superannuation savings pool stands at nearly $1.46 trillion and it grew 13 per cent over the year to September 2012. You hear a lot of doom and gloom in some parts of the Australian media about our superannuation, but the fact our retirement savings grew at a double-digit rate should give Australians confidence.


Last week ANZ launched its new Smart Choice superannuation product, which has been designed with the government's MySuper and Stronger Super reforms in mind. This, together with the ING Living Super launch I attended in September, gives a clear signal that the industry is embracing the MySuper reforms and launching new simple and affordable products.


A bill that provides tax relief for fund mergers—the so-called roll-over relief—has also passed the parliament. This will benefit millions of Australians because it removes a tax barrier that could have prevented otherwise viable fund mergers from proceeding. Again, another win in terms of cost and efficiency.


This was soon followed by the passage of a very significant reform for trans-Tasman relations that will establish trans-Tasman retirement savings portability. New Zealanders who move to Australia will now be able to consolidate their New Zealand retirement savings with their Australian superannuation benefits. Similarly, Australians moving to New Zealand, and New Zealanders returning home, will be able to take their Australian benefits with them, to consolidate with their New Zealand retirement savings. This reform will help the thousands of Australians and New Zealanders who move across the Tasman Sea each year. They will be able to consolidate their retirement savings in their country of residence and avoid paying fees and charges on accounts in the two countries. This will help literally tens of thousands of New Zealanders who moved to Australia in the last year and the 14,000 Australians who have moved to New Zealand.


The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (MySuper Core Provisions) Bill 2012 delivers the government's 2010 election commitment to introduce a new simple, low-cost default superannuation product called MySuper. The MySuper reforms will put downward pressure on superannuation fees and they are a significant step towards enhancing the arrangements for workers' retirement savings. It reflects the Gillard Labor government's commitment to improving the efficiency, competition, transparency and governance arrangements for the superannuation industry.


The bill amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 to provide that trustees are able to apply to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority for authorisation to offer a MySuper product. The bill passed the House on 22 August 2012 and the Senate passed this bill on 22 November 2012, after making some technical amendments to the commencement provisions.


When the bill passed the House it provided that the provisions allowing funds to apply for authorisation for a MySuper product would commence on 1 January 2013, unless an earlier day was fixed by proclamation. In other words, the bill allowed applications to offer a MySuper product to commence from no later than 1 January 2013. However, key requirements for an application to offer a MySuper product are contained in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012. Applications to offer a MySuper product should not commence until that bill has passed. Therefore, the amendments agreed to by the Senate are important as they change the day on which the bill commences to a single day fixed by proclamation, which will ensure that applications for a MySuper product will not commence until those key requirements of a MySuper application in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Further MySuper and Transparency Measures) Bill 2012 have also come into effect. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (16:56):  One of my favourite movies is The Hunt for Red October. There is a great scene at the end of the movie—and Dr Jensen would appreciate it, given his understanding of military issues—in which the Soviets have lost a new class of submarine, which is what The Hunt for Red October is all about. In the scene at the end of the movie the Soviet ambassador goes to the office of the Secretary of Defense, I think it was, and says, 'Mr Secretary, we have lost another submarine.' The Secretary of Defense says, 'Mr Ambassador, are you telling me we have lost another submarine?' and so the conversation goes. Well, here we have another amendment by the government to its own legislation. It is like The Hunt for Red October; it is the search for yet another mistake by the old Soviet Empire—not much different from the current equivalent we have on the Treasury benches today.


The government said that the commencement provisions within the bill state that it will start no later than 1 January 2013, but now they are changing it again; and when the bill becomes an act it will be on the day of proclamation. This is all pretty embarrassing for the government, but it is no surprise really.



I am a little disappointed in the performance of the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. It is not the first time we have had trouble with commencement dates, as we did with FOFA. Now we know that the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation has failed to track his own legislation. He is now creating last-minute amendments in the Senate to a bill that relies on the passage of a bill currently before the House. All of this is to prevent industry from having to rely, for its guidance, on the passage of legislation that is yet to go through this hung parliament. So this is another example of the shambolic nature of the passage of legislation through this place.


I am glad the parliamentary secretary is at the table. He has just put out a media release in relation to unclaimed money. The Treasury Legislation Amendment (Unclaimed Money and Other Measures) Bill 2012 was a bill which, according to him, was absolutely urgent—which had to be rushed through the House of Representatives on the Thursday of the last sitting. On the floor of this House, members clearly illustrated their discomfort with rushing it through. But now the parliamentary secretary has said that the government are making a huge number of changes to the unclaimed money and other measures bill and that they are going to try and ram those changes through. So you can see that the government are a shambolic mess when it comes to legislation. They are constantly amending their own legislation in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. They state to the Australian people that certain legislation must be dealt with urgently and then we find, as a result of the most cursory consideration of a bill before the chamber, that the government have to make further amendments simply to tread water in the passage of their legislation. In relation to the unclaimed money and other measures bill, we will look very closely at the proposed amendments and we will reserve our position.


On this one, however, we are going to save the minister from himself. He tries hard, the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. He really does put in a sterling effort. He gives it his all. He does not quite cut the mustard, but we in the coalition are feeling exceedingly generous today. We try to help this minister through all of these problems. We know that he does not understand.




Mr Shorten:
  That is very generous of you. I will try to improve.




Mr HOCKEY:
  I see it as to our advantage to make him look good at the moment. I am on the 'Bill for leader' campaign and I am trying to do my level best to try to help him look a little bit better. So the coalition is not going to oppose this. No matter how flawed it may be, we think we can live with a change to the commencement date in order to help this minister through yet another bungle which is going to have an impact on Australian business.

  The government is committed to reforming superannuation and we continue to do that. The member for North Sydney, in speaking against the amendment, has challenged the government's bona fides in superannuation. Thank goodness Labor are in government in Australia, because we are the ones lifting superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Thank goodness Labor are in government, because we are the ones reforming financial planning laws so that people can have greater confidence in the advice they are getting. Thank goodness Labor are in government, because we are the ones who abolished the discrimination against people over 70 who are employees—they will be able to get superannuation. Thank goodness Labor are in government, because we are the ones abolishing the tax on superannuation contributions made by people who earn less than $37,000 a year. This last issue falls into the coalition's Bermuda Triangle of policy, where ideas mysteriously disappear into the opposition's policy think tank—if that is not a tautology. What is the opposition's policy on abolishing the 15 per cent tax paid by people who earn less than $37,000 a year? 


Perhaps it is the member for North Sydney's personal philosophy not to always be mindlessly negative, given that they are not opposing this amendment. Perhaps we do see the hand of Hockey here—the hand of North Sydney—cooperating on policies which make sense, which this one does. We will continue to negotiate with industry, we will continue to negotiate with the opposition and we will continue to make our superannuation system the envy of the world.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (20:00):  I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Solomon Islands and Samoa. The membership of the delegation apart from me were the Hon. Peter Slipper, member for Fisher; Senator the Hon. Ian Macdonald, a Queensland senator; Deborah O'Neill, member for Robertson; Senator Claire Moore, another Queensland senator; and the delegation secretary, Nina Markovic. The delegation visited Solomon Islands between 31 July and 5 August 2011, and Samoa between 6 and 11 August 2011. The challenges which Solomon Islands and Samoa are facing today are common challenges for our shared future in the Asia-Pacific region.


In Solomon Islands, we received a comprehensive briefing from the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, RAMSI, about the security situation in Solomon Islands, and we toured their base. The government of Solomon Islands invited the regional assistance force in 2003 to help restore law and order after a period of protracted communal violence and the breakdown of security. The delegation was very impressed with the scope of activities in which RAMSI has taken part over the last few years, and we want to publicly express our gratitude to the remaining Australian troops which contribute to the combined task force. The delegation was made aware that some sectors of Solomon Islands society fear what will happen to the maintenance of law and order after the RAMSI mission is completed over the coming years.


We also learnt about key resource projects in Solomon Islands, such as the country's largest industrial forestry project, Kolombangara, and the Gold Ridge mine, which is managed by an Australian company, both of which the delegation visited.


Solomon Islands is an archipelago country which consists of more than 900 islands. Its population in 2011 was 552,000 people. I observe that it has seen a very rapid increase since the time of independence. Australia and Solomon Islands have a longstanding partnership which is underpinned by growing commercial ties.


One of the areas that we took an interest in was the role of Australian aid in the creation of a national diabetes awareness program in the National Referral Hospital, which the delegation learnt had already had quite some success. However, the conditions in this hospital warrant improvement. There are large waiting lines and a lack of beds for some patients, who were actually lying on the ground. In the remote communities, access to adequate health services remains a major challenge. Malaria continues to be a serious health risk, with dozens of children and adults dying each year as a consequence of this mosquito-borne disease.


In Solomon Islands we also met with women leaders. Women continue to face economic and social barriers to full societal participation in Solomon Islands, including in national politics.


We also welcomed Australia's parliamentary twinning project between the New South Wales parliament and the national parliament of Solomon Islands, which allows practical support through staff placements, training, secondments and hands-on knowledge transfer.


I turn now to Samoa. Its population in 2011 was around 183,000. It has been very stable in the years since independence—and, for someone like me, with an interest in population issues, it was noticeable that Samoa is conspicuously more politically stable than the Solomons, which has experienced much more rapid population growth post independence.


We also learnt about the parliamentary twinning project there. The Tasmanian parliament is twinned with the parliament of Samoa. We appreciated the opportunity to visit Savai'i as well as the main island of Upolu, where we visited tsunami affected areas. We also talked about non-communicable diseases, which are a major issue throughout Samoa.


Australia's interests in Solomon Islands and Samoa are very well served by Australian officers posted from various department and agencies. I thank them on behalf of the delegation. I would like to extend our special thanks to His Excellency Matthew Anderson, the High Commissioner to Solomon Islands, and to His Excellency Dr Stephen Henningham, the High Commissioner to Samoa, and their staff, whose liaison with host institutions and support during our delegation's visit ensured its success.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (20:05):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012 is about motivation.


It goes to what the drivers are behind the declaration of a marine park.


It ensures that any government seeking to declare a marine park can adequately answer the question: why?


Why is this marine park being declared?


It is a perfectly valid question and it is a question the Gillard Labor government cannot adequately answer.


Using the same excuse that was trotted out for the carbon tax—'The Greens made me do it'—simply will not cut it.


It certainly did not cut it for anglers when the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities made the rushed declaration of marine parks two weeks ago.


Jim Harnwell, the managing director of advocacy group Keep Australia Fishing, which represents five million anglers, said: 


There was no scientific rationale behind the government's moves to lock anglers out of 1.3 million square kilometres of ocean. We've been asking for years why we need to be locked out. However, Minister Burke has never yet answered our questions. All we can do is keep asking: Why are you doing this to us?


The best answer that Minister Burke could come up with was this. He said:


Australia's oceans support many of the world's endangered marine animals including the Green Turtle, the Blue Whale, the Southern Right Whale, the Australian Sea Lion and the whale shark.


Well, when dad takes the kids out fishing for the weekend, I really do not know how many blue whales they are going to take home or how they would cook a southern right whale or a sea lion for dinner, but the environment minister can now rest easy in the knowledge that the whales, the sea lions and the whale sharks will be safe from Australia's recreational fishers as long as they stay inside the marine park boundaries that he declared.


I am not actually sure that the minister understands what recreational fishing is all about.


Allan Hansard, the Director of the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation, was quoted in my local newspaper, the Daily Mercury, on November 16, asking this:


What does Mum, Dad and the kids fishing … do to the environment that warrants them being locked out of vast areas of Australian waters, whether the marine parks are five or 500 kilometres from a boat ramp.


He said:


Australia's five million recreational fishers applaud good science based conservation measures that protects our marine environment for future generations …


… However, the Government's Marine Park Plan lacks scientific reasoning and—


there is—


no explanation why Aussie recreational fishers are banned from marine parks.


If peer-reviewed scientific studies proved that a particular species targeted by recreational fishers, or commercial fishermen, for that matter, was an endangered species in the Coral Sea, then fishing families and the rest of Australia could probably understand bag limits and no-take zones.


But the Labor Party and the Greens are kidding themselves if they think locking a relatively small number of fishers out of an area already teeming with fish will make any environmental difference, because fish cannot read maps.


Owner of Mackay Reef Fish Supplies, David Caracciolo, describes the concept of the marine park as fundamentally flawed. He says:


If the idea of a marine park is to conserve the animals or stock in it, to me it is hypocritical …


… A lot of these fish are migratory, you could say we are farming them for other countries to benefit.


What is more, Lance Murray, the President of the Mackay Regional Recreational Fishers, points out the reserves would place pressure on nearby fishing grounds, meaning there would be more competition for recreational anglers.


He said:


What'll happen is commercial fishers are going to be compensated but that'll also add pressure to other areas, which creates a funnel situation.


The minister and his cronies have tried to pretend no-one fishes in the Coral Sea at iconic fishing spots like Marion Reef, because that is 300 kilometres off the coastline.


Well, if no-one fishes out there, if no-one is fishing in these areas, then why are we locking them up?


Here is a dose of the truth—taken from the Nomad Sportfishing Adventures, which takes people fishing out to Marion Reef, one of those areas which is actually going to be locked up. They say:


Throughout each year, we fish the entire 1500 mile length of this reef system, moving between the most remote areas of the reef, to ensure you the absolute best fishing every week.


Nomad's owner, Damon Olsen, says 'travelling way out to Marion Reef on a calm ocean is one of the truly special experiences in the fishing world'.


In his report on a trip to Marion Reef with Nomad, Glanville Heydenrych had this to say about a fishing spot the minister would have us believe no-one visits:


… without a doubt some of the best fishing experiences I have ever uncounted in the Coral Sea and feel blessed to be a part of it, it just makes you hope that we will be allowed to partake in fishing here in the future, trust me this is a place you want to visit and having the government close this beautiful part of Australia due to some political uprising is a disgusting shame to say the least!!! Everybody should have the right to have the opportunity to experience the beauties of the Coral Sea, I am one for sure who would love to go back there …


Mr Olsen, in his blog, apologises for making fishing political, but he goes on to say:


… there are times when you just have to stand up and be counted, as the alternative is to sit back and watch many of the areas you love to fish get closed over the next few months and years.


On one hand, we have the environment minister telling us how important it is to lock people out of the Coral Sea and, on the other, the same environment minister is trying to convince us that the closure is not going to affect anyone because no-one goes out there.


You cannot have this both ways.


In recognition of the fact that some of our fishing industry will be forced to close down, the environment minister is actually putting $100 million worth of compensation on the table—an amount that is widely regarded by the industry as desperately insufficient.


There is no compensation for the businesses behind recreational fishing and an inadequate $100 million on the table for commercials.


If that is all the fishing industry is worth—over a million square kilometres of ocean—then why is it being closed down?


Australia has some of the most underfished waters in the world and closing down our seafood industry will only increase imports from some of the world's most overfished waters. That is the height of hypocrisy.


How does the government determine that to be a good environmental outcome?


Damon Olsen, from Nomad Sportfishing, is all in favour of marine parks if they are done for a reason—for the right reason—which is what this bill before us will ensure.


Mr Olsen says:


All recreational fishing groups support closed off areas, but only when thorough scientific processes have shown that these closed off areas are required. The current process is closing off huge areas to recreational fishermen simply so the government can keep green groups happy and stay in power.


The massive problem that we face here is that Science has long ago been abandoned by the politicians, and they are now playing a game of drawing colours on maps simply to keep the powerful and well funded green lobby groups at bay.


He goes on to say:


I have a first hand example of this from the meeting with the federal environment minister. The current process is proposing to close off the main area of the Perth trench to all gamefishing activities, essentially shutting down the entire gamefishing industry and community in Perth. We asked the minister why this zone had been placed in it's proposed position. We were told that the minister drew that zone himself because they needed one in that area, and there was no information to tell him where to put it, so he just placed it where he thought was appropriate.


That is great! Science by felt pen!


Obviously, this bill was aimed to stop the reckless announcement made by the environment minister some 10 days ago, and some people in this place may have a concern that the declaration of the marine parks will negate this bill.


I want to signal my intention right here and now that, if this bill should reach the consideration in detail stage, I will move an amendment that will negate the declaration of the marine protected areas that was made by the minister earlier this month, and then he would have to follow the accountable processes that are set forth in this bill before the House to create any new marine park in Australia. That would include a range of things, from allowing this parliament to have a say on it by making it a declarable instrument and by also ensuring that there are community stakeholder advisory groups set up so that there is real consultation on this, not the fake consultation that the minister has put forward. There would also be scientific review panels established to assess the conservation value. All of these things are in this bill.


I would urge particularly the crossbenchers, who might think that this matter is put to bed with the minister's declaration, to think again. They still have the ability to negate what the minister has done. Instead of having marine parks based on the extreme green agenda and science by felt pen, they can be based on real science with real consultation, real accountability and real transparency, and this parliament can make decisions as it is created to do. Hopefully this bill will be accepted by this parliament. Hopefully this bill will restore balance. Hopefully this bill will make the marine parks process accountable, as it is intended to do.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (20:15):  I rise to speak in opposition to this proposed bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012, which represents a continuation of the coalition running interference on what is an historic achievement by the Labor government in announcing the final network of Commonwealth marine reserves.


I want to congratulate the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Minister Burke, who, on 16 November, announced that Australia's precious marine environments have been permanently protected, with the proclamation of the world's biggest network of marine reserves—that is, more than 2.3 million square kilometres of ocean environment. The declaration of these new marine reserves delivers on an election commitment and represents a major achievement for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of Australia's oceans. Australia's oceans support many of the world's endangered marine animals, including the green turtle, the blue whale, the southern right whale, the Australian sea lion and the whale shark.


In May this year, a number of us in parliament were fortunate enough to hear an inspiring address from the author Tim Winton about the importance of marine parks. It reinforced my view that this is an opportunity for us as a parliament to do great things that future generations will be proud of. I would like to share with the parliament what Tim Winton had to say about this issue. It is important to highlight it to negate some of the short-sightedness of the bill before the House and because I cannot improve on Tim Winton's words. Tim himself is a very keen recreational fisher. He says that fishing is in his blood. Indeed, my own father, Allan, and my brothers Lex and Daryl are keen fishermen. Tim Winton says:


During my own lifetime the world's oceans have suffered a terrible decline. I've read about it. And I've seen it up close and ugly. When I lived in Greece I saw the results of oil spills, dynamite fishing, lax regulation. I've surfed in raw sewage in Indonesia and putrid medical waste in Brazil. And I've wondered: am I swimming in the future? … The global trends aren't great. Collapsing fisheries, dying corals, gyres of plastic the size of entire countries, catastrophic oil spills that ruin the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of fishing families and poison the food chain for decades.


Okay, I tell myself. All this is happening abroad, in someone else's ocean. But we're not immune. Not after the Montara spill. Not when a recent spike in sea temperature caused a mass kill of abalone on the mid-west coast and shut down the fishery until further notice …


Many of my neighbours are commercial fishermen. Lots of my friends are marine scientists. They don't always agree with each other, though they're all passionate about Australia's seas and want to do what they can keep them healthy. But none of them is telling me that things are getting better and better here at home.


… I don't think we'll pass on a dead ocean. I can't think that. … We have comparatively decent fisheries management and many good fishing operators. Still, consumption only goes up and the resource doesn't get any bigger. We all know we're pushing the ocean too hard. And the pressure to relegate marine protection - to defer it - that pressure is intense. And the balance is not in the ocean's favour. Taking a loss has become business as usual. Where else, in what other field, would mediocre outcomes be so acceptable?


We have to stop spending beyond our means. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Otherwise we'll be the generation - the richest, most mobile and well-educated generation in Australia's history - that passes on a dud inheritance, and leaves the estate in arrears. Bequeathing a loss to a family, a community, a nation, that's a despicable thing to do. …


The great news is we haven't blown it yet. We still have incredible assets to reserve and build upon: immense underwater canyons and sea mounts, fringing reefs, barrier reefs. Remote archipelagos teeming with birds and turtles. Precious inshore habitats, breeding grounds. Intricate coral atolls that are thrumming engines of oceanic life. These miracles of nature are our good and great fortune. They aren't just sources of protein. They're also food for thought, fields of scientific discovery. They are reservoirs of life inextricably entwined with our own. Because the health of the sea determines our human future. Yes, we have compromised great ecosystems already. We've made mistakes. And we've improved our game. But there's a gap between our aspirations and our achievements when it comes to stewardship. We must do better. We will do better. If we act now.


…   …   …


Commonwealth waters are public assets. The family silver. Silver that moves, breathes, swims. If you've ever swum in a school of trevally or barracuda or anchovies, you'll know what I mean; it's like being Scrooge McDuck rolling around in the vault. These riches are entrusted to government by the people. That trust, gravity of the task, has come into sharp focus in recent years. And in the past decade, in a groundswell of public consciousness that I simply didn't see coming, citizens have begun to expect a new level of accountability in marine stewardship. Why the sea? Well, because as much as they love the bush, Australians spend more time on the water. And they travel abroad – especially to places where they swim and surf and fish. Like me, I guess, they've come to see what we stand to lose. What the worst future looks and feels and tastes and smells like. So they value their marine inheritance much more consciously and vividly than you may realize. They expect the managers of their marine birthright to act prudently, conservatively. Which means they expect proper fisheries management. They want to know there are genuine limits to the incursions of oil and gas, that a marine system is at least as important as a coal-mine, or a port. Most importantly they expect government to hold significant marine assets in reserve by way of parks and sanctuaries. Where people can visit but not extract anything.


There's a precedent for this, one that makes sense to ordinary people. Generations ago, when our nation was far less prosperous, far less educated, far less certain of its place in the world, our forebears set aside habitats and ecosystems on land in the form of national parks and reserves. Pretty brave at the time. This was their gift to the future. The kind of sacrifice Australians instinctively understand and celebrate. You and I inherited the fruit of that enlightened impulse. We enjoy the work and the courage of those Australian thinkers and legislators who came before. And now, from the fringes of our cities, from the very hearts of our cities in some instances, right out to the interior, there are wild places to which we can take our children, where we study, or simple stare in awe –because someone fifty, sixty, seventy years ago was visionary enough, decent enough, and courageous enough to make it happen, to reserve a share of the family silver for us. You and I are connected to those visionaries by that patriotic impulse, that love of country, that love of family.


So now in 2012 we're on the cusp of achieving something like that in the sea. A system of marine parks for the nation. A network of representative ecosystems reserved for conservation purposes. It's the outcome of a process that's not owned by any narrow political interest. It's taken years of study and consultation, been overseen and supported by governments, both Liberal and Labor. It has the potential–if we hold our nerve and follow through—to be one of the great moments of marine stewardship. Of environmental responsibility. But also one of the great moments of Australian patriotism when our belief in the common good shines through, when we show our higher selves to our selves and to those unborn.


…   …   …


And neither should it be contentious, although I know there have been attempts to make it so, to make something unifying into something divisive. But the principle of marine parks has taken hold. You know that when more than 100,000 citizens make submissions in support of them, urging members of parliament to stay the course and reserve these parks, that something's going on. 


…   …   …


A decade ago, 15,000 citizens encircled the CBD of the city of Fremantle to spare a coral reef most Australians had never heard of, and Ningaloo is now on the World Heritage list. Since then support for marine parks has only grown. It's geographically widespread, spans all age groups, and is non-partisan. …The people asking for marine parks understand this for what it is: good housekeeping, prudent management, a future for their kids. And I think legislators ignore this tidal change at their peril.


I conclude by paraphrasing Tim Winton by saying that 'this is a genuine legacy moment'. When your grandkids ask, 'What did you do as a member of parliament?' tax reform might do it, or that parliamentary committee. But in that rare moment when a little kid looks up at you with a flicker of interest or even a moment of admiration, my money is on the dolphins and on the marine parks.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (20:26):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012, and I proudly support my good friend and member for Dawson. I would like to take up a couple of points made by the member for Wills. I do not think that anyone could possibly doubt his love for the environment and that sort of thing. Before the Montara spill—before they put that well there—the Australian Institute of Marine Science surveyed that entire place. They put good baseline research into the place. After the spill was cleaned up they went back to see what damage there was. There was none. That is good science. That is knowing what is out there and knowing what is at risk. That is knowing that, if there is damage, what there is to clean up. The green zones established over the reefs in North Queensland and along the coast were based on science. They did not make a lot of people happy, but they were based on good science. They have been proved to be successful. It was a great effort and the environment has no greater friend than Liberal governments. I would say to the member for Wills: 'You can't have it both ways. You can't trot Tim Winton out to say we are fishing out the place and then stand beside the minister who says, ""It is so far out, no-one can even get out there"".'


It just goes to show how duplicitous and shifty this government is that they will change the argument to suit the audience. That is what bothers me most. The problem with this argument is that when you say to someone in Melbourne that we should protect the sea, all you see is sea; that is the mental image, and there is nothing on top of it. You do not see anything underneath, you do not see the jobs that go with it, because they are all on the land. If you say to people that we have to protect forests, people immediately see roads, trees, chainsaws, trucks, towns. They see all the implications of making those sorts of decisions. That is the problem with this decision.


We held a forum—the first of many, I believe—in relation to this proposal and what has come to pass. I do not mind a bet and at that time I said that I would take any money that the area marked out by the felt pen on the Coral Sea would be exactly where the marine park would go once the consultation period ended. We have seen exactly that happen. We have now seen the Protect the Coral Sea campaign up the ante and call for even more closures closer to Cairns—more closures of reefs and fishing areas to shut down further industry. At that fishing forum there were a number of resolutions passed. First and foremost was the one about recreational fishing as a lifestyle issue for North Queenslanders. It is a right to be protected.


The Coral Sea Marine Park is a long way from Townsville, but this government has shown a willingness to go back on anything it says before an election. At every turn this government does something to suit itself at the expense of the recreational fisher. We campaigned in 2010 to say that a vote for Labor was a vote to close down the Coral Sea, and the Labor candidate at the time said, 'No, it's not,' and poked me in the chest and swore at me on the radio. But it has come to pass that exactly what we said would happen has happened.


Science should be the guide to the establishment of a marine reserve off the north coast of Australia. Any decision to establish a marine park should be overturned by a subsequent government until the scientific case for its establishment can be made. That was the second resolution passed at the fishing forum, and it was passed unanimously by the people who were there because that is what they care about. This government talks about science and various causes, but the Australian Institute of Marine Science has a $120 million boat down at the marina in Townsville with no fuel to run it on and no operational funding—the operational funding has been cut. At the fishing forum we asked that artificial reefs be established in yellow zones where there would be one rod, one angler and one hook. At the fishing forum we even passed a resolution that no anchor could be used and that fishers would just trawl or drift across the place. We asked for a science based review of the green zones to make sure that they were working as well as we suspected. We also wanted to make sure that the Coral Sea is protected. The greatest protector of the Coral Sea and marine parks in general is the weather. If the wind is blowing at between five knots and 10 knots, everyone is going out for a fish. But, if it is blowing stronger than 10 knots, no one goes out. You can go eight, 10 or 12 weeks without a fish up there.



Work needs to be done to change the negative perception of North Queenslanders as recreational fishers. (Time expired)

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (20:31):  I rise to speak in opposition to this bill, which would put the hugely significant marine conservation outcomes that this government has achieved in partnership and in trust with the Australian community at threat. For anyone to sensibly support the legislative amendments that this bill contains they would need to agree with its underlying premise, which is that the government's secured set of marine reserves has been achieved without the benefit of appropriate scientific data and analysis, without independent economic impact assessments and without the guidance of appropriate stakeholder and community consultation—and that is, frankly, a ludicrous proposition.


In an article published on 27 August this year and titled 'Marine reserves not about closing fisheries, but about preserving ocean health', Dr Nic Bax, Stream Leader, Understanding Ocean Ecosystems at CSIRO, and Dr Ian Cresswell, Director, Wealth from Oceans Flagship at CSIRO, concluded with the following:


The CMR network and marine bioregional planning herald a substantial change in the way Australia manages its marine environment. The potential impacts extend well beyond fishery management.


Importantly the marine bioregional framework provides a clear and consistent framework for Australia that will help make future management decisions and help focus the social, economic and environmental research to support those decisions. It will set clear and measurable objectives within a clear reporting process. This will provide the impetus and direction for science to reduce the uncertainty about whether we are achieving those objectives and the broader goals they serve.


Australia provides world leadership in the policy and science of marine ecosystem management and is likely to be one of the few countries to achieve the international commitment made at Rio+10 in 2002 to develop a representative system of marine reserves by 2012.


Last week the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities sealed one of the greatest environment achievements in Australian history when he proclaimed the network of marine protected areas, including the south-west marine bioregional area. That proclamation, long-sought and hard-won, represents a marine and environmental legacy for future generations unparalleled in our history.


The marine bioregional plan is a reform that has been painstakingly achieved. Like many members of this place, I have personally worked with professional and recreational fishers in my electorate to facilitate their input and to help them seek refinements in the protection scheme to ensure that the marine conservation outcomes achieved were at their highest without having unnecessary impact on fishing and other uses. I have also worked extensively with marine scientists and marine conservation advocates to argue for improvements to early versions of the network, which simply did not provide enough protection in some areas.


In considering the economic impacts, the government's 2011 fisheries adjustment policy very clearly set out the assessments required for the establishment of marine reserves. The policy is wholly consistent with the coalition's 2004 policy. Under the adjustment policy, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, ABARES, was engaged to prepare independent socioeconomic assessments for each proposed marine reserve. The production of the assessments involved data collection and consultation, including the creation of industry reference groups. All the ABARES reports are, of course, publicly available. The government acknowledges that the creation of the reserves necessary to properly protect Australia's range of unique and precious ecosystems and our marine biodiversity, which has already suffered significant losses, will involve some economic impact and that those affected must receive appropriate assistance.


On a side note: I am pleased to see that the Centre for Policy Development has produced analysis showing that the proposed Commonwealth network of marine reserves will cover an area that delivers $1.2 billion dollars in what is termed 'ecosystem service value' based on estimates derived using a UN environment program study. This value is not currently recognised in our economic models or analysis.


The proclamation of the new marine protected areas by the minister on the Friday before last was welcomed by tens of thousands of Australians, and I received letters or emails from approximately 750 constituents who wanted to support and reinforce the importance of this historic reform. The new marine reserves increase the Commonwealth network of protected areas to 2.3 million square kilometres. In WA these areas include critical feeding and birthing zones for the blue whale. They cover the Perth Canyon and the Abrolhos, the Recherche Archipelago, Geographe Bay and the Naturaliste Plateau. Many of these environmental wonderlands—or 'wonderseas'—have been zones of legend in WA for years, but some of them are even better known and regarded now, especially by young people in my electorate, as a result of the thorough marine protection process that we have been through.


The principles and the framework for protecting Australia's ocean ecosystems through the marine bioregional planning process are robust in themselves. They have been improved since their operation under the former government. They are fit for the purpose of securing the environmental legacy that future generations deserve. As our own experts at the CSIRO note, they are world-leading. The Member for Dawson's proposed changes to the legislative provisions of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act are unnecessary, unjustified, inconsistent and costly, and they cannot be supported.(Time expired)

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (20:36):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill. Quite frankly, the process under which the Coral Sea marine reserve was declared last week is an absolute disgrace. For generations this resource has been fished in a totally sustainable way; the fact that the area is now judged worthy of being a marine reserve is testament to that.


The bill would require the environment minister to fulfil four requirements before declaring an area a marine reserve. Firstly, he must commission an independent social and economic impact assessment so that the government and affected communities are fully aware of the long-term ramifications. What concerns me is that even before ABARES had completed its socio-economic report on the impact of the MPA, Ministers Burke and Ludwig—clairvoyants that they are, and we have seen that more recently with the live trade debacle—announced a nationwide assistance package in the vicinity of $100 million.


In Cairns we have a very well-regarded, experienced and independent economist named Bill Cummings. Earlier this year, Mr Cummings was commissioned by Cairns Regional Council to examine the economic impact of declaring the Coral Sea as a marine reserve. What became immediately evident on seeing his findings was how short-sighted this government has been in only assessing the immediate economic impact on commercial operators. They have not considered the flow-on effects to businesses further down the chain, the likely future growth and opportunities forgone in the future, the management cost impacts and the losses to post shipside activity. On the other hand, Mr Cummings has and what he found is quite frightening. By looking at these other impacts, and extrapolating them over 30 years—that is a standard economic forecast—he has come up with a cost, just for the Cairns region, of $1 billion. That is a billion dollars in a region with one of the highest unemployment figures in the country, contributing to the economic black hole that Labor has already got this country into over the past five years.


Secondly, this bill requires the government to obtain scientific peer-reviewed and publicly available advice before making any proclamations. There is no denying the fact that the government cannot produce any scientific evidence to show a threat from fishing activities to species in the Coral Sea. Just as with the last-minute banning of the MV Margiris, this government continues to ignore science. Take a look at this article from the Cairns Post on 20 November celebrating the fact that overseas buyers are 'lining up to take product from the Northern Prawn Fishery after its sustainable certification by the Marine Stewardship Council'. Gaining this certification is no mean feat. It proves that the operators in this fishery are using world's best practice to harvest their catch sustainably with less impact on the environment and on the by-catch. So what does this government do? It takes this certification and rubbishes it by declaring the Coral Sea as a marine reserve, shutting down 20 per cent of the Northern Prawn Fishery. What about the millions these operators have invested and the thousands of jobs they support? I just shake my head in disbelief.


The third requirement of this bill is that the government must establish independent reference panels and stakeholder groups in each region to ensure rigorous decision making. What does that mean? It means no more whistle-stop tours where the minister has already made up his mind; it means no more backhanded swapping of areas to keep marginal Labor MPs out of the firing line; it means no more playing industry groups off each other, bargaining with boundaries to buy support; and it means no more bowing to the pressure of gan-greenous overseas lobby groups, like the PEW foundation, who do not have the courage to take on the polluters and the over-fishers in their own waters.


Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this bill will put parliament in charge of final decisions by making declarations disallowable, scrapping the carte blanche powers that the minister clearly has abused.


To close, left as it stands the Coral Sea marine reserve is a failure for sustainability, it is a nail in the coffin for family owned businesses and it is a death knell for highly exploited species in Third World fisheries. This bill, put up by the member for Dawson, will instead provide a framework of accountability and transparency around the creation of marine reserves, and that is why I wholly support it here today.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (20:41):  I join my colleagues the member for Wills and the member for Fremantle in speaking against this private member's bill. As my colleagues have already pointed out, on 16 November environment minister Tony Burke proclaimed that 2.3 million square kilometres of ocean environment would be permanently protected and that new management plans for those areas will come into effect in July 2014.


The proclamation follows a lengthy public consultation process during which some 80,000 submissions were received. As part of that public consultation process, the public had the opportunity to put forward their views on the marine reserves proposals during 90-day public consultation processes in each region, at the 245 stakeholder meetings held around the country and during the most recent 60-day consultation on the final proposal. To say that this was a decision made by the minister without any consultation and without any consideration for those impacted by it is simply incorrect. The facts speak for themselves. In fact, I know this process has been ongoing for two or three years at least, if not longer, so there has been plenty of time for communities around the country to put their points of view forward to the minister, and in fact those points of view have been heard as part of the final outcome of that consultation process.


I understand that current arrangements for industry and recreational fishers will remain in place until the new management plans take effect, in July 2014. This means that there is still over 18 months to go before the new plans come into effect. Again, that is in order to give communities time to transition. In his speech on 17 September on the second reading the member for Dawson claimed that the minister's declaration was 'not the result of rigorous scientific analysis', that there has not been 'extensive industry or community consultation', that the government has 'not engaged in proper consultation' and that the government has 'no consideration for Australia's fishers or the coastal communities'. Furthermore he stated that the government has 'failed to understand the importance of recreational fishing' and has 'failed to consider the important economic contribution that recreational fishing makes to coastal communities'.


I reject all of those assertions and in fact, as I outlined a moment ago, the extensive consultation process the government has undertaken as part of the announcement made by the minister on 16 November simply dismisses all of those claims. The member for Dawson, through his bill, wants the minister to commission an independent social and economic impact assessment before any proclamations are made. His bill will also require the minister to obtain independent scientific peer reviewed advice. As the member for Fremantle has already pointed out, the current proposals were the subject of a considerable amount of scientific advice.


The member for Dawson's bill will also require:


… that the Government establish an independent scientific reference panel as well as a stakeholder advisory group so that decisions are made with rigour following extensive consultation and analysis of the possible scientific and social impacts of any proposed marine protected areas.


What the member for Dawson is really saying is that he wants to make the process so cumbersome that it will be difficult to implement—if indeed implementation ever occurs. In other words, he does not want anything to happen and he wants to make the process cumbersome to ensure that is exactly the outcome—that nothing will ever happen. 


He also implies that the scientific advice provided in the existing process by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and other marine science centres is unreliable and that we cannot rely on it. I reject that assertion. I have spoken to some of the scientists who deal with marine issues for this country and I have nothing but praise for, and confidence in, their work. They were the very people who provided advice to the government in this process and who, at the very least, would have had the opportunity to make their own submissions. To suggest we need to have additional scientific advice is, in my view, suggesting that we should not rely on the scientists who have contributed so far.


There is another element of the member for Dawson's plan which concerns me. It says that the parliament should make the final decision. On the one hand, he is saying that we should have all of these experts—peer reviewed expert advice—on the panels. But, on the other hand, he says that their advice can be ignored. He says that the parliament, a group of nonprofessionals, should make the ultimate decision. Why would we get that advice if it is not needed? (Time expired)

I support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012 introduced into the chamber by the member for Dawson. I acknowledge the passionate way he has represented his constituents since his election to this House. This bill proposes to insert a process into the EPBC Act to ensure that, prior to the declaration of any marine protected areas, the relevant minister will be required to commission an independent social and economic impact assessment before any proclamations are made.


The bill has become necessary because of the way the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, has gone about the latest designation of the marine protected area in the Coral Sea. The consistent feedback—it has been consistent every step of the way—from stakeholders has been that the current process of establishing marine park boundaries completely failed to include any genuine consultation and failed to recognise that Australian fisheries are amongst the healthiest and best managed in the world—as highlighted in the latest Commonwealth fisheries status report released in November 2011.


The government has not engaged in proper consultation—their approach has been take it or leave it. There has been no consideration for Australian fisheries or the coastal communities which rely very heavily on this industry. There are also major concerns about the rigour and consistency of the science used to determine particular boundaries of proposed marine parks. 


Let me make one point very clear, however. The coalition does support the designation of marine parks and marine protected areas. We have a very strong record on this. When it comes to the protection of our fisheries and environmental sustainability, we have a strong and long record. One of the things that I was most proud of as a member of the Howard government was the effort which resulted in the establishment of 11 marine protected areas. That included, in July 2004, a new zoning plan for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which increased the areas protected from extractive activities from 4.6 per cent to 33.3 per cent of that park. These declarations were achieved with broad community and industry support. This demonstrates that it is possible to implement marine park zones with the support of both the scientific community and the other communities involved. It was a stepped and staged process involving those communities all along the way.


I see the petition has arrived now and I plan to table it in just a little while.


This government has displayed a total lack of consultation. It is exactly the opposite of what we did in government when we first implemented the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. That is why this bill is necessary. It is necessary to give the industry and the communities confidence that decisions which governments make on the basis of environmental protection are genuinely made on those grounds alone—not based on some political ideology.


As set out in the explanatory memorandum, this bill will require the relevant minister to commission an independent social and economic impact assessment before any proclamations are made. The bill will require the minister to obtain independent scientific peer reviewed advice that is made publicly available. It will also require the government to establish an independent scientific reference panel, as well as a stakeholder advisory group, so that decisions are made with rigour following extensive consultation and analysis of the possible scientific, economic and social impacts of any proposed marine protected areas. Finally, the bill will put parliament in charge of final decisions by making declarations disallowable by the parliament.


I again remind the parliament of the very high levels of sustainability already observed by our fishing industry. As someone who has worked in this industry, I can endorse the view that Australia's fisheries are amongst the best managed in the world. (Time expired)

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (20:51):  Australians know how fragile our marine life is and how important it is to protect it. We have completed a final network of Commonwealth marine reserves, and these will be managed to protect the unique biodiversity found in them, which is important for sustaining natural resources in the area. We think it is particularly important to do this. Those opposite in this chamber are simply opposing that which they previously had some commitment to when they created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park back in 2006. Those opposite are no longer the party that was led by the member for Wentworth, that is for sure, and their opposition today goes to show just how narrow-minded they are. 


The purpose of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill is to stop, not simply delay, what we are doing. Those opposite are proposing in this legislation to create up to 88 regional committees for a period of two months to provide input into any future proposed marine reserves. This is economically stupid. They claim there are almost no financial implications for the Commonwealth. Those opposite simply do not get it with respect to protection of the environment. The member for Leichhardt talked about what the Cairns Regional Council did in commissioning a report from a local consultant which purported to show a $1 billion net economic impact on the Cairns regional economy, but flawed assumptions, deliberate misrepresentation and exaggeration of the federal Labor government's proposals underlayed that analysis. They ignore the fact that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences were engaged to prepare an independent socioeconomic assessment for each of the proposed regional marine reserve networks. ABARES established reference groups with industry organisations, fisheries managers, fishing entitlement holders and fishing businesses, and those reports are publicly available on the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities website.




Mr Katter:
 Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was a member of the government party when this was done, and I claim to have been misrepresented. He is saying that the Liberals are opposed to the national park proposals. The Liberals closed down the entire fishing industry in North Queensland.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Symon
):  There is a time and a place for that. The member for Kennedy will resume his seat.




Mr NEUMANN:
  Those opposite are making all sorts of alarmist claims about financial Armageddon for the fishing industry, but that is at odds with what ABARES has had to say. The ABARES socioeconomic impact assessment predicts the value of the commercial fisheries catch displaced by the new marine reserves will be $11.1 million, which represents about one per cent of the annual value of catch, gross value of production, and about 103 jobs. That is what ABARES has had to say. They have run off with all sorts of scare campaigns. Senator Boswell has been talking about this, and we have had statements in the past by the member for Wentworth and the member for Curtin about it too. They will say one thing when they are in the capital cities of Australia about their commitments to marine parks but they will say another thing when they are up the coast of Queensland.


One thing that needs to be put on the table is how close the green zones and the new Commonwealth marine reserves are two towns along the Queensland coast. It is important to put this on the public record. Those opposite would have you believe that estuaries and lakes and beaches are all at risk, and that any person who gets in a tinny will be at risk when they leave Cairns and places like that. From Bundaberg, for example, the distance to the nearest marine park zone is 490 kilometres. From Brisbane it is 410 kilometres to the new Central Eastern Commonwealth Marine Reserve; Mooloolaba is 480 kilometres from that reserve—




Mr Katter:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is an outrageous misconception that the member for Blair is perpetrating on the House. The green zones stop almost all recreational fishing in Queensland.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. The time allotted for this debate has expired; the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2012-11-26,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (20:05):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012 is about motivation.


It goes to what the drivers are behind the declaration of a marine park.


It ensures that any government seeking to declare a marine park can adequately answer the question: why?


Why is this marine park being declared?


It is a perfectly valid question and it is a question the Gillard Labor government cannot adequately answer.


Using the same excuse that was trotted out for the carbon tax—'The Greens made me do it'—simply will not cut it.


It certainly did not cut it for anglers when the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities made the rushed declaration of marine parks two weeks ago.


Jim Harnwell, the managing director of advocacy group Keep Australia Fishing, which represents five million anglers, said: 


There was no scientific rationale behind the government's moves to lock anglers out of 1.3 million square kilometres of ocean. We've been asking for years why we need to be locked out. However, Minister Burke has never yet answered our questions. All we can do is keep asking: Why are you doing this to us?


The best answer that Minister Burke could come up with was this. He said:


Australia's oceans support many of the world's endangered marine animals including the Green Turtle, the Blue Whale, the Southern Right Whale, the Australian Sea Lion and the whale shark.


Well, when dad takes the kids out fishing for the weekend, I really do not know how many blue whales they are going to take home or how they would cook a southern right whale or a sea lion for dinner, but the environment minister can now rest easy in the knowledge that the whales, the sea lions and the whale sharks will be safe from Australia's recreational fishers as long as they stay inside the marine park boundaries that he declared.


I am not actually sure that the minister understands what recreational fishing is all about.


Allan Hansard, the Director of the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation, was quoted in my local newspaper, the Daily Mercury, on November 16, asking this:


What does Mum, Dad and the kids fishing … do to the environment that warrants them being locked out of vast areas of Australian waters, whether the marine parks are five or 500 kilometres from a boat ramp.


He said:


Australia's five million recreational fishers applaud good science based conservation measures that protects our marine environment for future generations …


… However, the Government's Marine Park Plan lacks scientific reasoning and—


there is—


no explanation why Aussie recreational fishers are banned from marine parks.


If peer-reviewed scientific studies proved that a particular species targeted by recreational fishers, or commercial fishermen, for that matter, was an endangered species in the Coral Sea, then fishing families and the rest of Australia could probably understand bag limits and no-take zones.


But the Labor Party and the Greens are kidding themselves if they think locking a relatively small number of fishers out of an area already teeming with fish will make any environmental difference, because fish cannot read maps.


Owner of Mackay Reef Fish Supplies, David Caracciolo, describes the concept of the marine park as fundamentally flawed. He says:


If the idea of a marine park is to conserve the animals or stock in it, to me it is hypocritical …


… A lot of these fish are migratory, you could say we are farming them for other countries to benefit.


What is more, Lance Murray, the President of the Mackay Regional Recreational Fishers, points out the reserves would place pressure on nearby fishing grounds, meaning there would be more competition for recreational anglers.


He said:


What'll happen is commercial fishers are going to be compensated but that'll also add pressure to other areas, which creates a funnel situation.


The minister and his cronies have tried to pretend no-one fishes in the Coral Sea at iconic fishing spots like Marion Reef, because that is 300 kilometres off the coastline.


Well, if no-one fishes out there, if no-one is fishing in these areas, then why are we locking them up?


Here is a dose of the truth—taken from the Nomad Sportfishing Adventures, which takes people fishing out to Marion Reef, one of those areas which is actually going to be locked up. They say:


Throughout each year, we fish the entire 1500 mile length of this reef system, moving between the most remote areas of the reef, to ensure you the absolute best fishing every week.


Nomad's owner, Damon Olsen, says 'travelling way out to Marion Reef on a calm ocean is one of the truly special experiences in the fishing world'.


In his report on a trip to Marion Reef with Nomad, Glanville Heydenrych had this to say about a fishing spot the minister would have us believe no-one visits:


… without a doubt some of the best fishing experiences I have ever uncounted in the Coral Sea and feel blessed to be a part of it, it just makes you hope that we will be allowed to partake in fishing here in the future, trust me this is a place you want to visit and having the government close this beautiful part of Australia due to some political uprising is a disgusting shame to say the least!!! Everybody should have the right to have the opportunity to experience the beauties of the Coral Sea, I am one for sure who would love to go back there …


Mr Olsen, in his blog, apologises for making fishing political, but he goes on to say:


… there are times when you just have to stand up and be counted, as the alternative is to sit back and watch many of the areas you love to fish get closed over the next few months and years.


On one hand, we have the environment minister telling us how important it is to lock people out of the Coral Sea and, on the other, the same environment minister is trying to convince us that the closure is not going to affect anyone because no-one goes out there.


You cannot have this both ways.


In recognition of the fact that some of our fishing industry will be forced to close down, the environment minister is actually putting $100 million worth of compensation on the table—an amount that is widely regarded by the industry as desperately insufficient.


There is no compensation for the businesses behind recreational fishing and an inadequate $100 million on the table for commercials.


If that is all the fishing industry is worth—over a million square kilometres of ocean—then why is it being closed down?


Australia has some of the most underfished waters in the world and closing down our seafood industry will only increase imports from some of the world's most overfished waters. That is the height of hypocrisy.


How does the government determine that to be a good environmental outcome?


Damon Olsen, from Nomad Sportfishing, is all in favour of marine parks if they are done for a reason—for the right reason—which is what this bill before us will ensure.


Mr Olsen says:


All recreational fishing groups support closed off areas, but only when thorough scientific processes have shown that these closed off areas are required. The current process is closing off huge areas to recreational fishermen simply so the government can keep green groups happy and stay in power.


The massive problem that we face here is that Science has long ago been abandoned by the politicians, and they are now playing a game of drawing colours on maps simply to keep the powerful and well funded green lobby groups at bay.


He goes on to say:


I have a first hand example of this from the meeting with the federal environment minister. The current process is proposing to close off the main area of the Perth trench to all gamefishing activities, essentially shutting down the entire gamefishing industry and community in Perth. We asked the minister why this zone had been placed in it's proposed position. We were told that the minister drew that zone himself because they needed one in that area, and there was no information to tell him where to put it, so he just placed it where he thought was appropriate.


That is great! Science by felt pen!


Obviously, this bill was aimed to stop the reckless announcement made by the environment minister some 10 days ago, and some people in this place may have a concern that the declaration of the marine parks will negate this bill.


I want to signal my intention right here and now that, if this bill should reach the consideration in detail stage, I will move an amendment that will negate the declaration of the marine protected areas that was made by the minister earlier this month, and then he would have to follow the accountable processes that are set forth in this bill before the House to create any new marine park in Australia. That would include a range of things, from allowing this parliament to have a say on it by making it a declarable instrument and by also ensuring that there are community stakeholder advisory groups set up so that there is real consultation on this, not the fake consultation that the minister has put forward. There would also be scientific review panels established to assess the conservation value. All of these things are in this bill.


I would urge particularly the crossbenchers, who might think that this matter is put to bed with the minister's declaration, to think again. They still have the ability to negate what the minister has done. Instead of having marine parks based on the extreme green agenda and science by felt pen, they can be based on real science with real consultation, real accountability and real transparency, and this parliament can make decisions as it is created to do. Hopefully this bill will be accepted by this parliament. Hopefully this bill will restore balance. Hopefully this bill will make the marine parks process accountable, as it is intended to do.

  It is with delight that I second the bill for the member for Dawson.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (20:15):  I rise to speak in opposition to this proposed bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012, which represents a continuation of the coalition running interference on what is an historic achievement by the Labor government in announcing the final network of Commonwealth marine reserves.


I want to congratulate the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Minister Burke, who, on 16 November, announced that Australia's precious marine environments have been permanently protected, with the proclamation of the world's biggest network of marine reserves—that is, more than 2.3 million square kilometres of ocean environment. The declaration of these new marine reserves delivers on an election commitment and represents a major achievement for the long-term conservation and sustainable use of Australia's oceans. Australia's oceans support many of the world's endangered marine animals, including the green turtle, the blue whale, the southern right whale, the Australian sea lion and the whale shark.


In May this year, a number of us in parliament were fortunate enough to hear an inspiring address from the author Tim Winton about the importance of marine parks. It reinforced my view that this is an opportunity for us as a parliament to do great things that future generations will be proud of. I would like to share with the parliament what Tim Winton had to say about this issue. It is important to highlight it to negate some of the short-sightedness of the bill before the House and because I cannot improve on Tim Winton's words. Tim himself is a very keen recreational fisher. He says that fishing is in his blood. Indeed, my own father, Allan, and my brothers Lex and Daryl are keen fishermen. Tim Winton says:


During my own lifetime the world's oceans have suffered a terrible decline. I've read about it. And I've seen it up close and ugly. When I lived in Greece I saw the results of oil spills, dynamite fishing, lax regulation. I've surfed in raw sewage in Indonesia and putrid medical waste in Brazil. And I've wondered: am I swimming in the future? … The global trends aren't great. Collapsing fisheries, dying corals, gyres of plastic the size of entire countries, catastrophic oil spills that ruin the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of fishing families and poison the food chain for decades.


Okay, I tell myself. All this is happening abroad, in someone else's ocean. But we're not immune. Not after the Montara spill. Not when a recent spike in sea temperature caused a mass kill of abalone on the mid-west coast and shut down the fishery until further notice …


Many of my neighbours are commercial fishermen. Lots of my friends are marine scientists. They don't always agree with each other, though they're all passionate about Australia's seas and want to do what they can keep them healthy. But none of them is telling me that things are getting better and better here at home.


… I don't think we'll pass on a dead ocean. I can't think that. … We have comparatively decent fisheries management and many good fishing operators. Still, consumption only goes up and the resource doesn't get any bigger. We all know we're pushing the ocean too hard. And the pressure to relegate marine protection - to defer it - that pressure is intense. And the balance is not in the ocean's favour. Taking a loss has become business as usual. Where else, in what other field, would mediocre outcomes be so acceptable?


We have to stop spending beyond our means. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Otherwise we'll be the generation - the richest, most mobile and well-educated generation in Australia's history - that passes on a dud inheritance, and leaves the estate in arrears. Bequeathing a loss to a family, a community, a nation, that's a despicable thing to do. …


The great news is we haven't blown it yet. We still have incredible assets to reserve and build upon: immense underwater canyons and sea mounts, fringing reefs, barrier reefs. Remote archipelagos teeming with birds and turtles. Precious inshore habitats, breeding grounds. Intricate coral atolls that are thrumming engines of oceanic life. These miracles of nature are our good and great fortune. They aren't just sources of protein. They're also food for thought, fields of scientific discovery. They are reservoirs of life inextricably entwined with our own. Because the health of the sea determines our human future. Yes, we have compromised great ecosystems already. We've made mistakes. And we've improved our game. But there's a gap between our aspirations and our achievements when it comes to stewardship. We must do better. We will do better. If we act now.


…   …   …


Commonwealth waters are public assets. The family silver. Silver that moves, breathes, swims. If you've ever swum in a school of trevally or barracuda or anchovies, you'll know what I mean; it's like being Scrooge McDuck rolling around in the vault. These riches are entrusted to government by the people. That trust, gravity of the task, has come into sharp focus in recent years. And in the past decade, in a groundswell of public consciousness that I simply didn't see coming, citizens have begun to expect a new level of accountability in marine stewardship. Why the sea? Well, because as much as they love the bush, Australians spend more time on the water. And they travel abroad – especially to places where they swim and surf and fish. Like me, I guess, they've come to see what we stand to lose. What the worst future looks and feels and tastes and smells like. So they value their marine inheritance much more consciously and vividly than you may realize. They expect the managers of their marine birthright to act prudently, conservatively. Which means they expect proper fisheries management. They want to know there are genuine limits to the incursions of oil and gas, that a marine system is at least as important as a coal-mine, or a port. Most importantly they expect government to hold significant marine assets in reserve by way of parks and sanctuaries. Where people can visit but not extract anything.


There's a precedent for this, one that makes sense to ordinary people. Generations ago, when our nation was far less prosperous, far less educated, far less certain of its place in the world, our forebears set aside habitats and ecosystems on land in the form of national parks and reserves. Pretty brave at the time. This was their gift to the future. The kind of sacrifice Australians instinctively understand and celebrate. You and I inherited the fruit of that enlightened impulse. We enjoy the work and the courage of those Australian thinkers and legislators who came before. And now, from the fringes of our cities, from the very hearts of our cities in some instances, right out to the interior, there are wild places to which we can take our children, where we study, or simple stare in awe –because someone fifty, sixty, seventy years ago was visionary enough, decent enough, and courageous enough to make it happen, to reserve a share of the family silver for us. You and I are connected to those visionaries by that patriotic impulse, that love of country, that love of family.


So now in 2012 we're on the cusp of achieving something like that in the sea. A system of marine parks for the nation. A network of representative ecosystems reserved for conservation purposes. It's the outcome of a process that's not owned by any narrow political interest. It's taken years of study and consultation, been overseen and supported by governments, both Liberal and Labor. It has the potential–if we hold our nerve and follow through—to be one of the great moments of marine stewardship. Of environmental responsibility. But also one of the great moments of Australian patriotism when our belief in the common good shines through, when we show our higher selves to our selves and to those unborn.


…   …   …


And neither should it be contentious, although I know there have been attempts to make it so, to make something unifying into something divisive. But the principle of marine parks has taken hold. You know that when more than 100,000 citizens make submissions in support of them, urging members of parliament to stay the course and reserve these parks, that something's going on. 


…   …   …


A decade ago, 15,000 citizens encircled the CBD of the city of Fremantle to spare a coral reef most Australians had never heard of, and Ningaloo is now on the World Heritage list. Since then support for marine parks has only grown. It's geographically widespread, spans all age groups, and is non-partisan. …The people asking for marine parks understand this for what it is: good housekeeping, prudent management, a future for their kids. And I think legislators ignore this tidal change at their peril.


I conclude by paraphrasing Tim Winton by saying that 'this is a genuine legacy moment'. When your grandkids ask, 'What did you do as a member of parliament?' tax reform might do it, or that parliamentary committee. But in that rare moment when a little kid looks up at you with a flicker of interest or even a moment of admiration, my money is on the dolphins and on the marine parks.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (20:26):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012, and I proudly support my good friend and member for Dawson. I would like to take up a couple of points made by the member for Wills. I do not think that anyone could possibly doubt his love for the environment and that sort of thing. Before the Montara spill—before they put that well there—the Australian Institute of Marine Science surveyed that entire place. They put good baseline research into the place. After the spill was cleaned up they went back to see what damage there was. There was none. That is good science. That is knowing what is out there and knowing what is at risk. That is knowing that, if there is damage, what there is to clean up. The green zones established over the reefs in North Queensland and along the coast were based on science. They did not make a lot of people happy, but they were based on good science. They have been proved to be successful. It was a great effort and the environment has no greater friend than Liberal governments. I would say to the member for Wills: 'You can't have it both ways. You can't trot Tim Winton out to say we are fishing out the place and then stand beside the minister who says, ""It is so far out, no-one can even get out there"".'


It just goes to show how duplicitous and shifty this government is that they will change the argument to suit the audience. That is what bothers me most. The problem with this argument is that when you say to someone in Melbourne that we should protect the sea, all you see is sea; that is the mental image, and there is nothing on top of it. You do not see anything underneath, you do not see the jobs that go with it, because they are all on the land. If you say to people that we have to protect forests, people immediately see roads, trees, chainsaws, trucks, towns. They see all the implications of making those sorts of decisions. That is the problem with this decision.


We held a forum—the first of many, I believe—in relation to this proposal and what has come to pass. I do not mind a bet and at that time I said that I would take any money that the area marked out by the felt pen on the Coral Sea would be exactly where the marine park would go once the consultation period ended. We have seen exactly that happen. We have now seen the Protect the Coral Sea campaign up the ante and call for even more closures closer to Cairns—more closures of reefs and fishing areas to shut down further industry. At that fishing forum there were a number of resolutions passed. First and foremost was the one about recreational fishing as a lifestyle issue for North Queenslanders. It is a right to be protected.


The Coral Sea Marine Park is a long way from Townsville, but this government has shown a willingness to go back on anything it says before an election. At every turn this government does something to suit itself at the expense of the recreational fisher. We campaigned in 2010 to say that a vote for Labor was a vote to close down the Coral Sea, and the Labor candidate at the time said, 'No, it's not,' and poked me in the chest and swore at me on the radio. But it has come to pass that exactly what we said would happen has happened.


Science should be the guide to the establishment of a marine reserve off the north coast of Australia. Any decision to establish a marine park should be overturned by a subsequent government until the scientific case for its establishment can be made. That was the second resolution passed at the fishing forum, and it was passed unanimously by the people who were there because that is what they care about. This government talks about science and various causes, but the Australian Institute of Marine Science has a $120 million boat down at the marina in Townsville with no fuel to run it on and no operational funding—the operational funding has been cut. At the fishing forum we asked that artificial reefs be established in yellow zones where there would be one rod, one angler and one hook. At the fishing forum we even passed a resolution that no anchor could be used and that fishers would just trawl or drift across the place. We asked for a science based review of the green zones to make sure that they were working as well as we suspected. We also wanted to make sure that the Coral Sea is protected. The greatest protector of the Coral Sea and marine parks in general is the weather. If the wind is blowing at between five knots and 10 knots, everyone is going out for a fish. But, if it is blowing stronger than 10 knots, no one goes out. You can go eight, 10 or 12 weeks without a fish up there.



Work needs to be done to change the negative perception of North Queenslanders as recreational fishers. (Time expired)

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (20:31):  I rise to speak in opposition to this bill, which would put the hugely significant marine conservation outcomes that this government has achieved in partnership and in trust with the Australian community at threat. For anyone to sensibly support the legislative amendments that this bill contains they would need to agree with its underlying premise, which is that the government's secured set of marine reserves has been achieved without the benefit of appropriate scientific data and analysis, without independent economic impact assessments and without the guidance of appropriate stakeholder and community consultation—and that is, frankly, a ludicrous proposition.


In an article published on 27 August this year and titled 'Marine reserves not about closing fisheries, but about preserving ocean health', Dr Nic Bax, Stream Leader, Understanding Ocean Ecosystems at CSIRO, and Dr Ian Cresswell, Director, Wealth from Oceans Flagship at CSIRO, concluded with the following:


The CMR network and marine bioregional planning herald a substantial change in the way Australia manages its marine environment. The potential impacts extend well beyond fishery management.


Importantly the marine bioregional framework provides a clear and consistent framework for Australia that will help make future management decisions and help focus the social, economic and environmental research to support those decisions. It will set clear and measurable objectives within a clear reporting process. This will provide the impetus and direction for science to reduce the uncertainty about whether we are achieving those objectives and the broader goals they serve.


Australia provides world leadership in the policy and science of marine ecosystem management and is likely to be one of the few countries to achieve the international commitment made at Rio+10 in 2002 to develop a representative system of marine reserves by 2012.


Last week the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities sealed one of the greatest environment achievements in Australian history when he proclaimed the network of marine protected areas, including the south-west marine bioregional area. That proclamation, long-sought and hard-won, represents a marine and environmental legacy for future generations unparalleled in our history.


The marine bioregional plan is a reform that has been painstakingly achieved. Like many members of this place, I have personally worked with professional and recreational fishers in my electorate to facilitate their input and to help them seek refinements in the protection scheme to ensure that the marine conservation outcomes achieved were at their highest without having unnecessary impact on fishing and other uses. I have also worked extensively with marine scientists and marine conservation advocates to argue for improvements to early versions of the network, which simply did not provide enough protection in some areas.


In considering the economic impacts, the government's 2011 fisheries adjustment policy very clearly set out the assessments required for the establishment of marine reserves. The policy is wholly consistent with the coalition's 2004 policy. Under the adjustment policy, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences, ABARES, was engaged to prepare independent socioeconomic assessments for each proposed marine reserve. The production of the assessments involved data collection and consultation, including the creation of industry reference groups. All the ABARES reports are, of course, publicly available. The government acknowledges that the creation of the reserves necessary to properly protect Australia's range of unique and precious ecosystems and our marine biodiversity, which has already suffered significant losses, will involve some economic impact and that those affected must receive appropriate assistance.


On a side note: I am pleased to see that the Centre for Policy Development has produced analysis showing that the proposed Commonwealth network of marine reserves will cover an area that delivers $1.2 billion dollars in what is termed 'ecosystem service value' based on estimates derived using a UN environment program study. This value is not currently recognised in our economic models or analysis.


The proclamation of the new marine protected areas by the minister on the Friday before last was welcomed by tens of thousands of Australians, and I received letters or emails from approximately 750 constituents who wanted to support and reinforce the importance of this historic reform. The new marine reserves increase the Commonwealth network of protected areas to 2.3 million square kilometres. In WA these areas include critical feeding and birthing zones for the blue whale. They cover the Perth Canyon and the Abrolhos, the Recherche Archipelago, Geographe Bay and the Naturaliste Plateau. Many of these environmental wonderlands—or 'wonderseas'—have been zones of legend in WA for years, but some of them are even better known and regarded now, especially by young people in my electorate, as a result of the thorough marine protection process that we have been through.


The principles and the framework for protecting Australia's ocean ecosystems through the marine bioregional planning process are robust in themselves. They have been improved since their operation under the former government. They are fit for the purpose of securing the environmental legacy that future generations deserve. As our own experts at the CSIRO note, they are world-leading. The Member for Dawson's proposed changes to the legislative provisions of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act are unnecessary, unjustified, inconsistent and costly, and they cannot be supported.(Time expired)

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (20:36):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this bill. Quite frankly, the process under which the Coral Sea marine reserve was declared last week is an absolute disgrace. For generations this resource has been fished in a totally sustainable way; the fact that the area is now judged worthy of being a marine reserve is testament to that.


The bill would require the environment minister to fulfil four requirements before declaring an area a marine reserve. Firstly, he must commission an independent social and economic impact assessment so that the government and affected communities are fully aware of the long-term ramifications. What concerns me is that even before ABARES had completed its socio-economic report on the impact of the MPA, Ministers Burke and Ludwig—clairvoyants that they are, and we have seen that more recently with the live trade debacle—announced a nationwide assistance package in the vicinity of $100 million.


In Cairns we have a very well-regarded, experienced and independent economist named Bill Cummings. Earlier this year, Mr Cummings was commissioned by Cairns Regional Council to examine the economic impact of declaring the Coral Sea as a marine reserve. What became immediately evident on seeing his findings was how short-sighted this government has been in only assessing the immediate economic impact on commercial operators. They have not considered the flow-on effects to businesses further down the chain, the likely future growth and opportunities forgone in the future, the management cost impacts and the losses to post shipside activity. On the other hand, Mr Cummings has and what he found is quite frightening. By looking at these other impacts, and extrapolating them over 30 years—that is a standard economic forecast—he has come up with a cost, just for the Cairns region, of $1 billion. That is a billion dollars in a region with one of the highest unemployment figures in the country, contributing to the economic black hole that Labor has already got this country into over the past five years.


Secondly, this bill requires the government to obtain scientific peer-reviewed and publicly available advice before making any proclamations. There is no denying the fact that the government cannot produce any scientific evidence to show a threat from fishing activities to species in the Coral Sea. Just as with the last-minute banning of the MV Margiris, this government continues to ignore science. Take a look at this article from the Cairns Post on 20 November celebrating the fact that overseas buyers are 'lining up to take product from the Northern Prawn Fishery after its sustainable certification by the Marine Stewardship Council'. Gaining this certification is no mean feat. It proves that the operators in this fishery are using world's best practice to harvest their catch sustainably with less impact on the environment and on the by-catch. So what does this government do? It takes this certification and rubbishes it by declaring the Coral Sea as a marine reserve, shutting down 20 per cent of the Northern Prawn Fishery. What about the millions these operators have invested and the thousands of jobs they support? I just shake my head in disbelief.


The third requirement of this bill is that the government must establish independent reference panels and stakeholder groups in each region to ensure rigorous decision making. What does that mean? It means no more whistle-stop tours where the minister has already made up his mind; it means no more backhanded swapping of areas to keep marginal Labor MPs out of the firing line; it means no more playing industry groups off each other, bargaining with boundaries to buy support; and it means no more bowing to the pressure of gan-greenous overseas lobby groups, like the PEW foundation, who do not have the courage to take on the polluters and the over-fishers in their own waters.


Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this bill will put parliament in charge of final decisions by making declarations disallowable, scrapping the carte blanche powers that the minister clearly has abused.


To close, left as it stands the Coral Sea marine reserve is a failure for sustainability, it is a nail in the coffin for family owned businesses and it is a death knell for highly exploited species in Third World fisheries. This bill, put up by the member for Dawson, will instead provide a framework of accountability and transparency around the creation of marine reserves, and that is why I wholly support it here today.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (20:41):  I join my colleagues the member for Wills and the member for Fremantle in speaking against this private member's bill. As my colleagues have already pointed out, on 16 November environment minister Tony Burke proclaimed that 2.3 million square kilometres of ocean environment would be permanently protected and that new management plans for those areas will come into effect in July 2014.


The proclamation follows a lengthy public consultation process during which some 80,000 submissions were received. As part of that public consultation process, the public had the opportunity to put forward their views on the marine reserves proposals during 90-day public consultation processes in each region, at the 245 stakeholder meetings held around the country and during the most recent 60-day consultation on the final proposal. To say that this was a decision made by the minister without any consultation and without any consideration for those impacted by it is simply incorrect. The facts speak for themselves. In fact, I know this process has been ongoing for two or three years at least, if not longer, so there has been plenty of time for communities around the country to put their points of view forward to the minister, and in fact those points of view have been heard as part of the final outcome of that consultation process.


I understand that current arrangements for industry and recreational fishers will remain in place until the new management plans take effect, in July 2014. This means that there is still over 18 months to go before the new plans come into effect. Again, that is in order to give communities time to transition. In his speech on 17 September on the second reading the member for Dawson claimed that the minister's declaration was 'not the result of rigorous scientific analysis', that there has not been 'extensive industry or community consultation', that the government has 'not engaged in proper consultation' and that the government has 'no consideration for Australia's fishers or the coastal communities'. Furthermore he stated that the government has 'failed to understand the importance of recreational fishing' and has 'failed to consider the important economic contribution that recreational fishing makes to coastal communities'.


I reject all of those assertions and in fact, as I outlined a moment ago, the extensive consultation process the government has undertaken as part of the announcement made by the minister on 16 November simply dismisses all of those claims. The member for Dawson, through his bill, wants the minister to commission an independent social and economic impact assessment before any proclamations are made. His bill will also require the minister to obtain independent scientific peer reviewed advice. As the member for Fremantle has already pointed out, the current proposals were the subject of a considerable amount of scientific advice.


The member for Dawson's bill will also require:


… that the Government establish an independent scientific reference panel as well as a stakeholder advisory group so that decisions are made with rigour following extensive consultation and analysis of the possible scientific and social impacts of any proposed marine protected areas.


What the member for Dawson is really saying is that he wants to make the process so cumbersome that it will be difficult to implement—if indeed implementation ever occurs. In other words, he does not want anything to happen and he wants to make the process cumbersome to ensure that is exactly the outcome—that nothing will ever happen. 


He also implies that the scientific advice provided in the existing process by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and other marine science centres is unreliable and that we cannot rely on it. I reject that assertion. I have spoken to some of the scientists who deal with marine issues for this country and I have nothing but praise for, and confidence in, their work. They were the very people who provided advice to the government in this process and who, at the very least, would have had the opportunity to make their own submissions. To suggest we need to have additional scientific advice is, in my view, suggesting that we should not rely on the scientists who have contributed so far.


There is another element of the member for Dawson's plan which concerns me. It says that the parliament should make the final decision. On the one hand, he is saying that we should have all of these experts—peer reviewed expert advice—on the panels. But, on the other hand, he says that their advice can be ignored. He says that the parliament, a group of nonprofessionals, should make the ultimate decision. Why would we get that advice if it is not needed? (Time expired)

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (20:46):  In a little while, I plan to present a petition which has been found to be in order by the Petitions Committee and which has been signed by 4,541 Australians. I support the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill 2012 introduced into the chamber by the member for Dawson. I acknowledge the passionate way he has represented his constituents since his election to this House. This bill proposes to insert a process into the EPBC Act to ensure that, prior to the declaration of any marine protected areas, the relevant minister will be required to commission an independent social and economic impact assessment before any proclamations are made.


The bill has become necessary because of the way the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, has gone about the latest designation of the marine protected area in the Coral Sea. The consistent feedback—it has been consistent every step of the way—from stakeholders has been that the current process of establishing marine park boundaries completely failed to include any genuine consultation and failed to recognise that Australian fisheries are amongst the healthiest and best managed in the world—as highlighted in the latest Commonwealth fisheries status report released in November 2011.


The government has not engaged in proper consultation—their approach has been take it or leave it. There has been no consideration for Australian fisheries or the coastal communities which rely very heavily on this industry. There are also major concerns about the rigour and consistency of the science used to determine particular boundaries of proposed marine parks. 


Let me make one point very clear, however. The coalition does support the designation of marine parks and marine protected areas. We have a very strong record on this. When it comes to the protection of our fisheries and environmental sustainability, we have a strong and long record. One of the things that I was most proud of as a member of the Howard government was the effort which resulted in the establishment of 11 marine protected areas. That included, in July 2004, a new zoning plan for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which increased the areas protected from extractive activities from 4.6 per cent to 33.3 per cent of that park. These declarations were achieved with broad community and industry support. This demonstrates that it is possible to implement marine park zones with the support of both the scientific community and the other communities involved. It was a stepped and staged process involving those communities all along the way.


I see the petition has arrived now and I plan to table it in just a little while.


This government has displayed a total lack of consultation. It is exactly the opposite of what we did in government when we first implemented the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. That is why this bill is necessary. It is necessary to give the industry and the communities confidence that decisions which governments make on the basis of environmental protection are genuinely made on those grounds alone—not based on some political ideology.


As set out in the explanatory memorandum, this bill will require the relevant minister to commission an independent social and economic impact assessment before any proclamations are made. The bill will require the minister to obtain independent scientific peer reviewed advice that is made publicly available. It will also require the government to establish an independent scientific reference panel, as well as a stakeholder advisory group, so that decisions are made with rigour following extensive consultation and analysis of the possible scientific, economic and social impacts of any proposed marine protected areas. Finally, the bill will put parliament in charge of final decisions by making declarations disallowable by the parliament.


I again remind the parliament of the very high levels of sustainability already observed by our fishing industry. As someone who has worked in this industry, I can endorse the view that Australia's fisheries are amongst the best managed in the world. (Time expired)

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (20:51):  Australians know how fragile our marine life is and how important it is to protect it. We have completed a final network of Commonwealth marine reserves, and these will be managed to protect the unique biodiversity found in them, which is important for sustaining natural resources in the area. We think it is particularly important to do this. Those opposite in this chamber are simply opposing that which they previously had some commitment to when they created the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park back in 2006. Those opposite are no longer the party that was led by the member for Wentworth, that is for sure, and their opposition today goes to show just how narrow-minded they are. 


The purpose of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Making Marine Parks Accountable) Bill is to stop, not simply delay, what we are doing. Those opposite are proposing in this legislation to create up to 88 regional committees for a period of two months to provide input into any future proposed marine reserves. This is economically stupid. They claim there are almost no financial implications for the Commonwealth. Those opposite simply do not get it with respect to protection of the environment. The member for Leichhardt talked about what the Cairns Regional Council did in commissioning a report from a local consultant which purported to show a $1 billion net economic impact on the Cairns regional economy, but flawed assumptions, deliberate misrepresentation and exaggeration of the federal Labor government's proposals underlayed that analysis. They ignore the fact that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences were engaged to prepare an independent socioeconomic assessment for each of the proposed regional marine reserve networks. ABARES established reference groups with industry organisations, fisheries managers, fishing entitlement holders and fishing businesses, and those reports are publicly available on the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities website.




Mr Katter:
 Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was a member of the government party when this was done, and I claim to have been misrepresented. He is saying that the Liberals are opposed to the national park proposals. The Liberals closed down the entire fishing industry in North Queensland.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Symon
):  There is a time and a place for that. The member for Kennedy will resume his seat.




Mr NEUMANN:
  Those opposite are making all sorts of alarmist claims about financial Armageddon for the fishing industry, but that is at odds with what ABARES has had to say. The ABARES socioeconomic impact assessment predicts the value of the commercial fisheries catch displaced by the new marine reserves will be $11.1 million, which represents about one per cent of the annual value of catch, gross value of production, and about 103 jobs. That is what ABARES has had to say. They have run off with all sorts of scare campaigns. Senator Boswell has been talking about this, and we have had statements in the past by the member for Wentworth and the member for Curtin about it too. They will say one thing when they are in the capital cities of Australia about their commitments to marine parks but they will say another thing when they are up the coast of Queensland.


One thing that needs to be put on the table is how close the green zones and the new Commonwealth marine reserves are two towns along the Queensland coast. It is important to put this on the public record. Those opposite would have you believe that estuaries and lakes and beaches are all at risk, and that any person who gets in a tinny will be at risk when they leave Cairns and places like that. From Bundaberg, for example, the distance to the nearest marine park zone is 490 kilometres. From Brisbane it is 410 kilometres to the new Central Eastern Commonwealth Marine Reserve; Mooloolaba is 480 kilometres from that reserve—




Mr Katter:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This is an outrageous misconception that the member for Blair is perpetrating on the House. The green zones stop almost all recreational fishing in Queensland.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. The time allotted for this debate has expired; the debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (20:57):  I move:


(1) notes with concern the recent and growing job losses in state governments around Australia, as well as the difficulties many state public sector employees face in bargaining over wages and conditions; and


(2) directs the Standing Committee on Education and Employment to inquire into and report on the conditions of employment of state public sector employees and the adequacy of protection of their rights at work as compared with other employees, including:


(a) whether:


   (i) current state government industrial relation legislation provides state public sector workers with less protection and entitlements than workers to whom the Fair Work Act 2009 applies;


   (ii) the removal of components of the long held principles relating to Termination, Change and Redundancy from state legislation is a breach of obligations under the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions;


   (iii) the rendering unenforceable of elements of existing collective agreements relating to employment security is a breach of the obligations under the ILO conventions relating to collective bargaining;


   (iv) the current state government industrial relations frameworks provide protection to workers as required under the ILO conventions;


   (v) state public sector workers face particular difficulties in bargaining under state or federal legislation; and


   (vi) the Fair Work Act 2009 provides the same protections to public sector workers as it does to other workers; and


(b) what legislative or regulatory options are available to the Commonwealth to ensure that all Australian workers, including those in state public sectors, have adequate and equal protection of their rights at work.


Public sector workers around this country are under attack, no more so than in Queensland where 14,000 employees are slated to lose their jobs. You can add that to the 10,000 in New South Wales and the 4,200 in Victoria, and with promises of more to come there will be somewhere near 30,000 conservative state government employees losing their jobs. 


The community understands the impact of this on the frontline services that they rely on; the community understands that it means their fellow community members are losing their jobs, with all the impacts that has on their families and consequentially on the public purse. It also means that the people who are left behind in these jobs are feeling increasingly insecure and they are under greater pressure to deliver the same services but with fewer resources. 


It is not just about job losses; it is also about the contravention of some fundamental basic principles of dignity and people's rights to have a say in the decisions that are made in their workplaces. We saw in Queensland, for example, the government come in over the top of agreements reached between employees and employers and say, 'We do not like some of those causes so we are going to take them away because they seem to give employees some rights to participate in decisions that are made in their workplace.' Can you imagine the outcry if the Commonwealth government or a state government decided that it was going to step in and rewrite the terms of a lease, saying, 'We don't like the way you have negotiated that so we are going to take away a few of the benefits that one side has'? Similarly, if that happened with a commercial contract there would be an outcry from the conservatives, and yet it seems okay, when it comes to employees, to come in and rewrite agreements and take away some of their basic termination, change and redundancy provisions. 


In my home state of Victoria I have seen the disadvantage that state public sector workers are at when it comes to bargaining under the current system. We have had nurses being put through the charade of bargaining that was extended for several years by a government that was hoping at some point the nurses would take industrial action so the bargaining period would be terminated and they would be taken to Fair Work Australia, where they knew that they would not be able to have their claim for nurse-patient ratios arbitrated. The teachers in Victoria have now become so fed up with the government's inaction and its refusal to come to the table that they have suspended bargaining and said they are not coming back until the government comes up with a proper proposal.


Around the country, state public sector workers reeling under the impacts of conservative state governments are now saying we need to do more. They are coming to this place, the federal parliament, and saying, 'We want you to do more and to do what you can.' The Queensland Public Sector Union have been leading the charge both in their home state and here, but it is not just the union; it is also community members and workers. More than 20,000 people around the country have signed up to the together.org.au petition to urge this place to find out how it can take steps to protect public sector workers and then implement them. 


That is why we are here debating this motion for an inquiry—to shine a light on what is happening in state governments around this country but also to answer the more fundamental question, the basic principle at the heart of this motion: how can we ensure that state public sector workers have the same level of protection as their federal counterparts?


Now, I do applaud the government for having taken some steps in this regard, but there is much more that could be done. For instance, as a final example, we need to ask the question: given that we as a country have signed up to various International Labour Organization conventions that give people basic rights—with regard to termination change and redundancy—to be involved in what happens in their workplace, has the Queensland government contravened that by unilaterally deciding to rewrite agreements and then proceeding to sack tens of thousands of those employees? That is just one of the questions that we would be able to get to the bottom of through this committee inquiry. This inquiry—if this motion succeeds and is passed by the House—will give us the opportunity over the coming months to allow those people who have been so devastated and affected by cuts that they never saw coming to get the gold-standard protection they deserve and that other employees in this country have.

"Katter, Bob, MP",AUS,2012-11-26,"



Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (21:02):  I second the motion and I exercise my right to speak now. Some 14,500 public servants have been sacked in Queensland in the space of about seven months, and it is far from over. I belonged to the most efficient government ever. No-one has ever denied that the Bjelke-Petersen government was the most efficient economic performing government in Australian history. In its lifetime, it created the coal and aluminium industries, which carried this nation for some 25 years. The iron ore industry is now also carrying the nation, but those two industries carried it for 25 years and they were established by that government. I will tell you something, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Symon: it was established by huge debt. We were the most indebted government in Australian history. No one will ever have the debt that we had. 


To give an example of what we did to get that debt, we borrowed $1,000 million to build a railway line from nowhere to nowhere because we believed that, if we built that railway line, the coalmines would be able to open up and export coal overseas. This was a very radical proposal because Australia in 1959 was a coal-importing country. We were not a coal-exporting country, so the idea that we should export coal was radical. We spent $1,000 million, which was about a quarter of our entire budget. Was it a good decision? That railway did not service just Les Thiess, who said, 'If you build me a railway line, I'll open a coalmine.' It did not serve just Utah, who said, 'If you build us a railway line, we'll give you a coalmine.' There were 30 major mines using that railway line. Each year, we made $850 million profit off that line and we made further profit on the port.


The Liberals have a rather crude, simplistic approach to economics. They believe economics is about cutting government spending. Would that it were that simple. If the Liberals had had control of Queensland, there would have been no coal industry and there would have been no aluminium industry, because they would not have built, as we did, a giant power station for which there were no customers in the belief that there would be if we built infrastructure. Most people in this House think of infrastructure as whirligigs and pleasure domes in the big cities. Heaven knows the Premier of Queensland is the king of all whirligigs and pleasure domes! He is the king of debt as well, because he increased the debt of the Brisbane City Council by 60 per cent and he increased their taxation by 60 per cent. We can drive through Brisbane and see all the bicycles he is responsible for. There are tens of thousands of bicycles that I have never seen anyone riding around on in my life. Is it any wonder that his party members are fleeing at the moment?


I also belonged to a government with very great pride in the fact that we never sacked any public servants. Yes, there was confrontation—a particular group of people switched the lights out in Brisbane. But except for that incident, which concerned 200 people, we never sacked anyone. On the railways, I am very proud to say because I had a railway electorate, in 1979 there were 22,000 people and in 1989 there were 21,000, even though we had instituted computerisation, which did away with 4,000 or 5,000 jobs in that period. We had the same number in 1979 that we had in 1989. But the great socialist party came in, and in seven years they took the numbers from 21,000 down to 12,000. They were not allowed up on the dais when 10,000 people marched in Brisbane. They were not allowed up on the dais because our trade union leaders are not hypocrites. They knew that they were the people who sacked half the railway workers in Queensland and broke the hearts of many people.


I conclude on this note: Anthea, a lovely lady who was one of our nurses, has no job now. I asked her, 'Can you get a job?' She said, 'No, I can't leave town because I owe money on my house.' I said, 'Can you get a job in town?' She said, 'There are no jobs for nurses in Charters Towers.' I asked, 'What will you do?' She did not have a tear in her eye and her voice did not waver. She said, 'I've got three children, Bob, and I don't know—I don't know.' (Time expired)

Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (21:07):  I think it is important that the member for Melbourne acknowledge that both state and Commonwealth Labor governments have presided over drastic cuts to the public service. I know that he, like those opposite, would like people to believe that public sector job cuts are strictly the modus operandi of coalition governments. Yet Labor's own modelling projects 4,200 full-time jobs to be shed from the federal Public Service, with further modelling showing federal Labor will cut more than 12,000 employees by the end of 2014-15. We have seen around 4,000 jobs go already under various efficiency-dividend mandates.



Mr Katter interjecting—




Ms LEY:
  Even the Greens do not have immunity here. In Tasmania, the state Greens-ALP alliance is, similarly, shedding jobs, due to their grave mismanagement of the Tasmanian economy. They also appear to be a little confused as to how many jobs have actually been cut.

Ms LEY:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, if you would ask the member for Kennedy to please desist from his interjections on my speech, I will not remind him of his voting record in this parliament.



Mr Katter interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! It would be far better for everyone in the House that the member for Farrer be heard in silence, as is her right.




Ms LEY:
  I was referring to the mismanagement by Tasmanian Labor of the Tasmanian economy. Not only does it appear that the Tasmanian government is struggling with their basic maths, but the make-up of job losses is worthy of comment. Two-thirds came from essential services—health, police and education—with just three from the Department of Premier and Cabinet.


Campbell Newman has been forced to take large cuts to the public sector directly as a result of the former Labor government. Under Anna Bligh, we saw economic mismanagement of debt to the tune of around $85 billion, once we factor in Labor commitments yet to be paid for. Yet it is important to note that those who are being made redundant will receive their full entitlements in nearly every single case. Public expenditure growth in Queensland has been well above the national average. As expert in public administration Ken Wiltshire pointed out in the Australian recently, there was:


… a blowout in the amount spent on public servants across the past decade, at 8.7 per cent a year. Of that, 3.5 per cent was attributed to the number of employees and 5.2 per cent to growth of wages.


This blow-out occurred entirely under Labor. So, while it is regrettable, there have been necessary cuts.


Queensland Health has somewhere in the vicinity of 80,000 staff today; 10 years ago it had 49,000. Yet the fact that almost three-quarters of the cuts are covered off by annual, natural attrition does not really give those opposite adequate ammunition for a suitable scare campaign. They would have you believe that there will be no-one left standing in the Queensland public service. In fact, so determined was Minister Shorten to prove his point that he felt it necessary to jump on a plane to Queensland to announce his commitment to standing by and protecting Queensland public servants. In fact, what he did was make it even harder for recently retrenched Queensland public servants to get a job. I do wonder whether recently redundant Canberra public servants are questioning why the federal minister felt it appropriate to do this when he kept silent on their redundancies, because they were the result of his own federal colleagues. He has also been noticeable for his absence in all instances where state Labor governments have undertaken public sector redundancies.


On the topic of protections for public sector employees, I say this: public sector staff across the board have high levels of protection in place. Their redundancy payouts are going to be paid. They are not going to be left hanging. And they can rest assured that their entitlements will be paid in full. This motion will achieve nothing, barring tying up valuable time of the standing committee on the political whim of the member for Melbourne. Therefore, the coalition will not be supporting this motion. All this serves to do is to act as a distraction from the real issue—the abysmal economic management of various state and federal Labor governments and their own penchant for slashing public servants while appeasing their union mates.

In New South Wales in recent times, we have really learnt just what the Liberal Party thinks of public servants and public services. In New South Wales, Barry O'Farrell has cut $1.7 billion out of education. The member for Farrer spoke about the fine economic credentials of the Liberal Party throughout the country. What has come to the attention of the people of New South Wales is that the O'Farrell government made a mathematical error: instead of having a budget deficit they have a billion-dollar surplus. Regardless of this fact, they are still going to slash those jobs in education. And who does that affect? That affects the children. That affects this country. That affects our economic prosperity. If we do not have an educated workforce, if we do not have public servants, if we do not have teachers to deliver that education in our public system, then what we have is a second-class country. And that is what the Liberal Party has been demonstrating, in both this federal parliament and the states of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia, they believe in. We have only to look at the statement of the shadow Treasurer in which he said that a Liberal-National Party government would slash 12,000 federal Public Service jobs to know that is what the opposition stand for. That is what the Liberal-National Party stand for. They stand for cutting jobs in the Public Service.


Along with that, they are cutting services to the Australian people. They should stand condemned for what has been happening in the states throughout Australia. In New South Wales and Queensland, I have heard—I am much more familiar with New South Wales—they are not only cutting jobs but attempting to strip leave loading for public servants, penalty rates for shift workers and the allowances of workers in remote areas. This will leave many thousands of workers worse off. But those on the other side of this parliament do not care about the fact that these are people who have families and who have financial obligations that they have to meet. All they care about are cuts, cuts, cuts. Along with cuts, cuts, cuts from the Public Service, there are cuts, cuts, cuts to services for the Australian people.


In New South Wales they have not just stopped with cutting jobs in the public service; they are also cutting workers compensation entitlements. They are ripping away workers' entitlements to workers compensation. The O'Farrell government is taking away the rights of people who are injured at work to any compensation or any support whilst they are injured.


If you look at the Liberal Party, what do you see? You see a party that does not value workers, does not value the public sector and does not believe in delivering public services. You have a party that is all about one thing. It is all about the big end of town and, at the same time, ignoring the needs of the people of Australia and devaluing the services that are provided through the public sector. Particularly in New South Wales they stand condemned for their cuts to education— (Time expired)

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (21:17):  I rise to speak on the member for Melbourne's motion regarding public sector employees in the states of Australia. Along with every member of this House, I am concerned any time an Australian loses their job, whether it is in the private or the public sector. Employment is a cornerstone of one's life. Being productive in the workplace is how we support ourselves and our children; it is how we provide shelter and security.


I also want to ensure that every Australian has appropriate protections at work. As the motion today does not explicitly state, public service employees in every state except Victoria are covered under their own industrial relations powers. In effect, the member for Melbourne's motion is an attack on the notion of competitive federalism in this country and does not acknowledge that, where appropriate, it is up to the states to regulate their own affairs without an overbearing federal government.


What today's motion does do, however, is distract Australians from what has been the main cause of so many job losses and what has been hurting general employment conditions around Australia in the private and public sectors—and that is the Labor Party and Labor governments. After decades of Labor governments in some states, and after five years of a federal Labor government, Australia and the Australian economy are reeling from their poor and reckless financial management of the economy.


In only five years of Labor running the Commonwealth, $70 billion of net assets has now turned into $150 billion of net debt. The Treasurer has run the four biggest deficits in Australia's history, and this Labor government has overseen wasteful and damaging programs, including overpriced school halls and dangerous roof insulation. This Labor government has implemented the world's only economy-wide carbon tax and has introduced an overpriced and underdelivered NBN, both of which are costing Australians billions and billions of dollars every year.


If we look at Queensland, after almost 20 years of Labor government, Campbell Newman's LNP government inherited $65 billion of debt. The Newman government was elected by Queenslanders to return the Queensland budget to a state of fiscal sanity. As a result of the previous Labor government's reckless spending, the state's fiscal and economic situation was destitute—and the new LNP government has to deal with that.


Today's private member's motion from the member for Melbourne would be laudable if it were not for the usual silence that comes from the Greens and the Labor Party when jobs are cut by their own parties. I say 'usual silence' because we know that the Greens are extremely pleased whenever a single job is lost in the mining industry. We should never forget that this is the party, under Bob Brown and now Senator Milne, that actively wants to shut down the coal industry and to do it today, no matter the cost to Australians and their jobs. More importantly, we have in Australia a Labor minister for employment who remains silent when Labor governments or unions cut workers.


Despite the silence, there have been significant attempts across our country to manage the size of the public service. In Tasmania, the Labor-Greens government plans to slash 2,300 public service workers. The South Australian government recently announced that, as a result of budget pressures and the typical template of Labor economic mismanagement, they are actually cutting 350 jobs from the public hospital system, which will see at least 114 beds lost. In total, the South Australia government plans to slash 1,400 public servants. At the federal level, Labor's own modelling projects 4,200 full-time jobs will be cut from the federal Public Service, with the very real possibility that 12,000 employees will have lost their jobs by the end of 2014-15. Have we heard anything from the federal Labor minister about these cuts? Of course not.


The debate today comes down to one basic fact: the employment conditions and the employment numbers for Australians are best when the economy is performing well. The members of this House who will manage the economy well for all Australians stand on this side of the chamber. Only the coalition has the policies and experience to reset our country's course to one that sees increasing confidence, renewed productivity growth and real improvement in the wealth of households. The next election will offer the Australian people a clear choice of three more years of Labor dysfunction and division or a new government with the experience and plans to deliver a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia—indeed hope, reward and opportunity for all Australian workers.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (21:22):  Slashing and burning, cutting and pillaging—that is the record of the Queensland LNP government, the New South Wales LNP government and the Victorian LNP government. This side of politics, the federal Labor government, has always supported the hardworking public servants in this country. There are about 1.8 million of them who serve this country well, from the Torres Strait to Tasmania, from Palm Beach right across to Perth.


At a federal level we know that those opposite have a proposal to cut 20,000 jobs from Commonwealth public sector. Why do we know that that is a promise they will fulfil? Because of the record of those opposite—Ted Baillieu, their mate, Campbell Newman, their comrade, and of course Barry O'Farrell, their friend. Their record in both states shows that quite clearly. In Queensland, my home state, Campbell Newman has cut over 14,000 full-time public sector jobs and there are another approximately 7,000 who work on contracts as well. These are people like teachers, nurses, community workers, domestic violence counsellors, people who work in child safety and disability services. He even proposes to get rid of people who work in Eventide, a state run aged care facility. Then there are the people in the rural fire brigades, those who work in regional councils, those who work in flood recovery community work and those who work in the drug courts and the Murri courts. Even the tenancy advocacy services were proposed to be slashed and we had to step in to save them.


Campbell Newman and the LNP state government in Queensland have betrayed the workers. He said that public sector workers had nothing to fear from him. That is what he said in April 2011. He betrayed the people who elected him. There are TAFE cuts on the go. There is a proposal to cut the number of TAFE campuses and educational institutions from 82 to 44, and Bremer TAFE in Ipswich, in my electorate, is under the gun as well.


Campbell Newman calls what he has done 'revitalisation'. Those opposite claim that he is there to 'clean up the mess'. The member for Ryan was in his political party, on his team, in the Brisbane City Council. What is the legacy Campbell Newman left to the Brisbane City Council? It is $2.4 billion in debt. They are figures that the Brisbane City Council budget records show. That is what he left to the Brisbane City Council. He got out leaving them with a terrible legacy and now he purports to come into the Queensland parliament to allegedly fix up Labor's debt.


That is what he claims, but he has betrayed even his own members. We have seen that in the last 24 hours. We have seen the member for Condamine, Ray Hopper, come out and say it and now he has decided to desert the ship. He has decided to actually stand up for his constituents. The LNP members opposite never stand up for their constituents in this place. They never stand up to Campbell Newman on behalf of Queensland; they always stand up for Campbell Newman. You can see them, one after another. In August this year we even saw former LNP life member Clive Palmer giving the Together union, which helps represent public sector workers in Queensland, $250,000 to create the Hope Fund to provide impacted former public sector employees with counselling and vocational training. Mr Palmer has become so disillusioned with the LNP government in Queensland he resigned his membership.


We have had to step in to help public sector workers in Queensland. The Queensland Council of Unions estimates that 900 jobs have been lost in my electorate. Indeed, the unemployment rate in Ipswich went up 0.6 per cent in a month at the height of the cuts from the Campbell Newman government. That is the impact they have had. On 24 October the federal Labor government staged a government jobs and information workshop at Ipswich. The LNP member for Ipswich claimed there were only a few people in Ipswich who had lost their jobs. Well, I was there at that workshop and there were dozens and dozens of public servants in Ipswich who had lost their jobs, right across the sector. I spoke to many of them. This was part of an $850,000 federal Labor government support package for the 14,000 affected public sector workers. We have run jobs and skills expos in Brisbane and Logan.


The reality is that coalition governments do not value the public sector. They do not value the services it provides. Look at what their attitude is. We have seen those opposite come out in support of what Campbell Newman has done in Queensland. The shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, the member for North Sydney, praised Campbell Newman's savage cuts, saying in the Age on 7 September 2012: 'All strength to his right arm. He's showing incredible courage'—sacking people. We have seen Campbell Newman— (Time expired)

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (21:27):  This motion has two distinct parts. The first part of the motion deals with concerns about job losses in state governments around Australia and raises issues surrounding bargaining for wages and conditions in the public sector. The second part of the motion seeks a referral to the Standing Committee on Education and Employment for an inquiry into conditions of employment of state public sector employees, and I oppose that referral.


I find this motion extraordinary on a number of counts. As we are all well aware, not all states have opted to refer their industrial relations arrangements to the Commonwealth, and for some states there was only a partial referral. In Queensland and in New South Wales public sector employees are not covered by the Fair Work Act because successive Labor governments did not refer powers to the Commonwealth in respect of public sector employees and local government employees. Clearly, if federal Labor were to support this motion, it would be casting a vote of no confidence in the former Labor state governments of New South Wales and Queensland.


That the member for Melbourne now thinks that intervention in this area of workplace law by the federal parliament is somehow desirable is quite clearly misconceived. It directly challenges the right of the states to determine their own employment affairs. It is appropriate that, unless there is a direct referral of powers, terms and conditions of employment for state public sector employees fall under the jurisdiction of the state industrial system. It is not for the federal parliament to inquire into the terms and conditions of employment of state public sector employees and there should be no referral to the Standing Committee on Education and Employment.


The motion also refers to the supposed difficulties that public sector employees face in bargaining over wages and conditions. I would say that is not the case. In many industry sectors, public sector awards are the pacesetters and private sector awards follow and are very in line with the public sector. The same occurs in collective bargaining negotiations: the public sector leads the way and the private sector negotiations follow. Some unions actively seek to finalise agreements with the public sector before negotiating with the private sector—

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (21:30):  I rise tonight to put on the record details that have been left out of recent media reports in relation to the case surrounding two Australians on trial in Dubai and canvassed most recently in the Weekend Australian. As with every story, there are two sides, and I want to ensure that a local Gold Coast business, Sunland, with 30 years of experience as a solid Australian corporate citizen, is not tarnished by a media that has chosen to tell only half the story. In the story written by Cameron Stewart for the Weekend Australian,he states:


The bribery charges for which he—


Joyce—


was arrested in Dubai in 2009 were tested in the Victorian Supreme Court this year and found to be without foundation. … Sunland … was found by the Australian judge to have ""commenced and continued the present proceedings in wilful disregard of known facts and law"" and with ""a willingness to implicate Joyce unjustifiably"".


The case to which Cameron Stewart refers is currently being appealed by Sunland on the basis that Justice Croft failed to consider a substantial amount of documentary evidence, including evidence of Joyce and Reed planning to deceive Sunland, evidence of the falsification of documents by Joyce or Reed, and evidence of the distribution of half of the payment made by Sunland to Reed's company, approximately $7 million, from Reed to Joyce, who at the time was a senior public servant in Dubai.


The receipt of that $7 million by Joyce is the basis for the bribery charge Joyce faces in Dubai. However, that bribery charge was not tested in the Victorian Supreme Court. Although the evidence of the bribe, and documents from the Dubai investigation and the Dubai Court file, were put before the Victorian Supreme Court, Justice Croft refused to consider them and said they were irrelevant. In his 300-page judgement, Justice Croft made not one mention of the fact that Reed paid Joyce $7 million and that Joyce has been charged with bribery in Dubai for receiving that $7 million. Further, Cameron Stewart wrote: 


Joyce is not alone. His former work colleague Marcus Lee, 43, was also arrested in 2009 on similar charges, despite Sunland having belatedly admitted this year that some of its claims against him, which formed the basis of his prosecution, were wrong.


The facts are that Mr Lee has been charged by the Dubai authorities because of his role in facilitating the transaction. The Dubai authorities assert that Lee deliberately undervalued the land in question in order to deliver a larger premium to Reed and Joyce. Lee's valuation provided a basis for Joyce to reduce the price. Sunland had no knowledge that Reed and Joyce knew one another until after Joyce was arrested. Sunland has made no comment on claims against Lee in Dubai. Sunland did correct minor facts—telephone numbers and dates—relating to Lee's dealings with Sunland, but those facts are not the basis of the Dubai prosecutor's claim against Lee. The most damning evidence is a Dubai audit report of 2009—never tested in Australia—that states:


Lee deliberately presented misleading and inaccurate information and omitted some data and studies which were necessary to determine the sale price …


This is from page 5 of a 2009 government of Dubai Financial Audit Department report.


According to the Weekend Australian: 


Dubai authorities alleged that the $14 million payment by Sunland to a company called Prudentia, which was controlled by Joyce's colleague and fellow Geelong Grammar graduate Angus Reed, was an illegal commission. Sunland claimed it should not bear the blame for the payment because it was Joyce and Reed who helped facilitate it.


The facts are that the Dubai authorities never alleged that Sunland's payment to Prudentia was an illegal commission. Nor did the Dubai authorities seek to 'blame' Sunland for having made a payment to Reed. That was an assertion made by Joyce's and Reed's lawyers in the Victorian Supreme Court as part of a conspiracy theory put forward to damage Sunland, but it was contrary to the evidence in both the Victorian court and the Dubai court. The evidence of the bribe was uncovered by searches carried out of Joyce's home and office and of Joyce's Dubai lawyers' office and by other extensive investigations in Dubai.


It did not rely on any evidence from Sunland but rather the Dubai Financial Audit Department's report of April 2009 stated in relation to Joyce:


Joyce Has informed and directed Sunland that there are rights on plot no D17 in favour of some Australian individuals through a company called Prudential Investment, contrary to the true state of affairs.


He—


Joyce—


approved the business case determining the square foot sale price for 120 dirhams per square foot—


which is widely acknowledged to be 30 per cent lower than market value. It went on:


It is proved that the accused has received a commission of 6 million Australian dollars—


based on exchange rates at the time—


through his account with Standard Bank Jersey from the commission paid to the so-called Angus Reed amounting to about 12 million Australian dollars.


Again, this is from page 5 of the Financial Audit Department report.


The Weekend Australian article further states:


Even though Lee was not involved in negotiations over D17 he was caught up in the charges because he prepared a report in relation to the sale of the land at the request of his superiors. Two other Australian colleagues of Joyce who were not in Dubai at that time, Anthony Brearley and Reed, were also charged in relation to the D17 negotiations.


The facts are that Mr Lee prepared the business case on behalf of a company called Dubai Waterfront, including a valuation. Lee's superior who requested him to prepare the report was Joyce. Anthony Brearley was an in-house lawyer at Dubai Waterfront. I have more. I seek leave to table a document in relation to the issue.




Ms King:
  I am a little reluctant to grant leave, as it appears to be a legal matter that I do not have any information about. 


Leave not granted.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:30):  I take the opportunity this morning to update the House on medical and health issues in my electorate of Swan. On 15 November I met with Jeanette Hackett the Vice-Chancellor of Curtin University, Professor William Hart, the head of medicine, along with Western Australian Senator Eggleston to discuss Curtin University's proposal for a new medical school at the Bentley campus, which is currently being considered by the federal government. It was good to visit the university with Senator Eggleston who, of course, has plenty of experience in medical matters, having been a practising doctor in the north-west of Western Australia for many years before he became a senator. We were able to tour the biosciences research precinct and discuss the medical school proposal in more detail with Ms Hackett and Professor Hart. Senator Eggleston and I are supportive of the medical school.


There is a shortage of doctors in WA. An article in the West Australian last weekend suggested that there was a shortage of 1,000 GPs across the state. Due to the shortage, we are currently taking overseas trained doctors, and we have been looking into some of the issues surrounding this trend in the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing with a report that was recently tabled. There are many overseas trained doctors across my electorate and they are much loved by the local communities they loyally serve. However, stats suggest that, even with these overseas doctors, we are not meeting the demand for GPs, and we need to look to the future and encourage as many people as possible to study medicine in WA. This needs to be a priority for all WA MPs from all parties. Curtin University is willing to be part of this drive to secure more doctors and we need to support them. Once again, in the chamber, I urge the federal government to provide support.


Over time, the new medical school could also strengthen Bentley Hospital with potential partnerships to be developed. We worked hard at Bentley Hospital to keep elective surgery services and to secure a commitment from the Barnett government to review a Labor decision to remove maternity services in 2014. We must keep a strong local hospital in Swan, and I will continue to support the Bentley Hospital.


On a further health issue, I have been working with John McGrath, the member for South Perth, to resolve an issue at the Mends Street Medical Centre in South Perth. The centre, which is popular among local residents, was closed recently after management problems. The doctors and the rent were not being paid, and the centre could not remain open. John McGrath and I have been in discussions with the AMA, the doctors and the patients in our attempts to have the centre reopened. The good news is that the centre has now been reopened after issues with the lease were resolved. We have met the new owner, Paris, who is in the process of opening the new centre. We will continue to work with Paris to help her resolve the many issues associated with reopening, including accessing medical files. Community services are important in Swan and health services in particular are essential. I continue to work with these for the community services in my electorate of Swan.

Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (11:00):  When I submitted this notice of motion condemning the Newman government for its attacks on recreational fishing, I thought I would be making quite a statement on behalf of rec fishers in Central Queensland and across the state. Here was my opportunity to get stuck into this shocking government, condemning it in the strongest terms for its arrogant and dismissive treatment of this important section of the community and a significant part of our local economy. But, as it turns out, condemnation of the Newman government does not have quite the same currency today that I expected it would. Condemning the Newman government is becoming quite a crowded field—now everyone is in on the act.


In just the past couple of days we have had Clive Palmer—life member of the LNP and the man who bankrolled the party into power—resign from the party in protest against what Campbell Newman is doing to Queensland. And yesterday we got the news that Ray Hopper, a long-serving LNP member of parliament, has left the party to sit in parliament as a member of the Katter party. He, too, did not want to be part of what the Newman LNP government is dishing out to Queensland and to regional Queensland in particular. When it comes to condemning the Newman government, it is hard for me to compete with the likes of Clive Palmer when he says:


… the current government is much worse than anything that was around at the time of the Fitzgerald inquiry—


and—


… I do think the government is crooked.


It is strange days indeed when I find myself in the same camp as Clive Palmer, but these are strange days in Queensland and dark days, too, under the leadership of Campbell Newman and the LNP government.


Amongst the many groups in Queensland who are feeling let down and under attack from the LNP government is recreational fishers and their representatives in Sunfish. Before the state election in March, the LNP told recreational fishers in writing that, if elected:


… an LNP government will work closely with stakeholders to enhance the experience of recreational fishers in Queensland.


Like so many others in Queensland, such as public servants, rural firefighters and community service organisations, recreational fishers are now learning that the LNP's promises are worth nothing now that it is in power—and in absolute power in a way never seen before in our state or any other. Barely eight months after the election, the Newman led LNP state government has already broken its pre-election promises regarding its support for recreational fishing and is in the process of setting back fisheries management in Queensland to failed models that were consigned to history in Australia a decade or more ago.


Recreational fishing in Queensland has been an integral part of the state's culture and heritage since white settlement. In its own election policy statements, the LNP promoted the fact that there are currently over 750,000 Queenslanders who enjoy recreational fishing and promised that it would 'restore the health of Queensland's fishery'. Up to 30 per cent of the population of some coastal regions in Queensland engage in this healthy outdoor activity and contribute, conservatively, many millions of dollars into the state's economy every year. So it is extremely concerning to watch the new LNP state government now thumb its nose at recreational fishers and withdraw funding from a range of critically important programs and initiatives.


These cuts include: an $8 million cut from the fisheries budget, 60 jobs cut from fisheries Queensland, the cessation of funding to Sunfish Queensland, the cessation of the fisheries observer program, the cessation of the industry development program for commercial and recreational fishing, the cessation of the Fishcare volunteer program and the cutting of all funding to the national Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, which is about the future of fisheries in our state and, indeed, Australia. The list goes on.


Of particular concern to recreational fishers in Central Queensland is the way these cuts will hit fish-stocking groups and the internationally recognised and acclaimed Suntag fish-tagging program—the brainchild of Bill Sawnyok in my electorate. The recreational fishing community feel betrayed by a government that said nothing about these cuts before the election. Robin Caddy, President of the Freshwater Fishing and Stocking Association of Queensland, said of the cuts, 'To be treated in this manner is deplorable.' David Bateman, Chairman of Sunfish, said in Bush 'n Beach Fishing magazine that his delegates were astounded that the government's first actions were to cut recreational fishing community projects.


Recreational fishers and their representatives—as members here from Queensland and elsewhere know—are passionate and knowledgeable about their sport of fishing, and deserve to have their concerns and ideas about fisheries management taken seriously by the state government. They have important things to say about the best models for fisheries management and need to be listened to.


It has been reported to me by constituents who attended the National Recreational Fishing Conference, on the Gold Coast in August this year, that they were actually embarrassed to admit they came from Queensland when they saw all the good things being done in other states by fisheries departments. Interestingly, it should be noted that Senator Joe Ludwig, the Commonwealth minister with responsibility for fisheries, attended and spoke at the national conference. I believe that the federal government put some sponsorship towards that national conference as well. The federal minister attended while Queensland's fisheries minister McVeigh declined the invitation to attend and was, in fact, conspicuous by his absence. Deputy Speaker, what sort of message did that send to recreational fishers in Queensland? I have a fair idea about how recreational fishers are feeling when I returned from a glorious day out on Keppel Bay in our family's tinny in early October. The carpark at the Rosslyn Bay boat ramp was absolutely packed, and every vehicle had a notice on its windscreen telling boaties and fishers about what the LNP state government is proposing to do with the money they paid towards recreational fishing initiatives.


Since the mid-1990s, Queensland recreational boat owners have been paying an additional levy—I think it is about $18—on top of their annual boat registration payment. That levy has been specifically quarantined to be used for the direct benefit of recreational fishers in Queensland. This levy was introduced as a recommendation of the Labor Party's groundbreaking Burns inquiry into recreational fishing in Queensland. Of course, that reference to the Burns inquiry is a reference to the beloved Tom Burns who members on this side of the House and most Queenslanders would recognise as one of the strongest advocates for recreational fishers, and indeed one of the strongest practitioners of recreational fishing that you could find. That was originally called the private pleasure vessel levy, but evolved into the recreational use fee a decade or so ago. However, these funds have continued to be largely directed to programs and projects that do benefit recreational fishing, that is, until now. Unofficial advice from Fisheries Queensland to Sunfish members has confirmed that around half of the funds raised this year from the recreational user fee—an estimated $4½ million—will be directed towards the core business operations of the agency. So, it is not for fish-tagging programs, not for fish-stocking programs, not for the teach your kids to fish programs that have been so popular amongst the recreational fishing community. In other words, the Newman government is raiding funds that come from the recreational fishing community to pay for the core operational costs of running its department. The minister has denied this, but we are getting used to the Queensland government running for cover when the community starts to react to its broken promises and cuts to important programs and services.


The fact is that the cuts to jobs and programs and attacks on community-level organisations, which Sunfish is campaigning against, are completely consistent with the Newman government's approach and track record in government. The recreational fishing community is now experiencing the same treatment from the Newman government as so many other parts of Queensland—cuts in funding and scrapping of programs that had broad community support and denigration by the government when they dared to oppose its destructive agenda. Cutting funding to the peak body, Sunfish, and sidelining it from involvement in fishing policies is an attempt to shut down opposition from the sector. In my 15 years of experience, I have found Sunfish to be a valuable voice in issues and debates regarding matters that affect the recreational fishing community and the fishing sector more broadly. I especially remember and pay tribute to the leadership shown by local Sunfish representatives at the time that we were trying to get the best outcome for Central Queensland fishers from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park's Green Zone process 10 years ago. Local Sunfish delegates worked closely with me and the chair of GBRMPA at the time, the Hon. Virginia Chadwick, and played a very constructive role in coordinating the views of our local fishing community and putting them forward to GBRMPA to achieve a successful outcome.


Most recreational fishers prefer just to go fishing rather getting involved in politics. However, I am seeing a growing anger among the recreational fishing community in Queensland, which is going to result in a backlash against the arrogance of the Newman government. I wish this sector  and their representatives all the best, and will support their efforts where I can. I know I am joined by my stage Labor colleague the member for Rockhampton, Bill Byrne, who will be speaking on this matter in state parliament tomorrow night.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:10):  I rise to speak on the matter before the house. I am a great supporter of Sunfish. I think they are great organisation. The Deputy Mayor of Townsville, Vern Veitch, is a former North Queensland representative of Sunfish. The member for Capricornia has said that the organisation is going to be decimated and that it is going to go away. It is a membership based organisation and what the Newman government has done is remove funding from a membership based organisation. It is not the death of Sunfish—far from it—and it is not the death of recreational fishing as she would have you believe. As a matter of fact, expenditure on recreational fishing services in 2012-13 will be in excess of $10 million from the Newman state government such as: compliance, surveillance and enforcement, including boat ramp signage and community service announcements, of over $3.2 million; communication and educational programs, including a free handbook for recreational fishers of $500,000; fish-stocking and recovery programs; pet fish education and marine habitat protection of $2 million; research, monitoring and reporting activities of $2.8 million; and scientific assessment and policy development of $2 million. Those are the things that, I think, the member for Capricornia may very well want to look back on.


I will include 100 per cent support for her words towards Tom Burns. Recreational fishing in Queensland has never had a better friend than Tom Burns and it is a legend that is boat was called The Electorate. When people would ring up his office and need to speak to the member they would say, 'I'm sorry, Mr Burns is out in The Electorate', which would be out on the bay having a good fish.


Let us be very realistic about this, only three per cent of recreational fishers are members of Sunfish which is a membership based organisation. Well may the member for Capricornia talk about growing anger in the recreational fishing public. It is not the problems we are having with Sunfish at the moment, it is the problem we are having with this government and the closure of the Coral Sea. I did not hear the member for Capricornia talk about this government's closure of the Coral Sea. I did not hear her talk about the lack of science or the lack of any sort of science based on making the decision to close the Coral Sea. What I hear is the minister for environment Mr Burke say that the science was specifically excluded from the decision to close the Coral Sea.


We campaigned hard in 2010 and said that a vote for Labor was a vote to close down the Coral Sea. I was on a radio fishing show with the then-candidate for the Labor Party at that election. He poked me in the chest and said, over the airwaves, that it was something starting with 'bull' and ending with the letter 'T'. He said it would not happen and that he would cross the floor if it did happen. We said that the problem you have here is that the Labor Party is beholden to the Greens. Whatever the Greens say they will do. So, straight up, they form the government and go straight to closing the Coral Sea. The Pew Foundation was in North Queensland for nearly 2½ days, and this government just jumped on it and closed the Coral Sea, without one ounce of science.


While this has been going on the operational funding for the Australian Institute of Marine Science has been cut. They have a $120 million boat sitting down at the wharf that they cannot afford to operate as they should. I should back up Minister Burke here. The recreational fisher, with the closure of the Coral Sea, is not under such great duress. It is a long way from the base at Townsville, about 300 kilometres. The recreational fishers are asking, 'What's going to happen next?' As with everything else, the government have a flippant disregard for what they said before the election. They said there would be no carbon tax, that they would not touch private health insurance or the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme and that there would be cuts in company tax. They do backflips galore. What the recreational fishers are most worried about is what is going to happen next. Straightaway GetUp has mounted a campaign, the 'Protect our Coral Sea' campaign, urging you to do all you can to protect a special place from future development through a comprehensive and effective management plan—to extend the marine park zone around Shark, Vema and Osprey reefs off Cairns. Within two weeks of the decision coming down, the government are beholden to the Greens and already a campaign to close out recreational fishers is happening. So, if you experience extreme anger from recreational fishers every time you pull up to put a tinnie in the water, it will be because the government cannot be trusted.


We went to the 2010 elections saying that we would stop this, but we have not been able to. We had a recreational fishing forum in Townsville just recently. The forum wanted it recognised that the ability to go out the front and have a fish is part of our lifestyle. The recreational fishers in Townsville want it recognised that they are the environment's friend, not its enemy. There is no-one in North Queensland or Central Queensland going out the front and dropping sticks of gelignite in the water as this government seems to be portraying the recreational fishers doing.


The Howard government established the green zones. There was a lot of disquiet about the establishment of green zones. But the recreational fishers are admitting that the establishment of green zones off the coast of Australia has been a fantastic success. What we need to do now is extend that to establish artificial reefs so that when those fish get hunted off the green zones they have somewhere to go and can get bigger. We need to have an artificial reef in a yellow zone, where you would have no anchor and either trawl or have one fish/one rod and fish those areas there. That is what recreational fishermen want. The recreational fisher wants something positive from this government, and this government is doing everything it can to make it harder for the recreational fisher—because this government is beholden to the Greens. This government is prepared to sacrifice everyone in Queensland so that every Vespa riding, black skivvy wearing, soy latte drinking Greenie in the inner cities of Sydney and Melbourne can sit there and vote for them. They are prepared to kiss it goodbye.


All the way through this, we do support the recreational fisher and we do support the commercial fishing industry. Sunfish, as I said, is a membership based organisation. When left with 20 years of Labor mismanagement, there are some things that are very uncomfortable to do. As I said before, when it comes down to what is actually happening there—and you will see what the Newman government is doing for recreational fishers—it is a very, very good picture. Sunfish is not going to go away. Sunfish is a membership based organisation. As with everything else, it will have its state funding removed and then can go and approach more people. More than three per cent of the recreational fishers are members of Sunfish. Sunfish as an organisation must grow that. All the way through this, you see what the Newman government has done.



Mr Neumann interjecting—




Mr EWEN JONES:
  In excess of $10 million for recreational fishers in 2012-13. The Campbell Newman led government in Queensland is the government that cares about all Queenslanders—not like this federal Labor government, who are prepared to kiss goodbye to everyone in Queensland to try and shore up some seats in inner-city Sydney and Melbourne. That is what the federal Labor government are trying to do. They are doing everything they possibly can to destroy recreational fishing in North Queensland—and they should be stopped. Sunfish is a great organisation and can continue to be a great organisation, but it must develop its ownership base and adjust its focus to continue to be a great organisation. I thank the House.

"D'Ath, Yvette, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mrs D'ATH
 (Petrie) (11:20):  I rise to speak in support of the motion from the member for Capricornia and thank the member for bringing this very important motion forward so that people can hear the truth. I thank the member for Herbert for putting some truth in this debate. Finally we have a member of the opposition telling the truth about the marine parks and how far away the Coral Sea is from Townsville. I think the member for Herbert's words were that recreational fishers will not be affected because the Coral Sea is over 300 kilometres away from Townsville. Thank you for actually saying that. It was a long time coming. I will get to how far it is from Redcliffe Peninsula shortly.


I want to acknowledge the damage being done to Queensland's recreational fishing industry by the LNP and to voice my support for recreational fishers, particularly in and around my electorate of Petrie, which is bound by beautiful Moreton Bay. Just to recap, since his election Campbell Newman and the LNP government have cut $8 million from the fisheries budget, 60 jobs from fisheries Queensland, front-line fisheries researchers and funding for the National Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. But that was not enough. The LNP have also scrapped the funding for Sunfish Queensland, discontinued the Fishcare volunteer program, slashed the fisheries observer program, scaled back the freshwater fishing program, restructured the Queensland boating and fisheries patrol and rationalised Brisbane based senior management support services. And it is not just recreational fishers that Campbell Newman has in his sights. The LNP have also ceased the industry development program for commercial and recreational fishing and cut $125,000 from the Queensland Seafood Industry Association.


I know that locals in my community love to throw a line out in Moreton Bay and I do too. I know that Sunfish have always stood up for the right to do just that and I thank them for the advocacy over the years. There are four LNP state members across my electorate and not one of them has stood up to Campbell Newman on this issue. These cuts come despite pre-election promises by the Premier that the Public Service has nothing to fear and that the government would work with recreational fishers to enhance their experiences. Instead we find that by 'enhance' the LNP really meant 'cut' and when the LNP said they would not cut front-line services like fisheries officers they really meant that they would redefine the positions first. I thank Minister Ludwig, federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, for his representations to the LNP on behalf of recreational fishers and I look forward to hearing an explanation for this latest round of cuts, which are further damaging local communities like mine.


But it is not just LNP state members who owe local fishers an apology. Fishers across Moreton Bay and Brisbane's northside also deserve an apology and an explanation from the federal opposition over their recent scare campaign around the Coral Sea marine reserves. We heard from the member for Herbert about the rallies and protests against the impact on the marine park. The federal Liberal Party were so desperate to con locals in my area on this issue that they even distributed incorrect maps throughout my community, until we caught them out. On 14 November I was thrilled to hosts the Petrie community cabinet at Hercules Road State School on the Redcliffe Peninsula, where the Prime Minister, environment minister and fisheries minister took questions from residents on this issue. One woman, Wendy, asked if the Liberals were right when they said that locals would only be able to fish in their bathtubs from now on. The answer was a resounding no, and I thank the minister for the environment for setting the record straight on that occasion. The fact is that local fishers would have to travel over 400 kilometres from the Redcliffe Peninsula to visit our marine reserves. There are not a lot of tinnies equipped for that journey. In fact, the local candidates and Senator Boyce were all out there in Lilley, across the bridge from Redcliffe Peninsula. They have photos on their websites of a tinny with the bay right in the background. It must be a really good camera to be out further than 400 kilometres and make a tinny look like it is sitting near the beach with a line thrown in.


I make no apologies for protecting our environment for future generations. I congratulate the environment minister on the recent declaration and I thank the many residents in my electorate who have written to me in support of our action on this issue. The Gillard government is a strong supporter of Australian recreational fishing. That is why we developed and held roundtables chaired by the fisheries minister to hear directly from the industries. We have to have a balanced approach on this issue. I do not believe it is balanced when we hear from the member for Herbert that it is okay for the state government to take funding away from organisations if they are member based organisations. Go and tell all of my community organisations that are member based organisations: 'You should welcome these cuts. You can go out and get more members. It's a great way to build your organisation.' Organisations across the board are suffering in my community, including in fisheries and recreational fisheries; Sunfish is one of those. We stand by the great work they have done. We stand by our recreational fishers.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2012-11-26,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (11:25):  I am very surprised that this motion has even been raised in this place, because what we have here is a Labor government criticising a state government for cleaning up Labor's mess in Queensland. The colossal amount of Labor wastes in the resource-rich state of Queensland managed to send the state broke in the middle of the biggest mining boom that the state has ever seen. Such was Labor's track record for economic stupidity, so sick were taxpayers of seeing their tax dollars wasted, they delivered the most crushing electoral defeat on record for Labor. The reality for us Queenslanders is this: every day that we collectively get out of our beds we have to find $12 million just to pay the interest on the debt legacy that Labor left Queensland. That is $12 million a day, $84 million a week, over $360 million a month and over $1 billion a quarter, just in interest on Labor's debt. To put it in simple terms, in a bit over three days in Queensland the money we spend on interest alone—not paying off debt, just the interest on Labor's debt—could have been used to build a new school, maybe in Gracemere near the Capricornia electorate, or certainly in the member for Flynn's electorate. 


Every five weeks we spend enough money on interest for Labor's debt to build a new state-of-the-art regional hospital—perhaps it could have been used to build a new Rockhampton regional hospital. In six weeks the money spent on paying interest on Labor's debt could have paid for a complete upgrade of the Peak Downs Highway in the Capricornia electorate. If you wonder why spending on non-essential needs should be cut, then you have to look no further than the Australian Labor Party.


Here we have this Labor government, having posted the four biggest budget deficits in history, lecturing the Queensland government about how to spend money. What is worse is that Labor would have us believe through this motion that they are somehow the fisherman's friend. What a joke! It is like Wile E. Coyote asking the Road Runner out for a date. They have the hide to come in here and pretend to be the friend of the fishermen and try to shift the focus from their own ineptitude. The sheer hypocrisy of it coming from the same government that cut funding to RecFish, the peak body representing recreational fishers in this nation, on the ground that the organisation might disagree with them. And Labor are criticising the Queensland government for doing exactly the same thing. What debt did Labor have to pay off to cut the funding to RecFish, the national recreational fishing body? This Labor government is now wasting $100 million of taxpayer funds to shut down commercial fishing and give zero compensation to recreational fishing throughout all of the marine park closures around Australia.


This Labor government encouraged a super trawler to come to Australia, and then when the political heat came on it rewrote the law to give the environment minister the power to ban it, Then the government also gave him the power to shut down any new fishing activity in Commonwealth waters. These are all purely political motivations that are stopping criticism from key stakeholders and pandering to the Greens. Why is it that the Greens, who have but one representative in this House, are driving all the policy decisions? Is it because the Labor Party has no idea what to do? When your only skill is to waste money you need direction from somewhere, I suppose, but instead of talking with stakeholders the Labor Party takes its directions from a fringe party whose aim is to shut down every industry in Australia and set civilisation back 1,000 years.


Labor and the Greens are not the fisherman's friend. Labor and the Greens have no understanding about recreational fishing. Firmly wedged in their inner-city, latte-sipping suburbs, they think that seafood comes from restaurant kitchens and, maybe, the supermarket. They would not know a potato cod from a potato. For the benefit of those members opposite, I seek leave to table documents on the potato cod and the potato that show the difference. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Is leave granted?



A government member:  No.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Leave is not granted.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  They do not even want to know the difference. Information about the potato cod tabled or not, we know that these guys are prepared to mash the recreational and commercial fishing industry. They do not know fish, they do not know fishing, they do not know boats—unless they are full of illegals! We have the environment minister out there trying to sell the Coral Sea lockout, saying, 'Mums and dads are not going to take their tinny 300 kilometres out to sea.' Most of them do not take tinnies anywhere. If the environment minister took the time to go and look in the Mackay marina, for instance, he would not find tinnies docked there but very sophisticated and expensive craft that are capable of going out on five-day fishing trips, out beyond 300 kilometres. In North Queensland we have charter fishing companies that every day take people out to iconic and remote fishing locations for days at a time—places like Marion Reef, which Labor is going to shut down under these marine parks. If the environment minister consulted with the fishing industry he would know that, but instead he is too busy sending away to the Acme Company for the latest contraption to catch the latest roadrunner that the Greens are telling him to catch. Just like Wile E. Coyote, everything Labor has touched ends in disaster.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (11:30):  They cannot even defend their own state government's policies. As a fellow Queenslander I thank the member for Capricornia for making this House aware of the needless pain and anxiety experienced by public sector workers, by community groups, by service providers and by ordinary men and women in the fishing industry perpetrated and perpetuated by Campbell Newman and the LNP state government across Queensland. In my electorate, whether you are in the rural parts or in urban parts like Ipswich, the sentiment is the same; the common complaint is the same; the refrain is the same: Campbell Newman and the state LNP government in Queensland have betrayed the people of Queensland. It is not just union members, public sector workers and community sector workers; it is also recreational fisher men and women. Campbell Newman and the LNP government have misled them all. The LNP's own policy document for the state election said:



An LNP government will also commit to no forced redundancies.


What a joke! The Premier of Queensland also said, in April 2011, when he took over the role as LNP leader:


… the public service has nothing to fear from me.


What right-wing claptrap! It is not just bureaucrats, it is not just fat cats—as he would describe them—it is doctors and nurses, it is rural fire brigade officers, it is community workers and it is even recreational fishers. Perhaps he considers Sunfish Queensland to be a bastion of highly paid officials all living large of the public largesse. You will even hear that from the tone of those opposite. Before the Queensland election, the LNP told recreational fishers that 'an LNP government will work closely with stakeholders to enhance the experience of recreational fishers in Queensland'. At best, that is another broken promise; at worst, that is an example of blatant disregard for honesty within the Queensland LNP state government.


In contrast, this federal Labor government, despite the bleatings, whinings and moanings of those opposite, is a strong supporter of the Australian recreational fishing industry. We developed and held recreational fishing roundtables chaired by the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Joseph Ludwig, bringing the sector straight to government. We supported the National Recreational Fishing Conference and we funded and implemented the national strategy for recreational fishing. At present we are engaged in the biggest single review of fisheries legislation in the history of the Commonwealth and we are looking at how the recreational sector fits into that framework. We have been able to balance the needs and rights of recreational fishers with the need to protect the environment. In Queensland, the LNP government has slashed and burned—not just in the public sector but also across the recreational fishing industries.


We know that the arrogant actions of the LNP state government in Queensland will be replicated by those opposite. We cannot trust anything their state colleagues in Queensland say, nor their federal counterparts. More hollow words and spin we have heard from the member for Herbert and the member for Dawson today.


But what have the LNP state government in Queensland done? They have cut $8 million from the fisheries budget. They have cut 60 jobs. They have ceased the fisheries observer program. They have ceased the Queensland Fishcare volunteers program. They have ceased operational activity for waterway barrier works and construction. They have cut all funding to the national Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. Again and again they have slashed and burned. They have not provided funding for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation this year and they have axed all funding to Sunfish Queensland.


The stakeholders are livid about this. Look at what they have said. Mr Robin Caddy, President of the Freshwater Fishing and Stocking Association of Queensland, said—as quoted in Bush 'n Beach Fishing magazine—of the cuts by the LNP state government: 'To be treated in this manner is deplorable.' Mr David Bateman, the chair of Sunfish, said that his delegates 'were astounded that the government's first action was to cut recreational fishing community projects', as quoted in that same magazine. Sunfish also said a recent letter from the LNP state minister in Queensland, Minister McVeigh, was full of 'electioneering, half-truths and inaccuracies'. The Queensland Seafood Industry Association, in its media release of 27 September, said this: 'The Queensland Seafood Industry Association has expressed serious concern about cutbacks to services announced in Fisheries Queensland. In particular, discontinuing the fisheries observer program and withdrawing funding to the federal government's Fisheries Research and Development Corporation are worrying.' That is what the stakeholders say. Those opposite cannot quote stakeholders, we know, because the stakeholders are livid with what they have done. They go on with their disingenuous argument, completely scaremongering, about what we have done in terms of Coral Sea Marine Park announcements and management.


The member for Herbert in his speech told the truth when it came to the distances and the fact that these marine parks will do good for the environment, but they will not impinge on the recreational fishing industry. Those opposite should stand up to Campbell Newman and stand up for Queensland.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2012-11-26,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (11:35):  The motion highlights that the federal government is completely out of touch with the Australian fishing industry. They are clearly in no position to be critical of the Queensland state government given the lockup of vast areas of our fishing based on a whim. More than 100 regional communities and many more businesses throughout Australia rely on the fishing industry for their livelihoods, but, despite this, the proportion of wild catch in Australia represents just 0.002 per cent of production worldwide. We export $1.5 billion and import $2.5 billion worth of product, which makes Australia a net importer of fish product. Australian seafood only makes up 30 per cent of domestic supply. Our fishers operate to world's best practice. Of the 70 per cent of imported product, three countries make up the bulk of that figure: Thailand, 26 per cent; China, 14 per cent; and Vietnam, 12 per cent. In 2009, an estimation of adherence to the UN code of conduct put Australia fourth out of 53 countries. Vietnam was ranked 45th, Thailand was ranked 42nd and China was ranked 22nd.


Like many other industries in this country, Australian fishers operate to world's best practice. Queensland already has a massive area of its waters under protection, which in itself is not a bad thing. However, knowing that we can barely monitor and police the current no-go-zones, locking up more of our waters will only open the back door for illegal operators. We currently cannot control the number of people coming to Australia and we certainly cannot control illegal fishing in our northern waters, and probably other waters around Australia. Northern Australia is virtually: 'Look on—we can't do anything about it because we haven't got the manpower to control the reefs.' There are no species of fish in Queensland waters that are under threat and there was no need to increase the Coral Sea by 2.3 million square kilometres. There was no scientific evidence to support this closure.



A government member:  Rubbish!




Mr O'DOWD:
  That is not rubbish, my friend. Read the facts. The Queensland LNP government have cut off a measly $200,000 from Sunfish, which is an industry based organisation and only has three per cent community membership. The minister has announced that the government will no longer fund bodies such as Sunfish and Suntag. The government was voted in by the Queensland people and they have had to cut costs. The Anna Bligh government ran the state into the ground and there had to be cutbacks somewhere.




Mr Neumann:
  Sacking people in your electorate—that is a good idea, is it?




Mr O'DOWD:
  Sacking the government was a good idea, I can tell you that. The people of Queensland have spoken and now Campbell Newman has the mandate to make these changes. In fact, everyone knows he has to in response to the appalling state of the Queensland economy. It is the worst of any state in Australia, including Tasmania. We are badly off. To anyone who lives in Queensland: if you do not know that, you do not know much.


Tony Burke is the single biggest threat to recreational fishers of Queensland. He did not listen to Sunfish or anyone else when he made his decisions on the extended marine park network. The Australian recreational fishing industry is the largest stakeholder affected by this lockout. These fishers are locked out forever—not for just one day, one month or one year—and there is no compensation as such. There is no compensation for on-land stakeholders either. I am talking about boat shops, tackle shops and the like, and they support the community and our economic base. Just two weeks ago, Mr Burke locked up another 2.3 million square kilometres to Australian fisheries. This is a disgrace. He we are, an island nation, and we are importing more than we are exporting. That in itself should tell you a story. We do not need any more interference into our fishing. It should be more like New Zealand who have a self managed industry and it works very well. We should listen to them a little bit more often in this particular case. It simply highlights that the Labor government has no desire to admit that their policies are hurting the Australian fishing industry, which are not based on any scientific evidence whatsoever.

 (Page) (11:40):  In listening to the honourable member for Flynn speaking—can I say I like the honourable member for Flynn and he seems like a good fellow—how can it be a good idea to cut jobs in your own electorates? It is never a good idea no matter who does it. People can claim all sorts of mandates, but the fact is there is no mandate for the Queensland Premier to do it. I am speaking in support of this motion for a number of reasons. I live in New South Wales, not in Queensland. I live in the Northern Rivers.




Mr Neumann:
  She comes from Ipswich.




Ms SAFFIN:
  Yes, I grew up in Ipswich as the honourable member for Blair said. I am in an area where I see all this happening just over the border. I have been watching all the things that Premier Campbell Newman has been doing by taking the axe to the public service, to services, to the community and to projects and programs that matter in the community. What can matter more than recreational fishing? Recreational fishing is huge Australia-wide. It is huge in my seat of Page. We have recreational fishers everywhere. Even if you were not able to make a decision on policy grounds, why would you go and put the axe through recreational fishing programs on political grounds alone? Equally, it is also an industry. It is a huge industry with a huge economic base in regional areas. That is an important point to focus on and remember. By cutting their programs, cutting money to them, it has an impact at a regional economic level and it does not make sense to do it.


In watching what is going on in Queensland, some of it was going on in New South Wales with Premier O'Farrell. But Premier Newman seems to have emboldened Premier O'Farrell even more. He has taken the axe to programs left, right and centre. Anything that is not bolted down is up for the axe. In my area alone we have had the issue of Grafton jail. It was to close and then they wound it down and nearly 100 jobs would go. Jobs are going in TAFE. There are billions of dollars going out of TAFE.



Honourable members interjecting—




Ms SAFFIN:
  Well, there is a jail and it provides a lot of jobs to local people. You cannot replicate those jobs easily and they have gone. There is the whole spin-off effect in the local area. Also the slasher is going through TAFE.



Government members interjecting—




Ms SAFFIN:
  It is a shame. People can say, 'We want smaller government.' But this is ridiculous. These are front line people who deliver services. The ambos have been affected too as well as the firies.



Honourable members interjecting—




Ms SAFFIN:
  Yes, the rural fire brigade as well as the fire service are all being affected. On Friday night in Lismore I opened a fine art exhibition at Lismore TAFE which was called 'Last Draw'. It was actually the last of its kind because the program that they run is also being axed. There were over 100 students there and some of them were from a whole range of backgrounds, and a lot of them end up with work. We have a huge creative industry in my area. It is an industry in its own right and it provides enormous economic benefits to the community. It is really short-sighted to put the axe through programs like this. There were over 100 students there from a whole range of diverse backgrounds. It has given some of them a whole new life. Some of them were in recovery. They have done this course. It has given them a place to belong; it has also given them skills that they can go out into the community and earn money with.


When I look at what is happening to recreational fishing in Queensland I look with alarm, and I realise what it has done to Sunfish Queensland Inc. I have read all of their statements and they say:


The Queensland Government fully supports recreational fishing in Queensland.


Then why is its first act to cut funding to voluntary community recreational projects?

Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (11:45):  I rise to speak on this motion with amazement. I cannot believe the barefaced cheek of the member for Capricornia in daring to point the finger at the Queensland government when, without doubt, the biggest threat to recreational fishing is the federal Labor government. It reminds me of the statement the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd, made before the 2007 election. He said: 'The Howard government's reckless spending must stop.' Isn't that a joke! The Howard government inherited a $96 billion national government debt, which we turned into an unencumbered $20 billion surplus. In comparison, Labor turned the $20 billion surplus into a very greatly encumbered $150 billion black hole in considerably less than five years. Labor's mismanagement of the country has included live exports, the super trawler, pink batts et cetera, not to mention the mining tax, which is a new low even for them—a tax which ended up costing the government money.


For the Labor Party, the reality is irrelevant as long as you tell the public you are doing the right thing. The member for Capricornia's motion is surely an own goal. Labor and Minister Burke are clearly the bigger threats to recreational fishing. It was the member for Watson, as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who removed all funding from the recreational fishing peak body, Recfish, in 2010, an act that was surely revenge for Recfish's daring to question the minister and lobby against the minister to try to bring some common sense into this debate. It was Minister Burke as fisheries minister who refused to take phone calls over the government's decision to ban mako shark fishing in 2010. He hid. And it was Minister Burke as Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities who has locked up another 2.3 million square kilometres of Australia's oceans. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences socioeconomic analysis into the impact of this massive lockup of ocean did not even consider recreational fishers. Recreational fishers, understandably, are not that happy with the federal government. There is no compensation for recreational fishers and the associated fishing industry, boat shops, tackle shops and the communities they support.


We are not just being critical. You may ask: what will we do? The coalition supports maritime protection that is based on peer reviewed science and developed in consultation with the community, and that clearly includes recreational fishers. We recognise that Australia's fisheries are amongst the best managed in the world. The coalition is committed to restoring balance and a future coalition government will appoint a science based panel to review all boundaries and all zones. The coalition has introduced a 'Making marine parks accountable' amendment to the EPBC Act into the parliament. This legislation requires the environment minister to commission an independent social and economic impact assessment before any proclamations are made, obtain independent peer reviewed scientific advice before making any proclamations and for this advice to be publicly available, and establish independent scientific reference panels and stakeholder advisory groups for each region to ensure rigorous decision making. The proclamation of many reserves will be disallowable, meaning it will be subject to the scrutiny of both houses of the Australian parliament. The coalition in opposition is doing what the government should be doing in government: implementing sound policy.


What has Labor really done for recreational fishers? It has ignored their phone calls. It has pitted stakeholder groups against one another—fishing against environment, even recreational fishing interests against commercial fishing interests. They have locked Aussies out of Australian oceans.



Honourable members interjecting—


They have completely removed funding from the recreational fishers' peak industry body in an act of revenge. They have failed to understand or even investigate the impact of marine parks on recreational fishers and the important economic contribution recreational fishing makes to coastal communities. They have pandered to the whims of green groups ahead of Australia's recreational fishing communities. They have changed the laws to suit their political purpose rather than sound science.

Sadly, it has only been six months, but I am again rising in this place to oppose the Liberal National Party cuts occurring in Queensland, whether it be job cuts, cuts to programs such as the Queensland Literacy Awards, cuts to the TB clinic in Brisbane, cuts to breast screening, cuts to funding for taxi vouchers to people with disability, and I could go on.


I note there is an ongoing theme when I rise to speak about the Liberal National Party, which is always to do with cuts. On this particular occasion, obviously, it is to do with the LNP cuts to the recreational fishing programs. I did not hear the speeches from the member for Herbert or the member for Dawson. I did hear the member for Flynn and the member for Calare, and I note that for all four of those speakers—if I take my advice from the member from Blair—none of them actually said that Campbell Newman's decision to cut the funding for Sunfish was a good policy. None of them said that it is right. So all pressure rests on the member for Wright to stand up and defend this decision to cut jobs up the east coast of Queensland. I look forward to the member Wright, who is a good bloke and will obviously stand up and defend, because there was a damning silence from the member for Flynn when it came to supporting Campbell Newman's decision to cut. The member for Calare just went off on a frolic of his own, which was the same speech he has been giving for the last 20 years. It went straight back to 1996. That is the vision for the future. He goes straight to 1996, yet he is the modern face of the Liberal and National parties on that side of the chamber.


But let us look to the cuts to fishing in Queensland by the Newman government. To date they have: cut $8 million the Fisheries budget; cut 60 jobs from Fisheries Queensland with many of those jobs in Flynn out of the 14,000 jobs that were cut across departments; ceased funding to Sunfish Queensland, which is what this motion is all about; ceased the Fisheries observer program; ceased the industry development program for commercial and recreational fishing—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  So, you are telling the people in Flynn that fishery inspectors do not have real jobs. You are saying to the people in Sunfish Queensland that they do not have real jobs. Well, I hope that is some comfort for them when they go home to their wife, or their husband or their kids and say, 'Mum or Dad doesn't have a job. But it wasn't a real job, so it doesn't matter now. We don't have to pay a real mortgage anymore maybe.' That is a ridiculous statement. I hope you withdraw.


Further cuts include: ceasing the Fishcare volunteer program; ceasing operational activity for waterway barrier works construction; cutting all funding to the national Fisheries Research and Development Corporation; scaling back the freshwater fishing program—which, as someone from St George, I am particularly upset about—to focus on the Stocked Impoundment Permit Scheme, freshwater stocking policy, native fish scientific expertise and pest and noxious fish; restructuring of the Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol to build capacity and expertise in priority regional locations—which I notice the member for Flynn actually touched on in his speech as being a bad thing. It is amazing to have those counterintuitive arguments in the one speech; not providing funding for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation—a decision for this year only, with review in future years; the Marine Ecology Group, seagrass monitoring, transitioning across to James Cook University; and the rationalisation of Brisbane based senior management and support services.


The LNP has also cut front line fisheries researchers, as Minister McVeigh has confirmed in writing. So, it is not surprising to hear that the Liberal National Party has failed at the national level, given that the federal coalition failed to act in response to these state cuts. As I said, we did not hear a single voice raised in the parliament by the member for Herbert, the member for Dawson, the member for Flynn or the member for Calare. All hope is resting on the member for Wright about objecting to these cuts. I go back to the comment made by the member for Blair—these were not flagged before the election, they were not in campaign material that I saw in my mailbox. Campbell Newman's actions are just a sign of what would come if, heaven forbid, the member for Warringah became Prime Minister.



This is in stark contrast to the Gillard Labor government's strong commitment to deliver a national network of marine reserves to protect our precious marine environment for future generations. I was horrified when the very first thing that the Deputy Premier said after taking office was, 'We need to cut the size of the Great Barrier Reef.' Remember that? The very first thing that the Newman government said, 'We need to make the Great Barrier Reef area smaller.' The member for Flynn who has close connections to Gladstone should be ashamed of that.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (11:57):  No-one enjoys the emotional task of having to sack someone. No-one likes to be sacked. It is an undertaking that I have had to do, from time to time, being an employer with over 105 permanent staff and contractors. But there is a reason it gets done, and hopefully through the course of this overview I will share those views with you, from a Queensland perspective.


I would like to speak a little bit about the overview of Sunfish and what the state government of Queensland is doing to support Sunfish. Sunfish puts itself forward as the peak recreational fishing organisation in Queensland.; However, a recent state-wide survey of recreational fishers in Queensland found that only three per cent of recreational fishers, of which there are 21,000 in Queensland, were actually affiliated with the recreational fishing body. Expenditures on recreational fishing services for the 2012-13 budget in Queensland will still be in excess of $10 million for the year. They will be broken down to include compliance, surveillance and enforcement including boat ramp signage and community service announcements in excess of $3.2 million. In addition to that: communication and education programs, including a free handbook for recreational fishers of half a million dollars; fish stocks and recovery programs, pest fish education and marine habitat protection of $2 million; research monitoring and reporting activities of $2.8 million; and scientific assessment and policy development of $2 million. Campbell Newman and the state LNP team are not walking away. Yes, there are reductions and there are reductions because the state is running out of money—and I will come to that.


In the process of these monies and jobs being wound back not one person in Queensland, who enjoys taking their kids, or going out and having a recreational fish, will lose the right to go and have a fish. We have just had to pare back some of the funding across all sectors of the community. The recreational fishing user fee contributes about $4.4 billion, and for everyone in Queensland who owns a boat, part of their registration goes towards this service. These revenues continue to be allocated for the ongoing management of recreation fishing with 75 per cent of SIPS's monies returning directly to the regional fishing stocking groups. This spending demonstrates the government's continued commitment to recreational fishing, and that is additional to the $10 million election commitment that will see this enhanced for the buybacks.


I mentioned earlier in my opening comments that I was going to allude to why some of these drastic measure are being undertaken. Recently, in Queensland we had a commission of audit report, which I will come to. There were three eminent persons who sat on that board. There was Professor Sandra Harding, Vice-Chancellor and President of James Cook University. She was educated at the Australian National University with 14 years of comprehensive experience. Mr Doug McTaggart brings strong leadership to the commission having held various senior positions in the private and public sectors. He is currently the Chairman for the Public Service Commission and a member of the Public Sector Renewal Board, a member of the COAG Reform Council, a councillor on the National Competition Council, and a director of Suncorp Ltd and UGL Ltd. These people are no dills when it comes to handling money. In addition to, that they had the honourable Peter Costello, who was the Treasurer for the Commonwealth for a record term. For more than a decade Peter Costello was a governor of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. He was also a member of the committee of the International Monetary Fund and has been chairman of the OECD Ministerial Council and APEC financial ministers. He was involved in the establishment of the G20 after the Asian financial crisis and was the global chairman of the G20 in 2006. So you are making the assumption that some of those guys actually know a little bit about fiscal management.


Bear with me and listen to their damning report on the previous Labor government's fiscal management of that state and why today a motivated LNP government and Campbell Newman are having to make these tough decisions. It is disturbing to report that in recent years the government of Queensland embarked on unsustainable levels of spending which have jeopardised the financial position of the state. Queensland has moved from a position of considerable financial strength just six years ago to, today, a position of weakness. Campbell Newman has a tough job ahead of him and I applaud him. If you want to help out Campbell, pop up and thank him for the work that he is doing in Queensland. (Time expired)

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:00):  I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012, because this bill seeks to impose an additional regulatory regime on employers who employ foreign nationals who are illegal or do not have work rights. We agree with that. That is common sense, and no-one in their right mind would disagree with that. In our opinion this bill goes too far and I will explain this as I go. The bill amends the Migration Act to alter criminal offence provisions and to create a new civil penalties regime with maximum fines of $49,500 for corporate entities and $9,900 for individuals in an infringement notice scheme. There is a whole lot of detail to the bill; I will not trawl over every bit, but the new requirements proposed by the bill are onerous, unnecessary and are in direct opposition to the coalition's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden and compliance costs on business. That is the crux of the matter. On this side of the parliament, we understand that business want government to get out of their way, make it easier for them and create a climate to operate in where they can actually turn a dollar and make a profit, because business are not going to employ anyone if they do not make a profit; they will go out of business and the worker will not have a job. 


This bill adds to the already substantial regulatory burden imposed by this Labor government on employers who hire overseas workers; for example, those contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008. This act provided DIAC with expanded powers to monitor and investigate possible non-compliance by sponsors and introduced new penalties et cetera. This was working quite well—and I will not go through the whole gamut of it because it is quite detailed. What the Labor party said was: 'Look, we don't think it goes far enough; we're going to engage Stephen Howells to conduct a review of this part of the Migration Act.'


In 2007 this act was brought in, and in 2010 they asked Stephen Howells to do an investigation; he reported in 2011. But the problem with Mr Howells's recommendations is that instead of having a common-sense approach to the numbers of people that have been found to be employed illegally or working without proper rights, he actually found that there were very few. In fact, in the whole of the work done beforehand—in 2008-09 the department located 11,428 unlawful non-citizens in Australia, and out of those only 990 were confirmed as working illegally. Mr Howells's report says, 'Yes, but it could be up to 100,000 people.' That is only anecdotal, and they do not have any figures to substantiate that. Even if it was, out of Australia's 11 million workers, on Mr Howells's own figures it is less than one per cent of workers. They would be far better off trying to do what they could to identify those working illegally than to put the onus on the poor old business. We know that, because of the language problems, there are a number of ethnic businesses, in particular, that employ people illegally. They say there could be 100,000 people here illegally who are being exploited by a restaurant or construction company that can get them cheaply because they do not have work rights. That is wrong and they should be prosecuted. But, on his own figures the numbers are so small. As a matter of principle, we in the coalition do not support government policy that shifts the administrative burden on to the employers. Where is the government's role in this? Where is the beefing up of the migration department? 


Just to demonstrate how sad this is; Labor Party policy has increased red tape out of proportion since Labor has been in government. In fact, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's national red-tape survey indicates that the extra compliance through red tape since the Labor Party has been in government is costing Australia an extra $1 billion a year. The ACCI survey states almost three quarters of businesses are spending more time on regulation than they were just two years ago. The financial costs of compliance are also rising. The survey of 870 businesses shows that 72 per cent spent more time on regulation, as I said, than they did two years ago, with 44 per cent spending between one to five hours a week, and 37 per cent spending more than five hours a week on this compliance activity. 


The cost of compliance is also increasing, with 60 per cent of businesses saying they spend over $5,000 on compliance. According to parliamentary research, since late 2007—you know what happened after 2007, you got Kevin 07 and the fascinating election of Kevin Rudd and this Labor government—when Labor came to power, it has introduced more than 20,000 new items of regulation. This is the ACCI survey, not mine, not the Liberal Party's. Today, the survey no doubt reflects some of its impact. Just a month ago the World Economic Forum—to my learned friend across the chamber: if you do not like the ACCI, how about the World Economic Forum—revealed that Australia now ranked 96th in terms of burden of government regulation, compared with 68th when Labor came to power. 


On independent figures, wherever you want to go, the multiplying factor of this compliance has affected productivity, which has fallen by 4.2 per cent since July 2007. Again, this coincides well with the election of a certain government. The government's so-called deregulation agenda is not addressing the underlying economic challenge of relative productivity. The government report not only failed to address the underlying economic challenges, but surprisingly indicated areas where they have introduced additional regulations. We know many of these recent regulatory examples such as the carbon tax and the mining tax. The mining tax has cost companies millions of dollars to regulate and implement and it did not raise one dollar for the government. It did not raise them any money but they are spending millions of dollars while mid-caps, juniors and everyone else are trying to comply. The government—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr RANDALL:
  This is certainly about the bill because it is about the compliance regime that this government has put on industry right across Australia. This is where we are going. As the learned member across the chamber asked about the bill, I will go further to the bill. 


One of the compliance factors is the imposition of a mandatory training requirement for 457 visa holders. The government also introduced legislation which effectively meant that two per cent of an employer's payroll tax had to be spent on training if they had overseas or temporary overseas workers. This is a new thing. The 457 visas worked. We as the coalition do not say that everyone should have a 457 visa worker. I have been vocal in the party room—as my colleague from Brisbane will tell you—and I have got up there and said: Australian workers first—train our young kids. We should be training our young kids in Australia and upskilling them first. At the end of the day, every now and then you are going to find a situation where you need a specific set of skills, and these people are sourced quite often on temporary visas called 457s. Combined with the introduction of the temporary skills migration income threshold, the cost to Australian business of employing temporary overseas workers has become prohibitive.


I wish to bring to the attention of this House—and I alluded to this last year—one of the crazy things in my own electorate that this compliance did. Borrello Cheese in my electorate sought to bring in a specialised cheese maker. Borrello is very good at their specialty cheeses. It is a family-run and owned business by Vince and Teresa Borrello. They are a couple of people of Italian origin who came here and set up this marvellous boutique industry. They are famous for their bocconcini cheeses, which I am sure, you would know, Deputy Speaker Scott. They are beautiful with tomato and a bit of basil and a bit of drizzled balsamic vinegar. It is some of the nicest cheese you will come across. Because they have got the whole range of cheese there, they decided to mentor and upskill their workers. As none of them had been to any courses, they would get a specialist Italian cheese maker from Italy.


They had a lot of help in this because they were blocked all the way along. Even Nick Catania, former state Labor MP, was helping Vince and Teresa eventually find a Mr Pelati, an Italian cheese maker, whose qualifications were right. His English was correct, not to mention the fact that he was enthusiastic and keen to get on with the job to help the local people employed in that cheese factory grow the business.


Vince and Teresa did the right thing: complied with the visa, paid for his transport, medical costs, set-up costs et cetera. All of a sudden he got a letter from DIAC saying that he was going to have to leave the country. It was rather strange, because they could not understand why a junior officer from DIAC in Perth had said that Mr Pelati was going to have to leave the country.


It was not until I went to a senior case officer who was very good and explained the difficulties in this area. A Mr Robert Bailey explained what the difficulty was. We know that this is a roadblock that has been put in the way of people employing people, because of the infiltration and interference of unions who do not want to see any outside workers, particularly if they do not belong to one of their unions.


Mr Bailey from DIAC said, 'They've got to pay this levy.' He initially said it was a one per cent levy, which was going to cost $8,890—nearly $9,000—a year to have this cheese maker stay in Australia, but it had to go to a registered training organisation. There are no registered training organisations in Australia that have cheese makers—not one. So they had to find someone to give this money to. Lo and behold, they ran into another roadblock. It was not one per cent at all; it was two per cent of your payroll tax that had to be spent on training—not on the training of the workers in Mr Borrello's cheese factory; he had to find a registered training organisation in Australia that he could give this $18,000 to.


He eventually thought he had found somebody in Melbourne that might put his $18,000 towards training but, at the end of the day—



A government member:  Couldn't they find anyone else?




Mr RANDALL:
  No, they could not find anyone suitable. Eventually, after the anger and the angst, Mr Pelati said, 'What's going on with this silly country of yours? I've come here to make cheese and you're in my way. You won't let me work.'


They eventually found a place at New Norcia near Gingin north of Perth and they got this windfall gain. When the training authority got the $18,000, they said, 'What's that for?' They said, 'We don't know. We just have to give it to someone, so we're going to give it to you.'


So they gave them $18,000. Mr Pelati got to stay, but here is the rub: Mr Pelati wanted to be paid well for his specific skills and he wanted a good salary, so they negotiated an above-award salary. Sorry, you cannot work unless you are on the industry award so he said, 'I'm not taking less. I'm leaving,' and he went back to Italy.


After all that, mess, thank you very much for your compliance and your interference, DIAC and everyone else, the Borrellos went back to making their own cheese and not having to pay more than the one-off $18,000. So the compliance and the interference that is involved in these sorts of regulations is unnecessary. 


If you are chasing illegal workers, yes, fund DIAC to go and investigate and hunt them down properly but do not get in the way of business from doing a proper job of making a profit and employing people who want to grow the business and further culturally enhance something like the Borrellos were trying to do in this country. I rest my case.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:14):  I speak in support of the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012, and I will actually deal with the bill. I support this particular legislation; it has long history. Back in 1999 the former Howard government commissioned a review of illegal workers but sat on that review year after year. In fact, former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock introduced the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, which came to affect on the eve of the federal election period on 19 August 2007—the federal election was in November 2007.


Having had a government review into illegal workers, they did nothing—year after year. At the time of its introduction, a review after two years of operation was planned. When the Liberals lost office and, fortunately, the Australian people entrusted a Labor government to serve in the Treasury benches, we said we would announce a review of the effectiveness of a particular legislation. We did that on 21 May 2010, and we appointed a very senior commercial barrister, Stephen Howells, to undertake the review.


The prevalence of illegal workers affects employers and employees. The major concerns with illegal work practices are that it means that people who are employed illegally are more susceptible to exploitation by venal employers. It means that concerns for workplace health and safety are less likely to be complied with. Employing those workers illegally has the effect of driving down wages and conditions, lowering safety standards and taking away the opportunities for Australian workers to get jobs. At its most egregious we have seen labour trafficking, forced labour and, effectively, economic slavery. This is a serious problem.


The former legislation put in place an alleged deterrent: companies could be exposed to fines of up to $66,000 per illegal worker. But, having investigated about 100 allegations against employers, it was found that only four were referred by DIAC to the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions. There were significant difficulties in developing prima facie cases against employers, and the only conviction we saw was in December 2010. This was a case where an employer was convicted and sentenced after a plea of guilty acknowledging a previous criminal record—a pretty straightforward case. A deterrent it was not.


The principal reason given in relation to this was the trouble gathering evidence. The best person to get the evidence is the employee who was working illegally, who may also find themselves in a position of legal sanction. It is possible that that illegal worker could find themselves in a detention facility awaiting trial, and the whole thing is extraordinarily expensive. So it is the case that employers with the worst motives could employ workers illegally, sourcing cheap labour, driving down wages and conditions, denying Australians the opportunities for those jobs and making sure that safety is not a high priority in the workplace. We do know that the vast majority of people who come to this country illegally, if I can put it like that, are people who arrive in Australia by aeroplane on valid visas and who stay here after the visa has expired. We see that quite regularly after major events are held in this country. They are not people who are the victims of effectively criminal cartels or people smugglers and who come to this country by boat and claim asylum.


The reality is that we could either resource DIAC even more and continue the current arrangements, which are not working and which the Howells review showed are not working—the evidence was clearly that they were not working—or we could take up the recommendations that were made by Stephen Howells. On 21 July 2011, the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, announced that we would overhaul the penalties, make substantial changes in this area and make sure that those employers employing employees without the appropriate visa and appropriate rights to work could be sanctioned to a tiered system and were subject and liable to that. We have engaged extensively in relation to this. In fact, stakeholders have had about 13 years, in effect, of opportunities to put their case to government in relation to this issue, and have done so.


Employers, employees and trade unions—including the ACTU—have made submissions to the Howells review. The Howells review made a number of recommendations. It recommended the retention of the current criminal sanctions and penalties. It recommended legislation of a tiered system, as I said. And it recommended the idea of new civil penalties, with strict liability provisions and with statutory defences that employers could avail themselves of in circumstances where they had done the right thing. Also, there would be judicial discretion and maximum penalties of about $10,000. Stephen Howells recommended a system of infringement notices, with sanctions of about $1,000 and legislation, as I said, to protect those employers who do the right thing. He also talked about the need for better education concerning obligations and awareness for employers in those circumstances.


Many employers are very much aware of 457 visas—certainly, in the meat industry which is aware of them. In my electorate, Kilcoy Pastoral Company up in Kilcoy and JBS meatworks in Dinmore employ many people who come in on 457 visas in circumstances where there are workforce shortages in IT. In the health sector 457 visas are used as well, such as for doctors. Many medical practices in my regional and rural electorate are full of doctors who are here on visas and who become important parts of the local economy and community. In many cases, they are beloved for the work they do. 


The federal government called for further information and submissions from interested parties. We have effectively decided to take a tougher stance by bringing in the civil system. We have decided to extend liabilities to third parties in order to address sham contracting arrangements as well, where people are engaged in circumventing the law. We made sure that the integrity of our migration system in this regard was protected. We wanted to make sure that there would be no reduction in working opportunities for Australians. The critical thing in all of this, and I have seen this personally in my electorate, is that foreign workers—those workers who come to this place and who do contribute to our local economy—are not subject to exploitation. It was estimated that up to 100,000 people were working illegally in this country, and that had grown from about 50,000 in 1998. The Howard government's response was inadequate. It acted as no deterrent, it was ineffective and, in effect, it impugned the integrity of our migration system, and it provided further opportunity for the exploitation of vulnerable people. We put the exposure draft of this bill into the public domain in August 2012 and we have had many submissions in relation to it. We put forward this legislation which brings in and acts on the recommendations of the Howells review. I am particularly interested in, and I am particularly in support of, the tiered enforcement strategy that is there—the creation of the no-fault base civil penalties—which has a lower standard than a criminal standard. Establishing a new civil penalty framework is important. This legislation also introduces new monitoring and investigation powers authorising officers to gather evidence of suspected breaches. As I mentioned before, the gathering of evidence was always a problem.


This legislation is an example of this federal Labor government fixing up a problem that the previous Howard coalition government had failed to address year after year, and on the eve of an election they decided they would seek to do something to make out they were protecting Australian jobs and protecting those people who were vulnerable. Once again, like their Work Choices legislation, it was inadequate, wrong, fallacious in terms of the law and did not result in good workplace practices in this country. In the circumstances, this legislation does seek to address that. It acts on best practice and brings us into line very much with what is happening in New Zealand, the UK and the US. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:26):  The bill should be seen for exactly what it is. It is an example, again, of this government's war on employers. The stated objective of the bill is to impose an additional regulatory regime on employers who employ foreign nationals who are illegal or who do not have work rights. The bill amends the Migration Act to alter criminal offence provisions and create a new civil penalties with a regime of maximum fines of $49,500 for corporate entitles and $9,900 for individuals, as well as creating an infringement notice scheme. It looks also at broadening the application of criminal offences and civil penalty provisions to people who allow or refer an unlawful non-citizen to work or to work in breach of visa conditions, and it creates statutory defences where reasonable steps are taken to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement to work. It creates an infringement notice tier setting under the civil penalties provision allowing a person or corporate entity to pay a fine as an alternative to court proceedings. It also amends the current aggravated offences provision so that a person commits an aggravated offence when a worker is or will be exploited doing the work and the person who allowed the work or referred the worker knows this or is reckless about it. It also extends criminal and civil liability, in certain circumstances, to executive officers of bodies corporate, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management, and it creates search warrants and notice to produce powers specifically to facilitate the investigation of suspected breaches of these offences and civil penalties.


What a joy it is to be an employer under the Labor government. I have been an employer and I have employed students who were 20 hours a week, and I knew that was all they were entitled to work. I have also employed people under the working holiday makers program. But this Labor government puts all employers under the same blanket and treats them all the same, and decides that it is just going to put more complexity into the system. This bill is another myriad of onerous regime that it seeks to introduce, and it is testament to Labor's increasing obsession with making life difficult for as many employers as it can with more and more layers of red tape. You only have to look at the explanatory memorandum, which is 105 pages long. It is amazing. This would make the flow chart of Labor's red-tape obsession. It leaves the knowledge flow chart we saw some years back in the shade—and we know what a testament to clear and logical thinking that was, requiring navigation via a crystal ball and a ouija board. That is what this government does. It punishes the business sector.


In October of this year the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry released its National Red Tape Survey. The member for Canning highlighted some of the results of that survey. The chamber surveyed 870 businesses across all states and territories. The survey had some very interesting results and part of the member for Canning's speech highlighted that. But 73 per cent of businesses believe the overall compliance burden has increased in the last two years—what a surprise that is. Sixty per cent of businesses spent more than $5,000 per annum directly on costs related to regulatory requirements, with 16.1 per cent of businesses spending more than $50,000 per annum. Over 54 per cent of businesses spent more than five hours on their last tax return while 30 per cent outsourced it. Over 54 per cent of businesses perceive that regulatory compliance prevents businesses from growing.


What is difficult to understand is that the additional red tape the government seeks to introduce with this bill flies in the face of its own 2007 red-tape reduction election commitment. This government went to the election under the glib sound bite 'one-in one-out'. I remember that very well. Let us have a look at this government's report card against that election promise. When they said one-in one-out, on 29 October this year, the government had introduced 20,884 regulations and had repealed the wonderful number of—only—104. That is not one-in one-out, that is 200 in for every one out. An incredible tragedy, at the end of the spectrum, is the contrast with their 2007 red-tape election promise.


With numbers like that Labor should have called it their red-tape elevation election commitment, because at least then the government would have been able to lay claim to having had an election promise that they had delivered against. Regrettably, the numbers really do tell the story: 200 in for every one out. There is no conclusion to make other than that this government is anti-employers, anti-jobs and anti-productivity. Don't just take my word for it: according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, multifactor productivity has fallen by 6.6 per cent in Australia, from July 2004 to June 2011, with 4.2 per cent of this fall occurring from July 2007.


A study undertaken in August 2012 by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Australia as the second worst of 51 countries for productivity growth, ahead only of—and we should be very proud of this—Botswana. That is something we should truly be proud of as a nation. This less than stellar performance is also confirmed by the 2012 McKinsey study, called Beyond the boom: Australia's productivity imperative. This indicates that Australia's experience of income growth between 2005 and 2011 was driven by rising terms of trade and an upsurge in capital investment, not by labour productivity growth, which was weak, or by capital productivity, which actually fell quite significantly.


Against this backdrop we have, today, another bill that is introducing red tape. It is the very last thing Australian employers need, but it is just what this Labor government wants to slug them with through this bill. One of the primary reasons legislation is proposed and introduced into the parliament is to address unresolved needs or problems, or to correct a perceived mischief. What is the unresolved need or mischief this government is seeking to address here?


The best starting point in search for a meaningful answer to his question is the government's engagement of Mr Stephen Howells to conduct a review of the Migration Amendment (Employers Sanction) Act 2007 in 2010. In December 2011 the government announced that it would legislate to implement the recommendations contained in that review. 


The current employer sanctions regime, introduced by the Howard government in 2007, set out criminal offences for allowing an unlawful noncitizen to work; allowing a non-citizen to work in breach of a visa condition restricting work; allowing the referring an unlawful noncitizen to work, and allowed for referring a noncitizen to work in breach of a visa condition restricting work. Therefore, under the existing legislation, for a person to be successfully prosecuted for committing one of these offences, it must have been shown that these offences were committed either with knowledge or due to recklessness. The current sanctions regime also provides for an aggravated offence where the worker is subject to exploitation. In considering the question of what mischief does this bill supposedly address, it is instructive to examine how many times these existing provisions have actually been used since the commencement of the existing legislation in 2007.


According to Mr Howells' report, of the approximately 100 instances of possible breaches of these existing provisions considered by the DIAC offices, only four of them were suitable to be referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions—that is right, there were only four cases since 2007—hardly what you would describe as a 'burning bridge' necessitating further regulatory overreach by a red-tape-happy Labor government that is never happier than when it is slugging the business sector as hard as it can. It was very interesting to hear the member for Blair analysing all of this. I cannot understand this, and the member for Blair is a former lawyer as well. I cannot understand why, on the basis of this very low prosecution rate, Mr Howells' report makes the following astounding conclusions about the existing sanction provisions contained in the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, that they are supposedly:


… wholly ineffective as a deterrent against the small number of employers and labour suppliers who engage or refer non-citizens who do not have lawful permission to work or who work in breach of their visa conditions. The Employer Sanctions provisions are also ineffective as an educational tool for recalcitrant employers and labour suppliers.


This bizarre—and it is absolutely bizarre—contradiction fundamentally undermines Mr Howell report's recommendation. On one hand the report acknowledges that there have been very few breaches and even fewer convictions, while on the other hand such sparse behaviour apparently warrants the imposition of an even greater regulatory burden on employers. On this basis, the Howells report utterly fails in making a case that the extent of illegal workers warrant the heavy handedness of the response. Once again I return to the question: where is the mischief?


Mr Howells' report states that in 2008-09, DIAC located 11,428 unlawful noncitizens in Australia and, of those, only 990 were confirmed to be working illegally. The report estimates that up to 100,000 people were working illegally in Australia at any one time. However, the figures are purely speculative as they assume that all overstayers are working illegally. The total labour force in Australia is some 11 million, so even if the estimates in the Howells report are accurate, that is less than 0.9 per cent of 1 per cent of the workforce. The flames on the so-called 'burning bridge' just got higher. This is a great calamity requiring legislative solutions and posing more unnecessary burdens on Australian businesses. We are talking about a number that is equivalent to 0.9 per cent of the workforce that maybe working illegally, and I emphasise that there is no other way to view this bill than to say that it is a regulatory overreach which has gone mad. Why are we taking up the resources of the parliament in addressing a problem that scarcely exists, and more importantly, that is more than adequately dealt with by the existing law? We have heard about the onus on employers, but where is the onus on people who are working illegally under this legislation? I note that recently, the department changed some of its proof of records. Previously, people who were working in this country just had to quote an ABN, but I understand now that they are asking for proof of bank records and payslips; that is a very welcome move. But why does a Labor government have a pathological obsession with slugging employers in any way that it can? Speaking of employer groups, the government should not have been wasting everyone's time in drafting this bill. There have been various groups—according to the submissions received from, for example, the Australian Industry Group and various chambers—who believe the proposed changes in this bill to be:


... heavy handed and unnecessary. Imposing strict liability offences on employers and labour suppliers will not deter the small minority of employers or labour suppliers who already knowingly abuse the law to engage cheap labour. Rather the proposed changes will impact the unintended targets: i.e. good employers and labour suppliers. It is unfair that these persons be subject to high regulatory burdens because of the illegal practices of just a very small few.


In this context, the coalition opposes this bill, and I call on the government members to remember their own 2007 red-tape reduction election commitment. One in and one out; throw this one out even before it gets in. It is, again, an overreach imposing greater regulatory burdens on businesses out there who already have to contend with a huge regulatory burden that has just increased under this Labor government.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (16:42):  The bill implements the government's response to the independent report of the 2010 review of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, conducted by Mr Stephen Howells. In 1999, the Howard government was presented with the results of a review into illegal work in Australia which concluded that the extent of illegal work in Australia was a significant problem and that measures in place at the time were insufficient to address the problem. The 1999 report recommended the adoption of a range of employer sanctions. Critically, the report recommended sanctions which encompassed both fault based offences with criminal penalties and strict liability offences with civil penalties as well as infringement notices. Unfortunately, the Howard government failed to act on these recommendations. It was not until 2007 that it belatedly introduced legislation which provided for criminal sanctions.


The 2010 review of these measures, conducted by the barrister Stephen Howells, found that the existing Howard government sanctions were wholly ineffective. These measure have not provided a practical mechanism to instil in businesses the need to comply, nor acted as a deterrent to illegal work hire practices. Illegal work hire practices undermine the integrity of Australia's migration program and can result in the exploitation of vulnerable workers. Such conduct may also put at a disadvantage those businesses that only engage workers who are entitled to work and it reduces work opportunities for Australian citizens.


The Howells review recommended implementation of the 1999 scheme, with a little modification, including graduated tiers of education, warnings, infringement notices, non-fault civil penalties and criminal offences. This is intended to encourage voluntary compliance by businesses, and when this does not occur, provide effective sanctions. The amendment in this bill will amend the criminal offences and create new non-fault civil penalty provisions for persons who: firstly, allow an unlawful non-citizen to work; secondly, refer an unlawful non-citizen to a third person for work; thirdly, allow a lawful non-citizen to work in breach of a work related visa condition; and finally, or refer a lawful non-citizen to a third person for work in breach of a work related visa condition. The Howells report provided a compelling analysis and critique of the effectiveness of the current framework for dealing with the problem of illegal work. It concluded that the prevalence of illegal work had increased markedly since the 1999 review, with potentially more than 100,000 workers currently being employed without valid work rights. This bill allows the government to crack down on employers who hire illegal workers by setting out a range of civil and criminal penalties. The graduated system of sanctions will operate as a last resort and should only be of concern to those employers who seeks to circumvent the law. The legislation's key amendments include: amending the criminal offences and creating new, non-fault civil penalty provisions and an infringement notice scheme for people who allow or refer an unlawful noncitizen to work, or allow or refer a lawful noncitizen to work in breach of a work related condition; creating statutory defences where reasonable steps are taken at reasonable times to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement to work; broadening the application of criminal offences and civil penalty provisions to hold a person liable for participating in an arrangement or series of arrangements that result in a foreign national working without lawful entitlement; extending both criminal and civil liability, in certain circumstances, to executive officers of bodies corporate, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management; and creating search warrant and notice to produce powers specifically to facilitate the investigation of suspected breaches of these offences and civil penalties.


In order to address the illegal practices of sham contracting, informal labour hire and use of illegal workers by various entities within a conglomerate, the application of the criminal offences and civil penalty provisions will be broadened so that a person who participates in the chain of events that results in a noncitizen being allowed or referred to work without the required permission can be held liable for contravening work related offences and work related provisions. In addition, the bill will extend both criminal and civil liability to executive officers of bodies corporate, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management in appropriate circumstances. It also introduces investigative powers to allow authorised officers to gather evidence of suspected breaches of the work related offences and work related provisions.


To the extent that the government's legislative response may be resisted by some employers, those arguments are likely to have the underlying theme that the introduction of strict liability offences will impose requirements that are too onerous or burdensome on employers, that it is not the responsibility of employers, that more education is the answer, that more time is needed, or that there will be an impost on business. Similar arguments were run throughout the Howard government years to resist and delay the changes which were recommended by the 1999 review. The case for change has been clearly articulated by the ACTU as follows:


It is not seriously contested that illegal work is a problem for a whole of variety of reasons, both for the illegal workers themselves, as well as all those working legally, whether they be Australian citizens and residents, or overseas workers with valid work rights. The prevalence of illegal work … affects … those employers who are doing the right thing, and the broader community. Major concerns with illegal work include:


employees employed illegally are more susceptible to exploitation and less likely to raise matters such as ill-treatment, safety concerns or under-payment because of their highly precarious status;


it has the effect of driving down local wages and conditions, lowering safety standards, and taking away local employment opportunities;


those employers employing illegal workers are less likely to comply with other legal obligations such as industrial relations, OHS, workers' compensation and taxation laws; and


In the worst cases, it can involve labour trafficking, forced labour, and slavery.


The real issue then becomes what practical measures are required to address the problem to reduce and remove the impact and incidence of illegal work. This means measures to deter employers who might be tempted to employ overseas workers without valid work rights and to ensure that those who do the wrong thing can be dealt with effectively.


One of the more disturbing aspects of illegal work is the use of student visas to bring people to Australia for exploitation in the sex industry. Anecdotal evidence given to the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee of the parliament of Victoria for its inquiry into people-trafficking for sex work, and its subsequent report in June 2010, suggests that the number of trafficked women on student visas is quite large and growing. Certainly, Commonwealth prosecutors working on trafficking cases have seen evidence of trafficked women entering Australia on student visas. Indeed, being on a student visa did not exclude them from working legitimately in the sex industry. The prosecutors told the committee the problem was that in such cases it was very difficult to prove these women were working more than the 20 hours permitted on such a visa or that they had been brought to Australia to be exploited as trafficking victims.


The report of the committee indicated that trafficking can occur whether women arrive through legal means with valid visas and documentation, or through illegal means. It is not unusual for traffickers to arrange documentation such as student, visitor, tourist or working holiday visas on the basis of incorrect, forged or otherwise fraudulent applications in the source country. At this stage of the recruitment process money may also be deposited in an account opened in the victim's name to give veracity to her application for a visa. This may be particularly the case if the woman has made an application for a tourist visa. She will then be able to show she has sufficient means to support herself in Australia even though it is highly unlikely she will have access to, or control over, those monies once she has reached her destination. There is also some evidence that traffickers may arrange for sham marriages to a 'mule' or other person in order to strengthen their visa applications.


Concern has also been expressed to the committee about the role played by some colleges that accept overseas students particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. There have been strong suggestions that this under regulated sector is being used to provide a cover for traffickers and their operations. In particular, it has been observed that some colleges have been less than vigilant in monitoring attendance rates of people on student visas when they are obliged to do so. Evidence given to the inquiry by trafficking victims support workers also indicated that, in some instances, women are even paid to attend college, or at least make an appearance, as substitutes for the enrolled victim. Nina Vallins, the Executive Director of Project Respect, stated:


We are aware of cases where women have come in on student visas and they never set foot in the school. The school is in on it. The school is paid off or whatever it is to tick the women off on their roll, or there have been cases where someone else would go to the school on behalf of that woman and pretend to be her. But clearly there are these very dodgy schools which are assisting traffickers in their operations. It is a frustration for us that there does not appear to be monitoring of the schools.


The Salvation Army also told the committee how bona fide students may get caught up in trafficking once in Australia. Captain Danielle Stricklandsaid that in her view many young women who are legitimately here as students and are finding it hard to make ends meet are susceptible to being recruited for sex work whilst in Melbourne. That is, they are subjected to a form of domestic trafficking.


There are also many documented examples of exploitation of workers on 457 visas, the temporary migrant workers. I was recently made aware by the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers of the dismissal of the Danish engineer, Tonny Lind, who was on a 457 visa sponsored by Maersk Australia. According to the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, Mr Lind questioned the company regarding whether his rate of pay was less than what he was entitled to. When the company did not address his concerns he sought advice from the union and then went to the Fair Work Ombudsman. The company subsequently dismissed Mr Lind,making reference in their letter of dismissal to the fact that he was seeking redress through Australian authorities over his pay and, as a result, instant dismissal was warranted pursuant to Danish law. This seems extraordinary to me and tends to confirm the concerns I have expressed for a number of years that 457 visas are open to abuse as a vehicle to pay reduced wages and conditions.


There was also the recent decision by Fair Work Australia in reference to the Giovenco Industries and Rio Tinto Alcanmaintenance agreement of 2012. The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers has also expressed concerns to me about this agreement. The Institute of Marine and Power Engineers believes that in this case 13 senior employees were made redundant, and the company then employed five workers of Filipino background just prior to the vote on the agreement, and that the latter were not allowed enough time nor had the ability to meaningfully understand the enterprise bargaining agreement that they were to vote on. The nominated bargaining agent for the agreement at the time, Mr Michael Huddy, asserted that the five workers were employed on 15 February just prior to the vote on 20 February and therefore did not receive a notice of representation rights at least 21 days prior to the employer requesting that they approve the proposed enterprise agreement under section 173 of the Fair Work Act of 2009. Mr Huddy noted that the vote on 20 February was 46 votes yes and 43 votes no and that this followed a previously unsuccessful vote a couple of months earlier in December 2011. Fair Work Australia determined that no breach of notice of representation rights had occurred as the requirement to notify in section 173 arises at notification time and applies only to employees employed at notification time, and was subsequently not applicable to the Filipino workers.


I believe this agreement raises serious concerns about the potential for abuse of subclass 457 visas. The case highlights a loophole in the act that allows an employer to secure an agreement in circumstances where it could well be that the aforementioned five workers were not in a position to understand their rights and options.


Recent estimates put the number of unlawful noncitizens and lawful noncitizens working without permission in Australia at around 100,000. This is despite the fact that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship continues to have considerable success in locating illegal workers. We must tackle the continuing practice of allowing or referring unlawful noncitizens, or lawful noncitizens without the required permission, to work. It remains a serious issue as it undermines the integrity of Australia's migration program and has resulted in the exploitation of vulnerable people. It places Australian businesses engaging noncitizen workers without permission to work at a competitive advantage and penalises employers who do the right thing. Its effect is to reduce taxation revenue as well as work opportunities for Australians and those noncitizens with permission to work.


This bill addresses the government's long-held concern about the serious matter of illegal work in Australia and demonstrates the government's determination to tackle the difficult issues associated with this practice. I commend the bill to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-11-26,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:56):  The Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012 seeks to impose an additional regulatory regime on employers employing foreign nationals who are illegal or who do not have work rights. The requirements this bill proposes are, I believe, onerous and unnecessary and are in direct opposition to the coalition's commitment to reduce the regulatory burden and compliance cost on business.


Employers who hire overseas workers are already weighed down by substantial regulations such as those contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008, and this bill will be yet another imposition on these businesses.




Mr Champion interjecting
—





The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order!




Mr McCORMACK:
  Your government is responsible for allowing so many foreign workers in under various acts.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Riverina will ignore the interjections from the other side of the chamber.




Mr McCORMACK:
  It is just unbelievable, but I will take your wise advice, Mr Deputy Speaker, and ignore the interjections by the member for Wakefield.


This act provides the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with expanded powers to monitor and investigate possible noncompliance by sponsors and introduce new penalties for employers who are found to be in breach of their obligations. Officers from the department were given investigative powers to monitor workplaces and conduct site visits. Fines of up to $33,000 were introduced and employer obligations were prescribed which had to be satisfied when employing a temporary overseas worker. A mandatory training requirement for 457 visa holders was introduced in this legislation which effectively amounted to a two per cent payroll tax on employers who engaged temporary overseas workers.


My electorate of Riverina has many of these temporary overseas workers. They work in the abattoirs, they work picking fruit in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and they do lots of other things as well. My Griffith electorate office handles many inquiries about these temporary overseas work arrangements. Combined with the introduction of the temporary skilled migration income threshold, the cost to Australian business of employing temporary overseas workers has become prohibitive. I and my staff member at Griffith hear that regularly. The Migration Act would be amended by this bill to alter criminal offence provisions and create a new civil penalties regime with a maximum fine of $49,500 for corporate entities and $9,900 for individuals, and an infringement notice scheme. It will also broaden the application of criminal offences and civil penalty provisions to people who allow or refer an unlawful noncitizen to work or to work in breach of visa conditions.


Statutory defences will be created where reasonable steps were taken to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement to work and an infringement notice tier will be created under the civil penalties provision, which will allow a person or corporate entity to pay a fine as an alternative to court proceedings. Additionally, the current aggravated offences provision will be amended so that a person commits an aggravated offence where the worker is or will be exploited doing the work and the person who allowed the work or referred the worker knows this or is reckless about it. This bill extends both the criminal and the civil liability in some instances to executive officers of corporate bodies, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management, and creates search warrants and notices to produce powers specifically to facilitate the investigation of suspected breaches of these offences and civil penalties.


In 2010, the government engaged Stephen Howell to conduct a review of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007 and in December 2011 the government announced it would legislate to implement the recommendations contained in the review. Currently, the employer sanctions regime, which was introduced by the Howard government in 2007, comprises criminal offences for the following: allowing an unlawful noncitizen to work; allowing a noncitizen to work in breach of a visa condition restricting work; referring an unlawful noncitizen to work; and referring a noncitizen to work in breach of a visa condition restricting work. For a person to be prosecuted of committing one of these offences, it is also required to be shown that the offences were committed with either knowledge or due recklessness. If the worker has been subjected to exploitation, the offence is considered an aggravated offence, as it should be.


Since the implementation of the act in 2007, officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship have deliberated about 100 instances of possible breaches. Of these cases, only four were considered suitable to be referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Due to the low prosecution rate, Howell concluded:


The provisions of the … Act—


as it stood—


are wholly ineffective as a deterrent against the small number of employers and labour suppliers who engage or refer non-citizens who do not have lawful permission to work or who work in breach of their visa conditions. The Employer Sanctions provisions are also ineffective as an educational tool for recalcitrant employers and labour suppliers.


The contradiction in this statement is a feature of the entire report. On one hand there are few breaches and even fewer convictions, yet on the other hand such exceptional behaviour warrants the imposition of an even greater evidentiary and regulatory burden on employers. Industry groups, including the Australian Industry Group, AiG, and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, ACCI, believe the proposed changes are 'heavy-handed and unnecessary'.


Under this bill the statutory defence provisions would require employers to establish, at the commencement of any work performed, that they were shown a valid Australian passport, a valid birth certificate, a valid certificate of permanent residency or a valid visa permitting work. The combined effect of this would mean any employer could be taking a risk of being fined before the court or receiving an infringement notice if they do not check this documentation. This administrative measure on its own is excessive. Furthermore, the process involved to view these documents is not only arduous but inherently discriminatory as it will require employees to reveal their age and place of birth. The need for this information has the potential to lead to discrimination against people who may be legitimate citizens or permanent residents of Australia but will be subject to questioning from their employer due to their race, accent and/or level of English. Due to these concerns, the ACCI has referred the draft legislation to the Australian Human Rights Commission and has informed the government that, if this bill is passed in its current form, the ACCI will seek exemptions under the federal and state discrimination acts to protect its ability to make requests for evidence required under the Migration Act.


The Master Builders Association of Australia made a submission to the Howell report, and, whilst they strongly support tough penalties being applied to those who deliberately exploit illegal workers, it was emphasised that the deliberate procurement of illegal workers for placement jobs in Australia was completely different to the inadvertent backpacker who has overstayed their visa. The law should specifically target those who deliberately seek out illegal workers. The Howell report was unsuccessful in making a case that the extent of illegal work warranted the heavy-handedness of the response. For example, the report stated in 2008-09 that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship located 11,428 unlawful non-citizens in Australia and, of those, only 990 were confirmed to be working illegally. The report also estimated that up to 100,000 people were working illegally in Australia at any one time. That is a staggering statistic. However, these figures are only speculative as it assumes all over-stayers are working illegally—and we know that is not correct. The total labour force in Australia is 11.057 million people. So, even if the estimates in the Howell report are accurate, this is less than 0.9 per cent of the total workforce.


The regime which is proposed shifts the cost of compliance and law enforcement directly onto the employer. I was contacted by my constituent Carmel La Rocca of Griffith, who wished to voice her concerns about this bill. Mrs La Rocca believes it is unfair to put the onus of ensuring workers are legal on farmers. As contractors, she believes it should be up to the contractor to ensure any subcontractors and employees they employ meet the necessary legal requirements to work in Australia. It is completely reasonable for Mrs La Rocca, or indeed any other farmer who uses a contractor, to place their trust in a contractor to employ legal staff. Farmers do not have the time to sit and check all the documentation from contractors of their employees' legal working status. 


Whilst they have been advised by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship that there will be ways of doing this online, many farmers are not computer savvy. Many farmers do not want to have that onerous burden of having to go and check every single employee, when they have been told in good faith that that employee is able to work. The Howell report stated:


The cost of addressing this problem cannot be borne solely by Government or the taxpayer and it is impossible to impose the cost on the workers themselves. Australian employers must bear some of the cost and inconvenience by taking reasonable steps to identify the workers they engage or employ and by taking reasonable steps to establish whether those workers have permission to work. Australian citizens must be prepared to bear their share of the cost and inconvenience by obtaining and carrying adequate identification when they seek work.


It is unfathomable that this Labor government can think it is acceptable to place this burden on employers by shifting the cost of enforcing the law onto them.


The coalition has consistently made the point that Australia's migration program is intended as a supplement not a substitute to the Australian workforce—to fill the gaps which have opened up by the way Australia's population has naturally grown. This is at the centre of the coalition's approach to the issues of the 457 temporary work visas and skilled migration. In that context, we have said that we will look at liberalising the 457 visa criteria to create a genuinely temporary and regional solution to skills gaps and shortages without compromising compliance. We will remove the union-driven roadblocks, allowing businesses—they are the people who actually employ people and make money to pay taxes and keep this Labor government in place so it can make all sorts of stupid policies that send us all broke—to quickly access the critical information that they require while also maintaining important safeguards and sanctions against those businesses and individuals who seek to abuse the scheme. 


The existing regime and compliance costs the government has systematically built around the employment of foreign nationals are already onerous, and the proposed changes are going to significantly increase the compliance costs for employers as well as leave them to struggle through the complex tangle of red tape.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:09):  I certainly agree with the comments that have been made by my colleague, the member for Riverina. I rise today to also speak on the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012. The government states that the purpose of this bill is to reduce the use and exploitation of illegal foreign workers. This is indeed a noble purpose. Any business found to be exploiting workers should be punished accordingly.


The Howard government brought in some very strict rules in 2007 to deal with just this issue. However, it is clear when you look at the detail of this bill that, far from achieving the purpose of the bill, the new regulations and sanctions proposed by the bill are so onerous that they will impose excessive regulatory and compliance costs on all businesses, the vast majority of which do the right thing. The minister himself acknowledged that the vast majority of businesses do indeed do the right thing.


Why is it significant that this will be so onerous for businesses? Let us examine this question in more detail. The government, in coming into government, claimed that for every regulation it brought in it would get rid of a regulation—a one-in, one-out approach. It also claimed that it would fix the problem of deregulation by simply appointing a minister for deregulation. But these issues are not fixed; the facts do not support its claims.


Since coming to power the Labor government has introduced over 20,000 new regulations. It introduced over 1,000 pages of new regulations with the carbon tax alone. In that same period it removed fewer than 100 regulations. How can businesses be expected to plan, with any sense of certainty, when the goalposts are changed so frequently by this government? And what is the point of having a minister whose main function is to deregulate the economy, when all we see from this government is more red tape, more regulation and more burden?


Like all things this government does and says one must look past the spin and at the reality. This brings me back to the bill before the House—another piece of regulation, another level of bureaucracy and another impost on hardworking Australian businesses. What is it that this government has against Australian businesses? Why does it consistently try to make it harder to do business in this country, not easier? We understand that creating the right regulatory environment is critically important to our nation's future. We understand that removing red tape will increase productivity and, in turn, allow business—the wealth creators of this nation—to thrive and grow.


According to the Productivity Commission red tape represents four per cent of all business costs and red-tape reduction can contribute up to $12 billion to our economy. Don't take my word for it; it was, after all, the current Treasurer who said 'Lifting productivity is essential to the nation's prosperity.' If only this government's actions were consistent with its words. To say this government's record on regulation is atrocious is an understatement. In a recent Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum Australia received a massive wake-up call on how we are doing. It showed that we are now ranked 96th in the burden of government regulation compared to 68th in 2007-08, noting that the lower the ranking the worse the burden of government regulation, in this instance. It also showed that we have slumped from 40th to 80th in pay and productivity for the same period. It is little wonder, when the same report showed that Australia had slipped from 12th to 29th in transparency of government policy and, most alarmingly, from a relatively strong position of 10th in wastefulness of government spending to 48th.


When you consider these trends it comes as no surprise to learn that productivity in this country is on the slide. A recent Grattan Institute report reinforced these claims. It showed that since 2007 Australia has experienced a drop in multifactor productivity of 4.2 per cent, while the OECD average remains in positive territory. This may not have an immediate effect on our economy but it does not bode well for our long-term economic outlook. The government should be doing everything it can within its power to introduce policies that address this emerging and alarming trend, not to introduce legislation that will further increase the regulatory burden and ultimately reduce productivity. Why is punishing all business with more red tape so detrimental?


The Business Council of Australia has reported that, compared to the United States, it costs 40 per cent more to operate resource projects in Australia, it is 92 per cent more expensive to build an airport and it costs 62 per cent more for hospitals. Perhaps this would not be such a problem if we lived 100 or 200 years ago, but in today's global economy, where capital is liquid and mobile, business competitiveness is more important than ever. It is essential that government create the regulatory environment that fosters business activity and growth. This legislation, however, is a step in the wrong direction. This legislation is an extra regulatory burden placed on all business, not just on those that are doing the wrong thing. It will further erode competitiveness. 


The government may well say: what is one more regulation going to do? What effect will one more piece of legislation have? Let us make it abundantly clear: as previously stated, it is but one of a multitude of regulations introduced since 2007. Increased regulation, as well as having an economic impact, has a human impact. 


The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, ACCI, recently conducted their national red-tape survey, and the results were distressing. Almost three-quarters of the 870 businesses that responded said they were spending more time on regulation today than they were just two years ago. Forty-four per cent of businesses are having to spend between one and five hours a week complying with government regulations—filling out forms, applying for permits, reporting business activity at a local, state or federal level. One in three businesses is spending more than five hours a week on regulation, and 11 per cent of those surveyed spent more than 20 hours a week on regulation. That is half the working week on regulation. This is time that could be better spent on growing businesses, which would be productivity enhancing or, as I said before, it could be time better spent with families, which would be emotionally enhancing. 


We know that each piece of regulation comes at a cost. Seventy-three per cent of businesses reported to ACCI that their overall cost of compliance had gone up in the last two years; 42 per cent of businesses estimated they spent more than $10,000 on compliance with regulation. Eighty businesses spent between $50,000 and $100,000. A resounding 60 businesses spent in excess of $100,000 on regulation. About 60 per cent of businesses said red tape had a moderate to major impact on their business; while 54 per cent flagged that the effort taken to comply with regulations had prevented them from making changes to expand or grow their business. 


With the extra regulatory burden this legislation places on all businesses, one would hope that the intended beneficiaries would be wide-ranging and vast. But it is not so. According to the Howe report there are approximately 100,000 illegal workers in Australia at any time. When you consider Australia has a workforce of over 11 million people, it means this legislation is relevant to only 0.09 per cent of the workforce. What kind of cost-benefit is that? What is this government saying? It is saying: 'Let's unload another level of administrative burden on all Australian businesses so we can target 0.09 per cent of the workforce.' Once again, the government is using the heavy sledgehammer of regulation when there are better, more targeted ways to achieve its objectives. 


But of course this is not the first change the government has made to the temporary migration and skilled migration program. These changes come on top of the regulatory burden already imposed through the introduction of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008, which gave the department of immigration expanded powers to monitor, investigate and penalise employers for non-compliance as a sponsor. That legislation allowed DIAC officers the investigative authority to conduct site visits, monitor workplaces and impose fines of up to $33,000. In addition to this, the legislation imposed compulsory training requirements for 457 visa holders that effectively amounted to a two per cent payroll tax. It is little wonder that business in Australia is becoming so very expensive.


The recent bungled approach to skilled migration at the Roy Hill project highlighted the deep divisions within the government on this issue and just how beholden they are to the union movement. This piece of legislation is yet another example of the confused and contradictory nature of the way the government goes about making regulation. It is difficult for business to adhere to this regulation, given that it will be in conflict with much of the state based antidiscrimination legislation and federal antidiscrimination legislation.


Under this bill, employers need to demand proof of birthplace, gender and age documentation. Under existing state legislation, this could be used down the track as a basis for accusations of discrimination. As a result, ACCI has already referred to draft legislation to the Human Rights Commission and, should the legislation pass, they will be seeking exemptions under both state and federal antidiscrimination acts. It is, again, another example of the incompetence of this government.


The coalition understands the importance that skilled migration plays in our economy. We understand that it is an important component in the labour force to fill in the gaps that we have with certain projects in getting them off the ground. We also understand that it is not a replacement for full-time Australian workers. The coalition cannot support this legislation. It will only increase the regulatory burden to further stifle business and to further stifle productivity, and will certainly not achieve the outcomes and objectives that the government has indeed set for itself. 


Debate adjourned.

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:00):  I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012, because this bill seeks to impose an additional regulatory regime on employers who employ foreign nationals who are illegal or do not have work rights. We agree with that. That is common sense, and no-one in their right mind would disagree with that. In our opinion this bill goes too far and I will explain this as I go. The bill amends the Migration Act to alter criminal offence provisions and to create a new civil penalties regime with maximum fines of $49,500 for corporate entities and $9,900 for individuals in an infringement notice scheme. There is a whole lot of detail to the bill; I will not trawl over every bit, but the new requirements proposed by the bill are onerous, unnecessary and are in direct opposition to the coalition's commitment to reducing the regulatory burden and compliance costs on business. That is the crux of the matter. On this side of the parliament, we understand that business want government to get out of their way, make it easier for them and create a climate to operate in where they can actually turn a dollar and make a profit, because business are not going to employ anyone if they do not make a profit; they will go out of business and the worker will not have a job. 


This bill adds to the already substantial regulatory burden imposed by this Labor government on employers who hire overseas workers; for example, those contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008. This act provided DIAC with expanded powers to monitor and investigate possible non-compliance by sponsors and introduced new penalties et cetera. This was working quite well—and I will not go through the whole gamut of it because it is quite detailed. What the Labor party said was: 'Look, we don't think it goes far enough; we're going to engage Stephen Howells to conduct a review of this part of the Migration Act.'


In 2007 this act was brought in, and in 2010 they asked Stephen Howells to do an investigation; he reported in 2011. But the problem with Mr Howells's recommendations is that instead of having a common-sense approach to the numbers of people that have been found to be employed illegally or working without proper rights, he actually found that there were very few. In fact, in the whole of the work done beforehand—in 2008-09 the department located 11,428 unlawful non-citizens in Australia, and out of those only 990 were confirmed as working illegally. Mr Howells's report says, 'Yes, but it could be up to 100,000 people.' That is only anecdotal, and they do not have any figures to substantiate that. Even if it was, out of Australia's 11 million workers, on Mr Howells's own figures it is less than one per cent of workers. They would be far better off trying to do what they could to identify those working illegally than to put the onus on the poor old business. We know that, because of the language problems, there are a number of ethnic businesses, in particular, that employ people illegally. They say there could be 100,000 people here illegally who are being exploited by a restaurant or construction company that can get them cheaply because they do not have work rights. That is wrong and they should be prosecuted. But, on his own figures the numbers are so small. As a matter of principle, we in the coalition do not support government policy that shifts the administrative burden on to the employers. Where is the government's role in this? Where is the beefing up of the migration department? 


Just to demonstrate how sad this is; Labor Party policy has increased red tape out of proportion since Labor has been in government. In fact, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's national red-tape survey indicates that the extra compliance through red tape since the Labor Party has been in government is costing Australia an extra $1 billion a year. The ACCI survey states almost three quarters of businesses are spending more time on regulation than they were just two years ago. The financial costs of compliance are also rising. The survey of 870 businesses shows that 72 per cent spent more time on regulation, as I said, than they did two years ago, with 44 per cent spending between one to five hours a week, and 37 per cent spending more than five hours a week on this compliance activity. 


The cost of compliance is also increasing, with 60 per cent of businesses saying they spend over $5,000 on compliance. According to parliamentary research, since late 2007—you know what happened after 2007, you got Kevin 07 and the fascinating election of Kevin Rudd and this Labor government—when Labor came to power, it has introduced more than 20,000 new items of regulation. This is the ACCI survey, not mine, not the Liberal Party's. Today, the survey no doubt reflects some of its impact. Just a month ago the World Economic Forum—to my learned friend across the chamber: if you do not like the ACCI, how about the World Economic Forum—revealed that Australia now ranked 96th in terms of burden of government regulation, compared with 68th when Labor came to power. 


On independent figures, wherever you want to go, the multiplying factor of this compliance has affected productivity, which has fallen by 4.2 per cent since July 2007. Again, this coincides well with the election of a certain government. The government's so-called deregulation agenda is not addressing the underlying economic challenge of relative productivity. The government report not only failed to address the underlying economic challenges, but surprisingly indicated areas where they have introduced additional regulations. We know many of these recent regulatory examples such as the carbon tax and the mining tax. The mining tax has cost companies millions of dollars to regulate and implement and it did not raise one dollar for the government. It did not raise them any money but they are spending millions of dollars while mid-caps, juniors and everyone else are trying to comply. The government—



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr RANDALL:
  This is certainly about the bill because it is about the compliance regime that this government has put on industry right across Australia. This is where we are going. As the learned member across the chamber asked about the bill, I will go further to the bill. 


One of the compliance factors is the imposition of a mandatory training requirement for 457 visa holders. The government also introduced legislation which effectively meant that two per cent of an employer's payroll tax had to be spent on training if they had overseas or temporary overseas workers. This is a new thing. The 457 visas worked. We as the coalition do not say that everyone should have a 457 visa worker. I have been vocal in the party room—as my colleague from Brisbane will tell you—and I have got up there and said: Australian workers first—train our young kids. We should be training our young kids in Australia and upskilling them first. At the end of the day, every now and then you are going to find a situation where you need a specific set of skills, and these people are sourced quite often on temporary visas called 457s. Combined with the introduction of the temporary skills migration income threshold, the cost to Australian business of employing temporary overseas workers has become prohibitive.


I wish to bring to the attention of this House—and I alluded to this last year—one of the crazy things in my own electorate that this compliance did. Borrello Cheese in my electorate sought to bring in a specialised cheese maker. Borrello is very good at their specialty cheeses. It is a family-run and owned business by Vince and Teresa Borrello. They are a couple of people of Italian origin who came here and set up this marvellous boutique industry. They are famous for their bocconcini cheeses, which I am sure, you would know, Deputy Speaker Scott. They are beautiful with tomato and a bit of basil and a bit of drizzled balsamic vinegar. It is some of the nicest cheese you will come across. Because they have got the whole range of cheese there, they decided to mentor and upskill their workers. As none of them had been to any courses, they would get a specialist Italian cheese maker from Italy.


They had a lot of help in this because they were blocked all the way along. Even Nick Catania, former state Labor MP, was helping Vince and Teresa eventually find a Mr Pelati, an Italian cheese maker, whose qualifications were right. His English was correct, not to mention the fact that he was enthusiastic and keen to get on with the job to help the local people employed in that cheese factory grow the business.


Vince and Teresa did the right thing: complied with the visa, paid for his transport, medical costs, set-up costs et cetera. All of a sudden he got a letter from DIAC saying that he was going to have to leave the country. It was rather strange, because they could not understand why a junior officer from DIAC in Perth had said that Mr Pelati was going to have to leave the country.


It was not until I went to a senior case officer who was very good and explained the difficulties in this area. A Mr Robert Bailey explained what the difficulty was. We know that this is a roadblock that has been put in the way of people employing people, because of the infiltration and interference of unions who do not want to see any outside workers, particularly if they do not belong to one of their unions.


Mr Bailey from DIAC said, 'They've got to pay this levy.' He initially said it was a one per cent levy, which was going to cost $8,890—nearly $9,000—a year to have this cheese maker stay in Australia, but it had to go to a registered training organisation. There are no registered training organisations in Australia that have cheese makers—not one. So they had to find someone to give this money to. Lo and behold, they ran into another roadblock. It was not one per cent at all; it was two per cent of your payroll tax that had to be spent on training—not on the training of the workers in Mr Borrello's cheese factory; he had to find a registered training organisation in Australia that he could give this $18,000 to.


He eventually thought he had found somebody in Melbourne that might put his $18,000 towards training but, at the end of the day—



A government member:  Couldn't they find anyone else?




Mr RANDALL:
  No, they could not find anyone suitable. Eventually, after the anger and the angst, Mr Pelati said, 'What's going on with this silly country of yours? I've come here to make cheese and you're in my way. You won't let me work.'


They eventually found a place at New Norcia near Gingin north of Perth and they got this windfall gain. When the training authority got the $18,000, they said, 'What's that for?' They said, 'We don't know. We just have to give it to someone, so we're going to give it to you.'


So they gave them $18,000. Mr Pelati got to stay, but here is the rub: Mr Pelati wanted to be paid well for his specific skills and he wanted a good salary, so they negotiated an above-award salary. Sorry, you cannot work unless you are on the industry award so he said, 'I'm not taking less. I'm leaving,' and he went back to Italy.


After all that, mess, thank you very much for your compliance and your interference, DIAC and everyone else, the Borrellos went back to making their own cheese and not having to pay more than the one-off $18,000. So the compliance and the interference that is involved in these sorts of regulations is unnecessary. 


If you are chasing illegal workers, yes, fund DIAC to go and investigate and hunt them down properly but do not get in the way of business from doing a proper job of making a profit and employing people who want to grow the business and further culturally enhance something like the Borrellos were trying to do in this country. I rest my case.

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (16:14):  I speak in support of the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012, and I will actually deal with the bill. I support this particular legislation; it has long history. Back in 1999 the former Howard government commissioned a review of illegal workers but sat on that review year after year. In fact, former Liberal minister Philip Ruddock introduced the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, which came to affect on the eve of the federal election period on 19 August 2007—the federal election was in November 2007.


Having had a government review into illegal workers, they did nothing—year after year. At the time of its introduction, a review after two years of operation was planned. When the Liberals lost office and, fortunately, the Australian people entrusted a Labor government to serve in the Treasury benches, we said we would announce a review of the effectiveness of a particular legislation. We did that on 21 May 2010, and we appointed a very senior commercial barrister, Stephen Howells, to undertake the review.


The prevalence of illegal workers affects employers and employees. The major concerns with illegal work practices are that it means that people who are employed illegally are more susceptible to exploitation by venal employers. It means that concerns for workplace health and safety are less likely to be complied with. Employing those workers illegally has the effect of driving down wages and conditions, lowering safety standards and taking away the opportunities for Australian workers to get jobs. At its most egregious we have seen labour trafficking, forced labour and, effectively, economic slavery. This is a serious problem.


The former legislation put in place an alleged deterrent: companies could be exposed to fines of up to $66,000 per illegal worker. But, having investigated about 100 allegations against employers, it was found that only four were referred by DIAC to the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions. There were significant difficulties in developing prima facie cases against employers, and the only conviction we saw was in December 2010. This was a case where an employer was convicted and sentenced after a plea of guilty acknowledging a previous criminal record—a pretty straightforward case. A deterrent it was not.


The principal reason given in relation to this was the trouble gathering evidence. The best person to get the evidence is the employee who was working illegally, who may also find themselves in a position of legal sanction. It is possible that that illegal worker could find themselves in a detention facility awaiting trial, and the whole thing is extraordinarily expensive. So it is the case that employers with the worst motives could employ workers illegally, sourcing cheap labour, driving down wages and conditions, denying Australians the opportunities for those jobs and making sure that safety is not a high priority in the workplace. We do know that the vast majority of people who come to this country illegally, if I can put it like that, are people who arrive in Australia by aeroplane on valid visas and who stay here after the visa has expired. We see that quite regularly after major events are held in this country. They are not people who are the victims of effectively criminal cartels or people smugglers and who come to this country by boat and claim asylum.


The reality is that we could either resource DIAC even more and continue the current arrangements, which are not working and which the Howells review showed are not working—the evidence was clearly that they were not working—or we could take up the recommendations that were made by Stephen Howells. On 21 July 2011, the Minister of Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Bowen, announced that we would overhaul the penalties, make substantial changes in this area and make sure that those employers employing employees without the appropriate visa and appropriate rights to work could be sanctioned to a tiered system and were subject and liable to that. We have engaged extensively in relation to this. In fact, stakeholders have had about 13 years, in effect, of opportunities to put their case to government in relation to this issue, and have done so.


Employers, employees and trade unions—including the ACTU—have made submissions to the Howells review. The Howells review made a number of recommendations. It recommended the retention of the current criminal sanctions and penalties. It recommended legislation of a tiered system, as I said. And it recommended the idea of new civil penalties, with strict liability provisions and with statutory defences that employers could avail themselves of in circumstances where they had done the right thing. Also, there would be judicial discretion and maximum penalties of about $10,000. Stephen Howells recommended a system of infringement notices, with sanctions of about $1,000 and legislation, as I said, to protect those employers who do the right thing. He also talked about the need for better education concerning obligations and awareness for employers in those circumstances.


Many employers are very much aware of 457 visas—certainly, in the meat industry which is aware of them. In my electorate, Kilcoy Pastoral Company up in Kilcoy and JBS meatworks in Dinmore employ many people who come in on 457 visas in circumstances where there are workforce shortages in IT. In the health sector 457 visas are used as well, such as for doctors. Many medical practices in my regional and rural electorate are full of doctors who are here on visas and who become important parts of the local economy and community. In many cases, they are beloved for the work they do. 


The federal government called for further information and submissions from interested parties. We have effectively decided to take a tougher stance by bringing in the civil system. We have decided to extend liabilities to third parties in order to address sham contracting arrangements as well, where people are engaged in circumventing the law. We made sure that the integrity of our migration system in this regard was protected. We wanted to make sure that there would be no reduction in working opportunities for Australians. The critical thing in all of this, and I have seen this personally in my electorate, is that foreign workers—those workers who come to this place and who do contribute to our local economy—are not subject to exploitation. It was estimated that up to 100,000 people were working illegally in this country, and that had grown from about 50,000 in 1998. The Howard government's response was inadequate. It acted as no deterrent, it was ineffective and, in effect, it impugned the integrity of our migration system, and it provided further opportunity for the exploitation of vulnerable people. We put the exposure draft of this bill into the public domain in August 2012 and we have had many submissions in relation to it. We put forward this legislation which brings in and acts on the recommendations of the Howells review. I am particularly interested in, and I am particularly in support of, the tiered enforcement strategy that is there—the creation of the no-fault base civil penalties—which has a lower standard than a criminal standard. Establishing a new civil penalty framework is important. This legislation also introduces new monitoring and investigation powers authorising officers to gather evidence of suspected breaches. As I mentioned before, the gathering of evidence was always a problem.


This legislation is an example of this federal Labor government fixing up a problem that the previous Howard coalition government had failed to address year after year, and on the eve of an election they decided they would seek to do something to make out they were protecting Australian jobs and protecting those people who were vulnerable. Once again, like their Work Choices legislation, it was inadequate, wrong, fallacious in terms of the law and did not result in good workplace practices in this country. In the circumstances, this legislation does seek to address that. It acts on best practice and brings us into line very much with what is happening in New Zealand, the UK and the US. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:26):  The bill should be seen for exactly what it is. It is an example, again, of this government's war on employers. The stated objective of the bill is to impose an additional regulatory regime on employers who employ foreign nationals who are illegal or who do not have work rights. The bill amends the Migration Act to alter criminal offence provisions and create a new civil penalties with a regime of maximum fines of $49,500 for corporate entitles and $9,900 for individuals, as well as creating an infringement notice scheme. It looks also at broadening the application of criminal offences and civil penalty provisions to people who allow or refer an unlawful non-citizen to work or to work in breach of visa conditions, and it creates statutory defences where reasonable steps are taken to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement to work. It creates an infringement notice tier setting under the civil penalties provision allowing a person or corporate entity to pay a fine as an alternative to court proceedings. It also amends the current aggravated offences provision so that a person commits an aggravated offence when a worker is or will be exploited doing the work and the person who allowed the work or referred the worker knows this or is reckless about it. It also extends criminal and civil liability, in certain circumstances, to executive officers of bodies corporate, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management, and it creates search warrants and notice to produce powers specifically to facilitate the investigation of suspected breaches of these offences and civil penalties.


What a joy it is to be an employer under the Labor government. I have been an employer and I have employed students who were 20 hours a week, and I knew that was all they were entitled to work. I have also employed people under the working holiday makers program. But this Labor government puts all employers under the same blanket and treats them all the same, and decides that it is just going to put more complexity into the system. This bill is another myriad of onerous regime that it seeks to introduce, and it is testament to Labor's increasing obsession with making life difficult for as many employers as it can with more and more layers of red tape. You only have to look at the explanatory memorandum, which is 105 pages long. It is amazing. This would make the flow chart of Labor's red-tape obsession. It leaves the knowledge flow chart we saw some years back in the shade—and we know what a testament to clear and logical thinking that was, requiring navigation via a crystal ball and a ouija board. That is what this government does. It punishes the business sector.


In October of this year the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry released its National Red Tape Survey. The member for Canning highlighted some of the results of that survey. The chamber surveyed 870 businesses across all states and territories. The survey had some very interesting results and part of the member for Canning's speech highlighted that. But 73 per cent of businesses believe the overall compliance burden has increased in the last two years—what a surprise that is. Sixty per cent of businesses spent more than $5,000 per annum directly on costs related to regulatory requirements, with 16.1 per cent of businesses spending more than $50,000 per annum. Over 54 per cent of businesses spent more than five hours on their last tax return while 30 per cent outsourced it. Over 54 per cent of businesses perceive that regulatory compliance prevents businesses from growing.


What is difficult to understand is that the additional red tape the government seeks to introduce with this bill flies in the face of its own 2007 red-tape reduction election commitment. This government went to the election under the glib sound bite 'one-in one-out'. I remember that very well. Let us have a look at this government's report card against that election promise. When they said one-in one-out, on 29 October this year, the government had introduced 20,884 regulations and had repealed the wonderful number of—only—104. That is not one-in one-out, that is 200 in for every one out. An incredible tragedy, at the end of the spectrum, is the contrast with their 2007 red-tape election promise.


With numbers like that Labor should have called it their red-tape elevation election commitment, because at least then the government would have been able to lay claim to having had an election promise that they had delivered against. Regrettably, the numbers really do tell the story: 200 in for every one out. There is no conclusion to make other than that this government is anti-employers, anti-jobs and anti-productivity. Don't just take my word for it: according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, multifactor productivity has fallen by 6.6 per cent in Australia, from July 2004 to June 2011, with 4.2 per cent of this fall occurring from July 2007.


A study undertaken in August 2012 by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Australia as the second worst of 51 countries for productivity growth, ahead only of—and we should be very proud of this—Botswana. That is something we should truly be proud of as a nation. This less than stellar performance is also confirmed by the 2012 McKinsey study, called Beyond the boom: Australia's productivity imperative. This indicates that Australia's experience of income growth between 2005 and 2011 was driven by rising terms of trade and an upsurge in capital investment, not by labour productivity growth, which was weak, or by capital productivity, which actually fell quite significantly.


Against this backdrop we have, today, another bill that is introducing red tape. It is the very last thing Australian employers need, but it is just what this Labor government wants to slug them with through this bill. One of the primary reasons legislation is proposed and introduced into the parliament is to address unresolved needs or problems, or to correct a perceived mischief. What is the unresolved need or mischief this government is seeking to address here?


The best starting point in search for a meaningful answer to his question is the government's engagement of Mr Stephen Howells to conduct a review of the Migration Amendment (Employers Sanction) Act 2007 in 2010. In December 2011 the government announced that it would legislate to implement the recommendations contained in that review. 


The current employer sanctions regime, introduced by the Howard government in 2007, set out criminal offences for allowing an unlawful noncitizen to work; allowing a non-citizen to work in breach of a visa condition restricting work; allowing the referring an unlawful noncitizen to work, and allowed for referring a noncitizen to work in breach of a visa condition restricting work. Therefore, under the existing legislation, for a person to be successfully prosecuted for committing one of these offences, it must have been shown that these offences were committed either with knowledge or due to recklessness. The current sanctions regime also provides for an aggravated offence where the worker is subject to exploitation. In considering the question of what mischief does this bill supposedly address, it is instructive to examine how many times these existing provisions have actually been used since the commencement of the existing legislation in 2007.


According to Mr Howells' report, of the approximately 100 instances of possible breaches of these existing provisions considered by the DIAC offices, only four of them were suitable to be referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions—that is right, there were only four cases since 2007—hardly what you would describe as a 'burning bridge' necessitating further regulatory overreach by a red-tape-happy Labor government that is never happier than when it is slugging the business sector as hard as it can. It was very interesting to hear the member for Blair analysing all of this. I cannot understand this, and the member for Blair is a former lawyer as well. I cannot understand why, on the basis of this very low prosecution rate, Mr Howells' report makes the following astounding conclusions about the existing sanction provisions contained in the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, that they are supposedly:


… wholly ineffective as a deterrent against the small number of employers and labour suppliers who engage or refer non-citizens who do not have lawful permission to work or who work in breach of their visa conditions. The Employer Sanctions provisions are also ineffective as an educational tool for recalcitrant employers and labour suppliers.


This bizarre—and it is absolutely bizarre—contradiction fundamentally undermines Mr Howell report's recommendation. On one hand the report acknowledges that there have been very few breaches and even fewer convictions, while on the other hand such sparse behaviour apparently warrants the imposition of an even greater regulatory burden on employers. On this basis, the Howells report utterly fails in making a case that the extent of illegal workers warrant the heavy handedness of the response. Once again I return to the question: where is the mischief?


Mr Howells' report states that in 2008-09, DIAC located 11,428 unlawful noncitizens in Australia and, of those, only 990 were confirmed to be working illegally. The report estimates that up to 100,000 people were working illegally in Australia at any one time. However, the figures are purely speculative as they assume that all overstayers are working illegally. The total labour force in Australia is some 11 million, so even if the estimates in the Howells report are accurate, that is less than 0.9 per cent of 1 per cent of the workforce. The flames on the so-called 'burning bridge' just got higher. This is a great calamity requiring legislative solutions and posing more unnecessary burdens on Australian businesses. We are talking about a number that is equivalent to 0.9 per cent of the workforce that maybe working illegally, and I emphasise that there is no other way to view this bill than to say that it is a regulatory overreach which has gone mad. Why are we taking up the resources of the parliament in addressing a problem that scarcely exists, and more importantly, that is more than adequately dealt with by the existing law? We have heard about the onus on employers, but where is the onus on people who are working illegally under this legislation? I note that recently, the department changed some of its proof of records. Previously, people who were working in this country just had to quote an ABN, but I understand now that they are asking for proof of bank records and payslips; that is a very welcome move. But why does a Labor government have a pathological obsession with slugging employers in any way that it can? Speaking of employer groups, the government should not have been wasting everyone's time in drafting this bill. There have been various groups—according to the submissions received from, for example, the Australian Industry Group and various chambers—who believe the proposed changes in this bill to be:


... heavy handed and unnecessary. Imposing strict liability offences on employers and labour suppliers will not deter the small minority of employers or labour suppliers who already knowingly abuse the law to engage cheap labour. Rather the proposed changes will impact the unintended targets: i.e. good employers and labour suppliers. It is unfair that these persons be subject to high regulatory burdens because of the illegal practices of just a very small few.


In this context, the coalition opposes this bill, and I call on the government members to remember their own 2007 red-tape reduction election commitment. One in and one out; throw this one out even before it gets in. It is, again, an overreach imposing greater regulatory burdens on businesses out there who already have to contend with a huge regulatory burden that has just increased under this Labor government.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (16:42):  The bill implements the government's response to the independent report of the 2010 review of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007, conducted by Mr Stephen Howells. In 1999, the Howard government was presented with the results of a review into illegal work in Australia which concluded that the extent of illegal work in Australia was a significant problem and that measures in place at the time were insufficient to address the problem. The 1999 report recommended the adoption of a range of employer sanctions. Critically, the report recommended sanctions which encompassed both fault based offences with criminal penalties and strict liability offences with civil penalties as well as infringement notices. Unfortunately, the Howard government failed to act on these recommendations. It was not until 2007 that it belatedly introduced legislation which provided for criminal sanctions.


The 2010 review of these measures, conducted by the barrister Stephen Howells, found that the existing Howard government sanctions were wholly ineffective. These measure have not provided a practical mechanism to instil in businesses the need to comply, nor acted as a deterrent to illegal work hire practices. Illegal work hire practices undermine the integrity of Australia's migration program and can result in the exploitation of vulnerable workers. Such conduct may also put at a disadvantage those businesses that only engage workers who are entitled to work and it reduces work opportunities for Australian citizens.


The Howells review recommended implementation of the 1999 scheme, with a little modification, including graduated tiers of education, warnings, infringement notices, non-fault civil penalties and criminal offences. This is intended to encourage voluntary compliance by businesses, and when this does not occur, provide effective sanctions. The amendment in this bill will amend the criminal offences and create new non-fault civil penalty provisions for persons who: firstly, allow an unlawful non-citizen to work; secondly, refer an unlawful non-citizen to a third person for work; thirdly, allow a lawful non-citizen to work in breach of a work related visa condition; and finally, or refer a lawful non-citizen to a third person for work in breach of a work related visa condition. The Howells report provided a compelling analysis and critique of the effectiveness of the current framework for dealing with the problem of illegal work. It concluded that the prevalence of illegal work had increased markedly since the 1999 review, with potentially more than 100,000 workers currently being employed without valid work rights. This bill allows the government to crack down on employers who hire illegal workers by setting out a range of civil and criminal penalties. The graduated system of sanctions will operate as a last resort and should only be of concern to those employers who seeks to circumvent the law. The legislation's key amendments include: amending the criminal offences and creating new, non-fault civil penalty provisions and an infringement notice scheme for people who allow or refer an unlawful noncitizen to work, or allow or refer a lawful noncitizen to work in breach of a work related condition; creating statutory defences where reasonable steps are taken at reasonable times to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement to work; broadening the application of criminal offences and civil penalty provisions to hold a person liable for participating in an arrangement or series of arrangements that result in a foreign national working without lawful entitlement; extending both criminal and civil liability, in certain circumstances, to executive officers of bodies corporate, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management; and creating search warrant and notice to produce powers specifically to facilitate the investigation of suspected breaches of these offences and civil penalties.


In order to address the illegal practices of sham contracting, informal labour hire and use of illegal workers by various entities within a conglomerate, the application of the criminal offences and civil penalty provisions will be broadened so that a person who participates in the chain of events that results in a noncitizen being allowed or referred to work without the required permission can be held liable for contravening work related offences and work related provisions. In addition, the bill will extend both criminal and civil liability to executive officers of bodies corporate, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management in appropriate circumstances. It also introduces investigative powers to allow authorised officers to gather evidence of suspected breaches of the work related offences and work related provisions.


To the extent that the government's legislative response may be resisted by some employers, those arguments are likely to have the underlying theme that the introduction of strict liability offences will impose requirements that are too onerous or burdensome on employers, that it is not the responsibility of employers, that more education is the answer, that more time is needed, or that there will be an impost on business. Similar arguments were run throughout the Howard government years to resist and delay the changes which were recommended by the 1999 review. The case for change has been clearly articulated by the ACTU as follows:


It is not seriously contested that illegal work is a problem for a whole of variety of reasons, both for the illegal workers themselves, as well as all those working legally, whether they be Australian citizens and residents, or overseas workers with valid work rights. The prevalence of illegal work … affects … those employers who are doing the right thing, and the broader community. Major concerns with illegal work include:


employees employed illegally are more susceptible to exploitation and less likely to raise matters such as ill-treatment, safety concerns or under-payment because of their highly precarious status;


it has the effect of driving down local wages and conditions, lowering safety standards, and taking away local employment opportunities;


those employers employing illegal workers are less likely to comply with other legal obligations such as industrial relations, OHS, workers' compensation and taxation laws; and


In the worst cases, it can involve labour trafficking, forced labour, and slavery.


The real issue then becomes what practical measures are required to address the problem to reduce and remove the impact and incidence of illegal work. This means measures to deter employers who might be tempted to employ overseas workers without valid work rights and to ensure that those who do the wrong thing can be dealt with effectively.


One of the more disturbing aspects of illegal work is the use of student visas to bring people to Australia for exploitation in the sex industry. Anecdotal evidence given to the Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee of the parliament of Victoria for its inquiry into people-trafficking for sex work, and its subsequent report in June 2010, suggests that the number of trafficked women on student visas is quite large and growing. Certainly, Commonwealth prosecutors working on trafficking cases have seen evidence of trafficked women entering Australia on student visas. Indeed, being on a student visa did not exclude them from working legitimately in the sex industry. The prosecutors told the committee the problem was that in such cases it was very difficult to prove these women were working more than the 20 hours permitted on such a visa or that they had been brought to Australia to be exploited as trafficking victims.


The report of the committee indicated that trafficking can occur whether women arrive through legal means with valid visas and documentation, or through illegal means. It is not unusual for traffickers to arrange documentation such as student, visitor, tourist or working holiday visas on the basis of incorrect, forged or otherwise fraudulent applications in the source country. At this stage of the recruitment process money may also be deposited in an account opened in the victim's name to give veracity to her application for a visa. This may be particularly the case if the woman has made an application for a tourist visa. She will then be able to show she has sufficient means to support herself in Australia even though it is highly unlikely she will have access to, or control over, those monies once she has reached her destination. There is also some evidence that traffickers may arrange for sham marriages to a 'mule' or other person in order to strengthen their visa applications.


Concern has also been expressed to the committee about the role played by some colleges that accept overseas students particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. There have been strong suggestions that this under regulated sector is being used to provide a cover for traffickers and their operations. In particular, it has been observed that some colleges have been less than vigilant in monitoring attendance rates of people on student visas when they are obliged to do so. Evidence given to the inquiry by trafficking victims support workers also indicated that, in some instances, women are even paid to attend college, or at least make an appearance, as substitutes for the enrolled victim. Nina Vallins, the Executive Director of Project Respect, stated:


We are aware of cases where women have come in on student visas and they never set foot in the school. The school is in on it. The school is paid off or whatever it is to tick the women off on their roll, or there have been cases where someone else would go to the school on behalf of that woman and pretend to be her. But clearly there are these very dodgy schools which are assisting traffickers in their operations. It is a frustration for us that there does not appear to be monitoring of the schools.


The Salvation Army also told the committee how bona fide students may get caught up in trafficking once in Australia. Captain Danielle Stricklandsaid that in her view many young women who are legitimately here as students and are finding it hard to make ends meet are susceptible to being recruited for sex work whilst in Melbourne. That is, they are subjected to a form of domestic trafficking.


There are also many documented examples of exploitation of workers on 457 visas, the temporary migrant workers. I was recently made aware by the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers of the dismissal of the Danish engineer, Tonny Lind, who was on a 457 visa sponsored by Maersk Australia. According to the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, Mr Lind questioned the company regarding whether his rate of pay was less than what he was entitled to. When the company did not address his concerns he sought advice from the union and then went to the Fair Work Ombudsman. The company subsequently dismissed Mr Lind,making reference in their letter of dismissal to the fact that he was seeking redress through Australian authorities over his pay and, as a result, instant dismissal was warranted pursuant to Danish law. This seems extraordinary to me and tends to confirm the concerns I have expressed for a number of years that 457 visas are open to abuse as a vehicle to pay reduced wages and conditions.


There was also the recent decision by Fair Work Australia in reference to the Giovenco Industries and Rio Tinto Alcanmaintenance agreement of 2012. The Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers has also expressed concerns to me about this agreement. The Institute of Marine and Power Engineers believes that in this case 13 senior employees were made redundant, and the company then employed five workers of Filipino background just prior to the vote on the agreement, and that the latter were not allowed enough time nor had the ability to meaningfully understand the enterprise bargaining agreement that they were to vote on. The nominated bargaining agent for the agreement at the time, Mr Michael Huddy, asserted that the five workers were employed on 15 February just prior to the vote on 20 February and therefore did not receive a notice of representation rights at least 21 days prior to the employer requesting that they approve the proposed enterprise agreement under section 173 of the Fair Work Act of 2009. Mr Huddy noted that the vote on 20 February was 46 votes yes and 43 votes no and that this followed a previously unsuccessful vote a couple of months earlier in December 2011. Fair Work Australia determined that no breach of notice of representation rights had occurred as the requirement to notify in section 173 arises at notification time and applies only to employees employed at notification time, and was subsequently not applicable to the Filipino workers.


I believe this agreement raises serious concerns about the potential for abuse of subclass 457 visas. The case highlights a loophole in the act that allows an employer to secure an agreement in circumstances where it could well be that the aforementioned five workers were not in a position to understand their rights and options.


Recent estimates put the number of unlawful noncitizens and lawful noncitizens working without permission in Australia at around 100,000. This is despite the fact that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship continues to have considerable success in locating illegal workers. We must tackle the continuing practice of allowing or referring unlawful noncitizens, or lawful noncitizens without the required permission, to work. It remains a serious issue as it undermines the integrity of Australia's migration program and has resulted in the exploitation of vulnerable people. It places Australian businesses engaging noncitizen workers without permission to work at a competitive advantage and penalises employers who do the right thing. Its effect is to reduce taxation revenue as well as work opportunities for Australians and those noncitizens with permission to work.


This bill addresses the government's long-held concern about the serious matter of illegal work in Australia and demonstrates the government's determination to tackle the difficult issues associated with this practice. I commend the bill to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2012-11-26,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (16:56):  The Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012 seeks to impose an additional regulatory regime on employers employing foreign nationals who are illegal or who do not have work rights. The requirements this bill proposes are, I believe, onerous and unnecessary and are in direct opposition to the coalition's commitment to reduce the regulatory burden and compliance cost on business.


Employers who hire overseas workers are already weighed down by substantial regulations such as those contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008, and this bill will be yet another imposition on these businesses.




Mr Champion interjecting
—





The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order!




Mr McCORMACK:
  Your government is responsible for allowing so many foreign workers in under various acts.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Riverina will ignore the interjections from the other side of the chamber.




Mr McCORMACK:
  It is just unbelievable, but I will take your wise advice, Mr Deputy Speaker, and ignore the interjections by the member for Wakefield.


This act provides the Department of Immigration and Citizenship with expanded powers to monitor and investigate possible noncompliance by sponsors and introduce new penalties for employers who are found to be in breach of their obligations. Officers from the department were given investigative powers to monitor workplaces and conduct site visits. Fines of up to $33,000 were introduced and employer obligations were prescribed which had to be satisfied when employing a temporary overseas worker. A mandatory training requirement for 457 visa holders was introduced in this legislation which effectively amounted to a two per cent payroll tax on employers who engaged temporary overseas workers.


My electorate of Riverina has many of these temporary overseas workers. They work in the abattoirs, they work picking fruit in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and they do lots of other things as well. My Griffith electorate office handles many inquiries about these temporary overseas work arrangements. Combined with the introduction of the temporary skilled migration income threshold, the cost to Australian business of employing temporary overseas workers has become prohibitive. I and my staff member at Griffith hear that regularly. The Migration Act would be amended by this bill to alter criminal offence provisions and create a new civil penalties regime with a maximum fine of $49,500 for corporate entities and $9,900 for individuals, and an infringement notice scheme. It will also broaden the application of criminal offences and civil penalty provisions to people who allow or refer an unlawful noncitizen to work or to work in breach of visa conditions.


Statutory defences will be created where reasonable steps were taken to verify a foreign national worker's entitlement to work and an infringement notice tier will be created under the civil penalties provision, which will allow a person or corporate entity to pay a fine as an alternative to court proceedings. Additionally, the current aggravated offences provision will be amended so that a person commits an aggravated offence where the worker is or will be exploited doing the work and the person who allowed the work or referred the worker knows this or is reckless about it. This bill extends both the criminal and the civil liability in some instances to executive officers of corporate bodies, partners in a partnership and members of an unincorporated association's committee of management, and creates search warrants and notices to produce powers specifically to facilitate the investigation of suspected breaches of these offences and civil penalties.


In 2010, the government engaged Stephen Howell to conduct a review of the Migration Amendment (Employer Sanctions) Act 2007 and in December 2011 the government announced it would legislate to implement the recommendations contained in the review. Currently, the employer sanctions regime, which was introduced by the Howard government in 2007, comprises criminal offences for the following: allowing an unlawful noncitizen to work; allowing a noncitizen to work in breach of a visa condition restricting work; referring an unlawful noncitizen to work; and referring a noncitizen to work in breach of a visa condition restricting work. For a person to be prosecuted of committing one of these offences, it is also required to be shown that the offences were committed with either knowledge or due recklessness. If the worker has been subjected to exploitation, the offence is considered an aggravated offence, as it should be.


Since the implementation of the act in 2007, officers from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship have deliberated about 100 instances of possible breaches. Of these cases, only four were considered suitable to be referred to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. Due to the low prosecution rate, Howell concluded:


The provisions of the … Act—


as it stood—


are wholly ineffective as a deterrent against the small number of employers and labour suppliers who engage or refer non-citizens who do not have lawful permission to work or who work in breach of their visa conditions. The Employer Sanctions provisions are also ineffective as an educational tool for recalcitrant employers and labour suppliers.


The contradiction in this statement is a feature of the entire report. On one hand there are few breaches and even fewer convictions, yet on the other hand such exceptional behaviour warrants the imposition of an even greater evidentiary and regulatory burden on employers. Industry groups, including the Australian Industry Group, AiG, and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, ACCI, believe the proposed changes are 'heavy-handed and unnecessary'.


Under this bill the statutory defence provisions would require employers to establish, at the commencement of any work performed, that they were shown a valid Australian passport, a valid birth certificate, a valid certificate of permanent residency or a valid visa permitting work. The combined effect of this would mean any employer could be taking a risk of being fined before the court or receiving an infringement notice if they do not check this documentation. This administrative measure on its own is excessive. Furthermore, the process involved to view these documents is not only arduous but inherently discriminatory as it will require employees to reveal their age and place of birth. The need for this information has the potential to lead to discrimination against people who may be legitimate citizens or permanent residents of Australia but will be subject to questioning from their employer due to their race, accent and/or level of English. Due to these concerns, the ACCI has referred the draft legislation to the Australian Human Rights Commission and has informed the government that, if this bill is passed in its current form, the ACCI will seek exemptions under the federal and state discrimination acts to protect its ability to make requests for evidence required under the Migration Act.


The Master Builders Association of Australia made a submission to the Howell report, and, whilst they strongly support tough penalties being applied to those who deliberately exploit illegal workers, it was emphasised that the deliberate procurement of illegal workers for placement jobs in Australia was completely different to the inadvertent backpacker who has overstayed their visa. The law should specifically target those who deliberately seek out illegal workers. The Howell report was unsuccessful in making a case that the extent of illegal work warranted the heavy-handedness of the response. For example, the report stated in 2008-09 that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship located 11,428 unlawful non-citizens in Australia and, of those, only 990 were confirmed to be working illegally. The report also estimated that up to 100,000 people were working illegally in Australia at any one time. That is a staggering statistic. However, these figures are only speculative as it assumes all over-stayers are working illegally—and we know that is not correct. The total labour force in Australia is 11.057 million people. So, even if the estimates in the Howell report are accurate, this is less than 0.9 per cent of the total workforce.


The regime which is proposed shifts the cost of compliance and law enforcement directly onto the employer. I was contacted by my constituent Carmel La Rocca of Griffith, who wished to voice her concerns about this bill. Mrs La Rocca believes it is unfair to put the onus of ensuring workers are legal on farmers. As contractors, she believes it should be up to the contractor to ensure any subcontractors and employees they employ meet the necessary legal requirements to work in Australia. It is completely reasonable for Mrs La Rocca, or indeed any other farmer who uses a contractor, to place their trust in a contractor to employ legal staff. Farmers do not have the time to sit and check all the documentation from contractors of their employees' legal working status. 


Whilst they have been advised by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship that there will be ways of doing this online, many farmers are not computer savvy. Many farmers do not want to have that onerous burden of having to go and check every single employee, when they have been told in good faith that that employee is able to work. The Howell report stated:


The cost of addressing this problem cannot be borne solely by Government or the taxpayer and it is impossible to impose the cost on the workers themselves. Australian employers must bear some of the cost and inconvenience by taking reasonable steps to identify the workers they engage or employ and by taking reasonable steps to establish whether those workers have permission to work. Australian citizens must be prepared to bear their share of the cost and inconvenience by obtaining and carrying adequate identification when they seek work.


It is unfathomable that this Labor government can think it is acceptable to place this burden on employers by shifting the cost of enforcing the law onto them.


The coalition has consistently made the point that Australia's migration program is intended as a supplement not a substitute to the Australian workforce—to fill the gaps which have opened up by the way Australia's population has naturally grown. This is at the centre of the coalition's approach to the issues of the 457 temporary work visas and skilled migration. In that context, we have said that we will look at liberalising the 457 visa criteria to create a genuinely temporary and regional solution to skills gaps and shortages without compromising compliance. We will remove the union-driven roadblocks, allowing businesses—they are the people who actually employ people and make money to pay taxes and keep this Labor government in place so it can make all sorts of stupid policies that send us all broke—to quickly access the critical information that they require while also maintaining important safeguards and sanctions against those businesses and individuals who seek to abuse the scheme. 


The existing regime and compliance costs the government has systematically built around the employment of foreign nationals are already onerous, and the proposed changes are going to significantly increase the compliance costs for employers as well as leave them to struggle through the complex tangle of red tape.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (17:09):  I certainly agree with the comments that have been made by my colleague, the member for Riverina. I rise today to also speak on the Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Bill 2012. The government states that the purpose of this bill is to reduce the use and exploitation of illegal foreign workers. This is indeed a noble purpose. Any business found to be exploiting workers should be punished accordingly.


The Howard government brought in some very strict rules in 2007 to deal with just this issue. However, it is clear when you look at the detail of this bill that, far from achieving the purpose of the bill, the new regulations and sanctions proposed by the bill are so onerous that they will impose excessive regulatory and compliance costs on all businesses, the vast majority of which do the right thing. The minister himself acknowledged that the vast majority of businesses do indeed do the right thing.


Why is it significant that this will be so onerous for businesses? Let us examine this question in more detail. The government, in coming into government, claimed that for every regulation it brought in it would get rid of a regulation—a one-in, one-out approach. It also claimed that it would fix the problem of deregulation by simply appointing a minister for deregulation. But these issues are not fixed; the facts do not support its claims.


Since coming to power the Labor government has introduced over 20,000 new regulations. It introduced over 1,000 pages of new regulations with the carbon tax alone. In that same period it removed fewer than 100 regulations. How can businesses be expected to plan, with any sense of certainty, when the goalposts are changed so frequently by this government? And what is the point of having a minister whose main function is to deregulate the economy, when all we see from this government is more red tape, more regulation and more burden?


Like all things this government does and says one must look past the spin and at the reality. This brings me back to the bill before the House—another piece of regulation, another level of bureaucracy and another impost on hardworking Australian businesses. What is it that this government has against Australian businesses? Why does it consistently try to make it harder to do business in this country, not easier? We understand that creating the right regulatory environment is critically important to our nation's future. We understand that removing red tape will increase productivity and, in turn, allow business—the wealth creators of this nation—to thrive and grow.


According to the Productivity Commission red tape represents four per cent of all business costs and red-tape reduction can contribute up to $12 billion to our economy. Don't take my word for it; it was, after all, the current Treasurer who said 'Lifting productivity is essential to the nation's prosperity.' If only this government's actions were consistent with its words. To say this government's record on regulation is atrocious is an understatement. In a recent Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum Australia received a massive wake-up call on how we are doing. It showed that we are now ranked 96th in the burden of government regulation compared to 68th in 2007-08, noting that the lower the ranking the worse the burden of government regulation, in this instance. It also showed that we have slumped from 40th to 80th in pay and productivity for the same period. It is little wonder, when the same report showed that Australia had slipped from 12th to 29th in transparency of government policy and, most alarmingly, from a relatively strong position of 10th in wastefulness of government spending to 48th.


When you consider these trends it comes as no surprise to learn that productivity in this country is on the slide. A recent Grattan Institute report reinforced these claims. It showed that since 2007 Australia has experienced a drop in multifactor productivity of 4.2 per cent, while the OECD average remains in positive territory. This may not have an immediate effect on our economy but it does not bode well for our long-term economic outlook. The government should be doing everything it can within its power to introduce policies that address this emerging and alarming trend, not to introduce legislation that will further increase the regulatory burden and ultimately reduce productivity. Why is punishing all business with more red tape so detrimental?


The Business Council of Australia has reported that, compared to the United States, it costs 40 per cent more to operate resource projects in Australia, it is 92 per cent more expensive to build an airport and it costs 62 per cent more for hospitals. Perhaps this would not be such a problem if we lived 100 or 200 years ago, but in today's global economy, where capital is liquid and mobile, business competitiveness is more important than ever. It is essential that government create the regulatory environment that fosters business activity and growth. This legislation, however, is a step in the wrong direction. This legislation is an extra regulatory burden placed on all business, not just on those that are doing the wrong thing. It will further erode competitiveness. 


The government may well say: what is one more regulation going to do? What effect will one more piece of legislation have? Let us make it abundantly clear: as previously stated, it is but one of a multitude of regulations introduced since 2007. Increased regulation, as well as having an economic impact, has a human impact. 


The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, ACCI, recently conducted their national red-tape survey, and the results were distressing. Almost three-quarters of the 870 businesses that responded said they were spending more time on regulation today than they were just two years ago. Forty-four per cent of businesses are having to spend between one and five hours a week complying with government regulations—filling out forms, applying for permits, reporting business activity at a local, state or federal level. One in three businesses is spending more than five hours a week on regulation, and 11 per cent of those surveyed spent more than 20 hours a week on regulation. That is half the working week on regulation. This is time that could be better spent on growing businesses, which would be productivity enhancing or, as I said before, it could be time better spent with families, which would be emotionally enhancing. 


We know that each piece of regulation comes at a cost. Seventy-three per cent of businesses reported to ACCI that their overall cost of compliance had gone up in the last two years; 42 per cent of businesses estimated they spent more than $10,000 on compliance with regulation. Eighty businesses spent between $50,000 and $100,000. A resounding 60 businesses spent in excess of $100,000 on regulation. About 60 per cent of businesses said red tape had a moderate to major impact on their business; while 54 per cent flagged that the effort taken to comply with regulations had prevented them from making changes to expand or grow their business. 


With the extra regulatory burden this legislation places on all businesses, one would hope that the intended beneficiaries would be wide-ranging and vast. But it is not so. According to the Howe report there are approximately 100,000 illegal workers in Australia at any time. When you consider Australia has a workforce of over 11 million people, it means this legislation is relevant to only 0.09 per cent of the workforce. What kind of cost-benefit is that? What is this government saying? It is saying: 'Let's unload another level of administrative burden on all Australian businesses so we can target 0.09 per cent of the workforce.' Once again, the government is using the heavy sledgehammer of regulation when there are better, more targeted ways to achieve its objectives. 


But of course this is not the first change the government has made to the temporary migration and skilled migration program. These changes come on top of the regulatory burden already imposed through the introduction of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Act 2008, which gave the department of immigration expanded powers to monitor, investigate and penalise employers for non-compliance as a sponsor. That legislation allowed DIAC officers the investigative authority to conduct site visits, monitor workplaces and impose fines of up to $33,000. In addition to this, the legislation imposed compulsory training requirements for 457 visa holders that effectively amounted to a two per cent payroll tax. It is little wonder that business in Australia is becoming so very expensive.


The recent bungled approach to skilled migration at the Roy Hill project highlighted the deep divisions within the government on this issue and just how beholden they are to the union movement. This piece of legislation is yet another example of the confused and contradictory nature of the way the government goes about making regulation. It is difficult for business to adhere to this regulation, given that it will be in conflict with much of the state based antidiscrimination legislation and federal antidiscrimination legislation.


Under this bill, employers need to demand proof of birthplace, gender and age documentation. Under existing state legislation, this could be used down the track as a basis for accusations of discrimination. As a result, ACCI has already referred to draft legislation to the Human Rights Commission and, should the legislation pass, they will be seeking exemptions under both state and federal antidiscrimination acts. It is, again, another example of the incompetence of this government.


The coalition understands the importance that skilled migration plays in our economy. We understand that it is an important component in the labour force to fill in the gaps that we have with certain projects in getting them off the ground. We also understand that it is not a replacement for full-time Australian workers. The coalition cannot support this legislation. It will only increase the regulatory burden to further stifle business and to further stifle productivity, and will certainly not achieve the outcomes and objectives that the government has indeed set for itself. 


Debate adjourned.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (18:30):  Over the weekend many of us came together to celebrate annual White Ribbon Day. 25 November each year is set aside to remembering and committing to do something about violence perpetrated against women and girls in the community. White Ribbon Day is dedicated to raising awareness of tackling the issues of domestic violence against women, which is the most prevalent form of violence that we have in our community today. Domestic violence is the single most widespread human rights abuse throughout the world. Australia is no exception. Although this country is doing much to protect victims and address the attitudes underlying the continuation of violence against women, the statistics on domestic violence are simply terrifying. The fact is that in their lifetime one in three women in our country will experience physical violence and one in five will experience violence of a sexual nature. It is also a fact that one woman is killed each week by her current or former partner. If that is not a wake-up call to society, I am not sure what is.


These statistics should be quite chilling for every responsible citizen in our country, but they become even more confronting when you personalise them and acknowledge the fact that every woman that we know is vulnerable to violence. When I look to personalise this I think of my wife, Bernadette, my daughter, Elizabeth, and my three fabulous granddaughters, Charlie, Maisie and Kiarni. For me that is the one in five; the statistic sits there. So for me it becomes very personal. With the females in my life I love the most, that one in five statistic really resonates with me. I would like to encourage all men to personalise this statistic. If they did, it might strengthen our resolve when it comes to changing the attitude which allows domestic violence to flourish.


Domestic violence and violence against women in general is one of the most significant issues facing our community today. Left unchecked, domestic violence will continue to flourish on an intergenerational basis. What we know is that 60 per cent of young boys growing up in abusive households are more than likely to become abusers themselves. What is even more chilling and disturbing to me, and I just cannot fathom this, is that 50 per cent of young women or girls growing up in an abusive household are more than likely to take an abuser as a husband or a life partner. Then the cycle continues. When you consider that one in four young people have witnessed violence against their mother or stepmother in their lifetime, it clearly demonstrates how widespread this is as an issue in our community. 


In fact, domestic violence is even more prevalent in south-west Sydney, in the area of my electorate, than in the rest of the country because of a couple of things. There is an issue about it being a low socioeconomic area, an area of great disadvantage, which probably comes into the equation. It is also a very multicultural community. Many people who migrate are fleeing from violence and oppression themselves, and perhaps some of that is manifested in the way women and girls are treated.


Cultural barriers make it significantly harder to get the message through to victims about seeking help but also to get the message through to perpetrators and potential perpetrators that domestic violence in our community is a crime—that, if you commit this crime, you will be dealt with and more than likely you will go to jail. That is the message we really have to get through. We have to protect the victims and look after them, but also, to abusers and potential abusers, we really need to articulate our stand on domestic violence in our community.


Only last Friday I had the opportunity to speak at a couple of functions. Before I went there I decided to check the level of reported cases of domestic violence in my local areas. I discovered that from January through to now there have been 2,079 incidents of domestic violence reported in Liverpool. In Fairfield there have been 2,024 over the same period. In Cabramatta there have been 797. In Green Valley there have been 1,500. That does not cover a full year, but the stats are very high. When I sit down and talk to the local police they tell me that, of all the assaults that occurred in each of those four police commands, 50 per cent of them relate to domestic violence. In terms of police resources and doing something about domestic violence—looking after victims—we have to take into account that 50 per cent of all assaults in those area commands relate to domestic violence. They also advised me that there are still many incidents of domestic violence going unreported. That may be a cultural reflection. We have seen progressively an increasing number of women having the courage to report their abusive partners. That is a good thing.


Similarly, there is underreporting. Domestic violence not only causes a lifetime of pain for victims and their communities but also has a significant economic ramification. I have just described the amount of work by the local police. Almost up to $15 billion, they estimate, by the year 2021 would be the cost of domestic violence. At the moment it is about $13 billion, they estimate. Bear in mind that the cost of organised crime to our community is $15 billion, so it is not far behind it in terms of the overall cost. We literally cannot afford to turn a blind eye to domestic violence.


On Friday last week, I attended two functions in my electorate designed to draw attention to domestic violence. I attended the Liverpool and Green Valley White Ribbon event at Miller Square, where residents, the local police and local service providers came together to raise awareness of this important community issue. Attendees enjoyed a BBQ and live performances and were able to gather useful information from stalls held by various local service providers. The event organiser, who is a fellow White Ribbon ambassador and a good friend of mine, Jimmy Masher, of the Liverpool Migrant Resource Centre, once again put together a wonderful event. The local area commander, Superintendent James Johnson, was also on hand and put a police perspective to the difficulties of domestic violence in our community.


The Cabramatta White Ribbon Day event at the Cabramatta PCYC was just as big an event. In fact, I think they had around 300 people attending, with many cultural performances, stalls and guest speakers, including Police Inspector Guy Newman. I would like to acknowledge all the hard work the Fairfield Migrant Resource Centre put into making that event very significant. I would also like to thank Julio Gruttulini, President of the Cabramatta Community Centre, and Dr Simon Emsley, Community Development and Advocacy Coordinator at the Fairfield Migrant Resource Centre, for all their hard work. Another group I would like to refer to is the Aboriginal women's group Sisters for Sisters, which is part of the Liverpool Women's Resource Centre. The group started in 2010 as a result of the Aboriginal Women Against Violence program, which was run in partnership between the LWRC and Joan Harrison Support Services for Women. The group is about Aboriginal women coming together and telling their stories through artwork. I recently attended their art exhibition. These are women who are trying to make a difference and support one another. In that respect, I thank Shirley Kent, the coordinator of the Liverpool Women's Resource Centre, and all the ladies from the Aboriginal art group, who allowed me to view their incredible contribution. I seek leave to tender to the House the document they gave to me, entitled 'Sisters for Sisters: a publication by the Aboriginal women's group on domestic violence'.


Leave granted.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-11-26,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (18:40):  In supporting this motion, I would like to commend the member for Fowler. His contribution here tonight joins a lot of fine words that have been spoken in the last 72 hours as community leaders right throughout Australia have denounced violence against women and supported the principles of White Ribbon Day. I had the opportunity to speak last night at a community function in Briagolong, where we took the oath in front of another 100 or 200 men.


In making my contribution, I would like to reinforce the words of the member for Fowler and also those of the Victorian police chief, Ken Lay, who pointed out that violence against women is an issue which is often discussed in terms of statistics. It is easy to talk about these sorts of numbers—51,000 family incident reports, 17,000 arrests or 36,000 offences. On average, one woman is killed by her partner or a former partner every week in Australia. One in three women over the age of 15 report physical or sexual violence at some in their lives. Then we had the incidents in Melbourne quite recently with the tragic deaths of Jill Meagher and Sarah Cafferkey. But the reality is that we do not put a human face to the tragedy when we just talk about statistics. It is important in this place, as we discuss White Ribbon Day, to recognise the human toll of violence against women. It is also important that we recognise that, for a lot of women in Australia, the streets of our cities and regional towns are safer than their own homes. For a lot of people in Australia, the tragic reality is that there is more danger for them in their own bedrooms than there is in a public bar room, and that is a disturbing fact that we need to think about as we talk about White Ribbon Day.


In my electorate, the Gippsland Women's Health Service takes the leading role in the fight against violence in Gippsland. I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from that service in recent weeks, and the really strong point to be made is that this is not a women's problem, it is not a problem for the police, it is not a problem for members of parliament like those gathered here today and it is not a problem just for the Gippsland Women's Health Service. This is a problem for our entire community and, in particular, it is a problem for the men in our community. It is up to us as men, particularly members of the House of Representatives who are leaders in our own communities, to set the example for other men and young boys within our community. Swearing the oath, as we did today in the parliament at the White Ribbon Day function, is the easy part. We must be vigilant for the other 364 days of the year. There are simple things that we can do to demonstrate our respect for women in our daily lives. In swearing to never commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women, we are taking a stand and setting a standard in the community. When we hear degrading jokes about women, we can choose not to pass them on. We can choose not to forward degrading emails. We can choose to treat all the women in our lives with the respect that they deserve, both in the workplace and in our family lives. The very simple question we can ask ourselves as men is: would we laugh at that joke or enjoy that pornographic video if it were our mother, our daughter, our sister, our wife or our girlfriend? These are the choices we can make every day of the year as men.


On that point in relation to pornography, I want to raise my concern about what I see as the increasingly violent nature of pornography and the extraordinary level of accessibility that now exists. It has the potential, I believe, to distort men's views of women in the community. I was going to demonstrate this on my iPad today, but I thought we might lose our G-rating on A-PAC. When talking about this issue on Friday in my office with two of my staff members, we googled three words on the iPad: nude, women and sex. These are words which I would say any 10-year-old boy could spell and certainly could search online—they are very competent with the technology. Within 10 seconds, Google had provided us with a long list of sites which met those search parameters. Within 30 seconds we could download visual images of sexual acts which were demeaning, violent and aggressive towards women. We were not asked at any stage to verify our age and we could access that 24 hours a day with a mobile device like an iPad, anywhere we liked. We have access to hardcore pornography wherever we are—at home, in the workplace, in the parliament of Australia or anywhere we choose to go online.


I know some people listening will say, 'That's freedom of choice—what's the problem with that?' But as a father with two sons and two daughters, and as a member of parliament, I am deeply concerned about the potential impact that such violent and aggressive images will have on young people. The objectification of women within the porn industry has direct links to violence against women in our community. Women are continually depicted in demeaning roles. The gender role they are given in the pornographic industry is to serve men. The images are often violent and graphic, and it can give young people and particularly young men a false sense of how a healthy sexual relationship should work.


I fear, and the evidence supports me, that there is a strong link between violence and pornography. The industry would deny it, but you would expect that from the industry because it is a $25 billion industry—we are talking about a big business. It is constantly developing even more hardcore images as consumers become bored with previous offerings. I quote an extract from the summary of the report from the United States Attorney-General's Commission on Pornography, which looked at the violent repercussions of porn:


Since the clinical and experimental evidence supports the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to sexually violent materials and an increase in aggressive behavior directed towards women, and since we believe that an increase in aggressive behavior towards women will in a population increase the incidence of sexual violence in that population, we have reached the conclusion unanimously and confidently, that the available evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that substantial exposure to sexually violent materials as described here bears a causal relationship to antisocial acts of sexual violence and, for some subgroups, possibly to unlawful acts of sexual violence.


I am a realist. I am not a wowser. What adults choose to do, within reason, is entirely up to them. In this modern era of accessibility and increased accessibility via the internet, I acknowledge that we cannot ban pornography and we will not be able to stop it or police it, but I think we can discredit it. We can work harder as a community to discredit it. We can give our young people the appropriate skills, the resilience to cope and an understanding of how a positive sexual relationship works, and reveal to them the ugly side of the porn industry. We can help them understand that the violent sex depicted in pornographic videos is highly unlikely to be the type of physical contact or physical relationship their girlfriend or wife in the future will enjoy.


I have been reading the work of Victorian researchers Maree Crabbe and David Corlett, who have studied the porn industry very closely. They are developing prevention measures to help young people understand the difference between pornography and reality. I encourage other members to take the time to have a look at some of their work. They say that we need to help young people to understand issues of gender, power and consent, and we need to do this by having conversations with young people in our schools, at home and in society more broadly.


It is not just the young people we need to educate. We need to give parents the skills to talk more comfortably about this issue, because it is a difficult issue for parents to talk about with their sons and daughters. I think young people are very smart, and they are pretty tech-savvy; I think they are better than the porn industry and I think they are going to figure it out. If we are serious about reducing the incidence of violence against women, we have to take on the porn industry and give our community those skills and the capacity to counter this cancer in our society. The violent and extreme scenes which have become mainstream pornography are a cancer in our society. It is slowly eating away at our morality and it is certainly eroding the social fabric of our community.


On White Ribbon Day we talk a lot about justice and equality for women, but there can be no justice and equality for women when we have a $25 billion industry that survives by depicting violent, aggressive and dominant roles for men over submissive women. There can be no justice or equality for women until we address that fundamental issue. Exercising control and power over women is the absolute core of pornographic material in the 21st century, and exercising control and power over women is a fundamental feature of violence against women. The link is undeniable, and our challenge is to help our young people to develop the skills to have healthy relationships in the future.


I am certainly not saying that if you watch porn then you are automatically going to commit violent crime towards women, but when we have such young and impressionable viewers exposed to such images on a constant basis the risk is obvious to us as a community. In raising this issue today in the context of the debate put by the member for Fowler I am not wishing to sound alarmist, but I think parents need to be aware of the risk. I challenge parents listening tonight to take the 30-second test I took on Friday with my staff. Anywhere, at any time, their children could be downloading hardcore pornography and violent images.


We all need to start working together to explode the porn industry myth. We need to be telling our sons about healthy relationships and how to respect girls and women. We need to let our daughters know what they should expect and what they deserve. Preventing violence against women is something that all members of this place have expressed their passion about here today. As men, I believe that we do have the capacity to make a difference. Violence against women is never acceptable and in the 21st century it is up to us to redefine what masculinity is about. Real men do not hurt women.


As I said earlier, it is fine for us to come in here today as members of parliament and swear the White Ribbon Day oath, but the real challenge is going to be what we do for the other 364 days of the year. I commend the motion and I commend all members for taking the opportunity to speak on behalf of the White Ribbon Day event. I wish them well in the future as we work as a community to eliminate violence against women, wherever it may be.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (18:50):  I rise this evening to support the member for Fowler's motion and I commend him for bringing it to the attention of the House. Violence against women is one of the most insidious crimes that we as a society are confronted with, and the statistics reveal a disturbing situation. One woman is killed every week by a current or former partner, one in three women over the age of 15 report physical or sexual violence at some time in their lives, in 50 per cent of households where domestic violence occurs child abuse also occurs and one in four young people have witnessed violence against their mother or stepmother. These are the terrifying realties that confront women experiencing violence in my electorate and right across the country. 


In fact, the very term 'domestic violence' is one that is often seen as inaccurate. For some years there has been a growing debate about whether we should be distinguishing between private and public forms of violence. It is more commonly, however, used to refer to violence generally against women. Domestic violence does not only constitute physical violence. It can take many forms, including forced isolation, verbal abuse, financial abuse and emotional abuse. 


Statistics are one thing but the human face is, of course, another. I saw first hand during my time as a pro bono duty solicitor for female victims of domestic violence what this really means. In approximately 10 years of my former life as a lawyer, I was a volunteer duty solicitor for the Redfern Women's Domestic Violence Advocacy Service. I would front up to the Downing Centre at least one Wednesday a month, usually more, to assist representation in mentions and apprehended violence order hearings for female victims of domestic violence.


There are a few cases that really stick in my mind. I saw a lot in those years. The one that sticks out to me more than anything was of a young Lebanese woman who had met in Lebanon an Australian man whom she decided to marry. She married him in Lebanon, came to Australia pregnant and had the baby in Australia. It was decided for some unknown reason that her new husband's family no longer wanted her. She was subjected to just about every form of violence—not just physical but emotional, mental, and financial. She was literally thrown out of the house with her infant. She could not speak a word of English, and she was continually threatened by this man and his family. She ended up being accommodated in a refuge when I was representing her.


Here was a first-time mother with an infant, in a foreign country, having been subjected to every form of violence you can imagine. That is one that to this day sticks out in my mind. Every now and then I think of trying to find out what happened to this lady, but, as I have been counselled by other people, it was my job to represent her. I did, I managed to obtain an order against the perpetrator and his family. But that poor woman and what she went through will always stick with me. I also saw a disproportionate number of Aboriginal women and their children who were victims of domestic violence. Even though this was a couple of years ago and social media has certainly taken off a lot since my time practising, the amount of electronic stalking of young women was absolutely alarming. I want to mention the support workers and the lawyers Gilbert + Tobin, who gave many years of support to advocacy services and continue to do so, because, without these non-government agencies stepping in, female victims of violence would have much less support than they currently do. I particularly mention the Outer West Domestic Violence Network, which held its White Ribbon breakfast at Blacktown two weeks ago. It was attended by hundreds of business and community leaders who all took the White Ribbon oath. I represent a large proportion of the Blacktown local government area, which, unfortunately, has some of the highest rates of domestic violence in Australia. The local area commander of Blacktown police, Superintendent Mark Wright, told us that domestic violence kills about 36 people each year in the Quaker's Hill, Mt Druitt and Blacktown local area command. It is a disturbing and shocking figure that no-one in the public should put up with.


One of the major issues of violence of this nature is the silence that often occurs in an abusive relationship. Two out of three victims do not go to the police. Whilst I would say it is important for us to raise this as a parliament, we should also remember that not only must we raise this but also we cannot tolerate silence when it comes to violence against women.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (18:56):  Tonight I rise to speak to the member for Fowler's motion on White Ribbon Day. Violence Against Women, Australia Says No was for many years one of the most visible campaigns in Australia, reaching an audience of millions. But why did such a campaign have to run in a country such as ours? The very sad reality is that as many as one in three Australian women will in some way be affected by violence against them. This is an absolutely shocking statistic and one that we must all work hard to make sure is turned around.


A national survey that was conducted a couple of years ago found that 17 per cent of women had experienced a sexual assault, in many cases by someone they knew, someone who was very close to them. This breach of trust at the most fundamental level is both sickening and disturbing. I guess we all know that, whilst the visible signs of physical abuse may heal, the psychological and emotional pain that is suffered can be ongoing and can last for many years into the future. Some people may take that emotional pain through the rest of their life.


As the member for Fowler has already indicated, the estimated cost of violence against women as well as children in Australia in 2008-09 was $13.6 billion, which is an extraordinary amount. It is a huge cost to Australia and to Australians. We cannot allow this to continue. Certainly, one of the better ways to battle against violence against women is through raising awareness. The Violence Against Women, Australia Says No campaign is a good example of awareness at its best, as it stuck in the minds of many people because of its very simple message.


One organisation that is actively working hard to raise awareness is White Ribbon, the drivers behind White Ribbon Day. Starting in Canada over 20 years ago, White Ribbon Day has spread across the globe and spreads a very simple message that violence against women is simply unacceptable. In 1999, the United Nations declared the date on which White Ribbon is held, 25 November, to be the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Children.


Yesterday, on 25 November, I joined members of the Southern Gold Coast community at Palm Beach to raise awareness for White Ribbon Day. A variety of events and activities were organised by the Palm Beach Neighbourhood Centre, including a bike ride and AFL footy tunnel with members of the Gold Coast Suns team present. I take the opportunity to acknowledge the work of Jill Wynd from the Palm Beach Neighbourhood Centre in making the day the success that it was.


On Sunday, we had the Gold Coast Mayor, Tom Tate; the state Assistant Minister for Child Safety, Rob Molhoek; and the member for Burleigh, Michael Hart, all there attending and voicing their opposition to violence against women. It is very important that we have our community leaders making a very strong stand and showing good leadership on such a significant and important issue. We also had at the event on Sunday the police superintendent Paul Ziebarth, who spoke about the appalling domestic violence statistics in our community.


One of the things that White Ribbon advocates is men taking an oath never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. The most important part of this oath is the promise not to remain silent. Part of helping end violence against women is not only undertaking not be violent yourself but also having the courage to speak up when you know that someone is using violence against a woman. Together we can help bring an end to violence against women. Through awareness, we can stop violence being perpetrated against today's women and the women of tomorrow. I give my commitment to work with the community to do what we can to ensure that violence against women does not continue.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2012-11-26,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (19:01):  I rise to speak in support of the honourable member's motion. In speaking in support, it is important to put on the record what the motion actually is about. It is about 25 November—which was yesterday—which is White Ribbon Day. It is a day aimed at preventing violence against women in Australia. It is about encouraging Australian men to join the My Oath campaign to challenge the attitudes and behaviours that allow violence to continue.


White Ribbon Day was established in Australia in 2003. It was a unique campaign by men and for men, with women's support, to prevent and reduce violence against women and girls. In 2007 the White Ribbon Foundation was established in recognition that achieving attitude change on violence required a long-term and high-profile commitment to work within communities to engage men and boys. The White Ribbon Foundation has a variety of ways of doing this. It works through a combination of awareness-raising campaigns, community events, and initiatives with schools, universities, workplaces and sporting organisations. It is most widely known for initiatives around White Ribbon Day and the 'I swear' campaign, which has been expanded to the 'I've got your back' initiative and the White Ribbon ambassadors, who are frequently high-profile men in our community.


Every year there are around 350 events held across the country, mostly on or around White Ribbon Day. People register these events on the White Ribbon website. Of these, 50 are coordinated by the White Ribbon Foundation. They mainly also include fundraising. To date, over 220 events have been registered on the White Ribbon website, and there will be many more going on in communities all around the country.


I am pleased to say that there was Australian government funding for the White Ribbon Foundation—$1 million over four years to 30 June 2014—enabling them to do some of this work. It is important work because it is profile raising, it is about being in the public eye and mind. Whenever we talk about domestic violence everybody in this House says how dreadful and terrible it is and how it should not happen, but it continues to happen. I worked in a women's refuge and I set up the Far North Coast Domestic Violence Liaison Committee. I have also been involved in a whole range of things in my community, along with other good people. We continue to tackle it and attempt to reduce it. We want it to end. But it continues to happen. It is a long-term goal to change attitudes in our society so that it is just not acceptable anywhere. To those of us who find it abhorrent and unacceptable and wonder why it continues, there are still many people with the attitude that it is okay, it is all right, or who do not even think about it—they just think it is part of our society. The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Status of Women yesterday in speaking on this issue said that, to achieve a sustained reduction to violence against women and girls, every sector of the Australian community must act—and we must. Sometimes it can be challenging to know when and how to act. If we know about it and we know someone who is perpetrating it or someone who is a victim of it, we must find ways of making it not acceptable and giving support to the person who is suffering it. Women often leave and they are forced back because they need somewhere to live. I think that it has to be the No. 1 priority right across all the services that, if a woman leaves and she leaves with her children and she needs accommodation, that accommodation just must be given. It has to be given and it has to be immediate. With those words, I commend the motion.

"Matheson, Russell, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (19:06):  Violence against women is a very serious issue, and the horrifying statistics speak for themselves. One Australian woman is killed every week by a current or former partner; one in three women over the age 15 report physical or sexual violence at some time in their lives; one in four young people have witnessed violence against their mother or stepmother; and domestic and family violence is the major cause of homelessness for Australian women and their children.


As a former police officer for 25 years, I have seen many examples of violence against women firsthand. As a husband and a father of two beautiful daughters, I found it very difficult to understand how these violent acts could occur, especially when they were instigated by those closest to the victims themselves. Throughout my time in the New South Wales Police Force I was faced with many acts of violence against women, including domestic violence, family violence, wife bashing, sexual assault, rape, sexual harassment, verbal abuse, emotional abuse and forced isolation from friends and family. It was heartbreaking to see these actions occurring against women of all ages and cultures—and it is even more disturbing to see so many people sit on the sidelines refusing to stand up for what is right while those they love come to harm. This is why White Ribbon Day is so important. It encourages violence against women to stop and asks those who witness such violence to take a stand for these women and make it clear that it will no longer be tolerated in our communities.


In my electorate there are still too many examples of domestic violence against women, both emotionally and physically, but there are also some great initiatives as part of the White Ribbon program taking place to stop this behaviour and encourage others to stand up against it. Each year the Campbelltown Domestic Violence Liaison Committee, which includes the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Campbelltown City Council and UnitingCare Burnside, conducts an event to help raise awareness in the local community for White Ribbon Day. Last year they painted a 30-metre white ribbon on the grass hill at the University of Western Sydney, which could be seen from Narellan Road. They also sent out posters to local businesses so that they could display and sell white ribbons at Macarthur Square and Glenquarie Shopping Centre.


The Campbelltown police, together with members of the Campbelltown Domestic Violence Liaison Committee, held a free barbecue in Mawson park last Friday. The barbecue included information stalls, kids activities and a visit from the New South Wales Police safety mascot, Constable Charlie. Businesses and organisations from the Macarthur community also supported the event, including Tim's Garden Centre Park, the Paul Wakeling Motor Group, Campbelltown City Council, W.I.L.M.A. Women's Health Centre, Tharawal Aboriginal Corporation, the Benevolent Society, Campbelltown Fire Brigade, UnitingCare Burnside, the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Campbelltown Lions Club, who manned the barbecue on the day. It was great to see so many people from my community attend to support the barbecue on Friday. Just by doing so, they have taken a stand against violence against women—and for that they should all be very proud of themselves.


The people who took part in these events in Macarthur are helping to strengthen the White Ribbon campaign, which began in Australia in 2003. It was initially part of UN Women and formally became a foundation in 2007. It is now Australia's only national male-led campaign to prevent violence against women. White Ribbon believes in the goodness of most men and it believes that good men reject violence against women and are willing to act to prevent it. White Ribbon believes in the capacity of the individual to change and encourage change in others. I think it is a fantastic program, which is why I signed up to be a White Ribbon Ambassador last year. I believe in everything the campaign stands for, especially its primary focus on prevention. 


The White Ribbon Foundation works to change our culture to stop violence before it occurs with activities in schools, workplaces and the broader community. As an ambassador, I have made a commitment to take an active role in any violence against women. I join many men from all walks of life who are passionate advocates for social change. White Ribbon now has 1,900 active ambassadors promoting the campaign in the Australian community. These men share the White Ribbon message within their networks and, through social media, highlight the importance of respect for women and encourage community groups, local councils, workplaces, men's organisations, sports and services clubs to get involved in the White Ribbon campaign.


Today I would like to congratulate all of the people in my community who have signed up to be a White Ribbon Ambassador and those who support the cause throughout the year. Most importantly, I would like to thank every man who has ever intervened or stood up against violence towards women. It is these men who are leading by example and breaking the silence from the front line. They are the greatest ambassadors for the cause, and it is thanks to them that we are moving closer to a society where such behaviour is not tolerated and that is the way it should be.

Mrs ELLIOT
 (Richmond—Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (19:10):  I rise in support of the motion by the member for Fowler and acknowledge his long-term commitment to the principles of White Ribbon Day. I know he has been a very strong advocate of raising awareness about this issue for many years. I also acknowledge and commend all the other speakers on this very important motion.


We know that White Ribbon Day is so important to the whole community in terms of raising everyone's awareness about the devastating impact of domestic violence, and I speak to it tonight, particularly from the perspective of a former police officer. I saw all too often the reality of domestic violence as a general duties police officer. I saw the devastating impact upon women, their children and their families and indeed our community as a whole. So I have a very strong commitment to making sure we work together to take action in relation to this.


The purpose of White Ribbon Day is primarily to highlight the devastating impact of domestic violence and how we can work together to prevent it, to stop it. We know that White Ribbon Day is observed nationally on 25 November each year in conjunction with the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and aims to raise awareness for the prevention of violence against women.


This day to raise this awareness was brought about by a terrible tragedy. In 1989, 14 women were shot dead at the Montreal school of engineering by a young man. This very brutal act triggered the creation of the White Ribbon campaign. It is the largest effort by men across the world working in partnership with women to end violence against women.


White Ribbon Day stands as a stark reminder to us that violence against women in any form or context is absolutely unacceptable, and I encourage everyone to get involved with the campaign by joining the My Oath Campaign and taking the oath:


I swear never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women


It is important that we recognise that the White Ribbon Day initiative has become a catalyst for many women to seek help, so it is important that we talk about it here in our communities constantly to raise awareness and hope that it assists women in accessing help and support.


I also want to mention an important organisation in my electorate, the Tweed Shire Women's Service, that provides vital support services for women. They provide advocacy, information and support to many women who have been in situations or are in situations experiencing domestic violence, escaping domestic violence as well as supplying support to their families. This service was first established in 1987, and they have also provided lots of early intervention and crisis accommodation for women.


I am proud to be the patron of this outstanding organisation, which has for over 24 years made a huge difference to the lives of many women and children and also a huge difference to the community by the remarkable work that they do and continue to do. It is through the work of organisations like the Tweed Shire Women's Service, other support services, police and emergency services combined with the continued awareness of White Ribbon Day that together we can make a difference: we can stop this happening.


I would also like to recognise the fact that this government has a very strong and proud commitment to providing support for women and families that are affected by domestic violence. I was particularly pleased today with the Prime Minister's announcement that the government would be providing funding for the international conference into domestic violence programs, which will be held next year. The Prime Minister announced that the Gillard government will provide $20,000 in funding from the Women's Safety Agenda to support this important Australian-first conference, which will help increase awareness of the best ways to combat violence against women. It was great to have that announcement today. 


The Gillard government is committed to crime and prevention activities aimed at reducing violence against women and their children. The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022 brings together the efforts of governments across the nation. This government has committed $86 million to initiatives under the national plan to improve the lives of women who have experienced violence. So it is really important to have that major commitment and, indeed, the commitment right across the country from all levels of government so that everyone is working together. I think we would all agree that every year we are seeing awareness raised more and more and we are seeing many more campaigns. It is really good to see that throughout the community people are speaking out. They are taking the oath.


As a former police officer I saw day to day—constantly—the impacts of domestic violence and now I see that these positive improvements are a major step. We certainly have a long way to go and, through increasing awareness raised by White Ribbon Day, we are achieving a lot. We should recognise that and I commend everyone who has spoken tonight and those who are intending to speak in terms of working together to make sure that we are improving the situation for women and their children right across the country, and those who are affected by domestic violence.

Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (19:15):  I am very grateful to the member for Fowler for bringing this motion today. I feel enormously proud that so many men in this parliament have taken a lead in speaking on this issue. I think it is really fantastic. I listened with great interest to the passionate speech given by my colleague the member for Macarthur.


I had the privilege of being the minister for women under the Howard government and working with the then Prime Minister to highlight the need for the violence against women to stop in this country. And the Prime Minister took a leading role and garnered the support of every state minister in the country. We met here in Canberra and together the Prime Minister and the state leaders sent out a very strong message that violence against women simply has to stop. They recognised that it is not just a problem for women but is also a problem for men, and that if we were going to succeed in stopping violence against women we would have to get men to take a leading role in talking to other men about it. 


And one of the major thrusts of that campaign—I had the responsibility to roll out a national campaign—was to break the cycle of violence. Children are too often the innocent victims of domestic violence in particular. On 2 December 1989, 12 women were killed at Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, Canada. And this shocking event brought the subject of violence against women to the forefront of the public consciousness. Two years afterwards a handful of men decided to mark the anniversary of this tragedy by starting White Ribbon Day. That is why we are wearing the white ribbons today. I am glad to see mine is still on because I think it has lost the pin.


This has become a worldwide movement and it is marvellous to see our men taking such a key role here in Australia. A unique part of White Ribbon Day is that it is led by men to stamp out violence against women. Men swear never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. Its initiative asked men to challenge stereotypes and speak out, reinforcing that it is simply not good enough for society to condone violence through silence.


It is an unfortunate reality that in Australia one women is killed every week by a current or former partner, and one in three women over the age of 15 will report violence against them at some point in their lives. These confronting statistics are compounded by the fact that society has been apprehensive in dealing with domestic violence. This is all too common a complaint and was exemplified in a short clip shown on Channel 10's The Project last night. For the benefit of the chamber, I can tell you that it focused on the experience of a women who, after a turbulent relationship, wished to leave her partner. After confronting her partner she was drugged and raped. She complained to the authorities, but the response received was tepid at best, with the woman being steered away from pursuing an official complaint because of the timidity at the time in confronting domestic violence. Five years after the incident she finally brought proceedings against her former partner, who was recently jailed for seven years. These incidents reinforce that society must not remain silent in the face of violence. We must change the social conditions that lead to violence and teach our children from a young age that respect is not dependent on a person's gender. 


The myths surrounding violence and women must also be demystified. It is simply untrue that certain socioeconomic groups experience more domestic violence than others. Unfortunately, it is a problem that cuts across all society, regardless of background. Violence is also not necessarily related to drunkenness or substance abuse. Studies have shown that there are even numbers of incidents perpetrated by drunken and sober men. Also, violence is not experienced by a small number of women. A report by VicHealth in 2004, entitled Health costs of violence: measuring the burden of disease caused by intimate partner violence, found that violence is the biggest cause of injury or death for women between 18 and 45.


In the face of these alarming findings, it is critical that the campaign to stop violence against women remains strong. We can do that by urging everyone to visit the White Ribbon Day website and challenge what you think you know about violence against women and to learn more about the positive role models that are making a difference in local communities right across Australia.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (19:20):  I rise in support of my colleague Chris Hayes and other parliamentary colleagues to support the motion acknowledging White Ribbon Day, November 25, a day aimed at preventing violence against women through a nationwide campaign to raise public awareness of the issue.


Violence against women is indeed an incredibly serious problem. I understand that one Australia woman is killed every week by a current or former partner, that one in three women over the age of 15 report physical or sexual violence at some time in their lives, that one in four young people have witnessed violence against their mother or stepmother, that two-thirds of women who experience domestic or family violence are in paid work, and that domestic and family violence is the major cause of homelessness for Australian women and their children.


I am one of the male parliamentarians for the elimination of violence against women who has taken the white ribbon pledge not to commit, not to condone, not to stay silent about violence against women. One of the things we have committed to do is raise awareness of the issue of violence and, in fulfilling this pledge, I would like to speak to the House briefly about the Brunswick community safety forum which I held jointly with the state member for Brunswick, Jane Garrett, on Monday, 19 November, very recently, in response to the death of Jill Meagher. 


This forum was attended by 150 Brunswick residents. The Victoria Police Local Area Commander for the Moreland area, Dean McGowan, reported at the forum that crimes against the person are up around eight per cent, that most assaults are perpetrated by someone who is known to the victim and that some 44 per cent are family violence cases. The Moreland district has allocated a new sergeant and two officers dedicated to the family violence issue. 


The Executive Officer of Women's Information, Support and Housing in the North, Trish O'Donoghue, urged women to report all incidents, attempted assaults and the like, and pointed out that this will assist police to apprehend offenders before they commit more serious crimes. 


Members of the audience asked questions about what action the police were taking to improve security. They talked about the need for more taxi ranks and more CCTV. Police responded that there will be five Protected Services officers at Coburg railway station, which is a crime hotspot. Later on, they are looking at doing more at the Jewell railway station and other areas in the southern part of my electorate. They also said that speaking up is necessary for police to be able to take action, and they observed again that you are more likely to be assaulted inside your home than outside it. 


Residents talked about a range of community safety issues. They talked about the extent of population increase in Brunswick and they expressed a view that developers who make a lot of money, with hundreds of apartments going up, should make a contribution to the measures needed to improve safety and that it should not all be the responsibility of council or state governments. They talked about the need for more spending on lighting along pedestrian paths and railway stations. They said that Brunswick Police Station should be made more prominent and basically should be lit up like a Christmas tree. One resident talked about the 292 liquor licenses in Moreland. He believed they should financially contribute to making the community safer, with measures such as late night buses or extra lighting. Residents also talked about the fact that mixed-use planning can encourage slums and crime. In the light of further recent attacks on women in Melbourne, such as the murder of Sarah Cafferkey, I say again that violence against women is never acceptable under any circumstances, and we affirm that women like Jill Meagher and Sarah Cafferkey mattered and that they and their lives were important and meaningful to us.


We had at the forum Michelle Noon from the White Ribbon campaign who gave a very strong presentation. As the House is aware, every year White Ribbon runs an awareness campaign about the issue of violence against women and the role that men can play in preventing this violence. White Ribbon is encouraging men to stand up to violence against women with the knowledge that, and I use their words, 'Thousands of good men have got their back.' White Ribbon's new campaign highlights that men can challenge their mates and others in a way that does not endanger their own safety, knowing that there are many good men who support their actions and that the change starts with good men standing up and letting the perpetrators know that violent attitudes and behaviour towards women are never acceptable.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Thank you, member for Wills. I think it is worth commenting that your electorate's response to the tragic death of Jill Meagher was something that all Australians would find very commendable and a strong community response.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2012-11-26,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (19:26):  This year, the White Ribbon Day campaign is its 11th year, and the campaign is as pertinent as it was when it began. Research, as we know, reveals that as many as one in three women experience physical violence in their lifetime and one in five experience sexual violence in their lifetime. These numbers are far too high. The White Ribbon Day campaign is about reducing the number of women in Australia who experience violence perpetrated against them. The White Ribbon Day campaign is about changing the culture in our society so that violence against women is completely unacceptable. White Ribbon Day encourages men to take a stance in their lives and in their relationships with other men to let them know that violent and predatory behaviour against women will not be tolerated. 


What makes White Ribbon Day unique is that it does not seek to preach to men using a top-down approach, because we know that the top-down approach to education and public awareness campaigns that aim to change or influence behaviour does not have a great deal of success in achieving goals. In contrast, the White Ribbon Day is about change on the ground through peer-on-peer influence. The White Ribbon Day seeks to inspire men to stand up publicly in their networks and make it clear that they will never commit, excuse or remain silent about violence. Having personally witnessed the devastation that violence against women can have on families and communities, I believe that the White Ribbon Day is a campaign with a lot of merit. This is a campaign that every man in Australia needs to offer their full support to. As a nation, we need better awareness about the devastation that violence against women has on our society. It is for this reason that I again took the oath of the White Ribbon Day campaign. As I have said in this place before, violence against women has far-reaching effects. Violence impacts on women for the rest of their lives and even beyond. Violent behaviour is easily modelled by victims and witnesses, resulting in a dire intergenerational outcome. Unfortunately, there are all too many instances of generational learning of violent behaviour against women. We need to take a stand now to ensure the safety of the next generation of Australian women.


One community group in my electorate has taken-up the fight to stop violence against women. The Midland Information, Debt and Legal Advocacy Service Incorporated, known as MIDLAS, has this year run its own campaign for White Ribbon Day. MIDLAS created a series of short videos featuring community leaders of all ages, political persuasions and professions swearing the oath to end violence against women. I was pleased to be able to lend my own voice to this important initiative. It is fantastic to see so many people from my community get behind this great local campaign. It is through the efforts of MIDLAS and other community organisations that we will begin to see genuine change in our culture and an end to violence against women.


Violence against women can also result in dislocation of women and children in times of hardship; isolating women from their support networks and making it difficult to end the cycle of abuse. The emotional cost alone is enough reason for us to take action now to stop the cycle of violence. But on top of the emotional toll is an economic cost. It is estimated that violence against women in 2008-09 cost our country $13.6 billion, and if we do not take action against violence against women it is estimated that in 10 years we will face a cost of $14.6 billion. The financial and social cost of violence is far too high. I encourage all men—including my parliamentary colleagues and men in my local community—to seriously consider swearing the White Ribbon Day oath to take a stance against violence against women. We are role models in our communities and it is important that we lead by example. Violence against women is a serious and important matter—one that we need to shine a light on and bring out of the shadows and into the open. Violence against women will never be acceptable in any circumstance. Australian men cannot afford for this important issue to go unchallenged. No woman should ever be in fear of violence in the workplace, in her home or in a social context. Australian men need to do everything in our power to make sure the women around us are safe. If we do not make the effort, the intergenerational changes will not occur in the way that we require. In my work as an undertaker and as a teacher I have seen the end result of violence against women and the impact that it has.


Debate adjourned.

Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (20:58):  I welcome the opportunity to use this grievance debate to talk about World Diabetes Day, which happened last week when the parliament was not sitting. We had an excellent lunch, which had been arranged by Diabetes Australia, at the Lodge. Mr Matheson was a gracious host and spoke compellingly about the challenge of diabetes in Australia today. World Diabetes Day came after a report called Diabetes: the silent pandemic and its impact on Australia was launched in Parliament House. That report is a research paper written by a very well-known Melbourne institute, the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, in partnership with Diabetes Australia and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. World Diabetes Day was marked across the globe on 14 November. The day is a reminder that diabetes is one of the most important healthcare challenges that governments around the world will face this century. At the European Diabetes Leadership Forum at Copenhagen earlier this year, former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan—a man who has seen many of the worlds conflicts, pandemics and crises—chillingly reminded his audience that diabetes kills more people worldwide annually than HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. Even more sobering is the fact that Australia is on the front line. One study has found that if the rise in diabetes continues, up to 17 per cent of Australians will have diabetes by 2025. In fact, I believe that this is referred to in the study I mentioned. Unbelievably, we are on track to beat that prediction.


The message is clear that the government needs to act, but it needs to act in concert with all Australians. Every one of us has a responsibility for our own health. It is not just a government responsibility but government needs to lead the way. I am pleased to see the member for Hindmarsh in the chamber tonight, because he has been a long-term advocate for a comprehensive plan to combat diabetes in this country. He has been a long-term member of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. We thank him, as the chair of Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, for his work to highlight the need to manage diabetes better than we have done.


Before this century reaches its half term, the global affliction of diabetes will have wrought incalculable harm to the quality of life of individuals, with consequences for the social fabric and the productivity of all nations. For richer nations the consequences will be drastic, but for poorer nations they will be catastrophic. All over the globe diabetes is an insidious blight to income, productivity, and life expectancy. The World Health Organization estimates that 347 million people worldwide have diabetes, and that without intervention the number will double by 2030. There are currently 2.9 million deaths each year directly caused by diabetes. 


The global challenge of diabetes in the 21st century was the trigger for the United Nations resolution passed unanimously in 2006, which declared 14 November World Diabetes Day. But with diabetes rates growing worldwide, six years after the resolution there is little room for self-congratulation. It should serve to stiffen our resolve as a community to do better. Diabetes must be a national health priority, with an emphasis on prevention, diagnosis, treatment and research.


We continue to be confronted by escalating health costs and fiscal constraints—exacerbated by the deadly political inertia of a hung parliament, frankly. Amid all this we need to retrieve the crucial mantra that nothing succeeds like prevention. Prevention is both the best medicine and the best politics. And it is also the cheapest.


Undiagnosed, untreated or inadequately treated diabetes can lead to death preceded by multiple health conditions. It is a major cause of limb amputation, blindness, cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. Locally, it is estimated that 1.7 million Australians out of a population of 23 million have diabetes, with 280 new cases being diagnosed every single day. Over two million people have pre-diabetes, which is a condition where the blood sugar level is irregular, placing an individual at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Without diagnosis and appropriate intervention, more than 30 per cent of people with pre-diabetes go on to develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years. 


The stark reality of the prevalence and cost of diabetes in Australia was outlined, as I said, earlier this year in a research paper by Baker IDI, Diabetes: the silent pandemic, and its impact on Australia. It projects a diabetic population of three million over the age of 25 by 2025. Type 2 diabetes was once called late-onset diabetes, as it mostly affected people over the age of 60. Yet today, children, particularly in the Indigenous and Pacific Island populations are being regularly diagnosed with the condition and being condemned to a future of complex and expensive care. I had the privilege of speaking with the Speaker of the Tongan parliament at dinner this evening and I know from my regular visits to New Zealand, where I have been invited to speak, that the Pacific Islanders have a particular challenge ahead of them, as so many people in the Pacific have diabetes. It is a huge challenge. He was telling me this evening that many of them cannot get access to kidney dialysis; they have to go offshore to have that treatment.


The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has warned that obesity is a major contributor to the diabetes pandemic. In the Betterlife Index of the last 20 years, Australia is identified as having one of the fastest growing obesity rates on the planet. It reveals that about 60 per cent of Australians are now overweight or obese. Baker IDI estimates that the total annual cost for Australians with type 2 diabetes is up to $6.57 billion per annum. This figure includes healthcare costs, the cost of carers and Commonwealth government subsidies.


The latest statistics in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare overview of kidney transplant and dialysis in Australia show that the rate of new cases of end-stage kidney disease, ESKD, has increased by 80 per cent and is largely diabetes related. Indeed over the preceding 18 years kidney replacement therapy for ESKD almost tripled as did the number of people on kidney dialysis. There is a wealth of grim documentation pointing to the catastrophic cost of failing to diagnose early. The peak body Diabetes Australia estimates that there will be a 12-fold differential in the cost of managing advanced diabetes compared with early diagnosis and intervention.


A message that I have long promoted is that governments need not be afraid of the cost of diagnosing and treating diabetes; they need to be afraid of not diagnosing it and not treating it and then having to treat a number of complex conditions that result from not diagnosing and not treating diabetes. The dilemma for government therefore is whether to invest in prevention and relatively inexpensive treatment modalities, or continue to withdraw programs with an inevitable budgetary explosion affecting current and future generations.


Tragically, Australia today is without a coherent strategy for managing diabetes and has been without a national diabetes action plan since 2007. So tonight I would like to urge all my colleagues, particularly those who have long been involved with the parliamentary diabetes support group, to urge government to make a statement, to take leadership and to declare diabetes a national health priority.


This week we have the opportunity to speak to young people in this parliament at the Kids in the House event. They will tell their stories about what it is like to be a child living with diabetes and how that impacts on the quality of life. The other mission for us is to make sure that we do remember these children by ensuring that a cure for diabetes is forthcoming.
