"Nehl, Garry, MP",NP,1999-09-27,"—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Philippines and Japan from 24 May to 5 June 1999. The visit of the parliamentary delegation to those countries occurred during the Asian economic downturn which had extended throughout the region during the previous year and which had been manifest in Japan somewhat earlier in terms of a prolonged financial recession.
The aims of the delegation's visit were, in general terms, to strengthen the bilateral relationships between Australia and both countries at a time when economic pressures underline the necessity for regional stability as a means of enhancing mutual security and promoting economic growth and recovery. To this end, the delegation participated in an extensive program of meetings with members of the legislatures of both countries and with ministers and officials at the highest levels in the areas of economic policy, health, agriculture, foreign affairs, trade, defence and tourism—including the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Obuchi.
In the Philippines the government of President Joseph Estrada has continued to pursue the economic and social reform agenda established by his predecessor, President Ramos. Economic growth has proved difficult to achieve during the past year due to continuing regional recession and to climatic factors affecting agricultural production. The delegation was advised that economic restructuring was being pursued despite social costs, such as higher structural unemployment.
Issues dominating the delegation's discussions in the Philippines ranged from tariffs on agricultural produce to investment and security issues. The Philippines is trying to pursue a policy of trade liberalisation to open new 
 markets for such produce as tropical fruits, but continues to encounter political resistance to attempts to reduce tariffs on locally produced commodities such as sugar and rice, which are produced very inefficiently as peasant based industries. Discussions with a range of congressional leaders and provincial officials made it clear to us that there was little or no popular support for tariff reduction on commodities such as sugar.
The extremes of wealth and poverty, as well as infrastructure deficiencies, remain critical problems in the Philippines. The immaturity of the existing party system and the extensive use of congressional `place filling' by families of leading political figures was an additional issue which became apparent to the delegation in discussions with political leaders both in Manila and in the provinces.
Security issues brought to our notice by foreign secretary Siazon, and by Vice Admiral Santos of the Philippines Navy, included concern over Chinese incursions on islands in the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines, the continuing insurgency problem on Mindanao and the ratification of the visiting forces agreement with the United States by the Philippines Congress. The heavily armed escorts necessary for the delegation to make its way in safety—or to make its way under any circumstances—through Manila and to areas of the provinces underlined the continued existence of law and order and insurgency problems in the country—both significant problems for the Estrada government.
In Japan, discussions focused on the economy and on the financial restructuring measures put in place by the Obuchi government to restore confidence in the banking system and stimulate consumer spending and investment. There remain continuing concerns about the pace of reform in the areas of financial market deregulation and tariff reforms on a range of agricultural imports, some of which are important Australian agricultural exports, such as dairy products, meat and rice.
I agree with some of my delegation colleagues that political and business leaders showed a lack of urgency with regard to change, particularly in regard to trade and financial deregulation matters. Representatives 
 of the Japan-Australia Diet Members League were very senior political figures and the league would greatly benefit from an infusion of younger Diet members. It was also apparent that the Japan-Australia Business Cooperation Committee consisted of very conservative and senior business leaders and was dominated by commodity importers at the expense of representatives of such sectors as food processing and information technology—both areas in which Australia is keen to develop markets in Japan.
The delegation's visit to regional areas of Japan enabled members to strengthen and consolidate already effective sister city relationships with Sasebo and Nara, sister cities of Coffs Harbour and Canberra, to be briefed on regional trade initiatives being undertaken by the Australian Consulate in Fukuoka, and to observe the local tourism facilities in Nara and in the Mie Prefecture.
In both the Philippines and Japan the delegation was received with warmth and friendliness both at official levels and by its many hosts within the capital cities and in a variety of provincial centres. I thank my delegation colleagues for their support and constructive contributions to our discussions. I would also like to mention the professional assistance received from the Australian Embassy staff in both the Philippines and Japan, the enthusiastic support of our delegation secretary, Dr Margot Kerley, and the wonderful support and friendship of Ambassador Tadashi Suzuki from the House of Representatives secretariat in Tokyo.

"Thomson, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—The   delegation to the Philippines and Japan was led by the Deputy Speaker and member for Cowper and it was a terrific experience. In the Philippines it was a good opportunity for us to observe a new government in office. Former President Fidel Ramos visited Australia during his time as president and he did tremendous things to reform the Philippines economy. Under the new president, President Estrada, things are slightly different. There are some security problems looming, and I think they will loom greater in the future. The troubles the Philippines were experiencing with China over 
 some disputed sea territory flared up while we were there. In fact, on the very morning that we met the foreign minister, Mr Siazon, a Philippines Navy vessel had struck and sunk a so-called Chinese fishing vessel, no doubt having a more nefarious purpose than catching fish. They were dealing with it in a very constructive way and that was good to see.
As far as their approach to their economic problems was concerned, I felt they perhaps were not on the ball quite as much as the Ramos administration had been. They were trying hard but were looking like they were going to run up a fairly sizeable budget deficit. Some of the fiscal stringency of the past seemed to be slipping away.
As the member for Cowper said, it was very clear in the rural areas that we visited in the Philippines that they were having political difficulty with the notion of trade liberalisation. The price of sugar had come down a lot and they had a lot of employment dependent upon the sugar industry. Frankly, they were quite nervous about that prospect. Although we had very constructive exchanges with them, I felt that they really had some more work to do to resolve that in a political sense. All in all, you would not say that the direction of the Estrada administration is the wrong one, but there are some signs of the difficulties that they are encountering and we wish them more steel in their spine as they deal with them in the future.
In Japan, my impression was that the reform process had slowed down, that there was a sense of satisfaction with what had been done so far, and that people were talking more about supplementary budgets being what would really fix their problems, which are really not enough. As the leader of the delegation, the member for Cowper, pointed out, the Japan-Australia Business Cooperation Committee is beginning to look very old-fashioned, as are some elements of the Japan-Australia Diet Members League. Certainly, the Australian embassy is well aware of that and there are moves afoot to introduce some new blood into both those organisations.
I would like to give other members of the delegation time to share their reflections with the House.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Parliamentary Delegation to the Philippines and Japan</title>,Delegation Reports,0,1
"Washer, Mal, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—The delegation visit to the Philippines and Japan enabled members from both sides of politics to contribute to strengthening the bilateral relationship with two important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The Philippines is a nation with which Australia has had important historic ties and with which it continues to maintain important links, particularly in the areas of trade and development cooperation. The delegation were aware of the great challenges facing the Estrada government, particularly with regard to improving the social and economic prospects of the nearly 25 per cent of the population officially accounted as poor.
Infrastructure deficiencies represent a formidable problem and were obvious to members of the delegation as they made their way through the Manila traffic. Deficiencies were also apparent in the provinces where the delegation inspected an example of AusAID's Municipal Solar Infrastructure Project to provide clean water and electricity from solar cells to more than 370 rural settlements.
Despite continuing difficulties with providing a secure food supply to its population, the Philippines economy as a whole did not perform as badly as some other countries in the region during the last year. The delegation was told that agricultural reform was a priority of the Estrada government. However, it was not apparent that the Philippines agricultural ministry was tapping into international sources of expertise in agricultural research, much of which Australia is in the position to supply.

"Gallus, Christine, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, I present the report of the committee entitled Going for Gold: Immigration entry arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games , together with the minutes 
 of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—In 1998, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Hon. Phillip Ruddock, asked the Joint Standing Committee on Migration to report on immigration entry arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games being held in Sydney in September-October 2000. The inquiry lapsed when the parliament was prorogued. The minister again referred the matter to the new committee on 16 December 1998.
The purpose of the inquiry was to review issues related to the planning and coordination of entry arrangements for visitors, participants and officials for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The committee received 46 submissions and accumulated 250 pages of evidence at public hearings. Participants at the hearings included representatives of the tourist and travel industries, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police, the National Crime Authority and the Department of Transport and Regional Services.
While government departments were asked about their arrangements, tourism and travel industry submissions tended to focus on ways of simplifying access to Australia for visitors. The committee was not disposed to consider any waiving of visitor visa requirements, as suggested in some of the tourism and travel industry submissions. The committee felt that this would put added strain on Australia's border entry arrangements and cause delays in visitor entry processing on arrival.
There was broad agreement by witnesses that Australia's paperless electronic travel authority, or ETA, was a satisfactory way of minimising formalities and speeding visitor entry while protecting Australia's border integrity. The committee recommended increasing the number of countries for which ETA was available. The committee also recommended investigation of the practice of travel agents charging visitors for the ETA.
The committee was advised that the standard of scrutiny currently applied to intending visitors will continue through the games period. The committee was concerned that refusal to grant visas to some would-be visitors from specific countries could be caught in the spotlight of media attention during the games and generate negative publicity. Consequently, the committee has recommended forward planning to permit effective responses to visa issues which may gain a higher public profile during the period of the games.
The Olympic and Paralympic Games will place considerable demands on Australia's capacity to plan and coordinate immigration arrangements. Not only are more people expected to visit Australia but the arrivals are also expected to be concentrated in a short period with most visitors expected to arrive through Sydney international airport.
The games will also see increased numbers of people seeking to exploit any consequent weakening of DIMA's vigilance by attempting to enter Australia without documents or with false documentation. This will impose heavy demands on the skills and resources of Australia's border agencies, chiefly the Customs Service which staffs the immigration booths, and DIMA and AQIS. Although these agencies sought to reassure the committee that they would be able to handle the expected demands of the games period effectively, the committee noted there were only narrow margins between the border authorities' predicted capacity and the expected demand.
Australia's capacity to handle predicted volumes of visitors is reliant on trained and experienced staff offshore and at onshore entry points. Staffing in DIMA, ACS and AQIS is generally being approached by restructuring staff arrangements rather than by recruiting more people. The committee was concerned that this approach would not permit the agencies to cope with unexpected events. The committee therefore recommended that staffing levels receive further consideration.
The committee was also uneasy about the current and proposed staffing at international hub airports such as Singapore and Bangkok. It was felt that the provision of still further 
 staff was needed to ensure that the personnel at these key locations would be sufficient to deal with games generated pressures.
Efficient processing of visitors will be dependent on information technology, some of which is still to be tested. The committee was concerned that implementation dates had slipped significantly and it was not convinced the systems would be adequately bedded down and tested prior to the games. Consequently, it recommended that the installation of specific games oriented systems be given the highest priority and tested in situations as close as possible to those that will occur during the games period.
As part of its games responsibilities, Australia will provide special immigration arrangements for the accredited members of the Olympic and Paralympic families, which include competitors, officials and other personnel nominated by national Olympic, Paralympic and other sporting bodies. The arrangements for family members are set out in an information booklet which is part of the broader visitor information campaign. The committee noted that this had been undertaken with limited supplementation of the funding for DIMA, AQIS, ACS and DFAT and it has therefore recommended some low-cost measures to further publicise Australia's immigration requirements.
The special treatment of family members will impose additional pressure on Australia's immigration arrangements. Some of the concessions are procedural, such as quarantine arrangements for animals and equipment imported for the games and the waiver of duty free allowances. Other concessions relate to the manner in which Australia's immigration requirements are applied.
The most significant of these is the provision of special purpose visas—the Olympic and Paralympic travel authority—to accredited games family members. This represents a temporary extension of ETA to nationals of countries which usually do not have this facility. A number of safeguards are in place to maintain Australia's visa requirements for the family members, including approval by DIMA prior to the issuing of such travel authority. A memorandum of understanding 
 between DIMA and SOCOG on this process had not been finalised at the time of the committee's report. The committee therefore has urged prompt finalisation of the MOU so that committee members can reassure themselves that Australia's border integrity is being maintained.
An entry response team drawing on the expertise of Australia's border agencies and SOCOG is being set up to facilitate the entry of family members. The committee has recommended that this team be operational well before the games. To speed their entry to Australia it is essential that visitors are aware of the arrangements made to facilitate their passage through our border formalities. The committee noted that there was an unwarranted assumption that the purpose and benefits of the express lane would be well understood by visitors. It is recommended that this mechanism for arrival and departure management be more widely promoted.
The holding of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Australia in 2000 offers us many opportunities to promote our country, to demonstrate our business capabilities and to emphasise our unique assets as a tourist destination. The committee has considered the work of the responsible agencies and has unanimously recommended a number of steps which can be taken to contribute to the success of providing a positive experience for visitors while at the same time maintaining border integrity.
I would like to thank the committee secretariat—especially Steve Dyer—for their assistance with the inquiry. I also thank the committee members, most especially the Deputy Chair, Senator McKiernan, and my colleagues in the House, the Hon. Bruce Baird, Mrs Irwin, Mrs May and Mr Ripoll. I commend this report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Migration Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I would like to thank the committee and the committee secretariat for their work on this inquiry and their efforts in helping us prepare the final report. Our aim is to ensure that visitors to Australia are not in any way disappointed with their entry while we still maintain our border integrity.
The first recommendation of the report deals with ensuring that the same arrangements for the Olympic families are extended to the Paralympic families. To help facilitate this process, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and SOCOG must work together and fast-track the memorandum of understanding in terms of border control.
Ansett is the major airline sponsor for the games and, as such, is afforded special treatment as part of that deal. This could include special access to the Olympic Village and other locations for ticketing and other services. While the importance of their sponsorship is understood, it also needs to be understood that not all Olympic families will travel on the sponsor airline. If we are to provide the best possible access for Olympic families, then consideration must also be given to the other carriers. This does not need to detract from the advantage that the major sponsor might have but will ensure that the overall experience for all Olympic families is a good one.
The advantage gained by the sponsor airline will have already been achieved by virtue of the sponsorship deal and related access to advertising and marketing. But the issues of access to the village and other resources at the games during arrival and departure need to be considered. Those who have chosen to fly by other airlines need not be disadvantaged. There may have been no other choice or their decision may have been made well in advance of the games or for other reasons. I believe it is essential that services and access are made available at the games sites and are not restricted to purely one carrier.
I would like to note that, as far as the committee is aware, there are no exclusive arrangements in terms of access to the Olympic sites provided by the sponsorship arrangements in terms of easing the entry or departure process. In any event, the departure procedures should at least be treated differently, given that most people will be attempting to leave as soon as possible and will likely leave on the same carrier they arrived on. The committee noted that while there is an information campaign in place its effectiveness will only be measured by the amount of users 
 who access and understand that information provided. The possibility that a large number of Olympic visitors from a certain country will be refused visas has the potential to embarrass Australia and also to produce large amounts of negative media worldwide. It should be ensured that, if certain countries are more likely to be treated less favourably, procedures are pre-organised to facilitate faster processing and less uncertainty.
For the Olympic Games of 2000, Australia must do everything within its power to ensure the best games of the century and to use past experience to guarantee that success. The final success of the games will ensure a bright future for tourism promotion and the image of Australia worldwide.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Migration Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—In its report entitled Going for gold , the Joint Standing Committee on Migration has set out its recommendations from its inquiry into the immigration entry arrangements for the Olympic and Paralympic games. As everyone associated with this issue—the department, the minister and all members of the committee—are aware, Australia will be on show at the time of the 2000 Olympics and Paralympics. As contact with immigration officers is often the first contact with an Australian government agency and as we can expect that visitors' first impressions of Australia will quite likely be the most lasting, we certainly want to make a good first impression.
As everyone who has experienced undue delays with immigration officers overseas will appreciate, a bad experience at this time can put a dampener on your whole stay. We certainly do not want this to happen here at the time of the Olympics. In particular, we want the so-called members of the Olympic family—the officials, athletes, trainers, accredited media and major sponsors—to be processed through immigration as quickly, smoothly and efficiently as possible. The committee examined the proposed special arrangements and has recommended changes to existing procedures to provide for accredited members of the Olympic and Paralympic families. 
The committee had special concern about timing for the arrangements and has recommended that a memorandum of understanding between the department and SOCOG be finalised as a matter of urgency. There is less than one year to go before the Sydney Olympic Games, and these arrangements cannot be left to the last minute. With regard to the department's readiness, the committee has recommended that the proposed entry response team be formed as a matter of urgency to allow for full training to be undertaken. The committee noted the potential for embarrassment to Australia if large numbers of visa applications from some countries are refused. Refusal of visas particularly from the Middle East, Asia and parts of former Yugoslavia may spoil the plans for many families in electorates such as Fowler who hope that family members may be able to stay with them during the Olympics. The urgent extension of electronic travel authorities, as recommended by the committee, may go part of the way to reducing the potential embarrassment of refusing entry to people who wish to visit Australia to view the Olympics. It would not be in the friendly spirit of the Olympic Games if high refusal rates continue.
I strongly commend the committee's findings to the minister for his urgent attention. I also thank the staff of the committee, who are in the chamber today, who laboured through a number of changes but still provided invaluable assistance to the committee in producing this report. Finally, I wish to thank the members of the committee for the way in which they have considered all viewpoints in preparing this report.

(3)	 areas where the medical profession does not comply with trade practices law.
When the parliament passed its national competition policy in 1995, there were high hopes that this would clean out anticompetitive practices in the professions. This was particularly the case for the medical profession and the notorious practices of the College of Surgeons. In some areas the ACCC has made good progress, especially in its scrutiny of contracting arrangements in hospitals. For instance, in December last year it won an important case to prevent price fixing by the Society of Anaesthetists. However, a key area of public concern is still unresolved: the anticompetitive practices of the College of Surgeons.
We hear a lot of concern in this parliament about the costs of health care, the length of waiting lists and the paucity of health funding. These problems have been made much worse in Australia by restrictions on the supply of specialist doctors. These restrictions massively inflate the income of specialists within the College of Surgeons club. In nearly every specialty area Australia has many fewer surgeons than the recommended specialist to population ratio. Most people think that the New South Wales Police Commissioner, Peter Ryan, is Australia's highest paid person on the public payroll. In fact, they should have a look at some of the money earned by surgeons in our public hospitals. Medical specialists have formed a club, which keeps their numbers down and their prices up, and incomes of more than $800,000 per annum 
 are not uncommon. To adapt a Paul Keatingism, `Never get between a surgeon and a pile of public money.'
This decade we have heard a lot of noise about competition policy but too little action when it comes to the College of Surgeons. These practices are a deliberate anticompetitive strategy by the college. It is organised along the lines of a club: those inside the club protect their interests at the expense of those outside the club. They have adopted feudal training practices, virtually torturing prospective specialists such is the degree of difficulty in gaining entry, making it as hard as possible for anyone to join their club and thereby the public money benefits that come from it. Australia does not have medical academics, an unusual state of affairs. At huge public expense, the club is allowed to run our university medical programs. We have medical doctors running our university programs, not medical academics. This is not a standard of public accountability and competition policy that applies to any other profession in the country.
The ACCC has made noises about this issue for long enough. It needs to establish a full inquiry into the College of Surgeons to effectively bust up the club. Australia needs an independent system for the training of medical specialists. This would produce a higher number of surgeons, more competition, more reasonable prices, smaller waiting lists and, of course, better service for the public. We need to make the medical profession as a whole much more accountable and transparent. For instance, the recent report by the independent pricing tribunal on the New South Wales health system showed that there is virtually no data relating to the salaries, costs or efficiency of service of visiting medical officers. As in any other area information is power, and the medical elite has all the information, thus, in this sector, they have all the power.
The public interest can only be advantaged by greater transparency. Quality decision making in the public sector relies on quality information. Con Costa, the President of the Doctor's Reform Society was quoted in the Bulletin on 2 March 1999. He said:
I've had specialists come to me complaining about the colleges that make the decisions about who gets the treating hospital positions. It's not an open and transparent system. It's still an old boys' network. Getting them to speak out is very hard because it's a small and closed circle. That works to disadvantage specialists and patients.
I point out the hypocrisy on the part of the Howard government. If this government showed anywhere near the interest in the closed shop of the medical profession in this country as they did in the crane rates on the waterfront, then, by now, Australian medical consumers would have been far more advantaged. They might have seen this club busted up, some injection of competition and some benefits across the health sector. Most of all, action needs to be taken by the ACCC, and the purpose of this motion is to urge that action as soon as possible.

"Lawler, Tony, MP",NP,1999-09-27,"—The three issues we are talking about here today are, really, the issues of gaps, the lack of availability of services provided by specialists and the costs to the public purse. Quite clearly, as the member for Werriwa pointed out, it all comes back to providing competition in the marketplace. I agree with nearly everything the member for Werriwa said except, perhaps, the matter of timing. At least there is a procedure put in place to look at this issue. As I said, I think there needs to be a review into the whole process of selecting and training not only specialists but GPs, because we also have to look at the delivery of services, not just the costs. Having said that, there is an enormous number of dedicated specialists practising in rural and remote areas of Australia, and they are not getting the support they should from those who should be providing it. Obviously the colleges are big players in this equation. Certainly there is anecdotal evidence of the colleges allowing some hundreds of people to sit for the entrance exams to the courses at the colleges—collecting their money, I might add—knowing full well that the number accepted is predetermined and has nothing to do with the level 
 achieved in such exams; the predetermined number may well be that only a few are accepted out of a couple of hundred who may sit for them.
I believe the teaching hospitals also have a role to play in this, and they have a long way to go. Getting back to the delivery of services to rural and remote Australia, there is a perception among medical students who are interested in pursuing a specialist's career that, if they do go and do some of their pre-learning in the bush, they are cut out of the loop. They are no longer under the eyes of the specialists looking after an area and they have no chance of achieving their goals. So the teaching hospitals certainly have a role to play in encouraging people to go and gain the very valuable experience they will get by practising in a rural hospital.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—It is with great sadness that I report to the Australian parliament the passing, in the early hours of last Friday morning, of one of God's great priests, Reverend Father Joseph Elias of St Joseph's Maronite Church, Croydon. I was privileged to know Father Joseph. He was a beautiful, humble and very holy man. Tragically, Father Joseph was taken from us far too soon: he was only 35 years of age.
Father Joseph had a very special relationship with the youth of his parish. My very dear friend, Norah Elias, Father Joseph's cousin, told me last evening of the extraordinary vigil of the hundreds of young people who flocked to his bedside at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, in the hours prior to his passing—such was the warmth, affection and love for him.
Father Joseph's funeral service will be held tomorrow at Our Lady of Lebanon Church, Harris Park, and I know that the church will be overflowing. He will be buried in Lebanon, where he began his theological studies. To his mother, Mrs Maria Elias, his brothers Tony and George, his sisters Suad, Salma and Violet, and to his dear cousin Norah, my wife Adriana and I extend our prayers and deepest sympathy. It may help you to know at this time that we, too, share your loss.
They have loved Father Joseph in life and they will not forget him in death. May eternal light shine upon him. May he rest in peace. Amen.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,"<title>Elias, Reverend Father Joseph </title>",Statements by Members,3,1
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I move:
That the House:
(1)	 expresses its concern about widening inequality in Australia;
(2)	 notes the increasing evidence that the earliest years of childhood are vital in determining the life chances of young people;
(3)	 recognises that early intervention in the form of parenting programs, home visiting and literacy and numeracy programs are valuable in improving the life chances of young people; and
(4)	 acknowledges that the Commonwealth has an important role to play in the funding of early intervention programs.
I sound the alarm that Australia is fracturing into two sets of communities and is becoming a divided society. From the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, income inequality in Australia scarcely changed. That is evidenced in a report by Access Economics which, in part, says:
Australia has easily the largest rise in market income inequality, due overwhelmingly to increased employee earnings inequality.
It goes on to say:
Australia had the largest impact from transfers and direct taxes and almost offset the large increase in earnings inequality, so overall inequality rose only slightly.
That is, compared with other OECD countries. The report concludes:
Australian inequality rises over the two decades . . . although the changes are small or negative in the second decade when the Labor Party was in power.
The reason for that is that, under the accords, Labor exchanged improvements in the social wage on the one hand for wage moderation on the other. A vital aspect of those improvements in the social wage was the boost to payments to low income families with children, associated with Mr Hawke's much maligned child poverty pledge. Overall in the period, income inequality did not deteriorate.
The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirm that inequality under this government has widened significantly. A major cause of this is unemploy 
 ment. I point out that, in 64 communities around Australia, unemployment is above 15 per cent. In more than half of those communities, unemployment in the last 12 months has risen against a backdrop of falling national unemployment. So there are already two sets of communities in Australia: affluent communities and disadvantaged communities.
As Professor Bob Gregory and Boyd Hunter point out in their ground-breaking analysis of inequality, `one half of Australia does not know how the other half lives' and `the economic gap is widening'. Consider this: today, one in five children are growing up in a household where no-one is employed. One in three children are growing up in a household where there is no male employed—no male breadwinner, no male role model in the work force.
Never has a good education been more important to a young person's life chances than it is today and than it will be in the next 20 years. A 15-year-old leaving school today without qualifications and without good literacy and numeracy skills is being condemned in the information age to a life of casual employment interspersed with prolonged periods of unemployment. This is not the future that we want for our young people. 
How do we arrest this widening inequality and rising disadvantage? An important part of the answer lies in early intervention. I noticed during question time that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has discovered the term. The debate on early intervention has been led in this country by a number of people but most particularly by Wayne Swan, the shadow minister for family and community services. He has been out in front, as has the Labor Party, on this important issue of early intervention.
New evidence has shown that the first year of life is vital to a child's brain development, and that is why new programs are being conceived and developed. Home visiting programs are being developed, where nurses visit mothers at risk before the baby is born. They give advice and offer to follow up with home visits. There are positive parenting programs, where advice is given to parents in at-risk households on nurturing their children, 
 nutrition and early development of the learning skills which are so vital to the life prospects of young people.
Moving from that precious and important first year, there is a preschool program for disadvantaged children so that they can adapt to a formal learning environment as they enter the school system. Then, in the first few years of the formal learning system, there are literacy and numeracy programs where children with learning difficulties are identified and then helped through reading recovery programs. The Queensland experience is very encouraging. It shows that more than 90 per cent of the children who are identified with learning difficulties through the year 2 diagnostic net are able, after a period of support through the reading recovery program, to read at the relevant age of attainment. These are important programs.
There is strong overseas evidence of the success of early intervention programs. Three programs in the United States which I will mention are: Project Head Start, the High/Scope Perry Preschool Program and the Chicago Child-Parent Center and Expansion Program. There is another program, developed in Israel, called the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters—HIPPY. This program is now being implemented in countries around the world, including in pilot programs here in Australia. Analysis of the performance of these programs shows that they have been successful in improving the educational attainment of disadvantaged children, they have been successful in improving the ultimate earning capacity of the children who go through them, and they have been successful in preventing a life of crime and drug abuse. This does not mean that every child who goes through these programs comes out a winner, but they have been proven to make a real difference to the life chances of young people.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention in particular to the results of the Perry program. Those results show that the investment in young children under that program has returned to the public $7 for every $1 invested. So the moral of the story and the experience of these programs has been that it is a 
 very important and wise investment for a nation to identify the children at risk—disadvantaged children—and to help them through programs such as the positive parenting program and home visiting programs and, in addition, to help them in those preschool years and then on into the literacy and numeracy programs.
The Commonwealth government of Australia has a role in investing in the nation's young people. In particular, it has a role in investing in the future of children from disadvantaged communities. Yet the Treasurer of Australia, Mr Costello, has declared, `I'm an income tax cut man.' He is obsessed with cutting the top marginal rate of income tax. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs must be the greatest punisher and straightener since Governor Bligh. He abolished the disadvantaged schools program and replaced it with a literacy and numeracy program. He threatens to withdraw funding from schools which do not meet his expectations. He threatens to withdraw funding from those disadvantaged schools which desperately need the funding unless they live up to his expectations.
Only Labor is committed to early intervention. It is a very late discovery on the part of the government. Only Labor sees the wisdom of investing in young people living in disadvantaged communities. Only Labor is serious about lifting disadvantaged communities out of a life of despair and is committed to breaking that cycle of despair. The leadership of the Liberal Party does not know how the other half lives. Their children will never attend school with the children from disadvantaged Australia. Labor knows about disadvantage. If the disadvantaged children of Australia can hold on for another two years they will get a government that truly understands. They will get a government that truly cares. They will get a government that will support them in their aspiration for a fair go, a brighter future and a crack at the very best jobs the nation can offer.

"Cameron, Ross, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—I rise as a member of the government with a deep affinity with working Australians and with the battlers to whom the member for Rankin was referring. My own origins have something of the battler about them. My grandfather was a blacksmith who was ultimately made redundant by the advent of the motor vehicle and spent most of the last decade of his life as an itinerant labourer, finding work wherever he might. My maternal grandfather was a farmer who ultimately left the land with virtually nothing. He now lives a very humble life, but nonetheless he worked hard throughout his life. We battled. My father was a high school drop-out. I have never belonged to the ranks of the capitalists. We have never owned a great deal. We have struggled to pay off the mortgage of the family home. Yet I inherited something very precious and valuable. What was handed down to me was a legacy of values. While I have been an imperfect exponent of those values, they have nonetheless stood me in good stead.
It is true that there is inequality of income in Australia. But I do not necessarily associate inequality of outcomes with disadvantage. The Access Economics report on poverty in Australia, which the member for Rankin referred to, does note differences in distribution of income in Australia. It also notes that the percentage of Australians living in poverty fell in the decade from 1984 to 1994. It notes that the richest 30 per cent of the Australian population experienced the largest increase in income taxes of that percentile in any OECD country in the last 20 years.
Our objective is not to create perfect equality, which is a concept which ought to be reserved to the province of mathematics and physics. Our objective is to create the sort of community in which people who aspire to improve their lives have the opportunity to do so. This government recognises that early intervention has an important role to play in that regard. The evidence in studies such as the High/Scope Perry Preschool Study, which the member for Rankin referred to, provide fairly compelling evidence about the effectiveness of early intervention.
This government has shifted the ship of state towards intervention at an early age rather than the predominantly curative measures that were necessary under the former government precisely because its policies created so many of the problems which needed cure. In pure expenditure terms, this government is spending $1 billion a year to support families under the family tax initiative, $1.1 billion for child care in 1998-99, $280 million for the Staying at Home package for carers, $25.6 million for partnerships against domestic violence and over $40 million for the youth suicide prevention strategy and the National Council for the Prevention of Child Abuse.
That is in broad social policy, but literacy and numeracy will be the field regarded as a crowning achieving of this government and, in particular, of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp. His principal legacy is the focus on literacy and numeracy which he has brought to the Australian education system. It was his inspired individual leadership which in 1998 produced for the first time in Australian history a national agreement on literacy standards. This government in 1998 committed $84 million over three years precisely for the preventive literacy and numeracy work which was so absent in the former government.
Likewise, in other fields of policy, this government is not just discovering early intervention; it has been a feature of our policy work since we came to government. For example, the Minister for Justice and Customs recently released a report titled Pathways to prevention: developmental and early intervention approaches to crime in australia, which outlines the work of 10,000 different community programs based around the concept of early intervention. So I have no difficulty whatsoever in defending the government's record in the area of early intervention, and suggest to members of the opposition that they are somewhat late starters in this field.
I turn to the first paragraph of the member's motion which calls on the House to express its concern about widening inequality in Australia. I want to do something today which 
 is a bit heretical, but I genuinely stand up and defend inequality. There is something rich and lovable in the Australian egalitarian instinct. While the American soul gravitates towards liberty as its touchstone, the Australian looks to fairness. Concepts of mateship and `a fair go' are rightly regarded as emblematic to the Australian idea. The origins of the phrase `fair go' can be traced, the historians tell us, to the game of two-up, played in the colonies as early as 1804. In two-up circles, the cry `fair go' was used to indicate that the rules of wagering had been satisfied and to enjoin that the coins should be spun properly. Our ethos involves an intolerance of social pretension, a healthy irreverence for authority, and a sacred belief that every man or woman is entitled to fair treatment before the law.
That should not, however, be confused with the fatuous and disreputable doctrine of social justice. As the historian McIntyre pointed out, the Australian concepts of equity and a fair go mean something less than equality. Equality does not have a lot of horsepower, in my opinion, as an analytical or moral tool. Similarly, inequality per se should not be accepted without question as a symptom of moral or societal failure. In fact, I would argue that the presence of some measure of inequality of outcome is essential to the preservation of a just society, and in doing so I believe that that proposition cannot be opposed, except by a reduction in the human freedoms and the individual liberties which are also essential to the Australian identity.
It is argued that there is something morally wrong in one person living well while his neighbour lives poorly. In my mind, the greater offence would be to force all Australians to live at the same material standard, regardless of their gifts, regardless of their industry, regardless of their contribution or their willingness to shoulder responsibility and accept risk. We live in an open, free, competitive society which creates and respects a space within which private citizens can make private decisions. It has been suggested by an American philosopher that civilisation is the progress of society towards privacy; the savage's whole existence is public, ruled by 
 the laws of his tribe; civilisation is the process of setting man free from man.
On any Saturday morning most Australians enjoy a measure of civilised freedom. They can go to the office and do some overtime or they can go to the RSL club and play the pokies. They can put a little extra in their superannuation fund or they can buy another carton of fags. They can paint the house and work on plans for an extension or they can go down to the TAB and put a good bet on a tip at Randwick. I am not making any judgment about the moral quality of the choice. I simply observe that every human choice has consequences.
The idea that inequality of itself is a moral problem is ghastly in its overtones. It relegates human beings to a state of powerlessness before their circumstances which, aside from being insulting and demeaning, is patently untrue. There is a statistical correlation between poverty and a range of negative life outcomes, such as poor health, illiteracy, unemployment and life prospects generally. It is not true that poverty determines those outcomes. In the 1998 BRW list of the top 20 rich Australians, seven of the top 20 were immigrants or sons of immigrants who came to Australia with nothing.
Human beings are not automatons, undifferentiated by skill, by will, by talent or by virtue. One cannot compel industry. At the same time, we must take steps to ensure access to opportunity. This government is rightly focused on early intervention but, in the same way that Pauline Hanson is not the mother of all Australian children, the Commonwealth is not the father.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Early Intervention Programs</title>,Private Members' Business,9,1
"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—It gives me great pleasure to support the motion moved by the member for Rankin, which in turn supports the most ignored, unacknowledged and undervalued group in our nation—our young people, particularly those aged five years to 12 years. When you listen to the member for Parramatta, you would think that a huge amount of money has been spent on education, training and research in this country. But there is one piece of data that cannot be denied. In 1996, when this government came to office, three per cent of 
 the nation's proportion of GDP was spent on education, research and training. In 2001-02, it will be 2.4 per cent. That is a cut of 20 per cent in anybody's language.
Some 11-plus years ago, when researching for my maiden speech in this place, I discovered to my dismay that there were precious few references in the Hansard to early intervention, or in fact any references to the five-year-old to 12-year-old age group. Perhaps I should not have been surprised because I already knew in my former life as a school principal how powerless was this age group and the parents and the teachers who supported them. A media study in the early 1990s by the Sydney Institute of Technology, I believe, pointed out that up to 96 per cent of media references to children were negative. To confirm to this House that no-one can name a national institution or group that effectively advocates for the five- to 12-year-old age group is an indictment in itself.
As contributors to this situation, governments—federal and state—business, unions, welfare groups, religious groups, sectoral leadership in education, universities, TAFEs and senior secondary schools, public and private, stand condemned. It is sad to report that now, as in the past, few members in this House have taken the needs of young children seriously. Perhaps this reflects the short-term activity of the political process and the lack of long-term planning. Perhaps it also reflects an attitude that the needs of young children ought to be attended to by state governments.
All that, however, fails to recognise that in a very short time young primary age students become senior secondary students, university students, TAFE students and entrants to the labour market. The non-attended problems of the primary years, which can be largely remedial, become intractable and very expensive problems of young adulthood. That is the real essence of the member's motion and for that reason he deserves the support of this House. As the member for Rankin has correctly pointed out, there is a widening inequality developing in Australia. This is not a recent phenomenon; it has been developing over the past 20 or 30 years. Sadly, few have noticed, as endemic and entrenched high 
 unemployment has plagued the developed world and taken the front page of newspapers.
During the 1970s, it was relatively common to hear that around 10 per cent of our children had severe literacy, numeracy and social problems in their primary schooling. During the 1980s, the figure was 20 per cent. Campaigns were mounted around Australia, largely by primary school principals in various states, to alert education authorities and governments to the growing problems facing young children in their schooling. With a combination of denial, white-anting and misrepresentation, the claims were largely denied and not acted upon. During the mid- to late-1990s, the percentage of children experiencing severe difficulties was climbing up to 30 per cent. This figure is often quoted, even by the minister.
That merits the question: how did state governments and their education departments manage to keep this situation away from public awareness? It was relatively easy, unfortunately. At the same time as 30 per cent of children were being identified as having significant problems, another phenomenon was occurring. The more able of the primary aged population were doing better than they had ever done. In other words, while 30 per cent were doing very badly, another 30 per cent were doing extremely well. As almost all data produced by state education departments was averaged out, the trend of developments of the less and the more successful failed to be accurately identified. Although the overall quantitative data seemed similar, the qualitative analysis was conspicuous by its absence.
The single most important problem facing the five- to 12-year-old age group is a lack of resources to do the schooling job properly. Governments, both federal and state, have unfortunately seriously underestimated the resource implications of schooling for the five- to 12-year-old age group. It is a resource question. Until that question is acknowledged, the educational achievements of our young people will be diminished.
The allocation of the educational dollar in Australia is based on past traditions, privilege and vested interests. It is certainly not based on a sound educational rationale. In some 
 circumstances, there can be sound reasons for differential funding, but current policies affecting primary aged children are short-sighted. Each and every one of them will eventually become a senior secondary, a TAFE student or a university student, and they will be in the labour market. If unsuccessful, they will become an expensive liability to our nation.

"Forrest, John, MP",NP,1999-09-27,"—The member for Rankin has moved a very important motion expressing concern about widening inequality. I am a little disappointed that both he and the member for Port Adelaide seem to have a problem with amnesia—a memory problem in that for 13 years their side of politics presided at the power base and were in a position to address this position. People listening in the gallery and those listening to the public broadcast need to be reminded of that. Despite that, I am still prepared to support a member of parliament who wants to raise an important issue for public debate. I share his concerns about widening disparity in the provision of opportunity and I support the many actions of the current government to address it.
One of the points that has not yet been made by other speakers is what is an important ingredient in this issue; that is, the role of families. We need to find ways to invigorate families. Having come from a hardworking primary industry family, I am forever grateful that I was given an opportunity for educational pursuits and an opportunity to develop myself. The essential ingredient in that was the encouragement provided by good parents. I am eternally grateful for that and am often quoted as having said, `Thank God for good parents.'
Sadly, in our modern society there are many additional pressures on families as the support base and nurturer of youngsters whom the member for Rankin is concerned about. Families need to be reinvigorated in terms of their energy and direction. The formative years are the important years. As the second point of the motion says, `the earliest years of childhood are vital in determining the life chances of young people'. That statement is very true and has my support. Raising chil 
 dren is an ever more complex matter in today's society. Parents have to compete with the interruptions of television, with the projection into their lounge rooms of incidents that may not be mainstream for that family, raising questions and tensions in raising children.
There is a wealth of evidence which suggests that a poor start in the early formative years leads to a high risk of malfunction in later years. There is absolutely no doubt that the inevitable problems that that creates for society are now becoming evident. That is why I think it is hypocritical for members of the opposition to be highlighting the work of the current government which has gone out of its way—with the work mentioned by the member for Parramatta—to deal with early intervention, particularly in regard to literacy.
I was raised by a mum who considered it a great adventure to read from a very early age, and not just `John and Betty' but adventure novels and Mark Twain and stories about life which left an impression on me at an early age. I was an avid reader. With the competition of television, sport and everything else, I had enormous difficulty with my own children in encouraging them to pursue that particular adventure. I was always horrified that my children spent their study hours with the television on or the radio blaring. These are examples of just how competitive it is for parents to instil basic values in their children.
We need to do a lot more in encouraging public debate with respect to the operation of families and not be discouraged by those who say that it is an old-fashioned concept. Through the ages it has been proved that good parenting is the best intervention of all. While I support the member's motion, I suggest he take a better look at recent history in the last decade and give a lot more support to the government's direction in literacy in schools.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—Earlier this month the Productivity Commission published a paper on privatisation by two specialists in the field: Professor Stephen King of Melbourne University and Dr Rohan Pitchford of the Australian National University. The two gentlemen effectively belled the cat on privatisation in this country—indeed, the privatisation of public assets by governments in general. These are just some of the comments made by the two academics:
Privatisation can create a new range of government bureaucracy and control that exceeds any burden under public ownership.
It is simply stated that public ownership is less efficient than private ownership. But there is little analysis of the source of this efficiency or any potential benefits that public ownership may create which could offset this inefficiency.
They also found that:
Much of the debate on privatisation involves rhetoric rather than research. When private and 
 public sector managers have similar incentives and objectives, performance differences are less obvious.
The gentlemen said that governments were forced to intervene more regularly and introduce more regulations to control privatised public assets as competition had failed to protect consumers. They concluded in their investigation that:
If it is difficult to regulate a privatised firm and this firm can engage in undesirable practices, then public ownership, possibly with an alternative level of private sector involvement, may be preferred.
Governments in this country—both at state and federal levels and of both political persuasions—have been guilty in the past of rushing headlong into privatisation for the sake of it. Common thought had been—and still is, I might add—that public ownership was an inefficient anachronism while privatisation meant saying goodbye to suffocating government regulations and outmoded business practices and really saying hello to increased productivity and efficiency.
But, if you take a closer look, you will see the figures do not always tell the same story. As the Sydney Morning Herald's Ross Gittins wrote about the sale of Telstra recently:
Selling a profitable asset such as Telstra may reduce net debt, but it does nothing to increase the Government's net worth. And it may or may not improve the Government's future net income flow.
An article on this subject in the Australian Financial Review  reached a similar conclusion:
Privatisation is not a cure for human fallibility, and . . . assumptions about the inherent superiority of the private sector are untenable.
Most ordinary Australians would find themselves agreeing with Ross Gittins and the Productivity Commission's King and Pitchford with regard to their views on privatisation. They would agree not through any academic or high-minded analysis of the economic problems associated with privatisation but by really basing their opinions on plain commonsense.
They know that, in order for some services to be delivered fairly and effectively, the government must retain chief control, if not full control, of the particular public asset. 
 They know what can happen when public assets become the victims of ill-considered privatisation. They know because they are the ones that are often on the receiving end of poor service and higher prices when privatisation in this country goes wrong.
They know that some public assets and some government services should be considered sacrosanct when it comes to private sale. For example, while the sale of Telstra may have sent a minority of Australians racing off to find their chequebooks, the majority of Australians are still against the full sale of the telecommunications network. Most Australians want the government to retain majority ownership of this utility while there is still a chance to do so. Most Australians recognise that Telstra performs essential services for all Australians. For the foreseeable future at least it dominates massively the telecommunications industry in this country. Why shouldn't it continue to make money for all Australians? Why should it make money for just those shareholders lucky enough to have the finances or the wherewithal to invest in it?
Scratch most ordinary voters living in this country and you would find that they could tell governments exactly what they see as the problems associated with privatisation run amok. In fact, many of them have already had a go at telling governments just that. Recently we saw the electors in Tasmania and in New South Wales deliver sound drubbings to parties that had gone to the polls with policies heavily reliant on privatising dearly held public assets. The Victorian government, headed by Jeff Kennett—possibly the arch-proponent of privatisation in this country—was brought to the edge of defeat partly because of the public's antagonism towards his privatisation-gone-mad style of government. The same can be said about John Olsen in South Australia. It was primarily because of his government's decision to privatise South Australia's power supply that Labor was able to come within a whisker of retaking the treasury bench in the last state election.
People do not like governments simply selling public assets in order to raise money for their own coffers. They need to be con 
 vinced of the necessity of such action. They need to be convinced, on a case by case basis, that privatisation is necessary and makes sound economic sense. Of course, privatisation can be beneficial; it can make economic sense. None of us could imagine living in the old days when governments owned butcher shops or even ran liquor stores. There are some areas of private enterprise where governments plainly have no business, but when it comes to public utilities such as Telstra, state and territory power supplies and Australia Post the public quite plainly want them to remain in their hands—not just the government's hands, their hands.
Australians deserve the right not to be treated like mushrooms when it comes to privatising and have governments tell them that they know what is best for their assets—because quite simply they do not. I believe and I reiterate that Telstra is a case in point. Adding weight to the argument put forward by King and Pitchford, Telstra has around five separate bodies currently involved in its regulation, the number of which is directly linked to the government's privatisation process.
Another problem with privatisation is the growing levels of secrecy that have sprung up and now surround the management of formerly transparent public assets. The Labor Party has been trying for over three years to get the Crown Casino tender documents from the Kennett government under freedom of information laws; it has been denied them at every turn. In South Australia, contracts setting out the services to be provided by Group 4 Correction Services, a private prison operator in that state, also detail a prisoner's rights. But the same contracts contain a clause that denies third parties—you and I, the public—other than the government and the private operator from seeing any of these details. How can a prisoner know of his or her rights if he or she is not allowed to see the contract that details their rights in the first place?
Governments in this country have rushed so quickly into privatising public assets that Australia has now reached a stage where it is one of the largest privatisers in the world. Indeed, in the six months to 30 June this year, 
 Australia was the largest privatiser, with $7.5 billion worth of announced privatisations—15.4 per cent of the world's announced privatisations in that period. This arguably dubious honour came thanks to the Victorian government's sale of its gas, electricity and pipeline interests.
One of the most insightful observations about privatisation comes from the Canadian theorist and author John Ralston Saul in a recent lecture here in Australia. He said that privatisation essentially allowed:
. . . extremely lazy and not very imaginative people to get a hold of fully developed utilities which don't require any risk or imagination and they're able to sit there and basically clip their coupons as you flush your toilets.
By moving things like water out of government into the private sector you're bleeding real investment capital out of the private sector, you're rewarding laziness, and you're rewarding these managers who go about in capitalist drag.
Well said, Mr Ralston Saul. Australia's headlong rush towards privatisation betrays a lack of serious thought among our leaders about how to solve the efficiency and productivity problems that do exist within our public utilities. That is what we are elected to do—to come up with solutions to these problems, not sell off the family silver willy-nilly. I am sure most members of the public would agree with me. If some members of the House examined their consciences, they too would stand up and agree with me.
The Prime Minister's vision of a shareholder's democracy based upon the privatisation of public assets actually belittles the democratic process. As Ralston Saul said in that same lecture, leading a democratic society by economics—by self-interest—demotes the citizen and our civilisation to little more than a decoration. While there remain in this country assets still owned by the public, we need to work harder and think more clearly about privatisation before it is too late. We will soon have nothing left to sell.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Government Services: Privatisation</title>,Grievance Debate,10,1

"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—Let me say on behalf of the opposition that we will be supporting the government's amendments to the Public Service and Parliamentary Service bills and will be supporting the bills as amended. We welcome the progress this represents in our negotiations with the government on the future shape of the Commonwealth Public Service. There are still some important issues to be resolved through the negotiation of draft regulations, but we are confident that the bills as amended will provide a sound and much improved framework for the Public Service and Parliamentary Service for many years to come.
The opposition has always supported the simplification and modernisation of the Public Service Act, which dates back to 1922 and 
 which, over the years, has become impossibly complex and cumbersome. It was the Labor government which set in train the process of simplification by commissioning a review of the act by Ron McLeod, who was then a deputy secretary in the Department of Defence. Many of the issues identified and the recommendations made in the McLeod report, which was completed in December 1994, are reflected in the bills which are now before us and in the amendments which we have negotiated with the government. It is appropriate that, in debating this package, we recognise Ron McLeod's important contribution to the modernisation of the legislative framework of the Public Service.
This is the third attempt by the government to get its Public Service Bill through the parliament. On the two previous occasions—in November 1997 and in March-April 1998—it suited the government politically to ignore the merit of the 52 amendments which the Senate made to its bill. The government was then more interested in establishing a double dissolution trigger than in making the necessary changes to achieve passage of its legislation. The opposition, with the support of the minor parties in the Senate, had made it clear that it had some very serious concerns about the government's bill. We also made it clear that we shared many of the government's objectives and were prepared to pass the bill, provided our concerns were accommodated.
The Public Service is one of the key institutions of our system of government. It serves governments of either political persuasion—conservative or Labor—with equal professionalism and dedication. We have consistently argued that it is incumbent on any government which sets about radically transforming such an institution to at least consult with the alternative government about its plans. No such consultation occurred on the two previous occasions the government's Public Service Bill was presented to parliament. We therefore made our views on the bill clear through the amendments we moved in the Senate. Most of our concerns were shared by the Democrats and Senator Harradine, with the consequence that 52 
 amendments were successful and the government chose to lay the bill aside.
The government reintroduced its bill in March this year. But on this occasion it rejected the `all or nothing' approach and sought negotiations with the opposition in an effort to satisfy our concerns and ensure passage of the bill. We welcomed that changed approach, and we appreciate the spirit in which the government has conducted the negotiations. They have been lengthy and complex. They have not yet concluded and there are some important outstanding issues. But already they have resulted in a much improved piece of legislation which will provide an appropriate legislative basis for the Public Service under governments of either political persuasion.
What were our concerns with the government's original bill? Our assessment of the bill, in the form in which it is now before us—unamended—was that it would have led to a Public Service which was too susceptible to pressures from the government of the day and less willing to offer critical advice. If implemented unchanged, the bill's provisions would have undermined the independence, professionalism and efficiency of the Public Service. We concluded this was not a Public Service Australians would want and it was certainly not a Public Service a Labor government would want. The bill went too far in enhancing the powers of Public Service agency heads and converting their agencies into independent entities with separate procedures and employment conditions. It did not go far enough in protecting the independence and professionalism of the Public Service and the working conditions of public servants.
The bill would have placed Public Service agency heads on a similar footing to private sector employers. They would have been able to negotiate cosy deals on salaries and conditions with their ministers, free from public scrutiny, determine the salary and conditions of their employees and hire and fire as they pleased. While the bill proscribed patronage and favouritism, its provisions would actually have encouraged them. What else could be expected from a system which facilitated political appointments at the top with the lure 
 of special deals, which made the Senior Executive Service dependent on patronage for survival, which made public servants heavily dependent on their bosses for their salary and working conditions and which, at the same time, restricted their rights of appeal?
The government's bill would have taken devolution of powers to individual departments and agencies to unacceptable levels. It simply would not make sense for agencies to be reinventing the wheel in areas of commonality, such as application of the values and code of conduct—procedures for dealing with breaches and for engagement and termination of SES employees.
The amendments we moved in the Senate attempted to remedy these defects. These are the amendments which have formed the basis of our negotiations with the government. As a consequence of those negotiations, the government will today be moving some 60 amendments to its own bill. As is the way with negotiations, we have not achieved everything we desired, but we are satisfied with the progress we have made. We believe the government has made very important concessions which will be of great benefit to the Public Service and to the quality of our system of government.
In relation to the powers of secretaries, the amendments to be moved by the government insert a clause setting out the responsibilities of secretaries, including assisting the minister to fulfil his or her accountability obligations to parliament, and prohibit secret deals on salary and conditions by requiring ministers to seek advice from the Remuneration Tribunal and by requiring determinations on remuneration to be  open to public scrutiny. They make secretaries subject to sanctions for breaches of the code of conduct in the same way as employees and prevent secretaries from making determinations which could reduce benefits to employees under an award, certified agreement or AWA.
The independence of SES employees will be enhanced by requiring the Public Service Commissioner to certify that termination is in accordance with the published procedures and in the best interests of the APS and by allow 
 ing them access to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act.
The government has agreed to maintain the office of Merit Protection Commissioner and provide it with the functions, powers and protections which are necessary for the commissioner to be independent and effective. These powers will be provided through the act and regulations.	There are amendments which redress the excessive devolution of powers to individual agencies by requiring the Public Service Commissioner to issue directions on all of the values, breaches of the code of conduct and engagement and termination of SES employees. Other amendments will ensure that executive agencies which may be established under the act are accountable to the government, the parliament and the public in the same way as departments.
Many of the amendments which we have negotiated with the government are designed to protect the interests of those who constitute the Public Service—the APS employees. There will be a fair system of review of employment decisions. Additional values will be included. These will ensure that the APS remains a career service and that employees are consulted and encouraged to have input on matters that affect their workplace. Ongoing employment will continue to be the norm and conditions of employment will not be subject to change, outside limited exceptional circumstances, other than by negotiation and agreement through an award, certified agreement or AWA.
In relation to the provisions concerning termination of secretaries, there have been important developments in case law since the bill was drafted and last debated. I refer to the judgments of the Federal Court in relation to the actions taken by Mr Paul Barratt, the former Secretary to the Department of Defence. The court upheld Mr Barratt's complaint that he had been denied procedural fairness in the manner in which the government had sacked him. The court ruled that Mr Barratt was entitled to be informed of the government's reasons for dispensing with his services and that he was also entitled to an opportunity to respond.
The opposition had initially proposed a different method of affording secretaries who were being terminated a greater degree of procedural fairness. We had proposed that a report to the Prime Minister on the termination of a secretary be signed not only by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet but also by the Public Service Commissioner as well. In the earlier Senate debate, we attempted to amend the bill to this end, but we were not successful. In the interim, the Federal Court has set out very specific requirements for procedural fairness in the case of termination of secretaries. We pressed the government in our negotiations on this issue to reflect the outcome of the Barratt case in its bill. We consider the inclusion of the reference to that judgment in clause 59(1) constitutes adequate acknowledgment of that case and the obligations it places on governments.
As to the matters which are still outstanding, there are three: the details of the processes to be followed for review of employment decisions, the handling of the machinery of government changes and the circumstances in which Australian Public Service employees can be employed on a non-ongoing basis. We have reached agreement with the government on the basic structure of the new processes which will apply to the review of employment decisions. The current system of tripartite committees will continue to be used for appeals against promotional decisions. The recommendations of these committees will continue to be binding on agency heads.
Appeals against other employment decisions will be considered in the first instance by the relevant agency head. If the matter is not resolved satisfactorily, the appellant may take it to the Merit Protection Commissioner. The commissioner's recommendations in these matters will not be binding on the agency head, but if the commissioner is not satisfied with the action taken by the agency head this can be reported to the agency minister, the Prime Minister or the parliament. The precise details of these processes are still to be finalised in the form of regulations.
Machinery of government changes pose increasingly difficult challenges for govern 
 ments in the brave new world of the Howard government's industrial relations. With agency bargaining and the increasing use of Australian workplace agreements, AWAs, the standard Public Service classification structures and conditions of employment are disappearing. As a consequence, if a group of employees is moved from one agency to another as a result of a machinery of government change, it is more likely than not that in their new workplace they will have different employment conditions from their colleagues.
We have been concerned to ensure that machinery of government changes cannot be used as a means of reducing the remuneration, or other conditions of employment, of employees who are affected by these administrative changes. We have made some progress in this direction, as evidenced by the amendment which the government will be moving to clause 72 of the bill. But the detailed handling of these situations is still to be finalised in the draft regulations.
The final outstanding matter in our negotiations with the government—and the most difficult and important one—is the drafting of regulations concerning the engagement of Australian Public Service employees. The government has accepted ongoing employment as the norm and has agreed to specify in the bill the categories of employment which will be available in the APS. The circumstances in which persons may be engaged on a temporary or casual basis are to be set out in regulations. We attach great importance to getting this right. We will not be party to the casualisation of the Public Service, nor to arrangements which will constitute open slather for the hiring of employees on a temporary basis. The government's current proposal, to allow temporary employment for periods up to six years, is unacceptable. We consider this would be seriously detrimental to the professionalism and the morale of the Public Service.
The regulations concerning machinery of government changes and categories of employment take us into the realm of complex industrial matters—matters which are of vital concern to the public sector unions, in particular the CPSU. We have kept the CPSU 
 informed of the progress of our negotiations with the government and have made every effort to reflect their concerns in those negotiations. We are pleased that the government has agreed to involve them directly in the process of finalising these two sets of regulations.
As I indicated in commencing my remarks, the opposition will be supporting the amendments to be moved by the government and we will be supporting the bill as amended, together with its accompanying consequential amendment bill. However, given the importance of the three issues which remain to be resolved through the drafting of regulations, our support for the third reading of the bills in the Senate will be contingent on our satisfaction with those regulations.
We are also dealing today with the  Parliamentary Service Bill 1999 . We are pleased that the Presiding Officers have agreed to amendments to the bill which reflect the outcome of our negotiations with the government on the amendments to the Public Service Bill. We will be supporting those amendments and the bill itself, but again our position on the third reading of this bill in the Senate will be contingent on our satisfaction with the determinations which will detail the processes to be followed for review of employment decisions under clause 32 and the circumstances in which employees can be employed on a non-ongoing basis.
We are discussing with the parliamentary administration some additional amendments to the Parliamentary Service Bill which reflect those that we moved in the Senate on the last occasion that it was debated. We hope these discussions will reach a satisfactory conclusion prior to the Senate debate. Once again, on behalf of the opposition I express our thanks for the cooperative approach adopted by the government in its negotiations. We trust that will continue to enable the outstanding matters with regulations to be dealt with expeditiously.",REPS,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—In introducing my remarks by way of some kind of contribution to the consideration of the Public Service and Parliamentary Service bills and amendments—and it is most pleasing that 
 both the major parties are now in agreement—I would like to return to some comments that were made by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, the member for Goldstein, shortly after his appointment to that position when he spoke to the IPAA National Conference entitled `Public administration in the new democratic state'. The minister outlined his vision of the Public Service for the new millennium.
The minister said that he saw four contextual dimensions within which the new Public Service should function. The first was increasing social and economic globalisation, the second was an enhanced rate of the speed and scale of change, the third was higher educational attainment and the fourth was what the minister described as `the further advance of the human spirit'. The latter dimension consisted of `a growing demand for more recognition of equal dignity and equal opportunities for all and increasing resistance to closed positions of privilege'. The operational imperatives of the dimensions were more sophisticated public demands for flexibility, quality, ideas and accountability. The minister set out at that time his vision that meeting these challenges requires intellectual and creative capital rather than the capacity to make and follow rules.
How true it is that Australia's Public Service and Australia's public servants work and serve the Australian public and the governments that it elects in an environment and a world that is vastly different from what it was when the Public Service Act was passed in 1922. Judith Homeshaw from the University of Tasmania, in the Australian Journal of Public Administration in September 1998, said:
The original Public Service Act 1922 started out as a 52-page, 102-clause document designed for a simpler age when the Commonwealth government had far fewer responsibilities vis a vis the states, and notions of social justice extended about as far as the family wage provisions in Higgins' Harvester decision. Australia was largely Anglo-Celtic and women did not count in the public service because they did not work as efficiently as men. The first Public Service Board report said that this was because of the: `sapping of the vitality of unmarried young women at an earlier age in life'. However, 
 legislative simplicity and brevity can also mean vulnerability and discrimination.
This bill and the amendments to it very much serve not only the interests of efficiency, fairness and equity and the other four principles that were set out by the minister shortly after his appointment but also serve the interests of those Australians whom the Public Service ultimately serves.
One of the thematic criticisms of the government in trying to undertake Public Service reforms since its election in March 1996 has been that the government's reforms have resulted in fewer people being employed in Australia's Public Service. A couple of points need to be made in response to that. The first is that any organisation, certainly any business, can spend only what it earns and, except in some circumstances for governments in deficit budgeting, should actually spend less than it is earning.
It was imperative for Australia, in consolidating the finances of our country, apart from bringing a sense of economic and administrative efficiency to the Public Service, to actually employ the number of public servants appropriate to the needs of the Australian government. Judith Homeshaw also said:
When machinery of government reforms were instigated in 1987—
that of course was when Bob Hawke was the Prime Minister of Australia—
the APS had 177,742 staff employed under the Public Service Act. In June 1997 there were 133,602—a fall of 25 per cent. The Australian Public Service Statistics Report  for 1997 argues that the fall is only 8 per cent in real terms, given the changing coverage of the Act over the 10 years, but this changing coverage is in itself significant.
This was attributed to corporatisation, the establishment of stand-alone government agencies and the shift to other modes of service and advice delivery such as contracting, employing consultants and, more recently, the creation of cross-portfolio service centres throughout the country.
The single most important public administration event of 1997 was the introduction to the federal parliament of the Public Service Bill 1997. It is interesting when you go to the rationale for those reforms, which of course 
 I strongly support, and you compare those with the rationale for the reforms put up by the Hawke government in 1987: they are essentially transposable. There has been a bit of a change here today in debating this bill and these amendments. It is a pity that whoever is in opposition feels that, at times, they need to criticise, if not denigrate, what the government of the day is trying to do in relation to the Public Service when in government both sides essentially realise that, fundamentally, the same policy objectives need to be set and achieved.
The  Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1999  repeals the Public Service Act 1922 and the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984. Given the remarks I made about the Public Service Act 1922, you will wonder why it was not done earlier. It forms part of a package of two bills, one proposed bill and an act, and represents another instalment in the government's program to further allow for maximising performance in the Public Service.
There are three essential provisions of the bill. The first are transitional provisions, which cover three broad areas. The first comprises conversion arrangements for those who work in the Australian Public Service, removing the term `officers' and creating a single employment category. This has the effect of giving Public Service staff employees and corresponding agencies the corresponding classifications.
The second of the transitional provisions relates to first tier and second tier mobility rights under the Public Service Act 1922. This is a significant transitional arrangement, covering the rights of return of staff who have left the Public Service to enable them to take up non-Public Service Commonwealth employment under the complex provisions of part IV of the old act. The new bill will not contain mobility provisions, but those public servants who have part IV mobility rights of return to the Public Service will retain them for three years. That will be covered by regulations. In March last year, Public Service regulations were amended to delete most non-Public Service and Commonwealth agencies 
 and statutory officers from part IV provisions in any case.
When you look at what is going on around the country—and I certainly know, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, it is the case in your electorate of Franklin—and when you see the kinds of changes that are being wrought in our society and the problems that businesses and their employees have had over the last 15 years, you can see how anachronistic some things are in the Public Service Act. Those things are being dealt with by this bill and in these amendments. A detailed exposition of the mobility provisions is set out in the explanatory memorandum. But the essential features are the first and second tier arrangements, and they are actually worth having a look at. Division 2, part IV of the 1922 act deals with first tier employees. These are Public Service employees who have taken up employment with a statutory authority but who have retained the right to return to the Public Service at any time they please. Such officers are generally deemed to be on leave from the Public Service, but time spent with the non-Public Service authority by such employees counts as service in the Public Service.
Division 3 of part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 deals with second tier employees. This division applies to Public Service officers who are covered by part IV of the Public Service Act and who choose to remain, at the end of an initial three-year period with an authority, in the employment of that authority or another body. Officers covered by the second tier arrangements can apply for promotion or transfer to Public Service vacancies and exercise promotion appeal rights as if they were still Public Service officers. They also have certain rights of re-entry to the Public Service in cases where they have been or are about to be displaced from employment by their current non-Public Service employer. Whilst trying to encourage professional, educational, academic and career development amongst public servants is very important, one has to wonder in this day and age whether those sorts of provisions ought to remain other than at the discretion of agency heads. 
 For that reason amongst others, I am pleased that this bill deals with the issue.
Staff of the Public Service who now go back to work from a Commonwealth authority, or who take up a statutory office, no longer have a right of return under part IV of the act. Public servants will instead be required to obtain leave without pay from their Public Service employer or to resign from the Public Service. Leave without pay would be requested from Public Service agency heads. I must say that I have the greatest admiration for most of the public servants with whom I have worked, not only in my current life but in my previous one, despite some of the criticisms that are made throughout the country of public servants by people who think they are underworked and overpaid.
Dealing with some of these part IV mobility issues is long overdue. The term `sheltered workshop' sprang to mind when I read about this. I had some experience with it in my previous life in that, occasionally, very good people were seconded from the Public Service to work with the Australian Medical Association on some of our industrial issues, but I wondered whether it was an appropriate way in a modern society to conduct employment arrangements in such a large work force.
There is a third transitional issue. It is important to provide for the continuation of processes that are already under way. Action may have already been commenced under the Public Service Act 1922 or the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 which will not be completed by the time the new Public Service Act is proclaimed. Changes to these acts will be dealt with in regulation.
Embedded in this legislation are various amendments to the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990, the most significant of which is possibly item 756, which includes amendments to subclauses 1(2) and 1(3) of schedule 3. Subclause 1(2) currently provides that the annual salary of members of parliament be equal to the minimum annual salary payable to Australian Public Service officers at the SES Band 2 level. As these are now set by individual workplace agreements, there is essentially no longer a minimum annual rate 
 of salary payable in respect of that classification. It is further accentuated under clause 24 of the Public Service Bill by the formal provision of the determination of salary setting arrangements for SES and non-SES employees to the agency level.
Some of my colleagues will possibly say, `That Nelson again! He's a fool. Fancy talking about these sorts of things in relation to the bill,' but it is important that I take the same attitude to discussing remuneration issues for members of parliament that I did when trying to defend the professional interests of the medical profession. We need to discuss these things openly. It has been of some concern to me that, for up to a couple of years now, there has not been any formal mechanism linking federal parliamentarians' salary arrangements to any kind of indexation mechanism. At some point further down the line, this could create significant problems for anyone who tries to address it. It is to the credit of the government, and I understand it is supported by the opposition, that at least some kind of mechanism is being put in place.
In terms of workplace agreements, I would be very happy to be on one myself. I think that the whole system by which members of parliament are paid requires significant review—and I realise that by even talking about this I am probably making yet another career limiting move. Going back to some comments I have made publicly in the past, I do wonder whether it would be preferable if members of parliament were paid from a global budget, not a budget from which we run our offices but one from which we receive a global amount of money to pay our accommodation in Canberra—if you wanted to stay in a caravan or the Hyatt, that is your business—and from which we buy our wreaths, raffle tickets and all the other things that we do. We should pay into a superannuation fund like everybody else and it should be one into which no-one backs a tip truck loaded with someone else's money. The amount of money we are paid should be varied according to the sorts of electorates we represent—for example, I doubt that my total package as a member representing an inner suburban Sydney 
 metropolitan electorate would be the same as my friend and colleague the member for Kalgoorlie.
These are the kinds of issues that we ought to be discussing. I realise that they are tangential to this bill, but one of the reasons why there is an increasing sense of alienation from institutions in our country is that we seem too often to want to run away from debating the real issues. Evidence of this is the debate about whether or not we ought to be a republic, when the real issue for Australians is: how best can we govern ourselves in a federation in a world that is vastly different from what it was 100 years ago? The sorts of things we ought to be looking at earnestly as a nation are state-Commonwealth relations, the length of terms that are served by federal governments in particular, the number of politicians we have in our country—federal, state and local—and the way in which we remunerate those people. Coming back to the bill, I think it is a sensible move to at least have some kind of indexation linked to parliamentarians' remuneration; to do otherwise might create many more problems.
What this bill includes as the amendments under item 756 is the linking of the annual salary of MPs to the `minimum executive office salary'. The minimum executive office salary will be either the minimum annual rate of salary payable at the SES band 2 or, where the principal executive classification is prescribed by the regulations, the minimum annual rate of salary applicable to that classification. The other interesting amendments are those to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. Subsection 5(2)(a) proposes that the Remuneration Tribunal will, in addition to its current functions:
.	 determine a classification structure for principal executive offices
.	 provide advice to the relevant employing bodies in relation to terms and conditions on which principal executive offices are to be held.
However, remuneration, allowances, terms and conditions for a principal executive office may be determined by the relevant employing body under section 12C. Under these changes, an employing body will first request the assistance of the Remuneration Tribunal if it 
 wishes to determine terms and conditions for a principal executive office classification that will be consistent with the classification structure determined by the tribunal under subsection 5(2)(a). Whilst that is fairly legalistic jargon in terms of legislative drafting, it actually means that we will have a much more efficient, logical and sensible system.
So, I commend the bill and the amendments to the House. I also hope that at some time in the future the parliament will have the maturity to start to address the issues of politicians' remuneration in some meaningful way. It is interesting that one of the aid organisations asked me if I was prepared to donate my last hour's pay of the century to a very worthy charitable cause for children. I wrote to them and I said that I would in fact do better than that and would donate six hours because, when you sit down and work out your hourly rate, it is about $4. I realise that, by community standards, as members of parliament we have no reason to complain at all, but I think it is a two-way street. People need to appreciate the extent of work that is put in by members of parliament. At least there is an indexation mechanism here. Hopefully, at some point, we will discuss what I consider to be the real issues.",REPS,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—The Public Service Bill 1999  and the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1999  presented here today represent the culmination of much effort by the trade union movement, particularly the Community and Public Sector Union, in making it possible for the opposition to support these bills in principle today. Agreement has been reached on some 60 amendments to the bills, with nearly half of the 78 clauses being amended since the bills were last in this House. Three key issues, however, remain unanswered and these constitute the basis of my concerns: (1) types of employment—that is, the government has been extremely inflexible in the engagement of `specified term' employees; (2) machinery of government (MOG) changes—the government does not want to provide for the full transmission of existing conditions as a result of MOG changes; and (3) reviews/appeals—agreement 
 has been reached that binding promotion appeals will be retained with a three-member review committee hearing the appeal. However, there will not be designated union nominees on the committees. All other applications for review of action will only result in a recommendation to the agency head, with the Merit Protection Commissioner being able to report to the Prime Minister and parliament should he/she not be satisfied with the response to the recommendation.
It was only 10 months ago that I delivered my maiden speech in this House, on 12 November 1998. In that speech I noted, inter alia, as follows:
Since 1995 I have watched the APS being torn apart. This has resulted in absolute job losses in the public sector. At a local level in Lowe I have already had, in response to the savage cuts to Centrelink, a deputation from the CPSU . . . The Public Service is . . . the interface between the government and the governed. It provides services fairly, honestly, without discrimination and with great efficiency, remaining always accountable to the elected government of the day. The service is independent of the whims and fancies of individual politicians as it is required to act always in accordance with the law . . . It seems to me that the government is seeking to destroy the effect of interface between the government and the governed.
That is what I said nearly 12 months ago. There can be no greater affront to the rule of law than the systematic undermining of the rules of natural justice. These include the bias rule, the right to be heard and the probative evidence rule. Let us look at what these bills mean. Let us count the cost to Australia as a so-called democracy and judge the social implications of these bills in light of the operation of our democratic processes.
These bills represent potentially a blatant attack on the operation of natural justice in Australia. There is no comparison with or precedent for this level of attack on the operation of natural justice. We see here the systematic dismantling of the Australian Public Service (APS). We see far more than a decimation of the APS in both its role and its physical numbers. We see a public service that the Prime Minister himself declared in the media in January this year as needing to be more politically sensitive. In this one 
 statement, the Prime Minister demonstrated his understanding of responsible government.
It is timely to remind ourselves of what responsible government means. Responsible government is not a function of how receptive the Public Service is to its contractual masters, the Federal Government Inc. Rather, the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, the Constitution, prescribes in section 64:
After the first general election no Minister of State shall hold office for a longer period than three months unless he becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.
I feel compelled to remind the Prime Minister why this section exists in the Constitution. It exists because the Federal Executive Council must be responsible to the public. Political responsibility does not mean the Public Service is at the whim of elements of the legislature. I give the Prime Minister credit for pulling this swiftie. It is clever, but not clever enough. What the Prime Minister is doing is immoral. The Public Service is the port of entry between the Federal Executive Council and the public. Public participation depends on a public service that is impartial, indifferent to the outcome of parliamentary decision making, probative in its fact gathering in the presentation of advice to the Federal Executive Council and which affords every citizen equal right to be heard on matters of the public interest.
That is natural justice. That is the rule of law. The public service in our Westminster system must possess the following attributes: (1) it must be impartial; (2) it must be unencumbered by sectional or vested interests; and (3) it must be insulated and protected against the threat of reprisals for giving advice that runs contrary to other private interests that may bias or otherwise infiltrate particular political parties within our parliamentary structure.
I note here that the political parties are not accommodated in our current constitutional structure; at least, there is no formal recognition of political parties in our Constitution. This has had the unfortunate effect of enmeshing both the federal executive function 
 and sectional vested interests into one and the same body.
In these particular circumstances, we see the big end of town, corporate entities, acting as players in the Federal Executive Council, represented by the Liberal-National Party coalition. Therefore, when the Prime Minister speaks of a public service that is more politically sensitive, he is really saying `a public service that is more sensitive to the vested interests that contaminate and bias Liberal-National coalition policy'.
By comparison, the correct role of the Public Service is to accurately represent the public interest in an impartial and unbiased way. The Public Service must present the needs and concerns of the public in the various community consultations from those little republics that constitute the factor inputs that form the fabric of policy formulation. The Public Service is where those little republics—that great battery of social institutions such as trade unions, churches, lobby groups, professional organisations, community and welfare groups, et cetera—may freely present their case and state their claim and thus work collaboratively in the formulation of public policy. Instead, the Prime Minister's political sensitivity means that we will redirect sensitivity away from the general public and in favour of the sectional and vested interests of those who have infiltrated the Federal Executive Council through the political party operatives of this federal government.
How do these bills achieve the quantum shift in responsibility away from the public interest and in favour of the Prime Minister's so-called national interest—an oft quoted term which really translates into vested interests of big business? Let us examine what these bills actually mean in this context. First, the bills will further decimate the Public Service employment base. When this government took office in 1996, there were 350,200 employees in the Commonwealth public sector. As at 30 June 1998, the number of employees has fallen to 248,300, a decrease of 30 per cent. During the 1997-98 financial year, the number of staff employed under the Public Service 
 Act decreased by 13,065. That is more than 10 per cent in one year.
The impact of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 on the Public Service Act needs to be read in the context of the overriding ethic of the federal government. In particular, the Workplace Relations Regulations 1996 allow APS employees to override prescribed provisions of the Public Service Act relating the `hire and fire' powers in their certified agreements and Australian Workplace Agreements. Similarly, certified agreements and AWAs may be used to exclude the operation of determinations made under section 82AD of the Public Service Act. Also, a new direction issued by the Public Service Commission in February 1998 places responsibility on departments and agencies to develop procedures for managing poor performance by their employees and inserting these into certified agreements and AWAs.
What we are witnessing is the conspicuous shift from a regime of public responsibility to the privatisation of the public sector. We have witnessed more than just a system of greater political sensitivity and degradation of the public sector to being lackeys. The duty relationship between employer and employee has consumed and dominated the other duties of the Public Service, namely its duty to the public and its duty to policy. This is administrative reductionism at its worst. That is, the duty relationship between Government Incorporated and its employees is given greater weight than the duty between citizen and government through their public service.
The nature of the workplace amendments, including these bills, has fundamentally altered the duty relationship, damaging and perhaps destroying it. Gone are the days of impartial, disinterested advice from the Public Service. The Public Service is very interested in the advice it gives its pseudo political masters. I say `pseudo' because it is patently clear that the government has forgotten its right to employ these staff, and the moneys it derives from the taxes which go to pay the salaries of the APS are only mediate rights. The immediate right of the existence of the APS, its governance and the policies that underpin its existence, including this parlia 
 ment—every one of us privileged to participate in this great democratic institution called parliament—are delegated to us by the will of the people.
We are not here as of right. There is no divine right to rule. None of us is born to rule. However, this government has taken upon itself an omnipotent attribute, thinking itself beyond public mandate in bestowing powers unto itself whilst at the same time undermining the immediate rights of the citizen. I need not remind this parliament that it is here purely by virtue of its popular mandate. The APS employees are now in fear of wide-ranging powers to hire and fire and of making decisions that the Federal Executive Council may feel do not reflect this newspeak political sensitivity. Extensive powers are given to departmental secretaries and agency heads in relation to the management of staff, especially in respect of recruitment of staff and managing efficiency and underperformance.
This may sound intuitively appealing to some. Images of bludging public servants, who cannot be sacked, living with their snouts deeply bedded in the trough whilst doing very little, are not uncommon in Australia. In reality, the prospect of bureaucratic excesses is even more likely with public servants being retained depending on their loyalty as lackeys to the political system of the day. The Oxford Dictionary defines `lackey' as `a servile political follower'. That is what I believe the Prime Minister wishes to make the Public Service: a group of lackeys to the vested interests that govern them—a new baronage of elites who rule rather than serve.
Are departmental heads elected? No, they are appointed by their political masters. Who oversees the day-to-day management of these departmental heads? No-one. Whistleblowers are routinely dispensed with, often brutally. Even though there are supposed to be provisions in the amended Public Service Regulations in respect of protection for whistleblowers who allege breaches of the code of conduct, there will be no such protection for conduct prior to 15 March 1999 for non-code related allegations of breaches.
I refer to clause 16 of the Public Service Bill 1999, which prohibits `a person performing functions in or for an Agency' from victimising, or discriminating against, an APS employee because the latter has reported an alleged breach of the code of conduct to the Public Service Commissioner, the agency head or authorised persons. This clause is inserted in an attempt to afford some protection for whistleblowers. Whilst I appreciate this, I note the classification of such action to include what should be the day-to-day function of a public servant. That is, it is part of the public servant's duty to society to report anomalies in the operation of public responsibilities.
This is the very reason why public servants enjoyed some immunity from easy dismissal. Employment in the Public Service is fundamentally different from employment in private enterprise. Private enterprise is private because the duty is contractual in nature. The parties involved include the employer, customers and sometimes shareholders and creditors. The duty relationship in public life is very different. The public servant's whole existence is there by virtue of public policy, public interest and public necessity. The public servant's role is to assist in a national perspective in the performance of functions which individual citizens of Australia could not possibly perform alone or even in syndicate. The public servant's power is delegated from a representative of the people in the guise of parliament, which in turn is given immediate rights to govern by the general public.
The whistleblower provisions are very sinister. For one thing, inquiries into reports made by public interest whistleblowers under clause 16 are to be conducted by a Public Service commissioner. Second, the subject matter which is protected by immunity is very narrow. Public servants may still be victimised in any number of ways which do not trammel the new legislation. To put it bluntly, the new provisions do not provide adequate security in substitution for what the public servant has lost by losing their job security. It is not a fair swap. It is reductionist. It is a severe legal and statutory diminution of the 
 standing of the Public Service—a step down from the status public servants held prior to these reductionist bills.
Whether it is whistleblowers or the establishment of the Merit Protection Commissioner, the thread of reductionism prevails. It is the reduction of the duty relationship down to a mere contract that lies at the heart of the defect in the ethics being applied. Employment in the Public Service, like marriage, is not a mere contract; it is much more. It is more than merely contractual because it involves duty relationships that transcend the mere performance of consideration within the confines of a contract for services agreement. If that is all that it is, then we as a government should shut up shop as parliamentarians right now and enter private enterprise—after all, it is the same argument. To say the APS should be privatised is synonymous with saying there is no justification for a public sector. If the only distinguishing feature between public and private is who pays the bills, then there is really no need for a public sector at all. We may as well dispense with taxes altogether, farm out defence to private enterprise and simply eliminate sovereignty as a concept.
This may sound foreign to many of us here today, but these are the logical consequences of such policy. Either we rediscover our public interest role and give the Public Service the autonomy it must have in a functional Westminster system or face a world where we cease to exist as a sovereign people driven by policies of an ostensibly privative nature. We stand to become a world driven by ratification of the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, agreeing to further so-called globalisation without adequately accommodating our immediate policy needs to protect those higher values such as the rule of law and universalism.
One look at the economic catastrophe called Victoria proves my point on where we are headed when we take privatisation of a public service to its logical end. Famous Liberal Party identity, Jeff Kennett, may deep down in his ego appreciate the strength of these words. Look at the effect of privatisation in the state of Victoria. Look at the reaction at 
 the polling booths in Victoria—11 seats, mostly rural Victorians, flogged Kennett; a flogging well-earned and well-deserved. They told him to service their needs—the basics of what government means; that is, education, health, social services, financial accountability and auditing, law and order, roads, sewerage, electricity and transport. Victoria privatised the lot. Kennett sold the lot. Kennett dismembered the state public service. Superdepartments were formed. Everything where a slick deal and a fast buck could be made in place of providing Victorians with a service—a public service—seems to have been either sold or privatised, even planning powers, with certifiers taking the place of the local government authority, and the very ordinance powers themselves being meted out to private enterprise.
The Victorian election was a catastrophe for the Liberal Party. What the Liberal Party did to cash up in the wake of their even more catastrophic economic mismanagement during the 1980s was even more stupid than their overcapitalisation in the land market. The various building societies—and the Bank of Melbourne itself—that went bust rocked the state of Victoria. Then came Jeff Kennett's fire sale of the Victorian Public Service.
Messrs Howard and Costello can run but they cannot hide. They are equally deluded by the false economies of federal government asset sales. As in East Timor, I look across the charred landscape—a scorched earth policy of public sector cuts in many areas affecting my electorate of Lowe. For example, Medicare, Centrelink, the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and Australia Post. Even the Australian Electoral Commission's office in Strathfield is not safe. I understand the government wants to co-locate it and other AEC divisional offices in the city.
Does this government really believe that the public can ignore these events? Does this government really believe that a Telstra dividend or a notional budget surplus will compensate the shoe leather cost for pensioners, the unemployed, those with disabilities, those who need letterboxes and those waiting forever in bank queues, or make them forget 
 what Mr Howard has done? This government is facing the same fate as its Victorian colleagues—a catastrophic electoral backlash. No government is safe anymore. Mere budget surpluses do not win elections. The voting public will not forget the destruction of its Public Service. Through the demise of the APS, the public's voice is being forcibly silenced. The ports of entry to public participation are being forcibly closed.
Administratively, it is the timing of the bills and the repercussions if the bills were not accepted that have resulted in the opposition's giving in-principle agreement to these bills; that is, if the opposition did not support these bills, more harm than good would flow from them. To this extent, the opposition proposed only 71 amendments to the bills—a modest number when compared with the effect these bills will have on the future governance of Australia. It would be too complex to go into any detail with these 71 amendments, each of which have already been extensively discussed by my parliamentary colleagues in the Senate. This consultation has in itself resulted in the abovementioned amendments which have, I understand, been accommodated in the body of the substantive bills and therefore address the concerns therein.
However, I additionally wish to note the extensive contribution of the trade unions, especially the Commonwealth Public Sector Union, the Australian Metal Workers Union, the Australian Liquor Trades, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union and the National Union of Workers. These trade unions have played a major role in formulating the outstanding regulations dealing with complex industrial matters that these bills raise.
The 71 amendments are essential for the opposition's support for these bills. It will never be said that this opposition was obstructionist in its perspective. On the other hand, we cannot allow the unbridled collapse of duty relationships. No matter what the outcome of these bills, the effect on the public interest remains the same. It is one thing to vote on the operational efficiency of a bill versus its hidden costs. We may pass an efficient bill but have made for a collapse of governance. We now place our trust in the 
 government to honour its commitments. (Time expired)

"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—The Public Service Bill 1999 , the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1999  and the Parliamentary Service Bill 1999  were introduced into the House on 29 October 1997, amended by the Senate in November 1997, reintroduced in March 1998 and again amended to the dissatisfaction of the House. The original legislation was laid aside by the government in April 1998 and reintroduced to the House of Representatives on 30 March 1999 in its current form. The effect of the legislation is to replace the existing employment framework governing employees of the Australian Public Service. Such staff are presently subject to the Public Service Act 1922. Similarly, the parliament's employees are addressed in the Parliamentary Service Bill.
I had the pleasure of speaking to this bill when it first came before the House of Representatives in 1997. Since that time the original legislation has been twice mangled by the Senate and twice those amendments have been rejected by this House. The legislation has returned in the form of these bills and I sincerely hope that finally we might be able to achieve the outcome that best benefits the Commonwealth government, its employees and the people those employees serve. That outcome is the one that will arise from the passage of these bills without the death by a thousand amendments suffered by the previous bills.
In addressing the parliament on this matter two years ago, I made the point of reflecting on the importance of integrity and respect for the Australian Public Service. In a society that is at times wary of the intentions and actions of governments of all persuasions, in fact is wary—not without cause—of the state as an institution, it is crucial that those who implement and advise upon government policy exhibit the professional standards that are the hallmark of the Australian Public Service at its finest. Even a hint of corruption or malpractice within the public sector reflects not 
 only on all of us but also on our country at large. We can be immensely proud in this country that we have had very limited examples of that kind of malpractice. Integrity is something that is accepted as being very much a part of the Australian public sector. In the past we have not always recognised the importance of that fact, not simply because a country is well served by an honest and respected public service but also because such an asset is fundamental to this country's continued success, socially and economically.
In recent months we have all had cause to reflect on the success of this nation and its economy in avoiding the pitfalls produced by the crisis that lately enveloped the economies of Asia and many other developing regions. Undoubtedly the masterful economic policies of the Treasurer and of this government, especially the steadfast commitment to overcoming budget deficits and public debt, has let Australia not only ride out the storm but also surf the wave of global economic turmoil.
Longer term factors have also played a part in this success. It has already been remarked upon by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that the application of liberal economic policy and the repudiation of socialist solutions to socialist problems by the Labor governments of the 1980s—with the full and open support of the coalition in opposition—set the scene for a strong and competitive Australia to enter the new century with hope and optimism. It seems a long time ago that a Singaporean Prime Minister might have had cause to suggest that Australians were the `white trash of Asia'.
In all their ruminations on this success, a number of the most insightful analysts have focused their attention on the differences in law, public administration, freedom of information and justice between Australia and many nations now beset by downturn and pessimism. Essentially, the strong historical commitment to honest and impartial law making in this country has created an environment in which innovation, open dealings and trade can flourish, not without instances of difficulty but without systemic problems. Systems of governance that once seemed 
 enticing now seem a lot less attractive than those which we enjoy. The important reforms to public administration before this House strengthen this commitment and address some of those instances of difficulty.
The Public Service Act 1922 is now 77 years old. In those 77 years it has been amended more than 100 times. Its capacity to guide an effective Australian public service, serving the Australian public and national development, in its current form, is now in question. The act, as it presently stands, sets in legislative concrete values and practices that are historical rather than effective. For this reason, public servants themselves have sought in recent years to create workplace environments that can best serve the public rather than the act. As I noted in 1997, in a legislatively hamstrung environment, innovation is neglected and flexibility denied.
These reforms to the public sector are part of the government's broader micro-economic reform agenda and ought to have the support of both sides in this House and in the other place. The opposition ought to disregard their previous stance on these bills and consider the real need for reform. After all, members of previous Labor administrations did consider the kinds of reforms being debated here today. They rightly understood that the Public Service ought to serve the public as its goal rather than serve the act. Labor held the reviews and conducted the negotiations. However, Labor's allegiance to the Public Service unions outweighed the rights of taxpayers, the nation's economic health and, it should be noted, the actual interests of Australia's public servants. In 1997, I suggested to the House that the good intentions of ex-ministers such as the Hon. Gary Johns were wasted in such an environment. Unfortunately, I have not had sufficient cause to re-evaluate that judgment.
Some reforms have already been achieved through administrative means. For instance, agency heads now have greater authority and flexibility with which to manage staff. New Public Service values and a code of conduct have been set out in regulation. Public accountability has been strengthened and protection for whistleblowers has been introduced. 
 It is noteworthy that the Senate has not sought to overturn those amendments that were achieved through the amendment of the present act. If only that interest in reform can be translated into the acceptance and support of this legislation before us today.
Other speakers from the government both today and at previous incarnations of this bill have laid out in detail the measures contained in these three bills. As such, I shall not repeat those comments. I note simply that the legislation addresses a number of pressing issues which have not been amenable to simplification and improvement through administrative means, such as giving employment powers direct to agency heads; grounding in parliament derived law a secure framework for APS values, conduct and whistleblowers protection; removing inflexible employment categories; and removing compulsory age 65 retirement. Further, the reforms contained in this legislation move the Public Service away from central control towards the kind of management that best serves employees and clients. In the broadest context, the word `clients' means the Australian people.
Before closing, I will address an issue which seems to me to be worth further examination by the government. This issue was brought to my attention by Ross MacGregor in a recent Quadrant article. The bill strives to further entrench the value of merit in staffing decisions. For instance, it specifically seeks to ensure that appointments within the APS are not subject to political patronage. My concerns relate to section 10(1)(b), which outlines the values of the service, and states:
10 APS Values
(1)	 The APS Values are as follows:
. . .              . . .             . . .
	 (b)	 the APS is a public service in which employment decisions are based on merit.
I repeat, `employment decisions are based on merit'. That would certainly be a value respected by all Australians, but questions of merit and public employment are inevitably tainted by the triumph of political correctness in the 1980s and the 1990s. MacGregor catalogues in his article the various means by which merit has been undermined by notions 
 of proportionism in hiring and special notions of disadvantage.
Section 10(2) of the bill deems a decision to be based on merit if it is based primarily on assessment of suitability and qualifications with regard to the position in question. As secondary factors are not apparently defined, this does suggest that merit is only one factor in consideration. Section 11 may also give the Public Service Commissioner the power to further override the merit principle in favour of the various categories of `victimhood' that were so prevalent under the previous government. I hope that this will not see a return to the bad old days of political correctness at the expense of the taxpayer and the public. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—One thing that we on this side of the House are always a little sceptical of is the government when it comes to industrial relations, but it appears that on this occasion the government is going to include a number of amendments which are welcomed by the opposition. This government has been consistent in its attack on workers' conditions and job security. In every piece of legislation, every word it utters in relation to workplace reform signals an attack on workers. So you can understand our scepticism in relation to the public service and parliamentary service legislation and also to the history of this legislation, and the previous attempts by the government in relation to public sector reform add to that scepticism.
Workplace reform in the maritime industry signalled an attack on workers in that industry. It led to sackings and secret deals between the employers and government at the expense of workers. It led to a situation where workers were under siege and to great division within that work force. These are some of the reasons that we worry about this government's reform agenda. Generally speaking, reform does not mean reform for all parties; it means reform for one specific sector, and that is usually the employer. In this case, that employer is the Commonwealth of Australia and I believe that the onus on the government to ensure that those reforms take 
 the workers with them is greater than in any other area.
If the government's success in workplace reform is evaluated on its ability to create division, then it seems to have an overabundance of ability to attack workers. That evaluation would show that it has been quite successful to date because there has been an erosion of working conditions and security for workers here in Australia.
The Howard government advocates the need for micro-economic reform, the removal of red tape, workplace flexibility and the encouragement of a direct relationship between employers and workers. There are a lot of those things that we on this side of the House can see will benefit Australia, both the government and workers. But as so often under this government, micro-economic reforms and a change in direction signal an attack on workers.
 When the Howard government's workplace reforms have been introduced, they have shown that workplace flexibility means a loss of working conditions for workers. Workplace flexibility means that under the Howard government you can no longer assume you will go to work and be certain that you will have a job when you come home. Howard government flexibility changes on a daily basis. You do not have the security of knowing that your job and conditions are going to be maintained.
It is all about creating a situation where the workers are basically in their jobs at the whim of the employer. The reduction of red tape could mean that it makes it easier for businesses to operate and that it makes a better and more efficient Public Service. However, it can also mean that it is easier to sack workers. That is what worries me. We do not want a situation in this country where workers in our Public Service can go to work one day and be given a letter that says, `Sorry, your job doesn't exist any longer.'
The move to a direct relationship between employers and workers is one way of getting rid of unions. It makes sure that the unions do not play a part in negotiations. What does this mean? It means it will lead to a reduction in wages for workers, poorer conditions and 
 longer working hours. It seems to be a bit of a one-way street, one that is about protecting the employer—in this case, the Commonwealth—against the worker.
The Howard government sought to impose its 1950s reactionary type reforms on the Public Service on two previous occasions, but it failed to ram its legislation through the parliament. On the two previous occasions, the legislation was so anti-worker, so anti the employees—the fine public servants we have here in Australia—that it was rejected by the Senate and could have acted as a trigger for a double dissolution in the previous parliament.
In Australia, we have a highly skilled, professional, hardworking, independent, non-partisan Public Service. That is what we want to keep. They are valued employees of the Commonwealth and we should recognise it. After the Victorian elections, Jeff Kennett gave credit to his strong public service in that state. I put it to the government that we have an even stronger, better, more qualified Public Service here in the Commonwealth. We should appreciate it and make our workers feel valued.
We get the best graduates. There is a highly competitive system in place whereby the most highly educated, the highest performing graduates, are offered positions in the Public Service. To even obtain a position as a base grade clerk in the Public Service you have to perform at a very high level. Those positions are highly competitive. If we are to continue attracting highly qualified, high calibre people to the Public Service we need a public service where there is security of employment and where our workers in the Public Service retain good wages and conditions.
Why would a government attack its strength? The engine room of the government is its public service. If the country is to thrive and the government is to succeed, we need a strong public service from the base grade clerks to the SES. I am extremely worried that this government is not showing that concern and does not place that value on our Public Service. This government has a hatred of anything public, which leads to its obsession with selling off government assets and 
 contracting out public sector services. This erodes and runs down our Public Service and leads to poorer conditions for those left behind in the Public Service.
The partial sale of Telstra is, once again, an erosion of our public sector. The CES has been replaced with Employment National. There has been the contracting out of the case management functions and other services previously provided by our Commonwealth Employment Service. What does this mean? There are fewer people employed in the public sector, there are fewer career options and, at the same time, the people of Australia are not getting the same service.
We are finding a similar situation in Centrelink, where the staff have been cut. The Public Service staff employed in Centrelink are being asked to do more work over longer hours under extreme stress and pressure. What is the government doing? It is looking at attacking their conditions. That is the way that the public sector has seen these two previous bills. Although I am pleased with the changes that have taken place in the negotiations over the last five or six months, they have been slow in coming.
The contracting out of government services is leading to a decline in services to the public of Australia and lessening the ability of the government to monitor those services that have been contracted out. This leads to an erosion of quality and the inability to assess whether that quality still exists. When public servants deliver a service, they deliver it directly and are directly accountable. There is a loss of accountability with contracted out services. Few cost-benefit analyses have been done in this country. We cannot look at contracted out services and really determine whether we are getting value for money. We are told that we cannot be informed about what is happening simply because it is all commercial-in-confidence.
This government believes that private is better. Because of that, it has undermined the Public Service. The government has an ideological commitment to its philosophy of privatisation. It believes that private sector employees are better than public sector employees. I have already mentioned the 
 quality of people who go into the Public Service, be they graduates, people at the base grade level or those with high professional qualifications. The government believes that they should become more like their private counterparts and that this will be achieved by changing conditions. It believes that flexibility, which means less security, will attract the kinds of people who are attracted to the private sector.
I have news for the government. If it wants to maintain the quality Public Service that we have, that is not the way to go about it. I worked in the Public Service myself at one stage. I had the option to transfer to the private sector. Believe me, the benefits were much greater—higher wage, car and all the trimmings that go with it. But I was committed to what the Public Service is about: providing a quality service to the public and being accountable to the public. I believe that that is what most public servants are about. I have yet to come across any public servants that are not committed to providing the service to the people of Australia.
As I mentioned, this is the government's third attempt to have legislation enacted to change the employment conditions in the Commonwealth Public Service. The first two bills were amended in the Senate—and they were potential triggers for a double dissolution. But they were rejected because the amendments were unacceptable to the government. They were not prepared to discuss it; they were not prepared to compromise. They were not prepared to adopt a bipartisan approach to getting the legislation through the parliament. They have the opinion that the boss set the agenda and, as they were the boss, they were saying what was going to happen—if the rest of the parliament did not come in line with them, `Well, bad luck!' This time it is different. Because it has been different and there has been consultation, the result is an improved bill—52 amendments with nearly 78 clauses being amended. That shows the value of consultation.
The history of Public Service reform and this legislation within Australia is quite lengthy. It started in 1994 when the ALP government established the review of the 
 Public Service Act. They involved the CPSU at that time. There were a series of reports—the McLeod review was tabled in December 1994—and the Public Service went through a series of reviews and processes. In 1996, the coalition was elected and in November of that year the Minister for Industrial Relations issued his discussion paper, Towards a best practice Australian Public Service. In May 1997, he issued a further document, Accountability in a devolved management framework. In June 1997, he introduced the Public Service Bill. In November 1997 the bill was introduced into the Senate and there were 52 amendments. Amendments inserted at that time included preserving the existing appeal rights of Australian public servants, providing for a genuine independent Merit Protection Commissioner, strengthening the merit principles and a number of other amendments to ensure the conditions of the workers in the Public Service. But on 5 December the government rejected it, and on 5 March 1998 the bill was reintroduced into the House of Representatives with no change. That demonstrated this government's inability at that time to consult, an inability to accept change and a desire to create conflict between the employees in the Public Service and itself.
As I have already mentioned, the government has now agreed to the 52 amendments—and that is great. But some key issues still need addressing. The extreme flexibility in the engagement of specific term employees is a problem. In my time in the Public Service, a temporary employee was someone who was there for up to 12 months. This government is looking at making a person a temporary employee for up to six years. It is a real stretch of the imagination to imagine that somebody is still a temporary employee up to six years. If the workload is such that it requires a person to be kept on in a temporary position for six years, surely you can deem that that is now a permanent position. That is something that has to be looked at, and looked at very seriously, along with making sure that employees that move to a Commonwealth authority do not settle for fewer entitlements, a smaller wage and poorer conditions. They have to transfer across on 
 the same conditions that they are under at the moment.
It is very important to ensure that we have got the proper review and appeals system in place and that that system not be eroded. Once that happens, you start to lose the independence of the Public Service. It is so important that we have an independent Public Service. It is important for the government to be told things that they do not want to hear. It is important for the government to be given information on all issues and to be able to know that that information is going to be given to them in an impartial manner. It is not in the interests of either the government or Australia for the government to be told what they want to hear all the time. We need to be able to develop our ideas and to be able to consider other ideas and other positions.
Under this government, there has been a ballooning in AWAs. There are in excess of 5,000 AWAs in the Commonwealth Public Service. It is all right if you are in a highly paid position in the Public Service. It is all right if you are in the SES and are in a position to negotiate on even terms. But if you are a base grade clerk you are not in the same bargaining position. The government must not use this legislation to disadvantage those workers in the work force who are in a less powerful position. And it must not be used to increase the number of casual employees by a further casualisation of the work force.
This government does not have a reputation for respecting its employees. It is a government that views workers as its adversaries, to be taken on and beaten into submission. The boss's word is supreme and the boss sets the agenda. That is this government's approach to dealing with issues between workers and employers, and in this case the government is the employer. It is the government that is the boss and it is the public servants who are the employees. I think that is a concern. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and the government as a whole should recognise what Jeff Kennett recognised in Victoria: it is the quality and the dedication of loyal, hardworking public servants that spells success for 
 the government. It is time that this government recognises the value of its Public Service and the valuable role it plays in Australia's future and in the government's micro-economic reform agenda. The government should recognise this and, accordingly, treat its Public Service with respect.",REPS,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—The Public Service Bill 1999  proposes to replace the existing employment framework governing staff of the Australian Public Service, the APS, currently contained in the Public Service Act 1922. The Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1999  repeals the Public Service Act 1922, contains transitional provisions in relation to mobility rights of officers of the Australian Public Service under the Public Service Act 1922 and proposes amendments to other Commonwealth legislation to reflect its repeal.
These bills propose significant changes to the legislative framework governing the employment of approximately 125,000 Australian public servants, many of whom work and/or reside in my electorate of Canberra. The Public Service Act 1922 prescribes in considerable detail conditions of employment of officers of the APS. These include provisions relating to the appointment, promotion and transfer of employees; provisions for the investigation of allegations of misconduct and associated disciplinary provisions; wide-ranging provisions relating to retirement; and provisions relating to mobility of officers between the APS and other Commonwealth employers. However, with the advent of agency level and individual bargaining in the APS, there is now considerable variation in levels of pay and other terms and conditions of employment across departments and agencies. The extent of variation will only increase with further rounds of bargaining.
The history of this Public Service Bill is long and controversial. In fact, the present bill had its beginnings under the previous Labor government. In 1994, the Keating government announced a review of the Public Service Act 1922, headed by Mr Ron McLeod. The report of the review was presented in December 1994. In August 1995, the government an 
 nounced its response to the McLeod review, accepting the majority of the report's 118 recommendations. I understand that legislation was prepared to give effect to the McLeod recommendations, but it was not introduced before the March 1996 federal election.
Following the 1996 election, Minister Reith issued a discussion paper, Towards a best practice Australian Public Service. The discussion paper advocated the need for reform of the APS with the principal mechanism for so doing being the repeal of the Public Service Act 1922. Between December 1996 and February 1997, there was an extensive consultation program within the APS involving major interested parties about the issues raised in the discussion paper. In addition, the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee conducted a roundtable to consider the discussion paper.
In May 1997, at the conclusion of this consultation process, the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, the PSMPC, and the Department of Industrial Relations—as it then was—published The Public Service Act 1997: accountability in a devolved management framework, commonly known as the ADMF report. The ADMF report set out the proposed framework for a new public service act. The report proposed the removal of provisions prescribing conditions of employment of APS members with these to be governed by agreements under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, the repeal of the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 and the consequent abolition of the Merit Protection Review Agency.
In June 1997, the Public Service Bill 1997 and the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997 were introduced into the House of Representatives. After their second reading, both bills were referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit for inquiry and report. The JCPAA tabled its report in September 1997. In response to recommendations of the JCPAA, the government made some amendments to the bills. The Senate passed the bills with 52 non-government amendments in November 1997. In December, the House of 
 Representatives indicated that it would not agree to the Senate's amendments and laid the bills aside. The government then determined that it would implement a number of the reforms proposed by the bill by administrative and other means. The government also indicated that it would use the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to secure further changes to the employment framework of the Australian Public Service.
The relevant administrative changes are amendments to the Public Service Regulations made by the Public Service Regulations—these were made by the Governor-General on 18 February 1998 and commenced on 15 March 1998; amendments to the Public Service Regulations made by the Public Service Regulations Amendment—these regulations were made by the Governor-General on 18 March 1998 and commenced on 25 March 1998; new notifications, determinations, instructions and directions issued by the Public Service Commissioner under various provisions of the Public Service Act 1922; and the making of Determination 1998/5 by the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business, as it then was. Determination 1998/5, which commenced on 9 March 1998, consolidated conditions of employment contained in a wide range of previous determinations. Departments and agencies can override the terms of the determination by making certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements, AWAs, under the Workplace Relations Act.
Specific changes included more extensive powers to departmental secretaries and agency heads in relation to the management of staff, particularly in the areas of recruitment of staff and the management of inefficiency and underperformance; amendments to the Public Service Regulations to introduce Australian Public Service values and a code of conduct applicable to APS staff; and amendments to the Public Service Regulations to provide a level of protection for whistleblowers who allege breaches of the code of conduct, provided that the conduct occurred after 15 March 1999.
In March 1998 the government reintroduced the Public Service Bill 1997 and the Public 
 Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997 into the House of Representatives. The bills were passed by the House on 11 March 1997 and introduced into the Senate on 12 March 1998. Once again the bills were passed by the Senate, but with 95 amendments. On 1 April 1998 the government announced that it would reject the amendments in their entirety. The bills were laid aside on 6 April 1998 and thus became potential triggers for a double dissolution election. We do not need to be reminded of the many times we on this side were threatened with that very action during that time and the months following.
Against that background we now arrive at the 1999 bill. The main provisions of the 1999 bill are essentially the same as those contained in the Public Service Bill 1997 and the Public Service Bill 1997 (No. 2). Clause 3 lists the objects of the act, which are to establish an apolitical public service that is efficient and effective in serving the government, the parliament and the Australian public; to provide a legal framework for the effective and fair employment, management and leadership of APS employees; and to establish the rights and obligations of APS employees.
Clause 8 provides that the act has effect subject to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 except, however—and it is important to note—the bill proposes to exclude the operation of the termination of employment provisions of the Workplace Relations Act in the following circumstances: the termination of the appointment of an agency head, the termination of the employment of a Senior Executive Service employee and the machinery of government changes.
Labor's concerns with the government's previous two attempts at legislating in this area have been that they have gone too far in the direction of enhancing the powers of Public Service agency heads and converting their agencies into independent entities with separate procedures and employment conditions. We have also been concerned that the legislation did not go far enough in protecting the independence and professionalism of the Public Service and the working conditions of 
 public servants. Labor has consistently argued that the Public Service is one of the pillars of our system of government, that it is there to serve governments of either political persuasion and that it is incumbent on a government which is proposing profound reform of this institution to at least consult the alternative government. I am pleased that the government has determined to consult on these matters—at last—and it appears that these negotiations have been worth while because the government has agreed to accept our position in the vast majority of instances.
There are, of course, still a few outstanding issues that must be resolved before Labor support is guaranteed. These include the system of appeals against employment decisions in the APS, the circumstances in which employees may be engaged for a specific term or for irregular or intermittent duties and the conditions of employment for APS employees who are affected by machinery of government changes.
Over the past few short years we all—and I particularly in Canberra—have witnessed a sea change in government attitude towards the public sector. There is absolutely no doubt, and I have put this on the record many times, that my colleagues and I prefer to see the Australian Public Service maintain the uniqueness that it has had historically, and that is an incredibly high level of sophistication and professionalism, an undisputed level of ability to serve government of any persuasion at any time it is so called, and an absolute devotion, particularly from those in the decision making area, to do all of those things with full faith and value connected to them.
I look forward to these outstanding issues that I have outlined being resolved and to the continuation of an independent and professional Public Service in Australia. It is something that this country has valued and we must be in a position to continue to value.",REPS,<title>PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I too would like to speak on the Public Service Bill 1999  as well as the Parliamentary Service Bill 1999 . I would like to congratulate the clerks at the table for their usual impassive expressions, even though it might be argued that they are directly affected by this legislation.
Like the Public Service Bill, this Parliamentary Service Bill 1999 has been before the House on two separate occasions, but on this occasion it will be enjoying the support of the opposition. There are a couple of things that I wanted to say about the legislation. Firstly, it is ironic that we have a new bit of parliamentary legislation to fashion a new Parliamentary Service for our employees but, unlike the Senate, this House cannot come to grips with setting up a staffing and appropriations committee so that there is some oversight of the exercise of responsibilities by the permanent head of the Department of the House of Representatives, the secretary of the department, and the Speaker. The Senate has for many years had a staffing and appropriations committee. I think presiding officers of both persuasions would indicate that, rather than being a hindrance to the presiding officer, the operations of the committee have been of great assistance, particularly when the presiding officers need to confront the Department of Finance and Administration or PM&C.
I find it ironic, in an era that is demanding more accountability, more transparency of operations, that this House cannot form a staffing and appropriations committee. I think it is an absolutely ludicrous position that members of the House find themselves in, and I would argue that would be a small but important reform. If we are going to embrace this bit of legislation for those that work for us, it would be ridiculous not to have the mechanism to involve ordinary members of the parliament in an overseeing and advising role to the Presiding Officers and to the Clerk.
This is not a Labor Party proposition; this was first proposed in the report of a committee chaired by Senator Jessop going back to the seventies. He always envisaged that with the establishment of a Senate staffing and appropriations committee there would be a House staffing and appropriations committee and that, when we were looking at the three other joint departments, we would be sitting together. I would urge all honourable members to again contemplate the wisdom of Senator Jessop in his report in the seventies. Surely we have had time to digest the sugges 
 tion by now and to come up with a view about whether or not this is an appropriate thing for the House to do.
I am very pleased that we are still providing for mobility between those that serve this House and the parliament and the rest of the Public Service. I think there is great utility and great value in having people broaden their experience outside of the parliament. I know that, for example, those departmental officers who come in and service committees get a great deal of benefit from it. But I also believe—and we have had some examples of this—that officers of this parliament going into Public Service departments for a time and gaining a degree of experience is quite worth while.
I also hope, with the passage of this legislation, that we will be able to adopt a scheme that I have been very fond of, and that is enhancing the brain power of the parliamentary committees. In doing that, it would be offering short-term appointments to graduates so that we would have a graduate being appointed to a parliamentary committee for no longer than, say, 12 or 18 months, with the committee being able to utilise that graduate. In turn, the graduate would get the experience of working in the parliament, working for a parliamentary committee, being able to put that on their CV and of course applying for the job that they might ultimately aspire to.
Mr Speaker, I sincerely hope that, with the passage of this legislation, you and the Clerk of the House might be able to sit down and see whether or not you now have the flexibility to provide such a category of service for our young graduates. I am sure that they would welcome the opportunity. I regret to say that, whereas going to a university and getting a degree once meant that you were automatically going to find a job, that is no longer the case. More than a third of graduates are unemployed in the April after they have graduated. So I am sure that there would be a lot of graduates that would be very keen to take up such a 12-month or 18-month appointment with a committee. It would not take a lot of money—they would not require a lot of money—and it just might help them 
 get to the ultimate job that they are aspiring to.
I want to say a few things about the Public Service Bill. One of the areas that this bill covers is the termination of permanent heads of or secretaries to departments. We have had a recent example of that, I regret to say, with Mr Paul Barratt, who was the permanent head of the Department of Defence. I have to put on the record that it appears to be a great tragedy that, at the time of the deployment of Australia's largest force for peacekeeping operations, a major preoccupation of the Minister for Defence was not with the evolving situation in Timor but rather with the dismissal of his permanent head. The Labor Party does not argue that, if there were a conflict between the minister and his permanent head, ultimately the permanent head would have to go. However, there is an issue of procedural fairness. This was adjudicated on by the Federal Court and it said that, notwithstanding the powers of termination, permanent heads were entitled to procedural fairness.
It must be one of the great ironies in this particular case that Mr Barratt had received a bonus a few months before his sacking, presumably for exemplary conduct as a permanent head, not only fulfilling his responsibilities to the minister but working closely with the chief of the defence forces and providing the important leadership that these two people provide to one of the most important departments that we have in the federal sphere. Notwithstanding this bonus and notwithstanding the fact that the permanent head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Moore-Wilton, adjudged that this was an exemplary officer, he was terminated. Again I have to say that it is a matter of extreme regret to me that, at a time when the situation in East Timor was unfolding, the preoccupation of the minister appeared to be the termination of his permanent head, not the situation in East Timor.
It is on the record that the Minister for Defence was not having his phone calls returned by General Wiranto. That must have been a first in the administration of this particular portfolio. Given that situation, 
 whatever rapport Mr Barratt must have built up within our region and within the Department of Defence in Indonesia, clearly he was not in a position, given the cloud he was under, to exercise the normal person to person contacts that Defence had so heavily built up both on the civilian side and on the uniform side.
Mr Speaker, there are some other matters that I wish to respectfully bring to your attention. I suppose it is very fashionable to criticise the Public Service. As a former employee of the Post-Master General's Office and Telstra, one might say I have a vested interest in it. But I want to freely acknowledge, as a member of parliament, the great rapport I have had with public servants in my electorate—for example, Gail Permanoff at Centrelink. She is a great officer working under most difficult circumstances. She was with the former Department of Social Security and has been most helpful in getting an innovative employment program going in my electorate. I have a lot to do with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Overwhelmingly, I must report great help and great courtesy in all the matters that I have brought before them—and I do bring an awful lot before them. I can only be complementary in relation to the task they undertake.
The role of the Public Service in a democracy is absolutely vital. They are professional people who are there to implement the wishes of their ministers and the legislation passed by the parliament, often in most difficult circumstances. Let me give you another example—the Child Support Agency. No-one has been more critical than I have of the performance of the Child Support Agency, but I must congratulate the Penrith office. We had a seminar in my electorate where they wanted to talk about the changes that the government had recently passed. I did not think that the changes went far enough but, in the spirit of wanting to reach out to their clients, I was more than delighted to accept the role of chairing the meeting and introducing the speakers.
They had the forethought to have not only some officers from their own agency speak 
 but also people from Legal Aid and from the Sydney City Mission to talk about budgeting. The whole exercise went very well. Child support, when it was under Treasury, could be said to have had an implementation role as far as policy was concerned, but the Department of Social Security, now the Department of Family and Community Services, had the policy. Now they are under that one department and hopefully that agency, because of their direct experience in dealing with clients, will have a much greater input into the policy area.
It is absolutely vital that we encourage a Public Service that is professional, that is competent, that is efficient and that is prepared to give honest advice to the ministers of the day. It does not matter whether they are conservative ministers or Labor ministers, the advice should be impartial. Some might say that some of the trends that have been set in place are designed to militate against that. If that is the case, we have a serious problem. No institution should be immune from change or immune from adaptation or immune from accountability. I do not argue that. But I do argue for an impartial, apolitical, professional and efficient Public Service.
There has been a great trend towards outsourcing. That has basically been a private enterprise led initiative. We are seeing a lot of it, and we are also seeing it in the Public Service. Like a lot of management fashions, I think that will actually come a circle, because in private enterprise ultimately enterprises will understand that they are losing some of the controls they require on the quality of service and the responsiveness to service. You can have agreements but I do not think you can get other organisations to implement with the same concern, care and passion in relation to customers that you yourself as an organisation would. I think you will see, as we move on in time, that gradually some of these functions are going to be drawn back into enterprises.
There were a lot of other things I wanted to say about this bill. The salaries of members of parliament are involved in it. As you are aware, Mr Whitlam, when he was Prime Minister, instituted the Remuneration Tribu 
 nal. The idea behind this was to take the politics out of MP salaries and to stop MPs from the shocking practice of voting on their own increases so that you have an open and transparent process where members were not directly involved in setting their own salaries.
In the Labor government, the decision was taken to fix MP salaries to the lower salary range of level 2 in the Senior Executive Service. Because of changes that have occurred in Public Service pay, it is now not possible to identify that particular salary band and there has been absolutely no movement in it. Part of the process involved in this bill and the amendments that are about to be moved is that the Remuneration Tribunal is going to be asked to fix MP salaries on the basis of a principal executive officer's classification, which the Remuneration Tribunal deals with. Of course they deal with a whole range of other salaries for people like judges, conciliation commissioners, permanent heads and chairmen of boards of government organisations. It will be up to the Remuneration Tribunal to determine these.
The opposition is very keen that there continues to be an openness and transparency in the setting of members' salaries. I particularly welcome that. I note that, notwithstanding the opposition's fundamental belief in the rectitude of what it is doing, whatever the Remuneration Tribunal decides will be criticised by a whole range of people, some of whom have been found to take money for giving good opinions of different organisations. I do not think they will be able to resist the temptation to criticise the Remuneration Tribunal. In our democracy, it is somewhat out of kilter when you have a minister—such as Minister Kemp, who is at the table—receiving less money than his permanent head. That is absolutely absurd in terms of the responsibilities. That is not to have a go at permanent heads but to say that I think this is a silly approach.
In relation to parliamentary secretaries—and I note the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration is at the table—it is absurd that they take on their duties without any remuneration whatsoever. If those parliamentary secretaries happen to be 
 a whip, a chief whip or a chairman of a committee, they take a drop in salary. Most states have followed the lead of the Commonwealth in utilising the position of junior minister—the parliamentary secretary's role. In my own state the remuneration of parliamentary secretaries is something like $15,000 a year. A Commonwealth parliamentary secretary receives nothing; a state parliamentary secretary receives about $15,000 per annum.
I hope that the government will look at the situation of parliamentary secretaries. It is a bit too late for me, but justice is on their side. I sincerely hope that the government will look at the impediments to providing emoluments for parliamentary secretaries. I understand the arguments about section 44. At the very least, I would argue that parliamentary secretaries should get the same ministerial gold card entitlement that ministers do, but in any event there is a need for some salary justice.

"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—I would like to take this opportunity to make some final comments on the Public Service Bill 1999 . First of all, I thank all members for their contribution to this debate. What we are achieving here today is a very good outcome. It is a very important and significant step forward in the reform of the Public Service. It is a good outcome for government, a good outcome for public servants and a good outcome for the Australian people.
The Public Service Bill represents the biggest overhaul and reform of the Australian Public Service in more than 75 years. The bill as originally proposed was described by Alan Kohler as `one of the great pieces of government employee legislation—simple, clear and powerful.' The Public Service Bill will move the Australian Public Service away from the constraints of a lengthy and prescriptive act to a new framework where employment powers are held directly by agency heads. It reflects the contemporary realities of the Australian Public Service and will provide a sound basis for moving into the new 
 millennium. It is less than one-fifth of the size of the old act. It has been totally rewritten in plain English, making it simpler and easier to follow.
The bill creates much greater flexibility to respond to changing needs by replacing detailed prescription with principles. The bill provides a sound basis for the enterprise based approach of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 by giving agency heads full power to engage staff as well as the power, subject to the workplace relations framework, to determine their remuneration and terms and conditions of employment.
The government's reforms aim to address the problems of overcentralisation, excessive prescription in the management and procedures of the workplace, inadequate focus on the customer and failure to manage to world's best standards. The government remains committed to an Australian Public Service which embraces the best practice in contemporary management and is able to benchmark its performance against other sectors both in Australia and overseas.
The government, and indeed the Australian public, expects the APS to be a modern and efficient employer. We are therefore seeking reforms which enable APS agencies and their staff to develop the most appropriate arrangements for the management of each agency and, consequently, to contribute to a forward looking and high performing organisation.
In the development of this bill, the government has sought reasonable compromise and bipartisan support. The government recognises that significant legislative reform is vital, so in the spirit of forging ahead with reforming the APS, we have continued to press for new legislation to replace the Public Service Act 1922. It was in this spirit that we talked to the opposition about ways to move forward. The government acknowledges that there has been some constructive consideration and negotiation on the issues, and that the ALP has not pressed many of its original amendments and has reconsidered others.
The government would have much preferred the bill in its original form—for its brevity, its simplicity and its focus on principles. The amendments, while not significantly altering 
 the substance of the original bill, contain in our view some unnecessary detail and prescription. The bottom line, however, is that at no point is the amended bill more restrictive than the present arrangements and it maintains or enhances the government's current position as an employer and manager. Importantly, the amendments to the bill have been agreed to by both the government and the opposition in the interests of progressing tangible change.
The government has been prepared to accept amendments. We have not achieved everything we wanted. We would have preferred different practices in some areas. Nevertheless, we believe the bill in the form in which we expect it to be amended represents a significant step forward in the organisation of public administration in this country.	I would like to say that the government has appreciated the approach taken by the opposition in discussions on the proposed content of the bill. I appreciate that this has been a difficult issue within the Labor Party, and the government recognises that. On previous occasions when the original bill was presented, it was made clear by the opposition that much of the bill's content was not negotiable. It would be fair to say that a bipartisan realisation has been reached that it is in the interests of government as a whole to achieve an employment framework that capitalises on the real potential of our public sector.
I would like to acknowledge and thank a few people whose contributions have been instrumental in achieving today's outcome. I would first of all like to thank my opposite number in the opposition, Senator Faulkner, and his senior adviser, George Thompson. I would like to acknowledge also Dr Peter Shergold, as the then Public Service Commissioner and now Secretary to the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, who was involved from the development of the reform process and the Public Service Bill. I would like to acknowledge the work of the Public Service Commissioner, Helen Williams, and the Deputy Public Service Commissioner, Peter Kennedy, whose expert advice has been essential in reaching the agreements on the amendments that we now have. There have been many staff in the 
 Public Service and Merit Protection Commission and the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business who have been involved in this legislation over a very long period of time, many from the beginning of the process some three years ago. I would particularly like to single out Jeff Lamond, who has been tireless in monitoring the development of the process and providing advice, and Kate Bosser who, again, has been associated with the process for a long time and whose expert advice has been greatly valued.
I would like to thank my adviser on public service matters, Clayton Ford, who has been working on the bill now for some two years. I think that both Senator Faulkner and I would probably acknowledge that, without the assistance of people in our offices who have become really expert in this legislation, we would not have been able to bring this process to what I believe will be a successful completion. I want to also acknowledge the very real and significant achievements of the Australian Public Service in pursuing change and responding to the challenges offered by the new environment over the last couple of years. I know that that will continue with the implementation of the new act. Indeed, the very degree and speed of that responsiveness is a clear demonstration of the quality of the Public Service and its professionalism, and there will be a very positive reaction throughout the Public Service to the final passage of this legislation, which will provide clarity and a framework within which, I know, a great many in the Public Service are looking forward to working.
The principal areas where amendments have been agreed include a number designed to enhance transparency and accountability. Any direction issued by the Prime Minister to agency heads must be published in the Commonwealth Gazette. Where the Merit Protection Commissioner is not satisfied with any agency's response to a report on a review, the Merit Protection Commissioner may report on the matter to the agency minister and either or both the Prime Minister or the presiding officers for presentation to the parliament. 
The amendments also deal with certain employment matters. An agency head will not be able to terminate the employment of a senior executive service employee unless the Public Service Commissioner has issued a certificate stating that all relevant requirements have been satisfied and the commissioner is of the opinion that the termination is in the public interest. For each remuneration determination made by the minister responsible in respect of salary for the Public Service Commissioner, Merit Protection Commissioner, secretary or head of an executive agency, the minister will be required to seek the advice of the Remuneration Tribunal and to take that advice into account. In addition, each determination made by the minister must be published in the Commonwealth Gazette.
The government is well aware of the need to move the matter forward in order to achieve further progress in improving public administration. We have pursued negotiations because of the importance of achieving legislative reform in order to achieve essential change. This bill is a vast improvement on the 1922 legislation in terms of both content and language. For some time, the government has been critical of the current act's highly complex and technical language, which promotes a legalistic approach to managing people. The bill is altogether more accessible and understandable. It will provide a clear legal framework for an APS employment that achieves an optimal balance between improved accountability and devolved responsibility so as to maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the APS. It will guide the Commonwealth system of public service into the next century and enable the APS to achieve its full potential.
Significantly, the bill also articulates the distinctive character of Australia's public service and parliament's expectation of it in a way that is absent in the 1922 act. It sets out the fundamental values of the APS and enshrines and protects them through primary legislation. The bill clearly sets down the important values and culture the parliament wants in the Australian Public Service and the role, powers and accountability of agency heads and their relationship to ministers in a 
 clear and public way. It is a clear statement to those within the APS and to the Australian people of the conduct that is expected of public servants and enhanced evaluation through significant new inquiry and reporting powers for the Public Service Commissioner.
The bill explicitly acknowledges that the APS is to be apolitical, fulfilling its functions in an impartial, non-partisan and professional manner. For the first time, legislation will prevent ministers becoming involved in individual staffing decisions. Importantly, it provides for the APS to be openly accountable for its actions within the framework of ministerial responsibility to the government, the parliament and the Australian public. The government recognises that the evaluation of reform is crucial to maintaining and upgrading its effectiveness. Accordingly, there will be ongoing review of the operation of the new legislation, including its implementation, and where problems are identified these will be rectified through amendments.
This Public Service Bill is a very important piece of legislation. It sets a firm foundation for a high performance APS. It provides the groundwork for the APS to achieve its full potential. The agreed package will allow for a dynamic and flexible public service, which is vital for good government and effective delivery of quality services to the public. We are all aware of the extent of the challenges, and I look forward to the achievement of the reform objectives for the benefit of all Australians.

"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—I do not propose to give a lengthy speech on the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1999 . As members are aware, this is a bill that amends other pieces of legislation which are affected by the passage of the Public Service Bill 1999 . It affects some other matters that have been raised in the course of the debate, but I do not propose to make any further comment upon them.

Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.",REPS,<title>PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT (CONSEQUENTIAL AND TRANSITIONAL) AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1
"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—I am delighted to have the opportunity to continue my remarks on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 , which I commenced on 2 September. It has been some time since I wound up on this issue. It would be my fervent hope that the opposition could agree with the government on this bill as they have agreed to the three bills which we have just 
 considered—that is, the Public Service Bill 1999, the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1999  and the Parliamentary Service Bill 1999 . This has been an example of the government and the opposition working together to achieve an outcome, albeit over a year too late. Nonetheless, an outcome was achieved. I compliment the opposition on their sensible approach to an outcome and I compliment the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs on working with the opposition to reach agreement on these issues. I wish that the opposition would agree with the government on this series of amendments which we now propose to the workplace relations legislation.
As I said in my opening remarks, this bill is all about an evolving market for employment and evolving practices. On 23 April 1996, the then Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating—the former member for Blaxland—went to the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne and basically talked about three things in relation to what we then called industrial relations. He talked about reducing the award system down to its basic parameters so that all the miscellaneous agreements between employees and employers could be left to employees and their employers and only the basic issues would be left to awards. He proposed that there be non-union agreements—what we know today as workplace agreements. He also proposed that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—which we propose to call the Australian Workplace Relations Commission—be a court, if you will, of final resort.
Then in opposition, we did not disagree with the member for Blaxland and his 23 April 1996 speech to the Institute of Company Directors. In fact, we agreed. We might have gone a bit further in a few instances, but we thought that he was headed in the right direction. He told his then Minister for Industrial Relations, the member for Kingsford-Smith, to go forth and propagate and make it happen. I have to give the member for Kingsford-Smith the credit that he tried. Unfortunately, he ran up against a whole gaggle of union chiefs who said no because Paul Keating had forgotten to confer with them and 
 they did not agree to deregulate the labour market.
As a result, we did not have agreement between the then opposition and then government, or today's government and today's opposition. So here we are again in conflict over a bill that really ought to be at the heart of what all of us believe in. It was the Australian Labor Party that time and time again brought to this place deregulation of our borders, that is, reduction in tariffs and reduction in limits on what could come into this country. But they forgot to also modernise the Australian labour market and they left it regulated at a time of deregulation of the real economy. This dichotomy has finally been addressed by this side of politics. This bill is simply one more step on the long-term path to getting us to a point where we all know we have to be—including the honourable member at the table, the member for Batman, notwithstanding that he was a president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
—And a good one too.
—He used to speak to me—I have to say that. You never did. This bill is about a range of things. I talked about some of them in my opening remarks. I talked about improving the position of workplace agreements, that is, about them becoming the primary focus of workplace relations legislation, both for Australian workplace agreements and certified agreements in terms of award simplification. I talked about retaining the right of limited protected industrial action but finally introducing secret ballots, which is something I have been talking about for a very long time. I talked about the award system and the ARC being retained with a name change but modernised. We do not need a 100-year-old institution in Australia any more as part of the club to regulate Australian industrial relations. Then I had started talking about voluntary mediation services.
This is one of the best, most modern ideas to come forward from this side of the House. I sincerely wish that the opposition would listen to this proposal for voluntary mediation services because it has a great deal of merit. The compulsion in mediation simply sets forces which are on opposite sides of an argu 
 ment against each other and determined in a court-like atmosphere to seek a court-like outcome. As we know, courts are adversarial in nature, as is this House. But were people of goodwill given the opportunity, time and time again they could reach agreement away from the adversarial atmosphere. And here is an opportunity, a voluntary mediation service to replace compulsory arbitration. That is part of what this bill is all about. I commend it to honourable members.
Another issue that I want to address in terms of this bill is about tightening the compliance network. It seems to me that for far too long too many, for too many reasons, have been allowed to go their merry way, notwithstanding what legislation said. I cite my old industry, the building and construction industry in Victoria, as an excellent example of why this legislation is important. The  Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999  guarantees for the first time in Australia's history, voluntary membership of association, and this is an issue with which I have been associated for the entirety of my parliamentary life.
It is true to say that this new legislation is an attempt to make sure that those rules and regulations, which were totally intended in the Workplace Relations Bill, are finally in force because in the state of Victoria, as an example, far too many companies simply agree with far too many union bosses that there will be uniform compliance throughout the industry and that those employers who have employees who are not members of the union will be kept out of the work force, will be disallowed the opportunity to be subcontractors, disallowed the opportunity to be suppliers, will have their contracts cancelled and made meaningless because of the power of a few union bosses.
—What, the AMA?
—No. Let's not try the AMA.
—They are the most powerful union in the country.
—No. There is, as there has been for far too long, such a strong union presence in Victoria, dominating the building 
 and construction industry, that individuals have no opportunity to express their own desires. So those who do not wish to be members of a union are forced to become members or else their employer is held to account by the union itself. That is wrong and we all know it is wrong. There should be voluntary membership, which we guarantee to people should they want to join, and voluntary non-membership should people not wish to join.
Unfair dismissals are also addressed in this bill. The government has continuously pushed to try to get reasonable legislation in to give small business an opportunity to hire whom they want and to expand employment in this country. It wants voluntary membership with increased accountability. This bill takes into account the interests of small business, which means increased employment for Australians.
This bill offers a better balance between regulation and market forces, which all of us applaud. If the opposition were to wake up, they would come on board and support the legislation as they have the last three bills. (Time expired)
—Before calling the honourable member for Batman, I remind the honourable member for Banks that if he really wants to make a contribution he might put himself on the speakers list. I congratulate the honourable member for La Trobe for ignoring the interjections of the honourable member for Banks.",REPS,"<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MORE JOBS, BETTER PAY) BILL 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—If one had listened to the contribution from the member for La Trobe one would have thought that industrial relations does not matter and that it is just a debate about ideology. I reject that proposition. I rise this evening to speak in support of the amendment to the second reading moved by the member for Brisbane, the shadow minister for industrial relations. In doing so, I clearly state that, from our side of the House, we believe that the industrial relations framework matters. It has important effects on our economy and our society. It affects the wages and conditions of employees and the employment and productivity levels of firms. It also affects the 
 quality of our working lives and the control we have over our working lives.
We have to understand that decisions made in the industrial relations field are invariably trade-offs. They are often decisions which mean that someone gains and someone loses. That is the harsh reality but the reality nonetheless. Where this does not hold, and where there are genuine opportunities for win-win arrangements, we must exploit those opportunities as a priority. It is unfortunate that the government is not prepared to be open to the possibilities in this respect.
Given that this bill and the government's broader agenda are not about exploiting the potential gains of workplace cooperation, we must ask ourselves who gains and who loses under this bill, because that is the crux of the debate. I believe that the answer is simple. The workers, once again, are copping the brunt of what the government is calling labour market flexibility. The workers are copping the brunt of what the government is calling choice.
The Howard government is not interested in labour market flexibility or in choice. It is interested in ideology as outlined in the contribution by the member for La Trobe this evening. Alternatively I must say that when you think about ideology, it is normally we on this side of the House who are criticised for fighting against ideology. But this is an ideology that has at its core the demise of workers' rights in this country. It has at its core the breaking down of the institutions that stand to protect workers, be they unions or the Industrial Relations Commission, the independent organisation that has so long served this country so well.
The problems we face in the labour market give rise to major social costs that are so high that few observers could deny the need to do something. This is particularly so when we observe that the worst off are laden with a disproportionate share of the burden.
The problems of the labour market are social problems as much as economic problems. We must recognise that solutions which seek to rip our social fabric apart are not solutions at all. What happens in the workplace clearly affects our economy, the lives of 
 individuals and the life of our society. As with any area of policy, industrial relations must balance efficiency and fairness. We must look at the characteristics and trends of the modern labour market honestly and openly.
I am disappointed when I look to this bill for I see nothing but ideology. There is no real debate or suggestion about how we would create a greater sense of fairness, equity or improved productivity at the workplace. For that very reason, I want to examine the context in which this bill has been introduced. The minister has developed a bad habit of distorting the truth. In particular, I want to comment on a few claims floating around from the other side of the House regarding the performance of our labour market. Let us deal with facts for a change rather than ideology.
The minister says that his first wave assault on the Australian work force has given us economic growth, investment, more jobs and improved productivity. According to the Treasury, economic growth has actually slowed under the coalition compared with Labor's last term. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, growth in investment has dropped off significantly. According to the ABS again, Labor's employment growth was 60 per cent stronger than the coalition's. According to the Productivity Commission, the gains that Labor achieved in productivity growth in its last term have not been replicated by the coalition government.
I call on the government to try to refute these assertions. They are assertions that come not from Labor but from the Treasury, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Productivity Commission. Let us move beyond this nonsense that we have been hearing about the positive effects of the first wave, because the reality is that if the first wave has not drowned Australian workers, the second wave will.
I have also heard the assertion that this government has not succeeded because it was not allowed to go far enough in 1996. They say that if only Labor and the Democrats would allow the government to have its way, we would see the benefits, or so the story goes. I am sure that we will hear it from the member for Makin in the very near future. 
 Let us also think about that: if only they were allowed to have their way.  
They often used to talk about New Zealand. After all, they believed New Zealand got its way back in 1991, almost a decade ago. Until recently, this was the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business's baby. The New Zealanders implemented what he wanted to do—what he saw as the ideal model for reform of industrial relations in Australia. It is a bit like the way he used to talk about waterfront reform but, when it comes to so-called changes and benefits for those who use the waterfront coming out of his attack on waterfront workers, all of a sudden he has lost his tongue. In the same way, I have not heard the minister refer to New Zealand recently.
I will remind the House of a few facts concerning the New Zealand experience—the minister's baby. They deregulated the labour market in a more radical manner than even Margaret Thatcher did in Great Britain. They stripped workers' rights and conditions, they stripped their independent umpire's ability to protect the vulnerable, they stripped union powers to represent workers, they made industrial action almost impossible, they attacked the minimum wage safety net and they cut welfare in the name of work incentives. In short, they did what the minister wanted to do. The next time he claims this is not his agenda or the next time the Prime Minister says that, I would ask people to look at what the two of them have said about industrial relations throughout their political lives.
I suppose it is a bit like being reminded today of what the Prime Minister said, not all that long ago, about Indonesia and the Labor Party's attitude to changes in Indonesia. One's past statements come back to haunt one from time to time. When the government claim that this is not about balancing the interests of the workers on the industrial relations front and the employers, I suggest you compare what business groups say they want the government to do and what the government are trying to do. When one does that comparison, it becomes very clear who butters the government's bread.
On reflection, what we can say about the effects of the Reith agenda in New Zealand is as follows. It was claimed that unemployment would be reduced, but New Zealand's unemployment rate today is higher than Australia's. It was claimed that labour productivity would improve in New Zealand. I urge the House to compare New Zealand's labour productivity in the 1990s with that of Australia—it does not stack up too well. It was claimed that the cuts to welfare in New Zealand would not hurt people, but we saw a massive increase in poverty, in association with Australia taking many thousands of New Zealand workers into its own work force—thereby actually subsidising New Zealand's mistakes through the taxpayers' contribution to social security and employment.
The rhetoric of choice saw widening wage inequality. Real wages increased at the top end and fell at the bottom end. All of this was predictable and all of it was avoidable. It is now claimed that this path is the only way forward for the Australian workplace. Labor rejects that claim and rejects it absolutely. I note with interest the current international success stories on unemployment. I do not find New Zealand on that list. The Netherlands, Austria and Denmark are all comfortably below five per cent. In each case, what do we find? Their approach to unemployment has been based on social dialogue based on cooperation—a long way from the bill before the House this evening.
I want the Australian community to look at this bill in terms of this government's broader agenda. I want people to think seriously about whether attacking workers' protections, insulting the unemployed, slashing labour market assistance and slashing investments in education and training are the answers to our labour market problems. I want the Australian community to think seriously about whether this is the sort of society we want to live in, because that is the reality we face with the bill before the House this evening. By claiming that the unemployed choose to be unemployed, the government takes its ideology to the extreme. The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business goes as far as to claim that welfare dependency is 
 a bigger cause of unemployment than the level of economic activity. Dreamland stuff!
I ask him to find a single credible economist that agrees with him. I ask him to point to a single piece of economic analysis that supports his contention. This is political manipulation of the lowest order; he should know better. The biggest barrier most unemployed people face is not welfare, but a lack of skills. The solution is not the `job snobs' label but the opportunity that stems from education and training. It is about a cooperative workplace that encourages a partnership based on cooperation, improved productivity and training—reasonable outcomes; a win-win for all.
For that very reason, I also refer to the fact that the government claimed that Labor was spending too much on assisting the unemployed into work, so they slashed labour market employment and training programs. They now claim that under the new Job Network they are working harder to get people into jobs. Let us have look at this claim. Between November 1993 and May 1996, under Labor's programs the number of very long-term unemployed—that is, over 24 months unemployed—fell by 70,000. But since the coalition began to slash funding, there has been an increase in the number of very long-term unemployed—three years later that number has increased. We are talking about the most vulnerable in the labour market. We are talking about facts. We are talking about the figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics—not the Labor Party, not the ACTU, but the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
The next time they talk or look to economic prosperity, the disadvantaged in the labour market are entitled to ask where their share has gone. If we were to take into account the drop in the participation rate as people give up hope and stop looking for work, the figures would be even worse. The rate has dropped by almost one per cent since the election of March 1996. This means people are basically deciding that they have very little hope of finding a job because of a lack of assistance and insufficient jobs growth under the Howard government. This govern 
 ment has, in truth, managed to send shivers up the spine of every insecure worker and every recipient of government benefits. This government has chosen to attack the most vulnerable in our society and to hand out billions to the most fortunate. Robbing from the poor and giving to the rich is the heartless approach of the Howard government.
But I venture to suggest that there is more at stake. For every worker made less secure, for every mature age worker pushed onto a disability support pension and for every one of our children allowed to grow up without educational opportunity, we undermine the very notion of shared responsibility. That is the notion that underpins society. That is the notion of reciprocal obligation. It is not the notion of the one-way street, the so-called mutual obligation, of the Howard government. What could we expect?
Before us is the government's vision for the future of the Australian labour market. We might at least expect some reference to the difficulties facing ordinary workers and workplaces: worker insecurity, the struggle of the low skilled to keep up, casualisation, no opportunity for workplace participation and limited control over working lives. The problem is that this is a one-dimensional bill based on ideology and a very poor conception of the dynamics of the labour market. That is why the Melbourne Institute is right in saying that the minister's main game is the wrong game. It is why prominent lawyers are right when they say that this bill is grossly unfair. It is why the churches and the community organisations who care for society's vulnerable are right when they speak up—not to be denigrated but encouraged to speak up—and voice their concerns.
Under the Howard government we have seen growing inequality among workers which has been accentuated by budget cuts that hurt the poor the most and which will be further accentuated by tax changes that will benefit the rich the most, including many members of the Howard government's frontbench. If there is one lesson to be learnt from the history of Australian industrial relations, it is that fairness matters. The minister may seek to deny that, the government may seek to deny that, 
 but ordinary Australians know that fairness matters. Just ask the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett.
The minister speaks the language of labour market flexibility. The symbolic force of flexibility relies on the positive association we make with the ideal of flexibility. After all, to oppose flexibility is to appear rigid and conservative. In practice, though, labour market flexibility has had one aim: to increase the ability of employers to have their way. It is about employers having their way without the need to consult either external standards, in the form of tribunals or legislation, or internal standards, whether unions or workers. The fact that we live in a society that does have standards is something to take pride in, not something to try to tear down. Labour market flexibility is sometimes couched in terms of the ability of business to adapt to changing circumstances. The ability of business to adapt depends on two things in particular: the adaptability of the work force, in which we must invest; and cooperation in the work force, which only comes from leadership, encouragement and support. It does not come from a heavy hand or a bludgeon, as is the Howard way. I do not see this bill improving skills and consultation in Australian work forces and workplaces.
I now turn my attention briefly to some specifics of the bill. The bill has three fundamental flaws: it undermines the role of the commission, it seeks to undermine the safety net and it pursues neither efficiency nor fairness. The major problem I have with this bill is that it seeks to undermine independence. You would think the coalition might have learnt something from their Victorian state colleagues about what people think of a lack of accountability and independence in our public institutions.
The minister wants to control who is in the commission and what they are allowed to think. Instead of an independent commission conciliating or arbitrating, parties must do it themselves. For those with little bargaining power, that means not at all. Of course you can pay to see a mediator, but it has to be one that is approved by the new Mediation Adviser. And who appoints the Mediation Adviser? 
 The minister—just as he appointed the Industrial Registrar, one of his former employees, and the Employment Advocate, another of his mates. The secrecy of individual agreements would be made worse because you would no longer need the approval of the commission, which is independent. You now need only the approval of the Employment Advocate, the minister's adviser—the minister's mate.
The second problem I have with this bill is that it seeks to undermine the safety net. Further award matters will be removed, including those that are not incidental. Incidental matters are those which are `essential and necessary to the operation of the award'. But they will no longer be allowed. Awards that have not been simplified, regardless of the reason, cannot have the safety net—a minimum wage increase—applied to them. This is at a time when the safety net adjustment is likely to be higher than before as workers fight to maintain real wage growth in the face of the inflationary impact of the GST—another attack on workers. It is those without bargaining power who will again be hit the hardest. They will get no increases and will see their real wages fall significantly.
Finally, I want to ask the question: does fairness still matter? This bill makes it even harder to make an unfair dismissal claim. It undermines workers rights to be represented effectively while limiting rights of entry and cracking down on those workplaces that choose to be unionised. It undermines the right to strike by requiring a secret ballot and by extending the penalties involved. If this bill were really about fairness, it would contain more about the issues workers are worried about. But none of those issues are covered in this bill, because it is based on nothing other than ideology—and inferior ideology at that.
Meanwhile the issues Australians really care about—worker insecurity, the low skilled falling behind, casualisation, the lack of retraining opportunities for older workers and the difficulty faced by those seeking to balance work and family life—go unattended. I urge the Australian community, on the basis of the debate that will occur in this House, to actually put in a submission to the Senate 
 inquiry into the legislation, to go along, have its say and voice its concerns. If the so-called Reith's second wave is not stopped, fairness and equity will be destroyed in Australian workplaces. The opportunities for workers to actually engage in decent training and enjoy fair wages and conditions of employment, which in turn will improve their employability and create greater employment opportunities over time, will be destroyed. The independence of the Industrial Relations Commission will be destroyed. I commend the second reading amendment of the member for Brisbane to the House. (Time expired)",REPS,"<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MORE JOBS, BETTER PAY) BILL 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,1999-09-27,"—I am pleased to speak in support of the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 —a bill which I know will create more security and more opportunities for the people in my electorate of Makin. I refute absolutely all that has been stated by the previous speaker, the member for Batman. This bill implements our policy on workplace relations, which we took to the last election and which was also entitled More Jobs, Better Pay. This bill is a very practical and down-to-earth piece of legislation. It is based on what is fair and what has been shown to work.
The bill is also the culmination of a long debate in this country about the nature of our industrial relations system and discussion about how we can achieve the twin goals of lower unemployment and higher productivity and real wages for workers. At every stage of that debate, the Labor Party have had to be dragged kicking and screaming. When we first began to say in the early 1980s that there should be more bargaining for wages and conditions at the enterprise level, the then Labor government cried out that we were espousing a right-wing ideological agenda. But eventually they started to move quietly and cautiously in that direction. Unfortunately, they were still captive to the peak union bodies in Australia that were more interested in maintaining their own position in the system than in achieving better outcomes for their members.
We started to have some sort of enterprise bargaining, but there were still union preference clauses, there were still closed shops and 
 there were still not enough opportunities for workers to participate in the decisions in the workplace. In the 1996 election the coalition produced a policy that said we should have genuine enterprise bargaining with an opportunity for employers and employees to write their own contracts by way of Australian workplace agreements. We said that workers should not be discriminated against just because they chose not to join a union. We proposed legislation to make closed shops a thing of the past.
Again, the Labor Party cried that we were running some sort of ideological agenda. They declared that it would not work, that wages would go down, that strikes would increase. But, in fact, history now records that exactly the opposite occurred. In 1997, following the introduction of the Workplace Relations Act, industrial disputes were the cause of only 75 working days lost per thousand employees. This was the lowest number since 1913, the first year in which records were kept. In 1998 that number fell even further to 72 working days lost per thousand employees.
This result is all the more remarkable because it occurred in a climate of rising real wages and falling unemployment. Since the election of this government, real wages for a full-time adult employee have grown by nine per cent. This is nine per cent in three years, by the way, compared with just 4.7 per cent over the entire 13 years of the Labor government. At the same time, unemployment has fallen to seven per cent from the high of over 11 per cent that occurred under the previous government.
We have a plan and our plan works. Our plan has reduced industrial disputation, reduced unemployment and increased real wages. Our plan for the future is to deliver even more jobs and even better pay by the measures proposed in this bill. This bill will make jobs more secure and more plentiful, give workers more of a say in their own pay and conditions and enable employers and employees to work together free from any intimidation.
Part of the intent of this bill is to amend the objects of the Workplace Relations Act in a number of specific ways: to emphasise the 
 proper safety net role of awards; to refer to the role played by the Industrial Relations Commission, which in this bill will become the Australian Workplace Relations Commission, in preventing and stopping unprotected industrial action; and to recognise a role for mediation as an option available for dispute resolution. It is important to make the point that awards are there to ensure that there is a minimum standard of wages and conditions to which all Australian workers are entitled. Awards should not dictate chapter and verse what happens in individual workplaces. Matters such as tallies, jury service, union picnic days and trade union training leave are matters that can and should be worked out at the workplace level.
The other point I have mentioned is the recognition the bill contains of the role that mediation can play in resolving industrial disputes. This would occur on a voluntary basis and could supplement or be an alternative to the role of the commission. Voluntary mediation along these lines has a potential to be enormously valuable to employers and employees. It is all about creating a more cooperative workplace culture with employers and employees working together towards mutually satisfying goals.
It is envisaged that mediation would be most effective in resolving differences related to the negotiation of enterprise agreements, as a step in dispute resolution, in cases of serious or protracted industrial action and where the parties to an agreement have made provision for mediation in their grievance procedures.
The freedom of association provisions which we legislated in our original bill will be strengthened in this bill, closing loopholes which in some cases have continued to allow closed shops and preference for union members over non-union members. This bill also seeks to simplify and streamline the agreement making process. Since we introduced certified agreements and Australian workplace agreements in our original legislation, their performance has been impressive. Over 12,000 certified agreements and 50,000 Australian workplace agreements have been 
 created in the two years since their introduction.
We need to make this process even easier and more flexible to encourage more workplaces to take up these options and reap the benefits. We will seek to simplify the current procedures in a number of ways, including consolidating the requirements for making an AWA into a single provision, removing the requirement for employers to offer identical AWAs to comparable employees, giving the Employment Advocate greater power to request modifications to an agreement where there are concerns about it not meeting the no disadvantage test without the need for that to be referred to the commission at that stage, and fast-tracking approval for AWAs which provide rates of remuneration above $68,000 per year by removing the need for them to be scrutinised by the Employment Advocate before they go before the commission.
The bill will also clarify the interaction between the AWAs and certified agreements by ensuring that the AWAs prevail over certified agreements, either to the extent of any inconsistency or comprehensively. Protected strike action will continue, but certain procedures will have to be observed before such action is protected. In particular, it will have to be preceded by a secret ballot overseen by the commission. Strike action will be protected only if it is approved by a majority of eligible voters out of a quorum of at least 50 per cent of eligible voters. The notice period for notification of an intention to take industrial action will be increased from three to five working days and notification will have to follow a secret ballot of the employees.
I would like to return to what I consider to be the most important aspect of this bill and that is its strengthening of freedom of association provisions. Our original Workplace Relations Act prohibited closed shops and the inclusion of preference clauses in industrial awards and agreements—that is, clauses in which employees who were union members gained preference over employees who were not. That legislation also made it against the law for any employee to be victimised be 
 cause of their membership or non-membership of a union.
Since the passage of that legislation, the task has fallen to the Office of the Employment Advocate to handle complaints about agreements which still contain preference clauses. Under the legislation, these clauses have no standing but their continued existence can lead to confusion and even unlawful conduct by people who may not be aware that such clauses are now illegal. Figures released earlier this year showed that at that stage the Employment Advocate had made 735 applications to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for the removal of these clauses from certified agreements. Of these, 698 had been heard by the commission and in all of these cases the offending clauses were removed.
However, the government has found that in some workplaces there are still instances where indirect arrangements are put in place to effectively continue to give preference to union members. To overcome this, our new legislation will prohibit conduct which breaches freedom of association under the guise of site agreements, require employers to take positive steps to overcome closed shops, and provide a defence to breaches of freedom of association where the conduct complained of was designed to overcome a closed shop. It will prevent from certification agreements which contain clauses to encourage or discourage employees in relation to becoming a union member or which require non-union members to pay a service fee to a union. These new provisions will provide further protection to employees to ensure that their choice to join or to not join a union is theirs and theirs alone.
This bill needs to be seen in the context of other legislation that the government has introduced, all of which has the intent of increasing employment opportunities for all Australians. In particular, we have brought legislation before the parliament to exempt small business from unfair dismissal provisions during the first six months of a person's employment, provided for the retention of junior wage rates in awards and agreements, and removed superannuation from the list of 
 allowable award matters to ensure that employers and employees can enter into more flexible arrangements which suit them. These measures, along with the legislation we are discussing today, if allowed to pass the Senate, will provide significant assistance to small businesses and directly encourage them to take on more employees.
In April last year I made a submission to the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee as it was conducting its inquiry into regional employment and unemployment. In that submission I made the point that there are a total of 71,000 people employed in the northern suburbs of Adelaide and that 50,000 of these are employed by 5,000 businesses, at an average of 10 employees per business. If the profit margins and costs of employing for each of these businesses were such that they were encouraged to employ one extra person, unemployment in my electorate of Makin would be reduced by approximately one-third.
Thankfully, unemployment is on the way down in my electorate, thanks to the initiatives that this government has already put in place. However, we still have some way to go and the measures that we are now proposing would be of enormous benefit to the people in Makin who are still seeking work. This is the ultimate reason for my support for this bill, leaving aside the benefits to small business, the protection to workers and the enhancements of freedom of association. All of these things are important but my most important reason for supporting this bill is that I want to do all that is in my power and in the power of the government to reduce unemployment even further.
This bill will encourage employment in my electorate of Makin because it simplifies agreement making procedures, reduces the bureaucratic burden on our businesses and encourages employers and employees to deal directly with each other to improve productivity and achieve better outcomes for everyone. Employees in my electorate know that they can achieve better outcomes in the workplace. Not only will they be making their own jobs secure; they will be creating extra 
 opportunities for other job seekers. I support this bill, just as I support every job creating initiative that this government has put forward. I applaud Minister Reith and the Prime Minister for their commitment to job creation and for the benefits that this has already had for my electorate of Makin.",REPS,"<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (MORE JOBS, BETTER PAY) BILL 1999</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—I rise tonight to speak in this debate about the rather ill named Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 . Prior to entering this parliament, I worked for eight years as an industrial lawyer within the industrial relations system on behalf of workers and unions. I admit that from that experience I have a biased view. I did not routinely see on display the best in industrial practice, the best employers engaging in modern consultative and fair work practices. Nothing in the legal system tended to bring me into contact with such employers. Rather, the employers I came into contact with were employers being sued by their employees, employers who were subject to action by trade unions. By definition, I saw the problem employers, the employers who by their conduct had created a legal difficulty.
While I know that there are in our community tens of thousands of employers who do the right thing, what needs to be understood in this debate and what cannot be wished away by some political rhetoric about more jobs and better pay is that there are these employers whom I saw—and whom I sued—during those eight years of legal practice: bad employers, shoddy employers and fly-by-night employers who treated like dirt employees who did not have the industrial strength to object.
Perhaps the highest point of the exploitation I saw during those eight years was the exploitation of clothing trades outworkers, abandoned in backrooms and garages, working for a pittance, working night and day, left unpaid on many occasions and subject to physical and verbal intimidation. They were a marginalised work force but a work force of significant size, with approximately 300,000 Australia wide and more than 140,000 working within the state of Victoria alone.
This is not overblown rhetoric for a political speech. I remember clearly the case of an employer who kept his time and wages book in pencil so that, when it was pointed out that he was paying less than the award rate, he produced a rubber and thought that by rubbing out the pencil entries and putting in the right figures that would fix the problem—not one extra cent for the workers ripped off but a beautiful time and wages book.
I remember the outworkers who would be left unpaid as their employer literally disappeared, or the outworkers whose pay would be withheld because of some imagined defect in the clothes that they were making. I remember the outworkers given huge bundles of work and impossible deadlines to meet who would get there only by staying up all night or by getting the teenage kids on the sewing machine as well or by getting the young kids in the household to cut the cotton. I remember the outworkers who worked for one employer for 10 or 12 years, but when you examined their group certificates each and every year the identity of the employer had changed without anybody bothering to advise them. I remember the Vietnamese man, an outworker who lived in the Richmond housing commission flats, who had hired thugs turn up at his flat, threatening him with a beating because he had contacted the union.
While I had direct experience with this sort of exploitation, I am by no means the only person who has been horrified and concerned about this kind of exploitation in our midst. This is a most inquired into area. In April 1987 there was the Report on Areas of Work Without Enforceable Minimum Standards produced by the Committee to Inquire into the Status of Women in Employment in Commerce and Industry and presented to the New South Wales ministers for industrial relations and employment; in September 1989 there was Out of Sight—Out of Mind: Outwork in South Australia by the Working Women's Centre; in March 1995 there was The Hidden Cost of Fashion—Report on the National Outwork Information Campaign by the relevant trade union, the TCFUA; in December 1996 there was Outworkers in the Garment Industry by the Senate Economics 
 References Committee; and in July 1998 there was the Review of the Inquiry into Outworkers in the Garment Industry, once again by the Senate Economics References Committee.
Each of these reports details graphically the exploitation of these workers and our continuing failure to address the issue. Each of these reports says that the problem within our midst is massive, despite the current forms of industrial regulation. And now we turn to consider a bill which would sweep much of that regulation away.
My real-life industrial experience with this area convinced me of two basic principles. Firstly, the true test of an industrial relations system is not how it deals with the industrially strong but how it deals with the industrially weak such as migrant workers, women workers, un-unionised workers, isolated workers, unskilled workers and poorly educated workers who do not have the capacity to fight back. Secondly, an industrial relations system is not about nice neat looking pieces of legislation, learned tomes on industrial law in leather bindings or even about time and wages books kept in pencil. An industrial relations system has to be alive. It has to have an effect in the workplace and it has to be making a real difference to people's lives and the experiences they have at work.
To analyse whether this legislation passes the first of these tests—the test of fairness, the test of looking after the industrially weak like outworkers—we need to review some history. The current legislation contains, as an allowable matter, dealing with pay and conditions for outworkers, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that their overall pay and conditions of employment are fair and reasonable in comparison to the pay and conditions of employment specified in the relevant award for employees who perform the same kind of work within the employer's commercial premises.
This provision is in the current legislation not because of the generosity of the current minister towards outworkers—one would not have suspected that and, indeed, it is not true—but as a result of the arrangements made with the Democrats to secure the passage of the legislation through the Senate. 
 Even with the legislation containing this clause, a long and complex commission case had to be run to determine whether or not the outwork clauses—clauses 26, 27 and 27A—of the Clothing Trades Award needed rewriting. Such a rewrite was possible because the minister's first wave of industrial relations reform minimised the allowable matters—the areas that could be covered by industrial awards. In continuing to allow the regulation of outwork, the minister's first wave limited that regulation so that it could be no better than what would be contained in a newly limited award. Fortunately, the clauses did survive largely untouched.
The question for this House to consider tonight is: if this bill passes, will the outwork clauses survive again? Or, because of the requirement that the outwork clause be no better than what is available in the award, and the fact that this bill strips awards back even further, will the regulation of outwork be fundamentally weakened by this bill? Upon any reading of this bill, the answer seems clear. This bill will cause the paring back of the clauses which endeavour to regulate outwork. How is this so?
Firstly, outworkers are likely to lose pay because of the eradication of skill based classifications as an allowable matter. Anyone who knows anything about this industry knows that, even under current circumstances with award regulation and recourse to the Industrial Relations Commission, outworkers struggle to be paid properly. Clearly, if there is no regulation in relation to payments for skill, then no money for skill will be paid. Remember, outworkers are not necessarily making standard garments like T-shirts or even business shirts; some of Australia's principal fashion houses have historically had product made by outworkers.
Secondly, a vital condition like accident make-up pay will be deleted and will no longer apply to the regulation of outwork. This is an industry with high injury rates, particularly when long hours of work are performed at home without breaks and without the benefit of ergonomic furniture. This bill is saying to workers who are already lowly paid that, in those circumstances, there 
 will be nothing to protect you—nothing to ensure you continue to retain your pre-injury earnings, even for the first period of injury.
Thirdly, this bill will take away the regulation of redundancy pay and notice of termination for outworkers. It is simply not true to say, as the government does, that anyone who does not receive these moneys can take an unfair dismissal claim. There are circumstances such as redundancy where the worker might accept the termination of employment but still seek proper payment in respect of it. Another basic right lost. The list of what has been lost by outworkers, as contemplated by this bill, goes on: long service leave, bonus systems, jury service leave and public holidays. The regulation of all of these conditions will be lost. Given that we know people get exploited now as outworkers, what is the justification for sweeping any of the current system of regulation away?

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,1999-09-27,"—The outer northern suburbs of Melbourne, and in particular the city of Whittlesea, are the products of the most positive application of multicultural Australia, not as a mere theory but in practice. This is the Australia that I have experienced throughout my life. I have been able to live within a community that displays the rich tapestry of Australia—an Australia made up of people from a range of backgrounds who are united by their desire to see that Australia progresses as a united, tolerant society.
One of the ways this community has been able to achieve that type of cohesion is by sharing the experiences of the various communities that make up the overall geographic community. Over the past few years, a number of those communities have put together historical backgrounds by way of oral histories converted into other media, whether it be books or posters or, in some cases, videos. 
 It was in this context that on 20 August I was pleased to be a part of the launch of the history, art and culture of the Chinese settlement in the city of Whittlesea, entitled Mooncake and Meat Pies.
The history of Chinese involvement in the city of Whittlesea dates back to the late 1800s. There is reference in the 1880s to a Chinese market garden which lay between the Plenty River and Bruces Creek. Unfortunately, whilst there is photographic evidence of such a market garden, there is very little written history. The exact date that the Chinese market garden was established is unknown, and the reasons that it found itself on the other side of the Whittlesea township are unknown. It is believed that the establishment of the market garden occurred at about the time of the Yan Yean reservoir, which was the first part of a reticulated water system to Melbourne.
The interesting thing about those of Chinese background who have made the city of Whittlesea their home is the diverse geopolitical areas that they have come from. Not only do they come from the People's Republic of China but also from Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and even East Timor. The way in which they have been able to come together as a community and, through organisations such as the North-East Melbourne Chinese Association, to be able to work as a self-help group is to be admired, given that they come from such a variety of backgrounds.
The history of the Chinese community follows the histories of the Macedonian community in the city of Whittlesea and in Westgarthtown, which was a German community late last century. It has added to the other oral histories of more Anglo-dominated parts of the city of Whittlesea, such as South Morang and the soldiers' settlement, which started in Lalor as the Peter Lalor Housing Co-op.
This book is authored by Arthur—as he is known—Boon Wah Yong. One of the motivations for Arthur putting together this collection of 17 stories of very successful Chinese people in our community was the outrage that he felt in the early days of the One Nation 
 party. The tone of the launch of this booklet was that Chinese migrants and the Chinese community felt that the way in which Pauline Hanson took over the expression `one nation' left them out of it. They had tried to achieve recognition that they were part of Australia as one nation. No matter what their differences are and what diversity they bring to Australia, they see Australia as a tolerant society, with people working together and obeying the one set of laws and in doing so sharing that diversity was creating this one nation.
