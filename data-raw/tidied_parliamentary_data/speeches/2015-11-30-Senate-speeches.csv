Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:02):  Labor is opposed to the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015. In the words of one of the former ministers in this area whom I have discussed this bill with, it simply is not a good fit. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, or the ACC Act, and repeal the Criminology Research Act 1971, or the CR Act, in order to merge the Australian Institute of Criminology into the Australian Crime Commission.


The bill comprises two schedules. Schedule 1 makes amendments to the ACC Act. The purposes of the amendments in this schedule are to enable the merged agency to continue to carry out the Australian Institute of Criminology's research work; to share criminological research and information with any person, including the private sector; and to carry out commissioned research. Schedule 2 repeals the Criminology Research Act to abolish the AIC as a statutory agency. The Australian Institute of Criminology, or the AIC, was established in 1973 under the CR Act. As a Commonwealth statutory authority, the AIC is regulated under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. Staff of the AIC are generally engaged under the Public Service Act 1999 but may also be employed or engaged by the AIC for a particular project.


According to the AIC 2013-14 annual report, the AIC:


… has served as Australia's national research and knowledge centre on crime and justice for more than 40 years, undertaking and promulgating new research, monitoring and analysing crime trends, and providing advice to inform legislative, policy and practice change. 


The independent status of the AIC has meant its output is not only robust, but trusted by government, law enforcement and justice agencies across the nation and—


I should stress from the evidence the committee received—


internationally. Much of the AIC's work falls under the Commonwealth Government’s strategic research priorities, in particular, the priority themes of 'living in a changing environment', 'promoting population health and wellbeing' and 'securing Australia's place in a changing world'.


A Criminology Research Advisory Council, established under the CR Act in 2011, advises the Director of the AIC on strategic research priorities, communications and the Criminology Research Grants Program. The advisory council consists of nine members, who represent the Australian government and all states and territories. This composition ensures that the areas targeted for research funding reflect both national and state and territory priorities. The Criminology Research Grants Program, managed by the AIC, is funded by the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. The Director of the AIC approves a series of research grants each year, taking into account the recommendations of the Criminology Research Advisory Council. The program funds research that has relevance to jurisdictional policy in the areas of law, police, judiciary, corrections, mental health, social welfare, education and related fields.


The Australian Crime Commission commenced operation on 1 January 2003. It has its origins in the April 2002 Council of Australian Governments leaders summit, which agreed that a new national framework was needed to meet the challenges of multijurisdictional crime. It replaced and combined the strategic and operational intelligence and specialist investigative capabilities of the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments.


According to its latest annual report, the aim of the ACC is:


Reduced serious and organised crime threats of most harm to Australians and the national interest.


To achieve this aim, the ACC has a range of special coercive powers such as the capacity to compel attendance at examinations, the production of documents and the answering of questions, similar to a royal commission. The ACC also has an intelligence-gathering capacity and a range of investigative powers common to law enforcement agencies, such as the power to tap phones, use surveillance devices and participate in controlled operations. Like the AIC, the ACC is regulated under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act, and staff of the ACC are engaged under the Public Service Act.


With that background, the 2014 Commission of Audit, announced by the Abbott government and released in February 2014, made a number of recommendations, including that:


A consolidated crime intelligence capability would also better support law enforcement operations …


The Commission of Audit did not suggest the possibility of the AIC merging with the ACC but proposed that consideration be given to moving the AIC to a university. This, perhaps, would have been a better framework to maintain the independence.


Prior to the 2015 budget, there was media speculation that the two bodies—the AIC and the ACC—would merge, and at the time Labor's shadow minister for justice, Mr Feeney, wrote to the minister requesting a briefing. However, the minister noted that the government was yet to make a decision regarding the proposed merger and so would not be offering a briefing at that time. Following the 2015 budget, the Minister for Justice announced the appointment of the ACC's CEO, Chris Dawson, as the newly appointed interim director of the AIC. At that time, Minister Keenan indicated that the government was considering whether the AIC should be placed within the ACC, but at that date no final decision had been made. The minister said:


In the interim, the ACC and AIC will continue to exist and operate as separate entities, while working together on expanding existing relationships.


Finally, on 25 September this year, the minister announced that the AIC would be placed within the ACC to boost research capability at the nation's criminal intelligence agency. The AIC is to be incorporated into the ACC as an independent research branch known as the Crime and Justice Research Centre, the CJRC. The minister stressed that the merger is not about cutting costs or personnel of either agency; it is about creating a unified workforce incorporating staff of both agencies.


The minister has stated that this merger brings together Australia's national criminal intelligence and research capabilities under one banner, and that having a unified resource of this type will enrich our national understanding of criminal activity, including serious and organised crime and terrorism, allowing police, justice agencies and policy-makers at all levels of government to adopt a more effective, efficient, evidence based response to crime. 


Under the proposed merger, the AIC will carry its research functions over to the ACC, including its ability to undertake commissioned research. The AIC's corporate functions will be merged with those of the ACC. The position of AIC director will be abolished. 


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee recently undertook an inquiry into this bill and the committee received correspondence from various stakeholders raising concerns about the proposed merger. As a result, Labor believes that the Australian Institute of Criminology's functions—which are to promote justice and to reduce crime by conducting criminological research, and communicating the results of that research to the Commonwealth, the States and the community—are best undertaken by an independent agency that can guarantee the independence of the work undertaken.


Further, the independence of the AIC has ensured that the programs for awarding grants and engaging specialists has been, and has been seen to be, independent and robust. As discussed in Labor's additional comments to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report, we believe that any positives that have been secured through the merger of the AIC and the Australian Crime Commission—such as access to classified data—can be secured through legislation and/or interagency agreements, and does not require a full merger. 


The continued integrity and independence of criminological research in Australia is vital for both the quality of research but also the public trust in crime statistics. It is not in the public or the national interest for such statistics to ever be perceived to be anything less than completely accurate and compiled by independent and skilled professionals. 


Labor senators continue to have concerns about these aspects of the bill. The appointment of the ACC CEO Chris Dawson as the interim director of the AIC in July 2015 raised concerns about there being an impending takeover of the AIC. Mr Dawson, appearing before the committee twice—first in his capacity as interim director of the AIC and then as director of the ACC—raised some concerns about the impact of the government's merger on the independence of his office. 


We recommend that the Government further consider the concerns raised by stakeholders during the public hearing, and in the submissions received by the committee regarding maintaining the integrity and independence of the research currently undertaken by the AIC, including maintaining funding and access to datasets, and maintaining public access to data, research and library resources of the JV Barry Library operated by the AIC. If it were to proceed with a merger, amendments to the minister's second speech and explanatory memorandum to the bill would help to address these concerns by committing to writing the verbal assurance given by the government regarding these matters. 


Further, Labor believes that the government should consider establishing a statutory advisory body similar to the existing AIC council to advise the ACC board on setting the criminological research agenda and priorities and allocation of grants. It is clear that this bill is not about improving government service delivery. It is about defunding services and that will result in reduced capabilities. As recently as last week, Prime Minister Turnbull's appointment as Secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, warned against degrading the abilities and organisational memory of our Public Service through outsourcing and redundancies. The government would do well to heed this advice.


We do not think the merger of these two agencies—or a takeover, as has been suggested by some—is a good fit. Therefore, Labor will oppose the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015 in its current form.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2015-11-30,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:14):  The Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015 seeks to repeal the Criminology Research Act 1971 and amend the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. This bill abolishes the Australian Institute of Criminology as a statutory agency and merges its functions into the Australian Crime Commission to form a research branch, within the Australian Crime Commission, to be called the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre. 


The Australian Institute of Criminology has a long and proud history of undertaking and publishing world-class criminological research. John Vincent Barry, a lawyer, Supreme Court judge and pioneer of criminology in Australia, advocated for many years for the establishment of a national institute of criminology in Australia. His efforts came to fruition in 1970, when it was announced that such an institute was to be formed. The JV Barry Library, which is the most comprehensive library based collection in the field of criminology and criminal justice in Australia, was named after John Vincent Barry in recognition of his early work in this area.


The exact reasoning for this merger is still unclear. The Commission of Audit proposed that consideration be given to locating the AIC in a university. How we have ended up here, with a bill to merge the AIC with the ACC, is something only the government can adequately explain. I note that in the second reading speech in the other place, Minister O'Dwyer stated:


The Government sees great opportunity in combining the resources of the AIC and the ACC to provide Australian law enforcement agencies with central access to a consolidated and comprehensive criminal research and intelligence resource. 


Having a unified resource of this type would significantly enhance support for law enforcement and bolster Australia's response to serious and organised crime.


The Greens have concerns that this is, in fact, much more of a takeover than a merger and will result in functions of the AIC being lost or subsumed. The first function of the AIC in the Criminology Research Act 1971 is 'to promote justice and reduce crime.' Nowhere in this legislation does it say that one of the functions of the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre will be to promote justice and reduce crime. In fact, when that is compared to the first function of the ACC in the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, which is:


… to collect, correlate, analyse and disseminate criminal information and intelligence and to maintain a national database of that information and intelligence—


it is clear that we are dealing with organisations that have very different aims and very different functions. It seems bizarre to be merging two agencies which have very different aims and very different functions, particularly as the minister has stated that this merger is not about reducing costs. 


Promoting justice and reducing crime is really important in Australia. A 2011 AIC report found the cost of crime in Australia is approximately $47.6 billion. This bill provides no guarantee that when the AIC becomes part of the ACC the depth and breadth of research currently undertaken by the AIC will continue. That was a common theme in many of the submissions to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. We heard on that committee from Professor Rick Sarre, president of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminologists, who stated in his evidence to the committee:


There is no doubt at all that the membership of our organisation would be with the maintenance of the status quo. I am very happy to say that.


The committee also heard from the acting director of Griffith Criminology Institute, Professor Janet Ransley, who stated in evidence to the committee:


I think once you put this research function in a law enforcement agency there is a capacity for it to be perceived as co-opted by law enforcement. It will lose that aura of independence. That would be a great shame for Australia.


The committee also heard concerns around the intent of combining the research function of the AIC with the law enforcement function of the ACC, whilst maintaining the current board structure of the ACC. Those concerns essentially were that the merger or the takeover, whilst maintaining the current board structure of the ACC, would diminish the research program currently undertaken by the Australian Institute of Criminology. Again I will quote from Professor Janet Ransley, who stated in evidence to the committee:


The ACC board, as it is currently constituted—by my understanding—comprises largely law enforcement-related personnel from the states and territories and federal agencies. I think that is an inappropriate body to be setting research directions as we would understand criminological research. I think it does show a lack of understanding about the distinction between law enforcement-related intelligence gathering—which is a legitimate and important function—and criminological research, which is about understanding the underlying factors that contribute to and worsen or reduce crime. I think that is not a great solution, to have the board—as currently constituted—directing research. I think it would result in a diminution of the research function, and it would be a disaster, actually.


The Crime Prevention Council submitted to the committee that the AIC has been highly respected and valued as a source of sound research and advice. The council further submitted that the diminution of its research, publications, overseas assistance and conference-organising functions would have an adverse effect on Australia's criminal justice influence and role in the region. Civil Liberties Australia, in their submission to the committee, said that they believe 'domestic crime issues may be neglected given the national priorities of the ACC'. Professor Rick Sarre, the president of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology, stated in his evidence to the committee on that issue:


If you are looking at crime prevention and bringing safety and security to our communities, anti-terrorism is one arm, and the sort of intelligence gathering that the ACC has done so well for so many years is another arm. But, if you are talking about community development and you are talking about education, health, housing, welfare—all those sorts of things—and the things that the sociologists and psychologists are telling us are the grave risks to our community development, an intelligence-gathering body is not likely to engage in that sort of behaviour.


It is fair to say that when these matters were put to representatives of the ACC at the committee hearings they indicated to the committee that they were aware of the concerns that had been raised. But it is worth noting that, in general terms, none of the concerns that were raised with the committee have been addressed in this legislation. It will be interesting to hear whether the minister is prepared to make any further statements on these matters during the debate here in the Senate today.


The Greens certainly believe that the domestic crime issues that were referred to by Civil Liberties Australia and Professor Sarre are very important for Australia. They include things like parole supervision and reoffending, preventing youth offending and reoffending, how we deal with people in the justice system with mental illness, and drink-driving prevention—just to name a few. These are many of the issues that no doubt all senators would hear about regularly in the so-called law and order debate in this country. These are bread-and-butter law and order issues. Ultimately, if we as a parliament want to reduce crime in Australia—and, of course, if you reduce crime there are fewer victims of crime and Australia will become a safer place—then we need to better understand why people commit crimes and, importantly, understand what strategies and responses we can put in place to reduce the level of crime in this country and to make Australians safer. That is a core function of the AIC, and that is one of the functions that will be placed at risk should this legislation pass through the parliament.


We have concerns relating to the future research direction of the ACC. Currently the AIC has an advisory board, the Criminology Research Advisory Council, which is made up of members from the states, territories and Commonwealth. This board advises the Director of the AIC on strategic research priorities. Should this legislation pass, the Criminology Research Advisory Council will no longer be a statutory body. Evidence was given that there is consideration being given to reconstituting that council in some form and having an advisory body exist within the ACC. However, it is worth pointing out that, if that is not detailed in legislation, it would be simply the stroke of an administrative pen to dissolve any new body. As we have heard, Professor Sarre and Professor Ransley both gave evidence to the committee outlining concerns in this area.


Fundamentally, the Greens believe that, should this bill pass, there is a significant risk that broad-ranging criminological research that focuses on understanding the causes of crime, recommending crime prevention strategies and informing policymakers will take second place to the law enforcement needs of the ACC—and I will place very firmly on the record that the Greens understand the law enforcement argument here around the ACC, and nothing we are saying should be taken to be critical of that law enforcement function. We have heard that one of the justifications for this legislation is around things like access to datasets and the JV Barry Library. Those concerns have been articulated, and the Greens have no reason to believe that those concerns are unfounded, but we would make the point very strongly today that concerns like that can be addressed through administrative actions, such as potentially an MOU between the ACC and the AIC, and that effectively, if those are the concerns that are driving this legislation, we are taking a sledgehammer to a walnut here by proposing what has been sold to us as a merger but what the Greens fear is more of a takeover of the AIC by the ACC. So we will be opposing this legislation.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-11-30,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (10:28):  I rise to support the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015 and add my words to those of previous speakers. We would all share the principle in this parliament and throughout the wider community that every effort must be made to contain, diminish and, of course, reduce the impact on victims of crimes, to bring those responsible for crime to account, and to reduce the massive impact that crime has in our community. Figures of $36 billion a year were mentioned. I think Senator McKim a moment ago mentioned the figure of $47.6 billion. So I lend my voice to any move that is likely to lead to better understanding of crime and study of crime in this country and, of course, all of those efforts to prevent it in the first place or to identify those responsible, bring them to account and reduce the impact on victims and on the community. As the minister in the other place said in her concluding remarks:


This bill implements an important consolidation of Australia's criminal research and intelligence capabilities. With the merger of the AIC into the ACC, the ACC will be better able to fulfil its role as Australia's national criminal intelligence agency, supporting and informing the efforts of law enforcement agencies around Australia.


Similarly, the new Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre in the ACC will continue to prepare and disseminate world-leading criminological research which informs our understanding of the trends and developments in crime and justice.


We have heard differing views on whether or not there is likely to be a diminution in the role of criminological research in this country. I would urge and hope that there will not. What I would think will be is a part of the thought process behind this move of merging the AIC into the ACC: that we end up with far more effect in terms of the work of the ACC without in any way reducing the effectiveness of criminological research. It will bring together two of the nation's leading authorities on crime and justice under the one banner.


The overall objective, of course, is to create a unified workforce that will incorporate the staff of both agencies to the mutual benefit of not only the Australian community but of the staff them themselves—and I will come back to the impact on staff in a few minutes. The prediction and the advice to government is that this type of unification of the resources will significantly enhance support for law enforcement in this country, bolster our response to serious and organised crime and help us to better understand the causes and the research mechanisms by which we can prevent major crime in this country. And, of course, we would expect to see enhanced evidence supporting a proactive and targeted response to crime by all of Australia's law enforcement agencies.


The staff are critically important to the move being undertaken. Their wellbeing has been a prime consideration throughout the development of the proposal. And there will be significant benefits to the staff of both agencies: the simple fact of being able to work more collaboratively in a closer environment and the capacity to be able to move within the organisation—as one in the research space sees the desire to further their own career progression, for example, in the actual work of the ACC. And, again, the ability of people whose main focus has been the responsibilities of the Crime Commission and who may actually develop an interest in the research space being able to move seamlessly, either permanently or on a project-by-project basis, into the research space must surely be of enormous benefit to the staff.


Equally, it has been important to provide the staff with a degree of certainty, as there have been questions about the possible co-location and merging of the two. That, of course, will happen should this legislation be passed. The question has been asked—and quite fairly—whether the independence of AIC research will be compromised in any way as a result of this merger. The understanding that has very clearly being given to me is, 'No, there will be no diminution on the impact of research.' The AIC would carry its research functions over to the ACC, forming the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, headed by a senior criminologist and research specialist. I have no doubt that those with a keen interest in this space will be watching carefully to see how that process of selection is undertaken, to make sure that we do indeed have the services of an internationally-acclaimed criminologist and research specialist.


The ACC and the AIC agreed on this structure following consultation with the AIC's stakeholders. It is important to understand that. State and territory justice agencies, external criminology researchers and they themselves have emphasised—as indeed has been quoted by others this morning—the need for the AIC group, or the now Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, to remain an independent research unit within the ACC. I have heard nothing and seen nothing that indicates a desire of government in any way to reduce either that independence or its excellence. In fact, I hope and expect we will see an enhancement of the research activities as a result of closer cooperation. 


The Crime and Justice Research Centre's priorities will continue to be influenced by an advisory body similar to the current Criminology Research Advisory Council. The question of whether or not there will be a diminution as a result of that body no longer being a statutory body has been asked. I, for one in this place, would want to make sure that at all times there will be that level of independence and excellence. Should there ever be a case where that body's independence or its excellence is in any way diminished, I for one and others in this place would want to know about it, we would want an explanation from government and we would want a correction to that, so important is the issue. 


There will be a broadening to include police representatives to reflect the important role the ACC plays in Australian law enforcement. There may be some who would say, 'Is that going to adversely impact the independence, excellence or direction of research?' Again, I certainly hope that it would not and that in fact it would only enhance, focus and act as a conduit for those police and other representatives to take back to their organisations a better understanding of the direction of research being undertaken and, indeed, the outcomes of research. 


There is always a question in these cases: is this in some way an attempt to actually reduce funding? With the scourge of the increase in crime in this country and the impact of crime on the Australian community, both in physical terms of victims and in terms of the budget, one would hope there would not be a reduction of research funding. One would hope that in this merger we would actually see a greater focus on the need for supporting research. There will be an ethics committee to oversee the activities of the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, as indeed an ethics committee currently oversees the role of the AIC. 


Where are the benefits for both? I expect that there will be and I expect that the minister, if need be, would expand on them. AIC staff should have better and further access to classified information available now to the ACC agency members. If that informs their research activities, if it gives them guidance in the directions in which research ought to be undertaken or if, indeed, there is the plea that they require further funding, the fact that they should have access to classified information should be of benefit. It will enable them to develop better informed and targeted research to be of greater value to law enforcement and justice agencies. Again, you would think that nobody in the Australian community—nobody of law-abiding nature, anyhow—would argue with that objective. A merger will provide ACC with a specialist research capability that will support the development of evidence-based responses to serious and organised criminal threats. It should be able to do so more seamlessly and more quickly and be able to respond in a very much more effective and efficient way. 


A merger, should the legislation be passed, will provide significant opportunities to the staff of what are now the two agencies by providing diversity in the type of work they can undertake and the professional opportunities available to them. I made mention of that earlier in my contribution. I can very firmly see the benefits to staff in a merged organisation where they can move to those areas in which they develop interest and in which they may want and be able to go on with higher qualifications and then from the ACC side, should they then have undertaken that research, to look at the value and the benefit of that person in their career coming back into the law enforcement side so that they can give greater effect to that work. 


I want to conclude my comments by talking about one area in which I know the ACC is active, and in which I understand AIC undertakes significant research. It is what some are referring to as the pandemic—not the epidemic—of crystal methamphetamine in this country. In 2014, as a result of surveys it was estimated that 2.5 per cent of all Australians over the age of 14—that is, half a million people—had used methamphetamine at least once during that year.  


I will put that into perspective by comparing it to other countries. The 2.5 per cent of Australians 14 years and older who had tried methamphetamine at least once in a year equates to 0.5 percent in the United States, Britain and Canada—countries to which we are often compared. That means that five times the number of people in our country in 2014 had used crystal methamphetamine—an illegal drug. Therefore we have in Australia—anecdotally we know this—a very severe issue. It is an area in which the ACC is active. Hopefully the AIC, reformed, would also have the resources to undertake the necessary research.


I will drill a little further into this issue. In Victoria, the Coroner's office reported in 2010 that one in every 25 drug related deaths was due to crystal meth or ice. Two years later—in 2012—the Victorian Coroner's office reported that the number was one in 10. Last September, the Medical Journal of Australia published a study of the Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Centre that showed a 318 per cent increase in hospitalisations from 2010-11 to 2011-12—in one year—in Melbourne as a result of issues associated with overdose and use of crystal methamphetamine. That figure of 318 per cent surely points to a greater need for a greater emphasis and better coordinated activity in our crime research, crime prevention and crime treatment, in order to reverse this evil trend. 


A study undertaken by the Institute of Criminology of detainees in police stations around the nation found that 61 per cent of those held in the Kings Cross Police Station in Sydney tested positive to methamphetamine, 40 per cent held in Brisbane City Police Station tested positive to methamphetamine, and 43 cent of those in the watch house in my home city of Perth tested positive.


I will conclude with the words of the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission, Paul Jevtovic. In a forward to a report, The Illicit Drug Data Report 2012-13, which was released about 15 months ago, he wrote


…with its relative accessibility, affordability and destructive side-effects, crystal methylamphetamine is emerging as a pandemic akin to the issue of ‘crack’ cocaine in the United States.


In this place we share the view of the wider honourable community of this country that the use of illicit drugs and the crime that stems from that—the need to fund such an addiction by stealing or through some other means—must be addressed and attacked. 


The bill that we see today has the objective of bringing together the national criminal intelligence analysis and research capabilities of the AIC, the Australian Institute of Criminology, and the ACC. I realise the reservations that have been expressed by the previous speaker and from eminent and highly regarded specialists in this field, criminologist Professor Rick Sarre, from the University of South Australia, amongst them. The point I want to make is that those cautions should be listened to. They should be addressed. From a risk point of view, we must ensure that none of the capacity of the AIC is lost in the merger with the ACC.


When we are facing the issues that we are, in this country, the closer the levels of collaboration between those parties who have a responsibility to the community, through this place, must surely be examined to see where the greatest of benefit lies. If there are risks of the independence of the research arm and if there are risks associated with the direction that research takes or, indeed, the quality of international collaboration, then those issues must be addressed. In the meantime, my own experience and background tells me that the more closely agencies of this type work together the better the outcome should be for the Australian community. I urge that this legislation be passed by this place.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-11-30,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:46):  I want to reflect on Senator Back's very thoughtful contribution relating to the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015. I agree with him that the impact of illicit drugs and substance abuse is a very significant issue for this nation. Interestingly, today, the youth survey commissioned by Mission Australia indicated that amongst young people one of their most significant concerns was alcohol abuse and illicit drug abuse. In particular, there was a real concern about crystal methamphetamine. Having known people who have been affected by the scourge of crystal meth—constituents who have been impacted by it and have come to see me—we are not doing enough as a nation.


I find it unconscionable that there are decent families around this country who are having to take out loans, mortgage their homes and cash in their super, in order to get a loved one into a rehabilitation program that may cost $20,000 or $30,000 either here or overseas. There are a number of reputable services around the country and also, apparently, services in Chiang Mai, in Thailand. There is something wrong in a nation as wealthy as Australia when families who are on average wages, who are battling with their bills already—because they do not want to see their loved one, whether it is a son or daughter, a father or mother, a husband or wife, have their life destroyed by crystal meth—are desperately trying to get them help and there is no real help from state institutions or government funded help, or it is minimal and piecemeal. It is a big issue, but it is not the issue that we are dealing with today.


I do endorse Senator Back's comments about the concern and impact of substance abuse of illicit drugs on crime in this country, but the issue here is whether the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Australian Crime Commission should merge. I think if Sir Humphrey Appleby were in this room he would say, 'This proposed merger is a courageous move, but I am not quite sure whether it makes sense.' Merging a criminal investigation organisation, with strong powers to compel testimony and gather intelligence from real world criminal networks, such as the ACC, with the Australian Institute of Criminology, a research body that carries out self-directed as well as commissioned research, raises some serious questions. The government says it is revenue neutral which, in the current climate of growing budget deficits, raises the question of why it is being done.


The Australian Institute of Criminology fulfils a very valuable role in Australia: providing objective analysis and research on criminal trends and statistics across Australia and transnationally. I first came to rely on the Australian Institute of Criminology as a state member of the South Australian state parliament, in the legislative council. I relied on its research back in 1997 with their landmark work, Who's holding the aces—a report into the frightening link between compulsive gambling and crime. The expert authors looked at the types of offences committed, the socioeconomic groups involved in gambling and sought to understand the reasons behind compulsive gamblers' behaviour and the wider effect on the family structure.


Of course, as a Western Australian senator, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you do not have the scourge of poker machines in your pubs and clubs. They are confined to the casino—to Jamie Packer's casino at Burswood. Obviously, they are driven by the nature of the product, if you like—the design of these machines, that actually is dangerous. They actually hurt people because they are designed to addict and to cause enormous harm.


So since that time I have been impressed by the work of the Australian Institute of Criminology. Now the government wants to merge it with the Australian Crime Commission. This is a heavy-hitting organised crime investigation body with powers akin to a standing royal commission—and that is appropriate. It absolutely appropriate that we have a body such as the ACC to deal with organised crime and with criminal elements where you need to have significant, broad and continuing powers to deal with the scourge of organised crime.


The merger involves removing the role of the director of the Australian Institute of Criminology and I am deeply concerned that it will also remove the effectiveness of the merged body to carry out independent and effective research. Senator Back, in his very thoughtful contribution, talked about the need for greater cooperation. I agree with him. But this is not cooperation: this is a takeover. This is co-option—this is basically taking over the Australian Institute of Criminology. The concern I have is that this will mitigate and reduce the effectiveness of the Australian Institute of Criminology in this country. We do need to have a body such as the AIC which is truly independent. I do not have a problem with it being directed to undertake Crime Commission research, and it could be directed to from time to time by the minister or by the ACC, for instance. But just to have it merged so that we no longer have a director of the Australian Institute of Criminology concerns me.


The director is usually an academic with a strong research record, and the AIC is also assisted by an advisory council. Under the merger the CEO of the ACC and its board will assume these roles, although there is no requirement for any of these people to be criminologists. There is a big difference between research into criminal behaviour and looking at societal trends, and also to give an objective, balanced view as to what we can do to reduce the impact of crime—to reduce crime and to look at the causes of crime. I am all for being tough on crime, but we need to be tough on the causes of crime. And in order to understand those we need a robust and truly independent body such as the Australian Institute of Criminology. I am worried that by being subsumed with this proposed merger—which, by the way, is revenue neutral—we will lose that opportunity.


How can the government guarantee that the priorities and mission of what is now the AIC—the Australian Institute of Criminology—will not be subordinated to the objectives of the Australian Crime Commission? I suggest that there is no guarantee. My understanding—and I am sure that the minister will shake or nod her head accordingly—is that this is being driven by the Minister for Justice, the Hon. Mr Keenan. It is his bill. I suggest respectfully to Minister Keenan, with whom I have had a very constructive and good working relationship, that this is not the right way to go about it. I suggest that this has not been thought through. I suggest that by going down this path we will reduce our ability to look at the causes of crime. The ACC's role is to deal with criminal organisations. I think that the AIC's role is to look at the causes of crime also and to look at it in a broader context than the ACC would.


Of course we all want the most effective criminal investigation bodies possible. The ACC—the Australian Crime Commission—does important work, and should be funded and structured to continue this work. But I am concerned that its priorities will supersede the separate and distinct role of the Australian Crime Commission.


I am very happy to talk to Minister Keenan as to how there can be a greater synergy between the two bodies. But I think that, whatever concerns the government has, it is really throwing out the baby with the bathwater. I think that this particular bill will be retrograde; it will be counterproductive in the fight against crime. You need to have an independent, robustly independent research body such as the Australian Institute of Criminology. I believe that this move, revenue neutral as it is, will actually set us backwards in the fight against crime and that is why I have real reservations in supporting this. I cannot support the second reading of this bill but I am open to having further discussions with the government in terms of further coordinations between the two bodies. But let us not get rid of a body that has served us well. Let us keep its robust independence in order that we can combat crime most effectively in our nation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2015-11-30,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs) (10:55):  The Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015 brings two of the nation's leading authorities on crime and justice, the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Australian Crime Commission, together under one banner. Australia's law enforcement and justice agencies are increasingly dependent on accurate research, information and intelligence to ensure that our officers on the ground, at our borders and in our intelligence agencies can do their job. Accurate research, information and intelligence are also essential to do deliver evidence based crime prevention strategies and effective justice policies that benefit the Australian community. A combined agency with strengthened research capability will be able to provide a better evidence base for our agencies to identify the patterns and associations that can detect, disrupt and undermine those who seek to keep to do our communities harm.


I would like now to turn to some of the specific points that were raised in the debate and address some of these points. Firstly, why does the government want to merge the AIC with the ACC? We believe that this will bring two of our leading authorities under the one banner. Whilst the proposed merger is expected to produce small savings over the forward estimates, can I assure the Senate that is not about cutting the costs or personnel of either agency; it is about creating a unified workforce incorporating the staff of both agencies.


We believe that there are benefits for both agencies and significant opportunities. By merging the two bodies, AIC staff would have greater access to classified information. This would enable them to develop better informed and targeted research that will be of greater value to law enforcement and justice agencies across Australia. It will also provide the ACC with a specialist research capability that will support the development of evidence based responses to serious and organised criminal threats. It will also provide significant opportunities to the staff of both agencies by providing a diversity in the type of work they can perform and also provide professional opportunities available to them.


We believe that the merger will assist in producing independent research that can inform policymaking by combining the expertise capability and data information holdings of the AIC and the ACC. This will significantly enhance support for law enforcement in counter-terrorism efforts and bolster Australia's response to serious and organised crime. The Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre will work closely with ACC, particularly on issues such as a common interest such as illicit drugs and crime prevention. Of course this will increase the value and relevance of the research, providing an enhanced evidence base to support a proactive and targeted response to crime and policy development by all law enforcement and justice agencies.


We believe there will be minimal risk only to both agencies. We believe it will be business-as-usual and there may be some minimal disruption but only during the transition process. Both have established a joint dedicated change management team to help manage this risk. Of course the government consulted in relation to the preparation of this bill with the two bodies in question and with the Attorney-General's Department, but we also consulted with states and territories through the Criminology Research Advisory Council and the ACC board throughout this process.


I will particularly address some comments that were made by Senator Collins and Senator McKim about consultation with external criminology researchers on the bill. We worked closely, as I have indicated, with the Attorney-General's Department and the two bodies to develop this bill for parliament's consideration. The AIC has a close working relationship with its stakeholders, including external criminology researchers, and it provided feedback from these stakeholders throughout the development of the merger process. The proposal also takes into account public statements made by criminology researchers and concerns this group proactively raised with the government. For example, the AIC provided feedback from the criminology research community that, should a merger proceed, the AIC should continue to carry out world-leading criminology research and remain an independent research unit within the ACC. Taking this feedback into account, the bill provides for the AIC to carry all of its research functions over to the ACC. Furthermore, the AIC's researchers will form a new research branch at the ACC—the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre—which will be headed by a senior criminologist and research specialist.


Earlier I mentioned the minimal impact on staff. I can assure the Senate that staff wellbeing has been a primary consideration throughout the development of this process and, as I have indicated, it will open up opportunities for staff. We particularly wanted to make this point, and I note that in correspondence from Minister Keenan to the shadow minister, the Hon. David Feeney, it was specifically noted that the merger will not result in significant job losses and that this bill is not about cutting the staff or functions of either agency. It is about leveraging their strengths to ensure that we are using existing capability as effectively as possible to achieve the best outcomes for the Australian community.


I will now go particularly to the issue of the independence of research, which has been raised by both Senator Collins and Senator Xenophon. Will the proposed merger impact the independence of the AIC's research? The answer, simply, is no. As I have indicated there will be the new branch of the ACC, the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, where an ethics committee will oversee this centre's activities, as one currently does for the AIC. The department, the ACC and the AIC agreed on its organisational structure following specific feedback from AIC stakeholders that the AIC needed to maintain the capability to produce independent research. Whilst the centre's research priorities may become aligned more closely with law enforcement's high-level priorities, such as illicit drugs or transnational crime, this operating model would ensure that the centre will not be subject to undue influence by law enforcement industries. The centre's priorities will also continue to be influenced by an advisory body similar to the current Criminology Research Advisory Council.


I want to focus now on comments raised by all speakers in relation to this, particularly about the AIC's research, and state that the centre would continue to carry out the AIC's three main work streams, which are: statistical monitoring programs, fee-for-service research and thematic research on crime and justice priorities. In relation to its thematic research on crime and justice priorities, the research centre will work closely with the rest of the ACC, particularly on issues of common interest. Research staff will also have access to ACC-sensitive law enforcement information, enabling the centre to carry out confidential research on specific issues for the ACC and law enforcement and justice agencies. The research centre will also have access to the same data sets that are currently available to the AIC, and the researchers will also be able to access all of the AIC's data sets. I will state that the ACC Act contains strict provisions governing dissemination of ACC information, not only to other government agencies but also to the private sector. Of course this is appropriate, given the sensitive information and intelligence that the ACC currently handles. Whilst this is appropriate for the ACC's existing operations, following a merger it will be important that the ACC can make AIC research available to other criminology researchers and to the broader Australian community, as it currently does.


In recognition of this, the bill inserts a new information disclosure provision into the ACC Act to enable the ACC to share and publish criminological research and information in the same way as the AIC currently does. This will ensure that criminological research will not become subject to the strict information disclosure regimes that apply to other types of ACC information. The JV Barry Library would also be maintained, and the merger agency will continue to provide public access to its holdings on an appointment basis, as the AIC currently does. As part of the proposed merger the AIC has also begun digitising parts of the JV Barry Library to improve public access, and this process will continue after the merger. In addition to publishing research, the merged agency will respond to specific data requests from researchers in the same way as the AIC currently does, and each request will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.


In response to a comment from Senator Xenophon, the merged agency will respond to specific data requests from researchers, as I indicated, in the same way as the AIC currently does. Each request will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with the level of detail provided subject to ethical and privacy considerations. In the unlikely event of a disagreement between researchers and the merged agency, researchers will be able to escalate the matter to the CEO, as is currently the case for the AIC. If the dispute cannot be dealt with in this way, researchers have an appeal mechanism. Furthermore, the ACC is subject to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction, so the Ombudsman can investigate complaints as well. As is currently the case, researchers can also seek access to unpublished reports through the freedom of information process.


Senator McKim in particular asked about the library. I think that issue has been addressed. Senator Collins asked a question about the government's decision not to move the AIC to a university, as was suggested by the National Commission of Audit. Merging the AIC with the ACC presents a unique opportunity that would not be available if the AIC was moved to a university. By merging the two bodies, AIC staff will obtain greater access to classified information. I have addressed some of those issues previously.


I now turn specifically to the schedules to the bill and address particular comments raised by both Senator Collins and Senator Xenophon in relation to the continuation of the Criminology Research Advisory Council. The government consulted closely with the Criminology Research Advisory Council in developing the proposal to merge the AIC with the ACC. The advisory council advised that it may wish to maintain a role in the merged agency but that this role does not need to be enshrined in legislation. Following a merger, the ACC board will assume responsibility for providing strategic direction to the ACC about its new research functions and for determining the ACC's criminological research priorities. However, in doing so, the ACC CEO proposes that the board take advice from the non-legislated research advisory committee. That research advisory committee is intended to perform a similar role to the current Criminology Research Advisory Council, with expanded membership to include the enforcement agencies. This will ensure that justice agencies continue to play a central role in determining the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre's priorities.


In relation to the non-legislated research advisory committee, on 20 November 2015, the Criminology Research Advisory Council agreed that the new non-legislated research advisory committee would consist of the advisory council's existing members plus two law enforcement representatives and a representative from the Australia and New Zealand Society of Criminology. These changes are intended to broaden the range of stakeholders that will provide advice on crime and justice research priorities. 


The ACC CEO proposes that the non-legislated research advisory committee will meet twice a year, with one meeting focused on research priorities and another on criminology research grants. That research advisory committee will still play a role in advising the CEO on criminology research grants through a grants subgroup. The subgroup will consist of research advisory committee members who provide a financial contribution to the grants fund. These arrangements will create a strong and independent committee structure to provide advice to the ACC board on the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre's research priorities.


I think that addresses the key points raised in relation to this bill. In conclusion, I reiterate that the proposed merger is not about cutting the staff functions or cost of either the AIC or the ACC. It is about leveraging strengths of both agencies to achieve the best research and intelligence outcomes for the Australian community. With the merger of the AIC into the ACC, the ACC will be better able to fulfil its role as Australia's national criminal intelligence agency, supporting and informing the efforts of law enforcement agencies around Australia. Similarly, the new Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre in the ACC will continue to prepare and disseminate world-leading criminological research, which informs our understanding of the trends and developments in crime and justice. In this way, the bill delivers on the government's commitment to tackle crime and keep our community safe.


Debate adjourned.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (10:02):  Labor is opposed to the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015. In the words of one of the former ministers in this area whom I have discussed this bill with, it simply is not a good fit. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, or the ACC Act, and repeal the Criminology Research Act 1971, or the CR Act, in order to merge the Australian Institute of Criminology into the Australian Crime Commission.


The bill comprises two schedules. Schedule 1 makes amendments to the ACC Act. The purposes of the amendments in this schedule are to enable the merged agency to continue to carry out the Australian Institute of Criminology's research work; to share criminological research and information with any person, including the private sector; and to carry out commissioned research. Schedule 2 repeals the Criminology Research Act to abolish the AIC as a statutory agency. The Australian Institute of Criminology, or the AIC, was established in 1973 under the CR Act. As a Commonwealth statutory authority, the AIC is regulated under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. Staff of the AIC are generally engaged under the Public Service Act 1999 but may also be employed or engaged by the AIC for a particular project.


According to the AIC 2013-14 annual report, the AIC:


… has served as Australia's national research and knowledge centre on crime and justice for more than 40 years, undertaking and promulgating new research, monitoring and analysing crime trends, and providing advice to inform legislative, policy and practice change. 


The independent status of the AIC has meant its output is not only robust, but trusted by government, law enforcement and justice agencies across the nation and—


I should stress from the evidence the committee received—


internationally. Much of the AIC's work falls under the Commonwealth Government’s strategic research priorities, in particular, the priority themes of 'living in a changing environment', 'promoting population health and wellbeing' and 'securing Australia's place in a changing world'.


A Criminology Research Advisory Council, established under the CR Act in 2011, advises the Director of the AIC on strategic research priorities, communications and the Criminology Research Grants Program. The advisory council consists of nine members, who represent the Australian government and all states and territories. This composition ensures that the areas targeted for research funding reflect both national and state and territory priorities. The Criminology Research Grants Program, managed by the AIC, is funded by the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. The Director of the AIC approves a series of research grants each year, taking into account the recommendations of the Criminology Research Advisory Council. The program funds research that has relevance to jurisdictional policy in the areas of law, police, judiciary, corrections, mental health, social welfare, education and related fields.


The Australian Crime Commission commenced operation on 1 January 2003. It has its origins in the April 2002 Council of Australian Governments leaders summit, which agreed that a new national framework was needed to meet the challenges of multijurisdictional crime. It replaced and combined the strategic and operational intelligence and specialist investigative capabilities of the National Crime Authority, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence and the Office of Strategic Crime Assessments.


According to its latest annual report, the aim of the ACC is:


Reduced serious and organised crime threats of most harm to Australians and the national interest.


To achieve this aim, the ACC has a range of special coercive powers such as the capacity to compel attendance at examinations, the production of documents and the answering of questions, similar to a royal commission. The ACC also has an intelligence-gathering capacity and a range of investigative powers common to law enforcement agencies, such as the power to tap phones, use surveillance devices and participate in controlled operations. Like the AIC, the ACC is regulated under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act, and staff of the ACC are engaged under the Public Service Act.


With that background, the 2014 Commission of Audit, announced by the Abbott government and released in February 2014, made a number of recommendations, including that:


A consolidated crime intelligence capability would also better support law enforcement operations …


The Commission of Audit did not suggest the possibility of the AIC merging with the ACC but proposed that consideration be given to moving the AIC to a university. This, perhaps, would have been a better framework to maintain the independence.


Prior to the 2015 budget, there was media speculation that the two bodies—the AIC and the ACC—would merge, and at the time Labor's shadow minister for justice, Mr Feeney, wrote to the minister requesting a briefing. However, the minister noted that the government was yet to make a decision regarding the proposed merger and so would not be offering a briefing at that time. Following the 2015 budget, the Minister for Justice announced the appointment of the ACC's CEO, Chris Dawson, as the newly appointed interim director of the AIC. At that time, Minister Keenan indicated that the government was considering whether the AIC should be placed within the ACC, but at that date no final decision had been made. The minister said:


In the interim, the ACC and AIC will continue to exist and operate as separate entities, while working together on expanding existing relationships.


Finally, on 25 September this year, the minister announced that the AIC would be placed within the ACC to boost research capability at the nation's criminal intelligence agency. The AIC is to be incorporated into the ACC as an independent research branch known as the Crime and Justice Research Centre, the CJRC. The minister stressed that the merger is not about cutting costs or personnel of either agency; it is about creating a unified workforce incorporating staff of both agencies.


The minister has stated that this merger brings together Australia's national criminal intelligence and research capabilities under one banner, and that having a unified resource of this type will enrich our national understanding of criminal activity, including serious and organised crime and terrorism, allowing police, justice agencies and policy-makers at all levels of government to adopt a more effective, efficient, evidence based response to crime. 


Under the proposed merger, the AIC will carry its research functions over to the ACC, including its ability to undertake commissioned research. The AIC's corporate functions will be merged with those of the ACC. The position of AIC director will be abolished. 


The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee recently undertook an inquiry into this bill and the committee received correspondence from various stakeholders raising concerns about the proposed merger. As a result, Labor believes that the Australian Institute of Criminology's functions—which are to promote justice and to reduce crime by conducting criminological research, and communicating the results of that research to the Commonwealth, the States and the community—are best undertaken by an independent agency that can guarantee the independence of the work undertaken.


Further, the independence of the AIC has ensured that the programs for awarding grants and engaging specialists has been, and has been seen to be, independent and robust. As discussed in Labor's additional comments to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee report, we believe that any positives that have been secured through the merger of the AIC and the Australian Crime Commission—such as access to classified data—can be secured through legislation and/or interagency agreements, and does not require a full merger. 


The continued integrity and independence of criminological research in Australia is vital for both the quality of research but also the public trust in crime statistics. It is not in the public or the national interest for such statistics to ever be perceived to be anything less than completely accurate and compiled by independent and skilled professionals. 


Labor senators continue to have concerns about these aspects of the bill. The appointment of the ACC CEO Chris Dawson as the interim director of the AIC in July 2015 raised concerns about there being an impending takeover of the AIC. Mr Dawson, appearing before the committee twice—first in his capacity as interim director of the AIC and then as director of the ACC—raised some concerns about the impact of the government's merger on the independence of his office. 


We recommend that the Government further consider the concerns raised by stakeholders during the public hearing, and in the submissions received by the committee regarding maintaining the integrity and independence of the research currently undertaken by the AIC, including maintaining funding and access to datasets, and maintaining public access to data, research and library resources of the JV Barry Library operated by the AIC. If it were to proceed with a merger, amendments to the minister's second speech and explanatory memorandum to the bill would help to address these concerns by committing to writing the verbal assurance given by the government regarding these matters. 


Further, Labor believes that the government should consider establishing a statutory advisory body similar to the existing AIC council to advise the ACC board on setting the criminological research agenda and priorities and allocation of grants. It is clear that this bill is not about improving government service delivery. It is about defunding services and that will result in reduced capabilities. As recently as last week, Prime Minister Turnbull's appointment as Secretary to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, warned against degrading the abilities and organisational memory of our Public Service through outsourcing and redundancies. The government would do well to heed this advice.


We do not think the merger of these two agencies—or a takeover, as has been suggested by some—is a good fit. Therefore, Labor will oppose the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015 in its current form.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2015-11-30,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:14):  The Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015 seeks to repeal the Criminology Research Act 1971 and amend the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. This bill abolishes the Australian Institute of Criminology as a statutory agency and merges its functions into the Australian Crime Commission to form a research branch, within the Australian Crime Commission, to be called the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre. 


The Australian Institute of Criminology has a long and proud history of undertaking and publishing world-class criminological research. John Vincent Barry, a lawyer, Supreme Court judge and pioneer of criminology in Australia, advocated for many years for the establishment of a national institute of criminology in Australia. His efforts came to fruition in 1970, when it was announced that such an institute was to be formed. The JV Barry Library, which is the most comprehensive library based collection in the field of criminology and criminal justice in Australia, was named after John Vincent Barry in recognition of his early work in this area.


The exact reasoning for this merger is still unclear. The Commission of Audit proposed that consideration be given to locating the AIC in a university. How we have ended up here, with a bill to merge the AIC with the ACC, is something only the government can adequately explain. I note that in the second reading speech in the other place, Minister O'Dwyer stated:


The Government sees great opportunity in combining the resources of the AIC and the ACC to provide Australian law enforcement agencies with central access to a consolidated and comprehensive criminal research and intelligence resource. 


Having a unified resource of this type would significantly enhance support for law enforcement and bolster Australia's response to serious and organised crime.


The Greens have concerns that this is, in fact, much more of a takeover than a merger and will result in functions of the AIC being lost or subsumed. The first function of the AIC in the Criminology Research Act 1971 is 'to promote justice and reduce crime.' Nowhere in this legislation does it say that one of the functions of the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre will be to promote justice and reduce crime. In fact, when that is compared to the first function of the ACC in the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002, which is:


… to collect, correlate, analyse and disseminate criminal information and intelligence and to maintain a national database of that information and intelligence—


it is clear that we are dealing with organisations that have very different aims and very different functions. It seems bizarre to be merging two agencies which have very different aims and very different functions, particularly as the minister has stated that this merger is not about reducing costs. 


Promoting justice and reducing crime is really important in Australia. A 2011 AIC report found the cost of crime in Australia is approximately $47.6 billion. This bill provides no guarantee that when the AIC becomes part of the ACC the depth and breadth of research currently undertaken by the AIC will continue. That was a common theme in many of the submissions to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. We heard on that committee from Professor Rick Sarre, president of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminologists, who stated in his evidence to the committee:


There is no doubt at all that the membership of our organisation would be with the maintenance of the status quo. I am very happy to say that.


The committee also heard from the acting director of Griffith Criminology Institute, Professor Janet Ransley, who stated in evidence to the committee:


I think once you put this research function in a law enforcement agency there is a capacity for it to be perceived as co-opted by law enforcement. It will lose that aura of independence. That would be a great shame for Australia.


The committee also heard concerns around the intent of combining the research function of the AIC with the law enforcement function of the ACC, whilst maintaining the current board structure of the ACC. Those concerns essentially were that the merger or the takeover, whilst maintaining the current board structure of the ACC, would diminish the research program currently undertaken by the Australian Institute of Criminology. Again I will quote from Professor Janet Ransley, who stated in evidence to the committee:


The ACC board, as it is currently constituted—by my understanding—comprises largely law enforcement-related personnel from the states and territories and federal agencies. I think that is an inappropriate body to be setting research directions as we would understand criminological research. I think it does show a lack of understanding about the distinction between law enforcement-related intelligence gathering—which is a legitimate and important function—and criminological research, which is about understanding the underlying factors that contribute to and worsen or reduce crime. I think that is not a great solution, to have the board—as currently constituted—directing research. I think it would result in a diminution of the research function, and it would be a disaster, actually.


The Crime Prevention Council submitted to the committee that the AIC has been highly respected and valued as a source of sound research and advice. The council further submitted that the diminution of its research, publications, overseas assistance and conference-organising functions would have an adverse effect on Australia's criminal justice influence and role in the region. Civil Liberties Australia, in their submission to the committee, said that they believe 'domestic crime issues may be neglected given the national priorities of the ACC'. Professor Rick Sarre, the president of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology, stated in his evidence to the committee on that issue:


If you are looking at crime prevention and bringing safety and security to our communities, anti-terrorism is one arm, and the sort of intelligence gathering that the ACC has done so well for so many years is another arm. But, if you are talking about community development and you are talking about education, health, housing, welfare—all those sorts of things—and the things that the sociologists and psychologists are telling us are the grave risks to our community development, an intelligence-gathering body is not likely to engage in that sort of behaviour.


It is fair to say that when these matters were put to representatives of the ACC at the committee hearings they indicated to the committee that they were aware of the concerns that had been raised. But it is worth noting that, in general terms, none of the concerns that were raised with the committee have been addressed in this legislation. It will be interesting to hear whether the minister is prepared to make any further statements on these matters during the debate here in the Senate today.


The Greens certainly believe that the domestic crime issues that were referred to by Civil Liberties Australia and Professor Sarre are very important for Australia. They include things like parole supervision and reoffending, preventing youth offending and reoffending, how we deal with people in the justice system with mental illness, and drink-driving prevention—just to name a few. These are many of the issues that no doubt all senators would hear about regularly in the so-called law and order debate in this country. These are bread-and-butter law and order issues. Ultimately, if we as a parliament want to reduce crime in Australia—and, of course, if you reduce crime there are fewer victims of crime and Australia will become a safer place—then we need to better understand why people commit crimes and, importantly, understand what strategies and responses we can put in place to reduce the level of crime in this country and to make Australians safer. That is a core function of the AIC, and that is one of the functions that will be placed at risk should this legislation pass through the parliament.


We have concerns relating to the future research direction of the ACC. Currently the AIC has an advisory board, the Criminology Research Advisory Council, which is made up of members from the states, territories and Commonwealth. This board advises the Director of the AIC on strategic research priorities. Should this legislation pass, the Criminology Research Advisory Council will no longer be a statutory body. Evidence was given that there is consideration being given to reconstituting that council in some form and having an advisory body exist within the ACC. However, it is worth pointing out that, if that is not detailed in legislation, it would be simply the stroke of an administrative pen to dissolve any new body. As we have heard, Professor Sarre and Professor Ransley both gave evidence to the committee outlining concerns in this area.


Fundamentally, the Greens believe that, should this bill pass, there is a significant risk that broad-ranging criminological research that focuses on understanding the causes of crime, recommending crime prevention strategies and informing policymakers will take second place to the law enforcement needs of the ACC—and I will place very firmly on the record that the Greens understand the law enforcement argument here around the ACC, and nothing we are saying should be taken to be critical of that law enforcement function. We have heard that one of the justifications for this legislation is around things like access to datasets and the JV Barry Library. Those concerns have been articulated, and the Greens have no reason to believe that those concerns are unfounded, but we would make the point very strongly today that concerns like that can be addressed through administrative actions, such as potentially an MOU between the ACC and the AIC, and that effectively, if those are the concerns that are driving this legislation, we are taking a sledgehammer to a walnut here by proposing what has been sold to us as a merger but what the Greens fear is more of a takeover of the AIC by the ACC. So we will be opposing this legislation.

Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (10:28):  I rise to support the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015 and add my words to those of previous speakers. We would all share the principle in this parliament and throughout the wider community that every effort must be made to contain, diminish and, of course, reduce the impact on victims of crimes, to bring those responsible for crime to account, and to reduce the massive impact that crime has in our community. Figures of $36 billion a year were mentioned. I think Senator McKim a moment ago mentioned the figure of $47.6 billion. So I lend my voice to any move that is likely to lead to better understanding of crime and study of crime in this country and, of course, all of those efforts to prevent it in the first place or to identify those responsible, bring them to account and reduce the impact on victims and on the community. As the minister in the other place said in her concluding remarks:


This bill implements an important consolidation of Australia's criminal research and intelligence capabilities. With the merger of the AIC into the ACC, the ACC will be better able to fulfil its role as Australia's national criminal intelligence agency, supporting and informing the efforts of law enforcement agencies around Australia.


Similarly, the new Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre in the ACC will continue to prepare and disseminate world-leading criminological research which informs our understanding of the trends and developments in crime and justice.


We have heard differing views on whether or not there is likely to be a diminution in the role of criminological research in this country. I would urge and hope that there will not. What I would think will be is a part of the thought process behind this move of merging the AIC into the ACC: that we end up with far more effect in terms of the work of the ACC without in any way reducing the effectiveness of criminological research. It will bring together two of the nation's leading authorities on crime and justice under the one banner.


The overall objective, of course, is to create a unified workforce that will incorporate the staff of both agencies to the mutual benefit of not only the Australian community but of the staff them themselves—and I will come back to the impact on staff in a few minutes. The prediction and the advice to government is that this type of unification of the resources will significantly enhance support for law enforcement in this country, bolster our response to serious and organised crime and help us to better understand the causes and the research mechanisms by which we can prevent major crime in this country. And, of course, we would expect to see enhanced evidence supporting a proactive and targeted response to crime by all of Australia's law enforcement agencies.


The staff are critically important to the move being undertaken. Their wellbeing has been a prime consideration throughout the development of the proposal. And there will be significant benefits to the staff of both agencies: the simple fact of being able to work more collaboratively in a closer environment and the capacity to be able to move within the organisation—as one in the research space sees the desire to further their own career progression, for example, in the actual work of the ACC. And, again, the ability of people whose main focus has been the responsibilities of the Crime Commission and who may actually develop an interest in the research space being able to move seamlessly, either permanently or on a project-by-project basis, into the research space must surely be of enormous benefit to the staff.


Equally, it has been important to provide the staff with a degree of certainty, as there have been questions about the possible co-location and merging of the two. That, of course, will happen should this legislation be passed. The question has been asked—and quite fairly—whether the independence of AIC research will be compromised in any way as a result of this merger. The understanding that has very clearly being given to me is, 'No, there will be no diminution on the impact of research.' The AIC would carry its research functions over to the ACC, forming the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, headed by a senior criminologist and research specialist. I have no doubt that those with a keen interest in this space will be watching carefully to see how that process of selection is undertaken, to make sure that we do indeed have the services of an internationally-acclaimed criminologist and research specialist.


The ACC and the AIC agreed on this structure following consultation with the AIC's stakeholders. It is important to understand that. State and territory justice agencies, external criminology researchers and they themselves have emphasised—as indeed has been quoted by others this morning—the need for the AIC group, or the now Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, to remain an independent research unit within the ACC. I have heard nothing and seen nothing that indicates a desire of government in any way to reduce either that independence or its excellence. In fact, I hope and expect we will see an enhancement of the research activities as a result of closer cooperation. 


The Crime and Justice Research Centre's priorities will continue to be influenced by an advisory body similar to the current Criminology Research Advisory Council. The question of whether or not there will be a diminution as a result of that body no longer being a statutory body has been asked. I, for one in this place, would want to make sure that at all times there will be that level of independence and excellence. Should there ever be a case where that body's independence or its excellence is in any way diminished, I for one and others in this place would want to know about it, we would want an explanation from government and we would want a correction to that, so important is the issue. 


There will be a broadening to include police representatives to reflect the important role the ACC plays in Australian law enforcement. There may be some who would say, 'Is that going to adversely impact the independence, excellence or direction of research?' Again, I certainly hope that it would not and that in fact it would only enhance, focus and act as a conduit for those police and other representatives to take back to their organisations a better understanding of the direction of research being undertaken and, indeed, the outcomes of research. 


There is always a question in these cases: is this in some way an attempt to actually reduce funding? With the scourge of the increase in crime in this country and the impact of crime on the Australian community, both in physical terms of victims and in terms of the budget, one would hope there would not be a reduction of research funding. One would hope that in this merger we would actually see a greater focus on the need for supporting research. There will be an ethics committee to oversee the activities of the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, as indeed an ethics committee currently oversees the role of the AIC. 


Where are the benefits for both? I expect that there will be and I expect that the minister, if need be, would expand on them. AIC staff should have better and further access to classified information available now to the ACC agency members. If that informs their research activities, if it gives them guidance in the directions in which research ought to be undertaken or if, indeed, there is the plea that they require further funding, the fact that they should have access to classified information should be of benefit. It will enable them to develop better informed and targeted research to be of greater value to law enforcement and justice agencies. Again, you would think that nobody in the Australian community—nobody of law-abiding nature, anyhow—would argue with that objective. A merger will provide ACC with a specialist research capability that will support the development of evidence-based responses to serious and organised criminal threats. It should be able to do so more seamlessly and more quickly and be able to respond in a very much more effective and efficient way. 


A merger, should the legislation be passed, will provide significant opportunities to the staff of what are now the two agencies by providing diversity in the type of work they can undertake and the professional opportunities available to them. I made mention of that earlier in my contribution. I can very firmly see the benefits to staff in a merged organisation where they can move to those areas in which they develop interest and in which they may want and be able to go on with higher qualifications and then from the ACC side, should they then have undertaken that research, to look at the value and the benefit of that person in their career coming back into the law enforcement side so that they can give greater effect to that work. 


I want to conclude my comments by talking about one area in which I know the ACC is active, and in which I understand AIC undertakes significant research. It is what some are referring to as the pandemic—not the epidemic—of crystal methamphetamine in this country. In 2014, as a result of surveys it was estimated that 2.5 per cent of all Australians over the age of 14—that is, half a million people—had used methamphetamine at least once during that year.  


I will put that into perspective by comparing it to other countries. The 2.5 per cent of Australians 14 years and older who had tried methamphetamine at least once in a year equates to 0.5 percent in the United States, Britain and Canada—countries to which we are often compared. That means that five times the number of people in our country in 2014 had used crystal methamphetamine—an illegal drug. Therefore we have in Australia—anecdotally we know this—a very severe issue. It is an area in which the ACC is active. Hopefully the AIC, reformed, would also have the resources to undertake the necessary research.


I will drill a little further into this issue. In Victoria, the Coroner's office reported in 2010 that one in every 25 drug related deaths was due to crystal meth or ice. Two years later—in 2012—the Victorian Coroner's office reported that the number was one in 10. Last September, the Medical Journal of Australia published a study of the Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Centre that showed a 318 per cent increase in hospitalisations from 2010-11 to 2011-12—in one year—in Melbourne as a result of issues associated with overdose and use of crystal methamphetamine. That figure of 318 per cent surely points to a greater need for a greater emphasis and better coordinated activity in our crime research, crime prevention and crime treatment, in order to reverse this evil trend. 


A study undertaken by the Institute of Criminology of detainees in police stations around the nation found that 61 per cent of those held in the Kings Cross Police Station in Sydney tested positive to methamphetamine, 40 per cent held in Brisbane City Police Station tested positive to methamphetamine, and 43 cent of those in the watch house in my home city of Perth tested positive.


I will conclude with the words of the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission, Paul Jevtovic. In a forward to a report, The Illicit Drug Data Report 2012-13, which was released about 15 months ago, he wrote


…with its relative accessibility, affordability and destructive side-effects, crystal methylamphetamine is emerging as a pandemic akin to the issue of ‘crack’ cocaine in the United States.


In this place we share the view of the wider honourable community of this country that the use of illicit drugs and the crime that stems from that—the need to fund such an addiction by stealing or through some other means—must be addressed and attacked. 


The bill that we see today has the objective of bringing together the national criminal intelligence analysis and research capabilities of the AIC, the Australian Institute of Criminology, and the ACC. I realise the reservations that have been expressed by the previous speaker and from eminent and highly regarded specialists in this field, criminologist Professor Rick Sarre, from the University of South Australia, amongst them. The point I want to make is that those cautions should be listened to. They should be addressed. From a risk point of view, we must ensure that none of the capacity of the AIC is lost in the merger with the ACC.


When we are facing the issues that we are, in this country, the closer the levels of collaboration between those parties who have a responsibility to the community, through this place, must surely be examined to see where the greatest of benefit lies. If there are risks of the independence of the research arm and if there are risks associated with the direction that research takes or, indeed, the quality of international collaboration, then those issues must be addressed. In the meantime, my own experience and background tells me that the more closely agencies of this type work together the better the outcome should be for the Australian community. I urge that this legislation be passed by this place.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2015-11-30,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:46):  I want to reflect on Senator Back's very thoughtful contribution relating to the Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015. I agree with him that the impact of illicit drugs and substance abuse is a very significant issue for this nation. Interestingly, today, the youth survey commissioned by Mission Australia indicated that amongst young people one of their most significant concerns was alcohol abuse and illicit drug abuse. In particular, there was a real concern about crystal methamphetamine. Having known people who have been affected by the scourge of crystal meth—constituents who have been impacted by it and have come to see me—we are not doing enough as a nation.


I find it unconscionable that there are decent families around this country who are having to take out loans, mortgage their homes and cash in their super, in order to get a loved one into a rehabilitation program that may cost $20,000 or $30,000 either here or overseas. There are a number of reputable services around the country and also, apparently, services in Chiang Mai, in Thailand. There is something wrong in a nation as wealthy as Australia when families who are on average wages, who are battling with their bills already—because they do not want to see their loved one, whether it is a son or daughter, a father or mother, a husband or wife, have their life destroyed by crystal meth—are desperately trying to get them help and there is no real help from state institutions or government funded help, or it is minimal and piecemeal. It is a big issue, but it is not the issue that we are dealing with today.


I do endorse Senator Back's comments about the concern and impact of substance abuse of illicit drugs on crime in this country, but the issue here is whether the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Australian Crime Commission should merge. I think if Sir Humphrey Appleby were in this room he would say, 'This proposed merger is a courageous move, but I am not quite sure whether it makes sense.' Merging a criminal investigation organisation, with strong powers to compel testimony and gather intelligence from real world criminal networks, such as the ACC, with the Australian Institute of Criminology, a research body that carries out self-directed as well as commissioned research, raises some serious questions. The government says it is revenue neutral which, in the current climate of growing budget deficits, raises the question of why it is being done.


The Australian Institute of Criminology fulfils a very valuable role in Australia: providing objective analysis and research on criminal trends and statistics across Australia and transnationally. I first came to rely on the Australian Institute of Criminology as a state member of the South Australian state parliament, in the legislative council. I relied on its research back in 1997 with their landmark work, Who's holding the aces—a report into the frightening link between compulsive gambling and crime. The expert authors looked at the types of offences committed, the socioeconomic groups involved in gambling and sought to understand the reasons behind compulsive gamblers' behaviour and the wider effect on the family structure.


Of course, as a Western Australian senator, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, you do not have the scourge of poker machines in your pubs and clubs. They are confined to the casino—to Jamie Packer's casino at Burswood. Obviously, they are driven by the nature of the product, if you like—the design of these machines, that actually is dangerous. They actually hurt people because they are designed to addict and to cause enormous harm.


So since that time I have been impressed by the work of the Australian Institute of Criminology. Now the government wants to merge it with the Australian Crime Commission. This is a heavy-hitting organised crime investigation body with powers akin to a standing royal commission—and that is appropriate. It absolutely appropriate that we have a body such as the ACC to deal with organised crime and with criminal elements where you need to have significant, broad and continuing powers to deal with the scourge of organised crime.


The merger involves removing the role of the director of the Australian Institute of Criminology and I am deeply concerned that it will also remove the effectiveness of the merged body to carry out independent and effective research. Senator Back, in his very thoughtful contribution, talked about the need for greater cooperation. I agree with him. But this is not cooperation: this is a takeover. This is co-option—this is basically taking over the Australian Institute of Criminology. The concern I have is that this will mitigate and reduce the effectiveness of the Australian Institute of Criminology in this country. We do need to have a body such as the AIC which is truly independent. I do not have a problem with it being directed to undertake Crime Commission research, and it could be directed to from time to time by the minister or by the ACC, for instance. But just to have it merged so that we no longer have a director of the Australian Institute of Criminology concerns me.


The director is usually an academic with a strong research record, and the AIC is also assisted by an advisory council. Under the merger the CEO of the ACC and its board will assume these roles, although there is no requirement for any of these people to be criminologists. There is a big difference between research into criminal behaviour and looking at societal trends, and also to give an objective, balanced view as to what we can do to reduce the impact of crime—to reduce crime and to look at the causes of crime. I am all for being tough on crime, but we need to be tough on the causes of crime. And in order to understand those we need a robust and truly independent body such as the Australian Institute of Criminology. I am worried that by being subsumed with this proposed merger—which, by the way, is revenue neutral—we will lose that opportunity.


How can the government guarantee that the priorities and mission of what is now the AIC—the Australian Institute of Criminology—will not be subordinated to the objectives of the Australian Crime Commission? I suggest that there is no guarantee. My understanding—and I am sure that the minister will shake or nod her head accordingly—is that this is being driven by the Minister for Justice, the Hon. Mr Keenan. It is his bill. I suggest respectfully to Minister Keenan, with whom I have had a very constructive and good working relationship, that this is not the right way to go about it. I suggest that this has not been thought through. I suggest that by going down this path we will reduce our ability to look at the causes of crime. The ACC's role is to deal with criminal organisations. I think that the AIC's role is to look at the causes of crime also and to look at it in a broader context than the ACC would.


Of course we all want the most effective criminal investigation bodies possible. The ACC—the Australian Crime Commission—does important work, and should be funded and structured to continue this work. But I am concerned that its priorities will supersede the separate and distinct role of the Australian Crime Commission.


I am very happy to talk to Minister Keenan as to how there can be a greater synergy between the two bodies. But I think that, whatever concerns the government has, it is really throwing out the baby with the bathwater. I think that this particular bill will be retrograde; it will be counterproductive in the fight against crime. You need to have an independent, robustly independent research body such as the Australian Institute of Criminology. I believe that this move, revenue neutral as it is, will actually set us backwards in the fight against crime and that is why I have real reservations in supporting this. I cannot support the second reading of this bill but I am open to having further discussions with the government in terms of further coordinations between the two bodies. But let us not get rid of a body that has served us well. Let us keep its robust independence in order that we can combat crime most effectively in our nation.

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2015-11-30,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs) (10:55):  The Australian Crime Commission Amendment (Criminology Research) Bill 2015 brings two of the nation's leading authorities on crime and justice, the Australian Institute of Criminology and the Australian Crime Commission, together under one banner. Australia's law enforcement and justice agencies are increasingly dependent on accurate research, information and intelligence to ensure that our officers on the ground, at our borders and in our intelligence agencies can do their job. Accurate research, information and intelligence are also essential to do deliver evidence based crime prevention strategies and effective justice policies that benefit the Australian community. A combined agency with strengthened research capability will be able to provide a better evidence base for our agencies to identify the patterns and associations that can detect, disrupt and undermine those who seek to keep to do our communities harm.


I would like now to turn to some of the specific points that were raised in the debate and address some of these points. Firstly, why does the government want to merge the AIC with the ACC? We believe that this will bring two of our leading authorities under the one banner. Whilst the proposed merger is expected to produce small savings over the forward estimates, can I assure the Senate that is not about cutting the costs or personnel of either agency; it is about creating a unified workforce incorporating the staff of both agencies.


We believe that there are benefits for both agencies and significant opportunities. By merging the two bodies, AIC staff would have greater access to classified information. This would enable them to develop better informed and targeted research that will be of greater value to law enforcement and justice agencies across Australia. It will also provide the ACC with a specialist research capability that will support the development of evidence based responses to serious and organised criminal threats. It will also provide significant opportunities to the staff of both agencies by providing a diversity in the type of work they can perform and also provide professional opportunities available to them.


We believe that the merger will assist in producing independent research that can inform policymaking by combining the expertise capability and data information holdings of the AIC and the ACC. This will significantly enhance support for law enforcement in counter-terrorism efforts and bolster Australia's response to serious and organised crime. The Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre will work closely with ACC, particularly on issues such as a common interest such as illicit drugs and crime prevention. Of course this will increase the value and relevance of the research, providing an enhanced evidence base to support a proactive and targeted response to crime and policy development by all law enforcement and justice agencies.


We believe there will be minimal risk only to both agencies. We believe it will be business-as-usual and there may be some minimal disruption but only during the transition process. Both have established a joint dedicated change management team to help manage this risk. Of course the government consulted in relation to the preparation of this bill with the two bodies in question and with the Attorney-General's Department, but we also consulted with states and territories through the Criminology Research Advisory Council and the ACC board throughout this process.


I will particularly address some comments that were made by Senator Collins and Senator McKim about consultation with external criminology researchers on the bill. We worked closely, as I have indicated, with the Attorney-General's Department and the two bodies to develop this bill for parliament's consideration. The AIC has a close working relationship with its stakeholders, including external criminology researchers, and it provided feedback from these stakeholders throughout the development of the merger process. The proposal also takes into account public statements made by criminology researchers and concerns this group proactively raised with the government. For example, the AIC provided feedback from the criminology research community that, should a merger proceed, the AIC should continue to carry out world-leading criminology research and remain an independent research unit within the ACC. Taking this feedback into account, the bill provides for the AIC to carry all of its research functions over to the ACC. Furthermore, the AIC's researchers will form a new research branch at the ACC—the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre—which will be headed by a senior criminologist and research specialist.


Earlier I mentioned the minimal impact on staff. I can assure the Senate that staff wellbeing has been a primary consideration throughout the development of this process and, as I have indicated, it will open up opportunities for staff. We particularly wanted to make this point, and I note that in correspondence from Minister Keenan to the shadow minister, the Hon. David Feeney, it was specifically noted that the merger will not result in significant job losses and that this bill is not about cutting the staff or functions of either agency. It is about leveraging their strengths to ensure that we are using existing capability as effectively as possible to achieve the best outcomes for the Australian community.


I will now go particularly to the issue of the independence of research, which has been raised by both Senator Collins and Senator Xenophon. Will the proposed merger impact the independence of the AIC's research? The answer, simply, is no. As I have indicated there will be the new branch of the ACC, the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre, where an ethics committee will oversee this centre's activities, as one currently does for the AIC. The department, the ACC and the AIC agreed on its organisational structure following specific feedback from AIC stakeholders that the AIC needed to maintain the capability to produce independent research. Whilst the centre's research priorities may become aligned more closely with law enforcement's high-level priorities, such as illicit drugs or transnational crime, this operating model would ensure that the centre will not be subject to undue influence by law enforcement industries. The centre's priorities will also continue to be influenced by an advisory body similar to the current Criminology Research Advisory Council.


I want to focus now on comments raised by all speakers in relation to this, particularly about the AIC's research, and state that the centre would continue to carry out the AIC's three main work streams, which are: statistical monitoring programs, fee-for-service research and thematic research on crime and justice priorities. In relation to its thematic research on crime and justice priorities, the research centre will work closely with the rest of the ACC, particularly on issues of common interest. Research staff will also have access to ACC-sensitive law enforcement information, enabling the centre to carry out confidential research on specific issues for the ACC and law enforcement and justice agencies. The research centre will also have access to the same data sets that are currently available to the AIC, and the researchers will also be able to access all of the AIC's data sets. I will state that the ACC Act contains strict provisions governing dissemination of ACC information, not only to other government agencies but also to the private sector. Of course this is appropriate, given the sensitive information and intelligence that the ACC currently handles. Whilst this is appropriate for the ACC's existing operations, following a merger it will be important that the ACC can make AIC research available to other criminology researchers and to the broader Australian community, as it currently does.


In recognition of this, the bill inserts a new information disclosure provision into the ACC Act to enable the ACC to share and publish criminological research and information in the same way as the AIC currently does. This will ensure that criminological research will not become subject to the strict information disclosure regimes that apply to other types of ACC information. The JV Barry Library would also be maintained, and the merger agency will continue to provide public access to its holdings on an appointment basis, as the AIC currently does. As part of the proposed merger the AIC has also begun digitising parts of the JV Barry Library to improve public access, and this process will continue after the merger. In addition to publishing research, the merged agency will respond to specific data requests from researchers in the same way as the AIC currently does, and each request will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.


In response to a comment from Senator Xenophon, the merged agency will respond to specific data requests from researchers, as I indicated, in the same way as the AIC currently does. Each request will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, with the level of detail provided subject to ethical and privacy considerations. In the unlikely event of a disagreement between researchers and the merged agency, researchers will be able to escalate the matter to the CEO, as is currently the case for the AIC. If the dispute cannot be dealt with in this way, researchers have an appeal mechanism. Furthermore, the ACC is subject to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's jurisdiction, so the Ombudsman can investigate complaints as well. As is currently the case, researchers can also seek access to unpublished reports through the freedom of information process.


Senator McKim in particular asked about the library. I think that issue has been addressed. Senator Collins asked a question about the government's decision not to move the AIC to a university, as was suggested by the National Commission of Audit. Merging the AIC with the ACC presents a unique opportunity that would not be available if the AIC was moved to a university. By merging the two bodies, AIC staff will obtain greater access to classified information. I have addressed some of those issues previously.


I now turn specifically to the schedules to the bill and address particular comments raised by both Senator Collins and Senator Xenophon in relation to the continuation of the Criminology Research Advisory Council. The government consulted closely with the Criminology Research Advisory Council in developing the proposal to merge the AIC with the ACC. The advisory council advised that it may wish to maintain a role in the merged agency but that this role does not need to be enshrined in legislation. Following a merger, the ACC board will assume responsibility for providing strategic direction to the ACC about its new research functions and for determining the ACC's criminological research priorities. However, in doing so, the ACC CEO proposes that the board take advice from the non-legislated research advisory committee. That research advisory committee is intended to perform a similar role to the current Criminology Research Advisory Council, with expanded membership to include the enforcement agencies. This will ensure that justice agencies continue to play a central role in determining the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre's priorities.


In relation to the non-legislated research advisory committee, on 20 November 2015, the Criminology Research Advisory Council agreed that the new non-legislated research advisory committee would consist of the advisory council's existing members plus two law enforcement representatives and a representative from the Australia and New Zealand Society of Criminology. These changes are intended to broaden the range of stakeholders that will provide advice on crime and justice research priorities. 


The ACC CEO proposes that the non-legislated research advisory committee will meet twice a year, with one meeting focused on research priorities and another on criminology research grants. That research advisory committee will still play a role in advising the CEO on criminology research grants through a grants subgroup. The subgroup will consist of research advisory committee members who provide a financial contribution to the grants fund. These arrangements will create a strong and independent committee structure to provide advice to the ACC board on the Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre's research priorities.


I think that addresses the key points raised in relation to this bill. In conclusion, I reiterate that the proposed merger is not about cutting the staff functions or cost of either the AIC or the ACC. It is about leveraging strengths of both agencies to achieve the best research and intelligence outcomes for the Australian community. With the merger of the AIC into the ACC, the ACC will be better able to fulfil its role as Australia's national criminal intelligence agency, supporting and informing the efforts of law enforcement agencies around Australia. Similarly, the new Australian Crime and Justice Research Centre in the ACC will continue to prepare and disseminate world-leading criminological research, which informs our understanding of the trends and developments in crime and justice. In this way, the bill delivers on the government's commitment to tackle crime and keep our community safe.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  It is, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Thank you very much. It may be somewhat unorthodox to speak to such a motion, but not quite as unorthodox as for the government to bring in a report in this manner—a report which then goes to a bill on which the government wishes to bring off a debate immediately. It may well be unorthodox as well given this importance of this issue. This is a bill that goes to our third largest export industry, and it is important, therefore, when we consider the report of a Senate education committee on this industry that senators actually get time to read the report, because it is more than likely that senators will not be aware that this report is being tabled and that people are seeking to have it printed so that the government can then bring on this bill.


This is a bill which, as I say, has quite considerable and far-reaching implications. The Senate committee has looked at this bill, having had the matter referred to it a little over a month ago, on 15 October. The report is based on the work of some 27 submitters, for a bill which has a start-up date for the private sector of the middle of next year. Yet the government wants to bring this bill in immediately after consideration of this report—a report most senators will not even know has been tabled.


I am particularly concerned that senators have the opportunity to look at the Labor Party's additional comments in regard to this report, because it goes to quite significant issues about the government's attempts to deregulate aspects of this industry. Given the government's experience in deregulation in higher education, this is a matter I would have thought would be of some interest to senators and would not be allowed to slip through without consideration of the issues involved.


This is a bill that seeks to reduce the level of regulation, particularly for private colleges operating in the international area. International education, as I have indicated, is of such vital concern. If there had been no problems here, one could reasonably expect that, upon discussion with the opposition, these matters could be dealt with in the manner which the government may well be proposing. But that has not happened, because there have been some 54 colleges that have gone belly up in one form or another since 2007.


There will be those that say, 'Well, that's all ancient history.' Of course, we know that that is not ancient history, because since the new organisational principles came into play just a couple of years ago a range of colleges have gone belly up in one form or another. I repeat that there was the case just in September of this year of the Gold Coast Language School, which on 29 September this year, because of business failure, was obliged to close. On 6 August of this year, I understand the St Stephen Institute of Education was deregistered. Symbiosis, on 6 August 2015, was deregistered. They are particularly significant colleges because they are at the centre of fraud charges by the Australian Federal Police because of their involvement with Australia Post.


These are not incidental questions. They go to the very heart of the integrity of our international education system. I could go back to 13 July of this year, when the Melbourne Senior Secondary College lost its registration because of gross abuses of the international education student body that it had enrolled at the school without providing the proper services that were available to them. On 12 April 2013, Ivy Business College was obliged to close for enrolling students and not providing qualified teachers to actually teach them. On 10 December 2013, the Sydney Technical Institute had its renewals rejected. On 22 November 2012, Milton College fell over because of business failure. On 10 December 2013, Ashmark Institute also lost its registration.


So these are quite serious matters which go to the very heart of our education system, because they affect our international reputation. But it is not just there. I might also draw your attention, Mr Acting Deputy President, to Careers Australia recently being the subject of considerable notoriety. They had some 590 students. They have been involved in the VET FEE-HELP scandals. Phoenix College, which was deregistered recently, had 40 international students. Unique International College, which was recently deregistered, had 400 students. There was the case of action pending in regard to Cornerstone Investment, which was a college that had a capacity to enrol over 900 students. There is the Australian Institute of Professional Education, which has a capacity to enrol nearly 4,000 students and is subject to action at the moment.


Cornerstone and Empower were trading in different names but were essentially the same entity. They received some $46 million in VET FEE-HELP assistance but only managed to graduate five students. I have complained in the past about the $100,000 degrees, but I have argued that in the VET FEE-HELP area we have seen examples of million-dollar diplomas. We now have a situation where we are looking at diplomas costing the better part of $10 million, where a college has $46 million of receipts from the Commonwealth but graduates only five students. That is at least a situation where you have to say their productivity is very high when it comes to rorting.


I put to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that these are the types of issues that should be studied carefully. If we are being asked to consider further deregulation in the international student area, we should consider carefully the implications of that. This is not a new problem. We know that these are matters that have dogged the development of the ESOS Act, the subject of the bills inquiry. The history of the current act is one of ongoing iterative reform—that is, piecemeal reform. It is a bit like tax avoidance, where the taxation department has to constantly move to close down loopholes that emerge from very clever people who are in the business of constantly refining the way in which they rip off the tax system. In international education, there is a similar type of problem, but here the consequences not only are ripping off the taxpayer—the rest of us—but involve reputational damage to the whole country.


This is our third largest export industry. This is an industry that has profoundly far-reaching economic consequences. I will go around the country. In Victoria, this is an industry worth $5.6 billion; in New South Wales, $6.7 billion; in Queensland, $2.7 billion; in South Australia, $1.1 billion; and in Western Australia, $1.3 billion. This is an industry of profound significance, but, as we have seen on so many occasions, it has required a series of exposes, usually concerning unethical behaviour, to force the regulators to tighten up legislation, to change their administrative practices and to acknowledge that there are dishonest people in this world.


We have seen a series of changes. I have been involved with this question now since the beginning of the ESOS Act, which was back in the early stages of the 1990s. We have had repeated exercises to clean up abuses. Of course, the most savage were in 2006 and 2007, under the Howard government, where—and this followed an independent review in 2004 and 2005, from my recollection—amendments needed to be made. Then we had the extraordinary developments that occurred just prior to Labor coming to office. There needed to be further amendments made in 2009. The 2009 amendments required the re-registration of all institutions in the country, so serious were the claims. And then, of course, further changes were made following the Baird review, where there were some 19 recommendations. A further three tranches of legislative amendments were made in 2010 and 2011. They went to the issue of regulation of the providers and to a so-called risk management approach to registration—and we have seen how well that has served us! They went to the Tuition Protection Service, which was paid for by levies on the various colleges. There was a requirement to place student fees in a separate account to limit the amount of prepaid fees that could be collected, in order to make sure that refunds were actually available if a college went belly up. There was also a requirement to strengthen the record-keeping obligations of providers. All were necessary changes at the time.


This government has now proposed further changes to wind back some of those arrangements, and that is essentially the proposition in this report. There is an opportunity here for us to study the details. We will be moving amendments because, while many of the changes the government is proposing are nothing particularly out of the ordinary, the fact remains that ASQA—and I have made the claim on occasions that they are a body that have not been able to track a bleeding elephant through snow, on good evidence—themselves in 2012 said that they thought about five per cent of colleges that they viewed had serious issues of noncompliance. I understand that in recent statements they have made a claim that the number has grown to 10 per cent. When people tell me that they have actually taken action against colleges, I say it is the tip of the iceberg. That is why it is so important for us to consider these matters in the proper context of the way in which this industry actually operates.


The Federal Police have laid charges relating to fraud in the vocational education sector against three individuals just in this year. An extremely high level of proof is required for a fraud allegation. For the police to charge proprietors with that crime suggests that it is incredibly serious. In the case of the Australia Post affair, it is quite clear that the charges were warranted. Yet we are being asked to consider a bill which winds back the government regulation when it comes to the protection of students and the way in which their fees are paid.


For those reasons, I want to draw attention to this report. I trust that senators have the time to read it and to appreciate just how critical these questions are in terms of their being treated appropriately and with the necessary time.


I understand that the government will bring on this bill for debate pretty much after I sit down. There are a number of speakers who will be heard today but there needs to be time to consider the amendments, and I will be making an appeal to the crossbenchers to actually look at the detail here. Do not be swayed by people who will run up to you, particularly private colleges, and say, 'Listen, we don't want anyone looking over our shoulder. We've got to cut red tape. We've got to reduce the level of compliance.' I say there is plenty of evidence to suggest why we need red tape, why we need proper quality assurance and why we need to protect this industry from the unscrupulous. They abound and, unfortunately, are to be found in so many cases across the country.


Internationally, people look to the Commonwealth of Australia to assure them that the quality of the education provided by our international education providers is sound. They also look to us to ensure the proper probity arrangements are in place. People across the world who send their students, their young people, to this country do not expect us to turn away and say, 'We're going to streamline the regulations. We're going to have a risk management approach to these questions, and if things go wrong they are isolated incidents.' We have had too many 'isolated incidents' for us to take this matter lightly, and a number of the submitters to this committee report make the point that there needs to be careful consideration—this is too important just to take a cavalier attitude. While reasonable changes can be supported—I think the government has argued that there are better ways of dealing with the national code and there may well be ways we can address some of these regulatory questions in a more effective way—in the case of students' protections I am not persuaded that the government has taken the necessary measures, and I am particularly concerned about the student protection service and the designated accounts.


The explanatory memorandum of the bill explains that the provision is to remove the designated account requirements. As part of these arrangements, introduced only in 2012, it says:


… non-exempt (private) providers are required to maintain an account in which all tuition fees paid by students prior to the course commencing must be kept until the student starts the course. Removing this requirement will be of significant deregulatory benefit to non-exempt providers, creating a more level playing field between public and private providers and encouraging competition and innovation in the sector.


I know what sort of competition they will create. I know what sort of innovation; it may well be a race to the bottom. The purpose of the designated account is to provide a source of funds for students should colleges go wrong.


I simply make this point: in 2009 the problems were so great that if this fund had not existed there would not be the money available to refund students at that time. There were other assurance schemes in place prior to 2012, and it is important that there be sufficient reserves available so that students are not left in the lurch. That is why, for instance, the TAFE directors opposed the removal of the designated funds. The TAFE directors said:


In the current environment where there is so much public concern surrounding the actions of some less reputable private education providers, TDA feels it imperative that the requirement for retaining pre-paid student fees in a ‘designated account’ remains.


That is a proposition that I believe this Senate should take very seriously.


Of course we know that with limits on the collection of prepaid fees retained that the removal of the requirement to hold fees in the designated account reduces the risks of default and provides opportunities for us to be able to put real meaning behind quality assurance and student protection when it comes to colleges that are not able to meet their obligations to the students they have enrolled.


So I would urge the Senate to give very, very careful consideration to this bill. And that is why the government trying to slip in this little stunt should be clearly identified for what it is.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Sterle
):  It is, Senator Carr.




Senator KIM CARR:
  Thank you very much. It may be somewhat unorthodox to speak to such a motion, but not quite as unorthodox as for the government to bring in a report in this manner—a report which then goes to a bill on which the government wishes to bring off a debate immediately. It may well be unorthodox as well given this importance of this issue. This is a bill that goes to our third largest export industry, and it is important, therefore, when we consider the report of a Senate education committee on this industry that senators actually get time to read the report, because it is more than likely that senators will not be aware that this report is being tabled and that people are seeking to have it printed so that the government can then bring on this bill.


This is a bill which, as I say, has quite considerable and far-reaching implications. The Senate committee has looked at this bill, having had the matter referred to it a little over a month ago, on 15 October. The report is based on the work of some 27 submitters, for a bill which has a start-up date for the private sector of the middle of next year. Yet the government wants to bring this bill in immediately after consideration of this report—a report most senators will not even know has been tabled.


I am particularly concerned that senators have the opportunity to look at the Labor Party's additional comments in regard to this report, because it goes to quite significant issues about the government's attempts to deregulate aspects of this industry. Given the government's experience in deregulation in higher education, this is a matter I would have thought would be of some interest to senators and would not be allowed to slip through without consideration of the issues involved.


This is a bill that seeks to reduce the level of regulation, particularly for private colleges operating in the international area. International education, as I have indicated, is of such vital concern. If there had been no problems here, one could reasonably expect that, upon discussion with the opposition, these matters could be dealt with in the manner which the government may well be proposing. But that has not happened, because there have been some 54 colleges that have gone belly up in one form or another since 2007.

On 10 December 2013, the Sydney Technical Institute had its renewals rejected. On 22 November 2012, Milton College fell over because of business failure. On 10 December 2013, Ashmark Institute also lost its registration.


So these are quite serious matters which go to the very heart of our education system, because they affect our international reputation. But it is not just there.

Cornerstone and Empower were trading in different names but were essentially the same entity. They received some $46 million in VET FEE-HELP assistance but only managed to graduate five students. I have complained in the past about the $100,000 degrees, but I have argued that in the VET FEE-HELP area we have seen examples of million-dollar diplomas.

Question agreed to.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,COMMITTEES,4,2
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:35):  I would like to say a few words on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015, quite independently from what I have just said! Hopefully by now senators might actually be reaching for the detail of this report. And if senators are not reaching for it, maybe their staff might be so they can actually look at the detail of it.


Labor does not oppose the goal of streamlining all of the different aspects. We have to acknowledge that circumstances change. As I have indicated, a bit like tax avoidance, one has to recognise that there are different circumstances that need to be met. But we strongly urge the government to revise this package, because its presence in this form is likely to aggravate the problems the bill has sought to resolve. In particular, Labor has great doubts about the effect of removing the requirement that private providers must hold tuition fees paid before the commencement of a course in a designated account. I will be moving amendments to strip that provision from the legislation.


We also have concern about the consequences of lifting the prohibition on the provider receiving more than 50 per cent of the tuition fees before a course begins. While we do not oppose the measure outright, we have doubts about how it will actually operate. It will be a challenge to the regulators to ensure that provisions are not abused. These bills take us down a path that has become, regrettably, all too familiar under this government. Under the guise of cutting red tape and removing supposed burdensome regulation the proposed legislative change opens the door to further abuses. This is what happened in the ill-considered attempt to change the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Authority.


In that case, fortunately, the undermining of TEQSA was prevented because the government accepted criticisms of the bill that Labor had made, and amended it accordingly. The government in this case has no interest whatsoever in looking at the perhaps unintended consequences of their folly.


I hope the government will, however, demonstrate a willingness to consider the bills before the chamber. The question arises: why does the government keep trying to dismantle robust regulatory frameworks for the provision of educational services? The answer can only be that the government's ideological preference for private provision blinds it to the abuses that manifestly occur when there is inadequate regulation to maintain standards and protect students.


Last year's TEQSA bill risked repeating that lamentable history of the Howard government, when a flood of shonky providers threatened to undermine the reputation of the entire international education industry. Some senators will remember the saga of Greenwich University, which was a scam degree factory operating out of Norfolk Island and which the Howard government allowed to run rampant for four years. It is not the only example of dodgy practices—merely the most bizarre.


Between 2008 and 2011, 54 providers of educational services for overseas students collapsed, affecting 13,000 students and triggering a major crisis in the industry. The effect on reputable providers, who do strive to maintain standards and treat students fairly, of course meant that they were often overwhelmed by the avarice and corrupt practices of the shonks and the sharks. When that practice came to light, it tainted the entire industry, the good with the bad. It is a familiar story and one which is being played through in the VET sector around the country today. That is why when Labor came to government we established the higher education and VET regulators, TEQSA and ASQA, and instituted the Tuition Protection Service and other protections for international students. We cleaned up the international education industry in this country and saved Australia's reputation as an education provider.


That is a reputation that must be protected. I remind senators that the provision of international education services brings some $18 billion a year into the Australian economy. I have indicated that it is the third largest export industry after iron and coal. It is probably the largest in Victoria. Any harm to Australia's reputation as an education provider will stem the flow of students into this country and will of course cause enormous damage to our export capacity.


I should also point out that it is important that we actually learn the lessons of history here. Senators will be aware that this is the experience of the Howard government. International students continuing to be exploited by education providers and by employers is an ongoing problem which we need to address. The Australian taxpayer and the students are defrauded. Sometimes even public agencies have been implicated in that exploitation. Only three months ago a joint operation in Melbourne by the AFP, the Australian Borden Force and ASQA resulted in three men being charged with serious migration and workplace exploitation offences. I have indicated that that was the operation on the St Stephen Institute of Technology, owned by Baljit Singh and Rakesh Kumar; and the Symbiosis Institute of Technical Education, owned by Mukesh Sharma.


Foreign students were lured to Australia with promises of receiving working visas or permanent residency after completing their courses at these colleges. Once they arrived, however, no education service was actually provided. Instead they were subcontracted to work for Australia Post, sorting and delivering packages for below-award wages. Mr Singh was a labour-hire contractor for Australia Post, which has since severed its relationship with him. But it is appalling that such an arrangement could ever have begun. Although the colleges are alleged to have provided no training, they charged international students fees of up to $10,000 as part of this scam. The St Stephen Institute was one of the higher education providers granted access to streamlined visa processing under the 2014 budget measures and their subsequent deregulation measures. They were provided special entry provisions to allow people to work as subcontractors for Australia Post and to be ripped off, and students were paying $10,000 for the privilege.


Streamlining visa processing is, of course, another one of those deregulation measures for individual students. It reduces the paperwork—there is no doubt about that—but it also increases the responsibilities for education providers. This is why Labor when we were in government did not approve streamlined visa processing from non-university providers. We were concerned that to do so would risk a revival of the shonky practices of the Howard era. Our concerns have been vindicated by the St Stephen Institute.


Senators will also be familiar with the media reports of the scandalous behaviour of underpayment of foreign students employed by the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores. Employees at 7-Eleven stores were paid $12 an hour to work in one of the most dangerous retail jobs in the country. Convenience stores experience an average of three robberies a week.


Adele Ferguson, who covered the 7-Eleven stories for Fairfax and the ABC, also exposed underpayment of the delivery drivers for the Pizza Hut fast food chain. Drivers hired by Pizza Hut franchises were paid $6 a delivery, with two deliveries per round trip. Drivers had to provide the car and pay full maintenance, fuel and insurance. They were hired as contractors, although this was clearly a scam. They were, in effect, employees of the franchise. Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, your committee has highlighted this particularly scandalous behaviour. But they were not even paid according to the enterprise agreement. This kind of arrangement is a classic trap for international students.


In the case of the 7-Eleven workers they are typically reluctant to complain because they are afraid of being penalised for infringing their visa obligations. The government has recently passed up an opportunity to provide greater protection for foreign students. It rejected Labor's amendments to the Migration Amendment (Charging for a Migration Outcome) Bill 2015 which were passed by the Senate last week. Those amendments would have extended the bill's provisions to include people on student visas and working holiday visas as well as 457 visas. They would have included protection for whistleblowers who exposed the conditions of businesses like 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut. The amendments would have also prevented vulnerable people such as international students being hired as sham contractors, because they would not have been able to obtain an Australian Business Number. Of course, they could only be hired as staff under regular conditions of employment where their conditions under their student visas could have been checked. But the government rejected these safeguards being included in the migration bill.


So it is more urgent now that we redraft this current bill that is before us. It does not take a great deal of imagination to see how the removal of the need for providers to hold fees in a designated account is an absolute gift to the disreputable private providers. You might as well tell them to take the money and run. The operators of St Stephen Institute of Technology would have loved to have been able to operate under the regime that these bills would introduce. The government, apparently, does not lack the imagination there, does it? It does not take any lack of imagination to see that happening. This sector, however, understands the implications only too well.


In its submission to the Senate inquiry—and I quoted this this morning in consideration of the printing of the report—TAFE Directors Australia stated:


In the current environment where there is so much public concern surrounding the actions of some less reputable private providers, TDA feels it imperative that the requirement for retaining pre-paid fees in a designated account remains.


Government Education and Training International, an agency of the Tasmanian government, commented, in its submission:


The designated account ensures private providers are able to guarantee consumer rights of students in times of provider failure … the designated account should remain to provide this protection in the more vulnerable private sector.


The Tuition Protection Service, while acknowledging the view of those who want to remove the designated account obligation, argued that that remains, 'an area of potential risk for the TPS', which 'would prefer the retention of this integrity measure'.


The TPS submission noted that the worst outcome would be the abolition of the designated account obligation together with removal of the existing limits on prepaid fees which, of course, is exactly what this bill proposes to do. So the body set up to provide the protection is telling us, 'Don't do it.' And the worst outcome would be exactly as this government is proposing: that it be done.


By itself, the amendment to prepaid fee limits has the arguable merit of giving students greater choice and flexibility. That will be the government's case. But abolishing the designated account requirement is dangerous and, in combination with the removal of the prepaid fees, is in fact pernicious. Defenders of the abolition of the requirement have argued that it is not needed now because we have an Overseas Student Tuition Fund and that should fulfil the role of the previous account. That is exactly what the fund was not designed to do. It was envisaged as a last resort—not as a right; as a last resort. If it had operated this way, then—as I have said in the previous discussion—in the events of 2008 to 2011 the fund's resources would not be able to cope.  I suppose then that we would have recourse to the government again? So private providers would be bailed out by the government—is that the argument? And the real assurance scheme is going to have to be the Commonwealth budget? These are people who are making money out of students. You should ensure that there are proper consumer protections in place. As I said, this fund, the Overseas Student Tuition Fund, was envisaged as a last resort instrument.


Some may object that the majority of providers are not shonks and sharks—I have heard this argument once or twice before—and they do not exploit students the way I have suggested. Of course that is true, but the problem in this industry is not the majority it is the minority. The problem in this industry is the rotten apple in the barrel which always ruins the whole barrel. The regulation framework has not been set in place because of what the compliant majority do. It exists because of what the rorting minority do—the ones that actually damage this country's reputation and do such harm to students that they rip off. What the shonky minority does is that it destroys this industry. That is why this is so important. 


We acknowledge there are some aspects which could always been improved—I do not know a scheme that could not—and eliminating any duplication between the work of TEQSA and ASQA and other agencies through an aligning of reporting of registration requirements is more than reasonable, but the abolition of essential regulatory requirements, such as the designated account, will not result in streamlining; it will be opening the door for the crooks. 


The system will not flow more smoothly, because the rorts will come thick and fast. The government's ideological obsessions for deregulation and for privatisation are clouding its vision in all sectors of education. It refuses to see that admitting private providers to contestable funding under the proposed deregulation of higher education will mean the degradation of Australia's world-standard public university system. It has had early warnings in that regard. We have seen what has happened in Victoria with the TAFE system after the introduction of contestable funding in the VET sector. But still the government will not see this. And we see the crisis that has now developed with VET FEE-HELP. But the only interest that the government have is in tinkering at the edges of these problems so they can say, 'We've dealt with that,' and move on.


I will have a lot more to say when the relevant sections of the bill come before the chamber in the committee stage, but, with respect to the bill before us now, the wilful blindness of this government needs to be called to account. Despite the continuing media reports about rorts and exploitation of international students, the government is intent on making life easier for the rorters themselves. For the sake of the international students in Australia and for the sake of Australia's international reputation, we will be urging this government to reconsider these measures.


When these questions are put to the chamber, I trust that senators will have had an opportunity to read the minority report, the additional comments that the Labor Party has presented, in regard to this legislation. This is not an area in which we should act in haste, particularly given the start-up date for private providers is the middle of next year. What is the urgency here? Why is it necessary for the government to try to pull stunts like we have seen this morning, in terms of bringing on the committee report early, and then attempt to ram this legislation through? Why is it necessary to behave in this way unless there is a blind obsession with deregulation for the sake of deregulation, no matter what the evidence to demonstrate that there are colleges out there that pose an unacceptable risk to this nation's reputation and an unacceptable risk to students who enrol in good faith, only to find that they are used and abused in a manner which is unconscionable, even to the point now where the ACCC has had to take action against some of these crooks? Their own regulators should have moved much more rapidly to deal with this question in a timely way, to prevent these people regaining registration, in some cases, or being registered at all, in others. The circumstances are clear, the evidence is abundant and I trust that senators will consider these matters carefully given the long-term consequences— (Time expired)

Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (11:55):  I rise to speak to the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. The Australian Greens have long supported the protection of Australia's reputation as a provider of world-class higher education and training. From 2008 to 2011, a number of international students were left without either alternative placements or refunds when multiple education providers went out of business, so the then Labor government recruited Bruce Baird to lead a review into the ESOS legislation. Senator Carr has touched on some of the aspects of that review. 


The Baird review found that there were untenable amounts of risk in the system for international students. Given this, it recommended a change in regulation and the creation of a risk management framework to protect international students from exploitation and to protect students from the risk of being left without either a refund or a qualification in cases of provider bankruptcy or market exit. To achieve this, it recommended the introduction of the Tuition Protection Service, which would assist international students to complete their qualification by finding alternative placements or, at worst, reimburse them in cases where providers went out of business.


The bill before the parliament today would unwind many of the regulations around the Tuition Protection Scheme that were put in place by the Labor government in response to the Baird review. These include the ending of the requirement of providers to hold student fees in a 'designated account' until course commencement; the removal of the 50 per cent cap on the up-front costs that are chargeable for longer courses; the removal of the concept of a 'study period'; and the lowering of reporting obligations for student defaults.


The minister, along with some other voices within the sector, now says that he has renewed confidence in the sector and that these regulations are just unwarranted red tape. The Australian Greens do not agree with that. Just last week another major provider in the VET sector, Vocation Limited, went into administration, leaving potentially 12,000 students in limbo. I ask the minister: how on earth can he have confidence in such a system, in such a sector? The Liberals are great at talking about removing red tape. When it is about protecting students, they want to remove red tape, but we know what happens when they take away the red tape: they roll out the red carpet for the shonks and those who are going to exploit vulnerable students. It is all part of the Liberal Party's obsession with a deregulation agenda. We have seen it being rolled out in our higher education sector across the board. We know that, if they win the next election, they are going to revive their plans to deregulate the university sector as well, potentially opening students up to huge amounts of exploitation and saddling them with lifetimes of debt, through skyrocketing HECS fees. That is the agenda of the Liberal Party when it comes to education in this country: 'Let's remove the red tape that actually protects students and let's leave them at the mercy of the market.' That is their agenda.


The Greens are not the only sceptics here. Here is an excerpt from the NTEU submission to the committee inquiry into the bill:


Supporters of the proposal to remove the designated account and 50% rules as a way of reducing provider compliance costs and red tape argue that it is justified as the international sector is more stable than when the current provisions to TPS were introduced in 2012. While we acknowledge that there have certainly been improvements, supporters of the changes argue that the RIS is premised on the assumption that the risk of circumstances (that is, the turmoil the sector experienced over the period 2008-2011) which was the catalyst for these and other changes is now very low or non-existent. However, given the recent evidence of widespread problems within the private vocational sector … we are concerned that both the Government and the sector are seriously underestimating the current levels of provider risk.


I repeat: 'seriously underestimating the current levels of provider risk'.


The NTEU goes on to say: 


As such the assumption that it is fine to pull back on regulatory protections is being made under a false premise.


Indeed, the Australian Greens agree that this decision is based on a false premise. Due to the problems within the VET FEE-HELP scheme, as identified in the recent Senate inquiry into the for-profit VET sector, there are more questionable providers than ever before. This is a scandal. Indeed, the Prime Minister has described it as such. Yet apparently the minister still has faith and confidence in this sector. It is our belief that the minister and the government have got their priorities completely wrong here. They need to sort out and tidy up this sector. They need to stop trying to pass the buck. We know that it was the Labor Party that brought in this system, but ultimately it is the Liberals that are in government and they need to try and find a solution.


Of course, the Greens have been advocating for many years that we should be cutting off funding to for-profit providers and redirecting funding back to TAFE. The government should be focusing on fixing this sector before they start going down the path of deregulating further, cutting away red tape, as they call it, and exposing students to huge amounts of risk. That is precisely what the government will do if this is legislated for today. That is precisely what will happen today if this legislation passes. We will be exposing students to more risk when we have not even solved the problems within the sector.


If the problems within the VET FEE-HELP scheme were to be fixed, it is quite possible that providers who rely on rorting the VET FEE-HELP system would struggle to stay afloat. After all, that is their business model. Many of the for-profit providers have an international student component to their business model so there is a structural risk to these international students' qualification and tuition if there is not appropriate regulation. What happens to those students and who carries this risk?


Given the problems identified here, it is the position of the Australian Greens that now is not the right time to pursue the deregulatory agenda contained within the bill. Now is not the time to be deregulating this industry further when we have rorts and scams endemic within this sector. Now is not the time to be saying: 'Let's remove the protections and let's expose students to even more risk.' It would be reckless and irresponsible to do so. It would pose too great a risk to students and Australia's international reputation as a world-class tertiary education provider. So the Greens will not be supporting this bill. We encourage other senators in this place to join us in our opposition to this bill.

Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (12:03):  I rise to speak in support of the government's Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. We have over 2½ million international students studying in our great country. It is, as Senator Carr said, one of our great export success stories. In my own home state of Victoria we are keenly aware of the benefits of a vibrant and efficient international education system, but we are also aware that it is where issues arose and risks were exposed. As a result, we are keenly aware of the importance of having an appropriate regulatory environment for international education so we can continue to provide a world-class education to students from around the world, and particularly those in our immediate region, who seek to have all the great things that Australian higher education can give them.


International students studying at our institutions are provided with a new way of learning. Rather than focusing on rote learning, there is a lot more team work and collaboration. There are team assignments et cetera, which they do not necessarily have exposure to in their own education systems. That is in addition to the personal friendships that they make. Many of them build fabulous friendships. We have heard time and again that the relationships that are formed through studying and working together can often lead to some fantastic outcomes once people get out into their professions and become leaders. I look at the Old Colombo Plan, and indeed the New Colombo Plan, in terms of delivering on all that international exchange can provide both for the exchangee and the exchanger.


International education also provides over 130,000 jobs in Australia. It is a very significant industry. The Deloitte report, looking at where is our competitive advantage as a nation post the mining boom, identified international education as one of the top five industries that are going to provide an economic underpinning for our nation going forward. So it is very important to get the settings around this right. We are not the only place where students can choose to study. We are No. 3 behind the UK and the US. It is a highly competitive environment. Canada wants more—everybody wants more—of the international student pie, so we have to get the settings right.


There is a complex interrelationship between the various arms of government that impact on a student's decision as to where they are going to study. It is not just about the reputation of the higher education institution. It is about the visa settings, post-education and pre-education, the value of the dollar and the distance from their home. So there are a whole range of issues interplaying here. That is why I am incredibly pleased that our government has chosen to approach international education from a strategic perspective. We set up a council—a group, if you like—and we got the ministers responsible in all those different areas, as I said, to come together for the first time and start to have a national conversation around where we are going to focus with international education.


When I went to uni and sat on a university governing council, international students were seen as the cash cow. International students were seen as the way for higher education institutions to underpin their balance sheets. That is not an educative process. International students were wrongly viewed as a way to make up for successive governments' shortfalls in funding for higher education institutions. Our government has gone back to the drawing board and has put trade, education, foreign affairs and immigration in the same room and has said, 'How can we focus on building this industry from a strategic perspective and really deliver outcomes, not just for our institutions and our local economies but also for our regions and for the very students who choose to study at our fabulous institutions?' So well done; because it is an incredibly international competitive environment.


The amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act—or, as we are all calling it here today, the ESOS Act—will have the practical effect of reducing certain unnecessary regulatory burdens currently placed on education institutions. This legislation will also improve the quality and reputation of Australia's international education industry whilst maintaining protection for students. The contributions of Senator Carr and Senator Simms went to that very important issue. We do not back away from that at all. As you will see later in the week with our VET FEE-HELP bill, we are very, very focused on ensuring that international students and domestic students are protected in our educational systems. At the end of the day, if we do not protect students, they do not have to purchase international education from us; they can go somewhere else—and they will. This is a highly mobile population. We on this side of the parliament are very well aware of that. So any amendments that we are making to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act will absolutely have that at the forefront.


We want to get the settings right to protect students so that they and their families can have confidence that, when they study here in Australia at one of our fabulous institutions, it will be a high-quality experience. We want the best possible experience for those who choose to study here in Australia—out of all of the places in the world that they could choose to study in. We want it to be enriching and valuable to their personal lives and, indeed, to their professional lives over the course of whatever they do. Ultimately, we want to protect those students who are far away from home studying in a place where English is their second language or, in some cases, their third and who are far away from their usual support structures. We want to have integrity of process and an education system that reflects the fair society we endeavour to always have in this country. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that we are a government that is focused on fairness, and fair principles underpin the changes that we have put forward as part of this legislation.


In his contribution, Senator Carr made consistent reference to dodgy providers. I know through the work of the committee that you chair, Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, and which I am the deputy chair of, that this is an experience and an issue that we are very, very aware of and I know that we are both committed to ensuring that students, whether they are domestic or international, are not subject to unethical practices that seek to take advantage of a person's disadvantage. As I said, the VET FEE-HELP bill is coming through later on this week, and I am looking forward to both the Greens' and the ALP's support for the measures to crack down on those dodgy providers so that we can continually get more and more integrity into our system. We know how serious the VET scandal is. We know that the former government did not mean for these unintended consequences to occur as a result of their legislation. But the reality is that that is how these unethical operators have chosen to treat students—and we are not going to have truck with it. So we really do look forward to your support.


Senator Carr also spoke about reputational damage to our nation and damage to our third-largest export. Senator Carr, we do need to learn the lessons from history. That is exactly what these bills seek to do. They seek not to burden providers with unnecessary regulation but to allow them to be as flexible as they need to be and as flexible as our students need them to be; to be connected to industry; and, at the end of the day, to be focused on outcomes so that the student experience is fulsome and valid for them. We are not a do-nothing coalition. We have identified the cheats of the industry and the blind-eye mentality of the previous Labor government. We know that they were allowed to get away with it under the previous government, and we say to the Australian public that it will not happen again. Vulnerable students will never again be able to be taken advantage of in a heinous way. Never again will taxpayers' money be used to prop up crooked operators who tarnish our valuable and vital international education industry.


We need a comprehensive scheme—and this is the world's most comprehensive student protection scheme; absolutely—but we need it to be targeted on where the risk is. We need it to be focused on where it can give the most benefit to the international students and to those providers who employ over 130,000 Australians in our communities and provide such a significant contribution to our economy. They need to be able to be freed up from the unnecessary regulation whilst keeping the regulation that will benefit in terms of protecting students.


Senator Carr went to the process of consultation. These bills have come as a result of extensive consultation with international education stakeholders. As I have said, our government has been talking to stakeholders in international education for a very long time. Very early in coming to government we recognised this as one of the key pillars of our economy going forward and pulled together the right ministers who have been focused on getting a strategic vision for our nation in this space. We are across the detail. That is why we know what changes to make and where to make them. That is what is important.


Our Department of Education and Training was even congratulated by the Council of International Students. I noticed that, while Senator Carr was very keen to talk about the TAFE directors—who, might I say, have a bit of a conflict of interest in the comments they made around designated accounts—the Council of International Students, the very people this legislation seeks to protect and who we congratulate on coming, congratulates the department for its 'commitment to ensuring that student voices' are heard. In turn, the reforms are very well tailored to solve the real loopholes and problems. They conscientiously seek to add and continually improve the legislation that underpins the successful operation of our international export industry.


The coalition has acted on the plethora of negative evidence about the scheme and delivered this suite of bills to rectify the highly embarrassing problem. We will be tabling our report to this legislation later in the day. It was a really interesting set of submissions that we got. I wanted to briefly read some of the submissions to our committee that support the amendments the government is putting forward.


The Australian Council for Private Education and Training said that the amendments:


Are common sense regulatory reforms that align the domestic and international regulatory frameworks and clarify and confirm the roles of the regulators.


They will reduce the overlap and duplication that has been apparent. And there is overlap and duplication. While those on the other side do not see that as an issue, here on this side we recognise that when you duplicate and overlap what you actually do is waste time. And what you do for organisations that are focused on providing education is you cost productivity; because, while you are filling out all those forms for two different regulators, you are taking your eye off the prize. What you should be doing is providing a quality educational experience for international students in this country.


The Overseas Students Ombudsman said:


The OSO transfers certain complaints to the TPS, where it is better suited to deal with those complaints. This includes complaints about provider closures and complaints about an unpaid refund following a student visa refusal, where the TPS can pay the refund directly to the student.


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection noted that the amendments reflect Australia's visa program. They said:


Increasing the flexibility of education providers to claim more than 50 per cent of tuition fees upfront complements Australia's student visa framework, in which some students are required to show that they have sufficient financial resources to cover course fees, living expenses and travel costs in order to obtain a student visa. The financial requirements for student visas are designed to reduce the risk of international students experiencing financial hardship while in Australia and ensure that international students have adequate financial support for the duration of their studies.


Another inquiry that the committee is looking at goes to working visas. We heard about the shonky practices of 7-Eleven. In certain countries it was promoted that you would have no problems at all in Australia as an international student getting a job. You really did not need to worry too much about having enough money in the bank account to cover your full costs because you could always get job. What we have seen is those students absolutely exploited over a long period of time with respect to that. They are having to take on work that is not appropriately or legally renumerated, which is a great shame. We need to ensure that the legislation surrounding and regulating international students' education does complement our visa program.


Australian Government Schools International noted that often it is not the students themselves who are responsible for paying for their courses but parents, governments or other organisations, all of whom might prefer the option to pay all fees up-front upfront. Their evidence is that 'removing the restriction on payments of 50 per cent of tuition fees provides parents and students with greater choice and flexibility'. Here on this side we understand that flexibility, particularly in education, is fundamental.


When I went to uni to study science in Melbourne, I had to be there from nine to five. It was not a 20-hour a week course. I had to be there on campus. I had to move away from home if I needed to et cetera. Going back to study as a mature age student the flexible options were fantastic because by then I was a parent of many young children—fabulous young adults now—and I needed the flexibility. I was living in regional Australia, so I needed the flexibility afforded by online options and indeed studying on weekends or studying at night—being able to fit into my own life. That increasingly over time is exactly where higher education has had to position itself in order to meet the expectations, not just of international students, but also of our domestic student cohort. Funnily enough, it fits in with our government's focus on having an agile economy that meets the demands of our citizenry and our economy.


Universities Australia also noted that parents would prefer to make payments of more than 50 per cent and, because of the difficulty of getting funds out of some countries due to internal unrest or restriction, some parents would prefer to make tuition payments up front rather than leaving large sums of money in students' everyday accounts in Australia. That is a very sensible common sense approach to the reality of what we are dealing with, that these people are not growing up in the very comfortable leafy suburbs which the Greens represent or even in the suburbs the Labor Party represents. These students come from places where the stability of financial institutions and the stability of the wider society cannot be guaranteed. 


The Independent Schools Council of Australia and the Australian Council for Private Education and Training also made positive comments. The report will be handed down later today. Obviously, as a government senator, I am incredibly proud of the legislation which seeks to get the balance right between protecting students and growing our industry.

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:23):  I rise to put remarks on the record as a Labor senator in regard to Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. 'Streamlining regulation' is the part which first caught my attention and I worry about what that might mean for who gets the benefit and who ends up paying the cost. One of the things we have seen on occasion after occasion since the election of the Abbott-Turnbull government is days where they have heralded great advances for the nation in terms of cutting red tape. In the midst of their haste to cut red tape—which is also sometimes very necessary regulation to ensure that people have the safety and protection against very powerful interests that would exploit them—we have already seen this government throw the baby out with the bathwater on more than one occasion. That is why we need to pay close attention to this legislation and to watch carefully what it is the government say they are seeking to do and what the unintended consequences of them, in their haste, pressing forward may end up costing those who need the protection of regulation that this government seem too hastily ready to remove from too much legislation.


Let us have a look at what ESOS is—the term we use for 'education services for overseas students'—and why it is such of an important debate for our country today. The fact that international education is our highest earning service in terms of export means that this bill requires incredible scrutiny. We know that the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2002 and the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2007 were instrumental in establishing obligations on Australian institutions to make sure that international students received services of a high quality.


This is an area where students have not always been guaranteed access to high-quality education nor access to processes that were transparent and enabling and gave them a right to ask questions about the quality of the services they were receiving and to ensure that funds they provided for courses were being properly spent and well allocated to their education. The ESOS Act was established to make sure that tuition assurance and refunds for overseas students were available.


I want to make some remarks on Labor's amendment, foreshadowed by the minister in the chamber this morning, which will go to the fifth schedule in the act, talking about the need for providers to keep fees in a separate account. It goes to the first principle of why the act was established in the first place. Sometimes, like the great romances people might have, they might start off wonderfully but when things start to fall apart, there needs to be a way for there to be redress, where a parting of the ways can be done in a way which does not unduly benefit one over the other. Sadly international students often arrive with a language disadvantage and a language set of practices that do not enable them to fight big institutions and perhaps because of a lack of understanding about the processes in Australia, they were required by legislation to have greater protections wrapped around them.


The other role of ESOS when it was established was to protect and enhance Australia's reputation for excellence in education and training services. I know there has been sufficient commentary already about the critical demand for providing assurances of the quality of the experience people are going to have when they come to university in Australia. The foreshadowing of changes to the VET legislation, which in my view are way too late, by a very tardy government in regard to the VET sector, contrast markedly with their haste to change things with this legislation and their haste particularly in their early period of government to get rid of protections from all sorts of legislation. We want to make sure that this significant industry, this significant enabler of learning right across the globe, which we are a part of, maintains its standards and improves constantly on those standards in a highly competitive environment.


The role of ESOS originally was also to ensure that educational institutions report information that is necessary to support the administration of immigration laws in regard to student visas. That was a critical part of it. Labor will always look at this legislation making sure that there is due regard given to that dimension of it. I put on the record my incredible concern about the exploitation of students who are on student visas who are now a part of the conversation in the public place about the 7-Eleven franchise chain. I know that the Acting Deputy President, in her role as the chair of the Education and Employment References Committee, is leading a very significant inquiry into the practices of a company that has decided that the exploitation of student workers for their own purposes is a ripe ground for growing their business in the most unethical way.


Here we have students coming to university—clearly intellectually capable students, though they might lack a degree of cultural knowledge about what a fair wage is in Australia—who have been engaged by franchisees. With their wages being paid by head office—let's not let head office off the hook, as well—those students have had their visa status used against them. This plays into other action from the government, and is why our looking very carefully at this piece of legislation is so important. Those very students who are going to be disadvantaged by the 7-Eleven chain continuing this practice are the students who are desperately in need of this government giving them a visa amnesty. Yet we have a government that refuses to do that.


So students can be vulnerable in a number of ways, not just in their interactions with the institutions at which they seek to study but also in terms of exploitation of the fact that they are on a visa, and a visa with very specific restrictions. This visa says they are allowed to work for no more than 40 hours over a two-week period, and when they have broken that arrangement—often unknowingly, by coercion by their employer—they find themselves in a situation where they have no power. They are just looking for a little income to feed and clothe themselves and to pay for the necessities for their study so as not to be a burden on their families back home, and they are being exploited.


So it is not all good news in this sector. I have had students say to me: 'I thought that I would come to this country and that I would find a fair and free democracy; that my wages would be safe.' Yet what we are seeing is wage fraud being perpetrated on these students. So before we start throwing out regulation—because this government said that they are going to come in and cut regulation, as if that is going to absolutely transform the lives of every person in the country in a positive way—we need to give it the due scrutiny it deserves.


Why do we need this universal protection scheme? I guess the Tuition Protection Service provides both a universal and a streamlined approach to placing or refunding students when their educational institution cannot meet its obligations. This reality, the Tuition Protection Service, came into being because we had revelations of an incredible inadequacy of supervision in the sector that, in the period of 2008 to 2011, led to 54 educational institutions closing and over 13,000 international students being affected by those closures. One of the big problems is that only 11 of those 54 educational institutions were actually able to meet, or partially meet, their refund obligations. We should not forget that. The legislative change undertaken by the Gillard government in the last parliament was significant and effective in redressing that big problem. At the time there were three tiers of tuition protection: there were providers who were meeting their obligation to students; there were the tuition assurance schemes; and there was the ESOS Assurance Fund. The ESOS Assurance Fund is a critical part of schedule 5 in the piece of legislation that is being put here today.


When that ESOS Act of 2012 came in to deal with risk—and this is where Labor's concerns with this particular piece of legislation lie—it was to support the viability and the sustainability of that tuition protection scheme. To ensure that, there was a limit on the amount of course fees that could be collected by the educational institution. Basically they could not take the money and run, which is what we saw happening. The limitation was to make sure they could not collect more than 50 per cent of the total fees for courses of more than 24 weeks duration prior to a student commencing the course. It was very clearly aimed at reducing potential refund liabilities for both the educational institution and the tuition protection scheme. It also required stronger record keeping of student contact details and of academic progress to make sure that students did not just land in the country and disappear off the radar, with the money being held by the institution and no servicing of that student's education occurring. They were the reasons for the changes in 2012.


Let's come to where we are now. What we have in this piece of legislation is a call from the federal government to change this legislation one more time on the strength of 27 submissions from organisations. In principle, Labor does support the streamlining of regulatory and reporting requirements as much as they can be improved, once the sector has settled in response to Labor's original intervention with the 2012 legislation. But I have some concerns about the changes that are being proposed by the government here.


There are two parts. The first part, if we look at this explanatory memorandum, is all about streamlining registration and monitoring providers with the purpose of lining up reporting requirements and registration periods. The first response to that is that it sounds okay at first blush; if we can use new technologies in new ways that make transparency still achievable but with a lower impact on the people who have to enter, monitor and report the data, then essentially Labor would support that. This is consistent with the review of reporting requirements for the universities that was put forward by PhillipsKPA, which was one of the critical documents that was commissioned as part of Labor's consideration of the 2012 amendments to the bill. It was commissioned in August 2012 and released in 2013.


But there is a second part of the government's deregulation agenda embedded in this bill, that wants to remove a range of requirements that really affect the providers. While we have some support for those, we have concerns about the way in which that may be open to interpretation and that it may lead to a loss of security of funds for students who find themselves departing from an institution.


Some of the proposed provisions we see from this government really leave Labor senators with some concern around the removal of the requirement to report all instances of a student default, the definition of what a study period might be and the requirements for providers to enter into agreements with each overseas student, setting out the study period and the tuition fees payable for each student period. The government says that it is better to deal with this through a national code. But Labor have concerns not only because of the scale of the exercise that is undertaken and the value of the industry that is at risk if we get this legislation wrong; also the project of revising the national code is something that is being undertaken right now by the government. Without the clarity of what that national code looks like, there are probably some questions we should ask about what the current legislation might allow because it is going to draw on the code for some of its strength.


In regard to the measure amending the restriction on education providers receiving more than 50 per cent of tuition for a course before the student commences the course if it is longer than 24 weeks, Labor understand the arguments that have been put that the change is going to give students the ability to pay more. But what does that mean in practice and what does it mean to ensure that students are genuinely freely choosing to do that, and where is the point at which we can get some oversight of whether there is coercion? 


If I could go to the explanatory memorandum and look at the facts about one of the arguments being put by the government that there is regulatory failure and that they need to change it because students have limited choice on payment options. The data they source tell us that only seven per cent of students, on average, made a significant prepayment of more than one semester at their time of enrolment. Granted it does go on to say that there is significant variation by sector, with ELICOS students paying 44 per cent in advance compared to only four per cent in the higher education sector and five per cent in the VET sector, the problem here is that students really should be able to pay everything up-front. This is an imposition by not allowing them do something administratively simpler and to get the discounts that are available when you pay up-front. But if seven per cent is the number of students who are going to get the benefit of that then I wonder how broad that general claim really is and how valid that argument really is. 


That is my constant concern with this government. I have just seen them do so many dodgy things and try to sneak through advantages for those who already have the most while kicking those who have the least when they are down. I do raise some concern about that. 


As I said earlier in my remarks, when students commence their studies in Australia—and tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of students now have come through and have had wonderful learning experiences in this country under different regimes and taken back an advantageous view of Australia's tertiary sector—we all know that, from time to time, things do come to tears, things do fall apart. That is why, with reservations, Labor will support this legislation. But we will seek to amend it specifically with regard to the student's capacity to have clear sight of the money that should be rightly theirs if their course, for any reason, does not proceed, or if they become unwell and they cannot proceed, that the money that they have paid up-front, even if it is only seven per cent, should be available for them to have access to. 


We cannot allow the situation to occur, once again, where the failures of tertiary institutions were so significant that hundreds of thousands of students were negatively affected. The impact on those individual students is something that I am sure they still keenly feel and that their families still keenly feel. Their families often go without a great deal to enable one particularly gifted child the opportunity of studying in Australia. Families who have been disadvantaged by that investment falling over need great protection. 


While supporting this legislation in principle and the capacity of technology and new systems to improve and streamline the way in which students might be enrolled and their fees taken, Labor will make sure—and we will seek the support of the crossbenchers—in our amendments that the money that needs to be there when things fall away, when it all ends in tears and the milk is spilt—




Senator Xenophon:

Senator O'NEILL:
  A great title for a novel—that students and their families who are investing in them and their futures can access a fair and timely response and secure the funding return that is their just due.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:43):  I have a short contribution to make in respect of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. I support the second reading of this bill but I do have a number of concerns in relation to the bill, in particular the removal of the requirement for private providers to keep fees paid by students in a designated account—a matter that was raised by Senator O'Neill. I will address my concerns shortly but, to begin with, it is important to reflect on the importance of international education to Australia and to my home state of South Australia—and, indeed, the home state of our education minister. 


International education activity arising from international students studying and living in Australia contributed $18.2 billion to our economy in 2014-15. This is an increase of 14.2 per cent on the previous financial year. In fact, I hope it increases even more with a lower Australian dollar. May the Australian dollar go below 70c as soon as possible because the low Australian dollar is good for our higher education sector in terms of overseas students. It is terrific for our manufacturing sector, and it is very important that, if the dollar keeps going down even a bit further, that just makes us so much more competitive with other countries.


Looking at the economic contribution in more detail, the higher education sector generated $12.5 billion in export income, with the VET sector generating $2.9 billion in earnings. In my home state of South Australia, export income generated from international education last year amounted to $1.127 billion—so $1,127 million. According to statistics sourced from the Department of Education and Training's website, in 2014, there were 249,990 overseas student enrolments in higher education in Australia. In the vocational education and training sector, there were 149,785 overseas students. Unless my maths is wrong, we are talking about 400,000 overseas student enrolments in either the higher education or the vocational education sector.


The Department of Education and Training has also released a research snapshot in relation to international students studying science, technology, engineering and maths, or the STEM subjects, in Australia. The research revealed:


In 2014, 31.5% of all postgraduate research students at Australian higher education institutions were international students. Even higher proportions were in STEM fields, including Engineering and Related Technologies (54.2%), Information Technology (51.6%) and Agriculture, Environmental & Related studies (45.6%) …


Given the importance of international education activity to Australia's economy and Australia's reputation abroad, it is essential we have a framework in place that ensures its administration and regulation is appropriate and robust. The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015, the bill that we are now debating, seeks to amend a number of acts that regulate the international education sector. These amendments will create education services for overseas students agencies, who will have direct responsibility for education providers' registration and for monitoring education providers' compliance with their obligations under the various acts. Education services for overseas students agencies will include the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency and the Australian Skills Quality Authority. By clarifying that these two bodies have direct responsibility for registering providers and monitoring compliance of providers, this bill creates more certainty in the education sector about who is responsible for what.


This bill also makes a number of amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. The first relates to decisions made by the education services for overseas students agencies. Under the current legislative framework, decisions made by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency and the Australian Skills Quality Authority can only be appealed in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This bill will allow for internal review of decisions made by these agencies. It will help to ease the caseload of the AAT by giving providers and ESOS agencies the ability to reach an agreement between themselves in the first instance. If that means fewer lawyers being involved or less legal work being done then so be it. I can say that as someone who still has my practising certificate—primarily for pro bono work, I should say.


The measures I have just described are some of the more straightforward measures in the bill. It is important to note that concerns have been raised in relation to a number of other measures. For example, in its submission to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill, the National Tertiary Education Union raised concerns about the proposal to remove the requirement for overseas education providers to keep prepaid student fees in a 'designated account', the matter that Senator O'Neill referred to previously. The government argues that forcing education providers to keep prepaid fees separate in a designated account limits the provider's competitiveness and its ability to invest in innovation in order to improve its operations. However, additional flexibility is not necessarily always a good thing, as we have seen from the collapse of some providers in the VET sector and private colleges. By the way, the overwhelming majority do terrific work, but if private providers collapse then that can leave students in the lurch and damage our international reputation as a quality higher education and vocational training provider. In relation to their opposition to this provision, the NTEU, the National Tertiary Education Union, pointed to the ongoing volatility of the private education market—although I would like to think that some of the reforms that Senator Birmingham, as education minister, is proposing to the VET sector will alleviate or deal with some of those concerns. That is why I welcome Senator Birmingham's bill in relation to this, which I understand we will be dealing with tomorrow. The NTEU are concerned that these changes will:


weaken protections for overseas students studying in Australia, and


threaten to undermine international reputation of Australia's tertiary education sector.


That is a direct quote from their submission. The Tasmania University Union argues that requiring providers to keep fees in a separate account serves as an accountability measure. In their submission to the Senate Education and Employment Committee, the TUU wrote: 


If students do not start a course they initially enroll in, it is essential that they be refunded their payment. The requirement that Universities have a separate account for the funds paid by overseas students prior to commencing their course streamlines the process of checking that students have been refunded.


Removing this process not only removes transparency from the use of overseas students fees; but also increases the work involved in overseeing refunds.


I think there are a number of good points made there by the TUU.


This bill also seeks to remove the requirement that providers not be allowed to charge more than 50 per cent of tuition fees up front for longer courses. The government believes this improves flexibility for students or their sponsors, especially those who may be studying here on a scholarship and may be able to cover the course cost up front. There are concerns that, by removing the 50 per cent cap on student fee contributions prior to a course starting, we may see pressure being placed on students to pay more than 50 per cent of fees, even though they are not required to do so by law.


I spoke earlier about the significant contribution international education activity makes to the Australian economy. In order to enhance this contribution, it is imperative that we have systems in place to encourage overseas students to be here, particularly in areas of low population and economic growth. It is an issue on which I hope to engage with the Minister for Education and Training, with Assistant Minister Colbeck and, indeed, with Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. I think that there is a compelling case in regions and states with low population growth and low economic growth—in particular South Australia and Tasmania, because we are below the Australian average for population growth and economic growth. South Australia, sadly, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation. It is a position that we do not want to be in. We face much greater challenges in employment with the demise of manufacturing in the automotive sector at the end of 2017 unless there is some urgent work done to claw that back, to keep car manufacturing in South Australia.


I believe that there is a compelling case for students in low-population-growth areas and regions to have an incentive to study in those regions. That could be that they are allowed to work a bit longer, allowed to stay a bit longer, than in other states. I think that would act as an incentive for those students to study in those low-population-growth, low-economic-growth areas. That is a matter for another time, but I would like to think that it is something that will receive bipartisan support. I know that in South Australia I have had discussions with opposition leader Steven Marshall, who has shared these concerns, and spoken to state government ministers, Labor government ministers, who similarly, I believe, would like to see more international students in my home state.


So, while I support the measures in this legislation insofar as they relate to education and overseas student agencies, I do have reservations about the other deregulatory measures being pushed for by the government. I would like to have an opportunity to engage further with the government, the opposition and my crossbench colleagues in relation to those measures. But I think it is important that we support the second reading stage of these bills and then see what can be drawn out of the committee stage in terms of any necessary amendments or sensible compromises.

Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (12:53):  I would just like to start by putting the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 in the context of the sorts of changes that the Turnbull government is seeking to put across all aspects of education in our country, whether it is early childhood education and care, primary school, secondary, TAFE or other education. In that concept, there is one word that links all of those services together, and that is 'deregulation'.


We have heard the concerns of the sector in relation to deregulation. Last week in this place, Labor asked the minister a number of questions about the casualisation of the early childhood sector. We saw in the media a couple of weeks ago comments that Minister Birmingham made previously about moving to a voucher system in primary schools. Imagine that: a voucher system, completely deregulating our primary school sector! We have seen the sorts of concerns and indeed the explosion of private colleges in the TAFE area, and we have seen in Victoria the Victorian government move to take back 8,000 TAFE qualifications.


And now we have seen—and we have fought in this place and in the wider community—the Turnbull government's deregulation of the university sector. We spent most of last year fighting their moves to introduce $100,000 degrees. Despite them trying to say that we got it wrong, that has now been shelved, but it has not gone away. It is still their intention to introduce $100,000 degrees, just not yet, because they have not got the support for it. Labor from day one, along with the National Union of Students and a whole range of other community organisations, has opposed that move, and thankfully crossbench senators and the Greens also do not support the deregulation of universities, which would make it incredibly expensive and prohibitive for a range of Australian students to attend university.


Those opposite can shake their heads, but deregulation is the key word from the Turnbull government when it comes to education, whether it is early childhood education and care—and I must say I was appalled last week to stand in this place and hear about early childhood education and care. We all know the critical impact that early education has on children from the ages of nought to three, and what did we hear from the Turnbull government? We heard 'business models' and 'profit'. How disgraceful. There was no mention of quality.


Again, we see in this place the impact of the government's proposal to deregulate international students. It is important to acknowledge that international students are big business for Australian universities. This is one thing I have learnt in all of the inquiries that we have done across the university sector, whether they were into the government's disgraceful attempt to introduce $100,000 degrees or this latest move by the government to deregulate. International students are big business, but they should not just be big business. We should be proud of the country being able to offer quality educational services to all who seek them, whether it is our own local students or it is international students.


What should be at the forefront of that experience of people coming to study at university in Australia is quality: proper, quality courses that change people's lives. I can say from my own experience as a very young mature-age student—I went to uni as a 26-year-old, and I went to Murdoch University in Western Australia—that that was a life-changing experience. That is what we want higher education to be. We want it to change people's lives, to give them greater opportunity. That is really what we want to do.


Unfortunately, we know that that requires our universities to be transparent, and it requires regulation. It does not happen on its own. It is not a trickle-down effect. It does not happen because nobody is watching, and it will not happen if we continue to deregulate our higher education sector. Of course, it should be regulated to the highest standards. The privilege to go and study at a higher education institution should be made available to many people in our community, whether they are international students or not. That should be an opportunity that is open to all. But it should be a proper opportunity, a life-changing opportunity, a life-enhancing opportunity.


That needs good, strong regulation—of course, not overregulation. That is not what Labor is calling for. It needs regulation to make sure that, when international students pay funds, those funds are protected and that universities act with great transparency and act in a proper way in relation to international students, because they are big business. Certainly, when we held the inquiry into the government's shelved $100,000 degrees, university after university told us that international students were a significant part of their student body. It did not matter if they were a rural or regional university or, indeed, a university based in our capital cities: international students were very much a core of their student bodies. We want to make sure that that core is protected—and, of course, our reputation.


We want to keep and indeed enhance our reputation as a country which is open and transparent, a country where students can come without fear of being ripped off and without fear of paying a lot of money and not getting a quality course or indeed not getting a degree at the end that is worth very much. Those are very important and they are also important to Australia, to continue as a leading country in terms of international students. We have world-standard universities and we have quite a small university body, which reflects our population, and we do want to keep that at world standard. We can name the universities which are competing at world standards and which are very highly ranked, but I think that all of our universities are at a world-standard level. So we want our reputation to be upheld. We want that quality and our reputation to grow and we want to continue to be held at a particular level.


International students make a significant investment, as do their families when sending a child overseas. Not only do they have to pay fees but that child also has to be supported either through working or through continuing to be supported at home. Families make a significant decision when they choose an overseas university, and we want them to keep choosing Australia so we have to have the highest standards. We have to have a quality educational service, and in order to get there we need regulation. It will not happen without regulation.


When Labor was in government we commissioned a review of reporting requirements for universities and, of course, Labor does support, in part, some of the streamlining of regulation. We do not want to see students and universities overburdened by regulation, but we do want to see very clear protective regulation in part. And some of that streamlining of the regulations is outlined in the bills, as recommended in that report—a report which Labor commissioned.


The second part, though, relates to the government's deregulation agenda. As I said at the outset, in early childhood education and care right through to higher education the government's keywords in those areas are not quality, protection for students or even cost, surprisingly. It is 'deregulation'.


As Labor has said, and as you will hear other Labor senators say in this place, that is a danger, as it seeks to remove a range of requirements that affect providers and were indeed partly introduced in response to the last major crisis in the international colleges in 2008 and 2009. None of us in this place, no matter where we come from, want a return to that—where our international reputation, particularly in relation to Indian students, was well and truly on the line. We had some awful protests. We had Indian students allegedly being bullied. We had collapse after collapse, with shonky operators taking the significant funds they received from international students and fleeing. We do not want to see that, because that is not the sort of country we are. We are not a country that promotes shonks and we are not a country that allows people to rip students off in that way. That is not who we are as a country. And of course, that was significant damage to our reputation. Partly, that collapse occurred because we did not have the regulation in place.


We do need to keep updating regulation. It is probably not appropriate to say that regulation that applied in 2008-09 is going to lead us forward from 2016 onward. It does need to be something we continue to review, because regulation can become a burden if it no longer matches what is being provided. But regulation in and of itself is required because none of us in this place want to go back to what we saw in 2008 and 2009. And we know already that in the era of international education we must have proper regulation that protects students who come here in good faith.


When you choose a university it is a very exciting time. You make the choice and you make your decision about what sort of degree you want to pursue, and it sets your career opportunities up for the future. It is a very exciting time, so we want to make sure that the highest standard of regulations are in place so that that decision made by the international student and their family is made in an environment they can feel comfortable in. We want to make sure they know they will get the highest-quality education and will be secure in the knowledge that they are not going to get scammed or ripped off by a shonky operator or someone taking advantage of them.


It is very confusing when you come to Australia from another country. You arrive and everything is different, and you may have English as a second or third language. It is an environment where we need to welcome students, and we need to be able to say to them confidently, 'We have good, strong regulation in place that's going to protect your interests. It's designed to protect you as the international student.' It is us saying in another way how much we value that international student and their family making that often-difficult decision to send their child overseas to study.


When Labor were in government we initiated in response to those college collapses in 2008-09 a range of reforms, including the creation of the Tuition Protection Service. Alarmingly, some of the requirements in this bill seek to remove those protections that Labor put in place.


We have seen another form of exploitation of international students in this country with the appalling and shocking exploitation of students by 7-Eleven. We heard in evidence that students were getting paid $12 an hour. The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the union in the retail sector, told us that they had calculated for one of those international students that he was working for about $5 or $6 an hour. That is shameful, and I am not suggesting for one minute that anyone in this place thinks that is okay, but it does demonstrate that where international students are concerned there is a market for some who are unscrupulous to exploit them. In the 7-Eleven case, we have already heard in evidence just from the Fels panel that they have done underpayments for 101 students, and that amount of underpayment is more than $2 million. I think people perhaps do not appreciate that these are low-paid jobs. These are jobs where students are earning about $20 an hour, so, to get to an underpayment of around $23,000 per student, which is what the Fels panel is telling us, is a staggering underpayment.


We have also heard, in relation to 7-Eleven's international students, how they were forced to work more than 20 hours a week, breaching their visa conditions, putting at risk their university career and degree, putting at risk all the money their family had got together to enable that student to come to Australia to study—all of that put at risk because a dodgy company chose to exploit them. We know that in the area of visa workers for international students the current regulations we have are not enough. We certainly want to see a beefing up of regulation there.


Of course I am not suggesting for a moment that our universities are behaving with some of the unscrupulous practices we have seen from 7-Eleven and others—Pizza Hut just last week. These are all going on now. But it does clearly demonstrate that international students are seen by some as big business. Obviously, where there is a lot of money out there, we do see elements of exploitation. In the cases of 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut, there has been shocking exploitation of international students.


That damages our reputation. It may not be about the quality of the educational experience the student is receiving, but nevertheless people reading the story—particularly a student looking at Australia as a market to come to to study next year—will take it into account. 'Gosh, I've got to work to look after myself, and I'm entitled to work 20 hours a week, but it seems that I'm going to be exploited.' That is bad for everyone. It is certainly bad for our reputation overseas and it is bad for our universities to be caught up in that kind of story. If there is no story—if people have a good story about the quality of their educational experience in Australia and a good story about not being exploited at work—that in and of itself promotes Australia as a destination that is safe and welcoming to come to. So we do not want to see that kind of thing. We know that, if we want to retain our reputation and our world-class systems, international students need more protection, not less.


Labor certainly wants to put on the public record in the Australian parliament that these bills before the Senate today remove or weaken student protections. We want that loud and clear. We do not want there to be any mistake that Labor thinks that this is additional protection for students. We do not. We absolutely believe and want on the public record that these bills remove or weaken student protections. These bills will not, as the government states, give international students more protections; they will give them less. We are very clear about that. It is wrong to argue, as the government will, that all deregulation is good. We can look back at the events of 2008 and 2009 to see the perils of not having enough regulation in place, of getting the settings wrong. None of us in this place want to go back to that situation. It is there for us to learn from, but it would seem that the government has not learnt or is not listening, because the current bills will weaken protections for international students. That history of 2008 and 2009 shows us that regulation is needed.


We do not want to see scams and rip-offs of international students. We see in the visa area that without adequate protections students are vulnerable. International students are big business, and some unscrupulous operators will take advantage. We do not want that. It is bad for all students. If there is a scam around an Australian university, that affects not only international students but also the local students who have a choice about what university they go to. 'No, I won't go to University X, because they've had all that horrible scam of international students.' It affects us all. We want a quality, well-regulated system that protects international students.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (13:13):  The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 really has two main parts. The first part is streamlining of the regulatory and reporting requirement. The opposition does give its support to that part in itself. However, the second part relates to the government's deregulation agenda in higher education and seeks to remove a range of requirements that affect providers and that were largely introduced, in fact, by Labor when in government in response to the last time we had a major crisis in the international education sector, which followed the collapses of colleges in 2008-2009 in particular. That is the part the opposition has grave concerns about, will move amendments to and will ask the government to reconsider.


When we talk about the international education sector, the international education market, we need to recognise the importance of quality—the importance of safeguarding that quality and having strict standards in relation to that quality. We know that this is an incredibly important part of the Australian economy. I understand it is second to coal and iron ore in terms of how important it is to our economy and worth some $18 billion a year. So, over and above the economic benefits that we know the international education market has, we need to ensure that, we as a country, stand proud in what we deliver and what we provide. Regulation is so important, because we know that there are those out there who, unscrupulously, will take advantage of any loophole they can find and offer dodgy courses which will lead, unfortunately, to the outcomes that we saw during the Howard era.


I want to draw on a little bit of history, though, in talking about the safeguarding of overseas students who come to study in Australia. This idea of a single framework to safeguard overseas students was first introduced by the Hawke government through the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991. It has had quite a reform journey since that time, and quite rightly so, because we are not talking about an education sector that is static or a time period that is static. Regulations must change as circumstances must change, so perhaps the protections that were provided back in 2009 or in 2012 may not be appropriate for international students in 2016. That is why the opposition takes a very constructive approach to looking at what is needed for the international student sector.


This issue, though, of standards and of safeguarding quality, I have to say, is dear to my heart. I am the daughter of someone who migrated to Australia as an international student. It was the attractiveness of the standards and the quality education that Australia provided then, in the 1960s, which made Australia a drawcard for my father, as it did for so many other people, so many other overseas students at that time.


And it has continued to be. Australia has been, certainly, right up there with a number of other countries in the world as a place to come and study and receive a quality education and a quality outcome in that process. But, unfortunately, we have had some hiccups over the last number of years. It is for those reasons that Labor, when we talk about offering international students a pathway for the future, stand very firm on the need to have 'safeguarding quality' as a key to maintaining our high reputation. Why do we do that? Because if we value every human being as equal to ourselves then we would want the same standards provided in higher education to those students coming from overseas to study here as we would want for ourselves. We would not want those students being exploited. We would not want those students to receive a watered-down degree, or have watered-down protections in relation to the fees that they have paid and the educational outcomes that they have then received in return. 


That is why this kind of ideological zeal that this government has in relation to deregulation is just so wrong-ended. It is completely wrong-ended. It is fine to want to reduce some red tape. We all understand that. We all understand the importance of streamlining something to make things easier and run more efficiently for students, as well as for those education providers, but, to me, talking about deregulation speaks of weakening those necessary and effective protections for overseas students that are needed now more than ever.


We do not want in this place—and I am sure I speak for all senators—a repeat of what occurred during the Howard era with all of those terrible scams that were put out through those colleges operating at the time, which, as we know, culminated in not only a major economic crisis but also an educational crisis with the international education enrolments collapsing at that time. I think it was, if we look back, an issue of naivety on behalf of the Howard government at that time, which Labor, when it came into government, had to fix up in a fairly major way. Between 2008 and 2011 we saw 54 colleges collapse and 13,000 students affected, of whom only 312 students got refunds from their educational institutions.


Since then, there has also been the saga of Greenwich University, where a scam degree factory operated out of Norfolk Island, which the Howard government allowed to run rampant, I understand, for some four years. It was not only an example of dodgy practice—it was really quite a bizarre situation.


I think that the efforts of all of the reputable providers who strive day in, day out, to maintain high standards, treat students fairly and with dignity are tainted, unfortunately, when there is some dodgy education provider in the mix. That is a shameful thing—when we know that there are so many good education providers out there whose reputations get damaged in the process.


Unfortunately, there have been too many familiar stories in this space, though. It is that concern that I certainly have. I know that Senator Lines also touched on issues to do with the recent sham with contracting arrangements at 7-Eleven. We saw something similar with Australia Post as well recently, with international students being exploited. Even though we are aware of some of these cases—7-Eleven, educational colleges, Australia Post—it raises the question of how many scams or exploitations of international students we are not aware of. This is only what is being reported and what has been found out. We know that there could indeed be a number of reports that go hidden, and in that sense we are left in a cloud of secrecy.


So I do raise the importance of the additional comments that were provided in the Senate committee report on this bill. They went into some detail as to what Labor's position is—the fact that we support the positive elements of this bill but that we want the government to reconsider those provisions that we do not see as reasonable. Anything that is reasonable, of course, we would support, but we have that anxiety, as I mentioned, about the potential consequences of the deregulation agenda of this government.


If I can reiterate the position that Senator Carr spoke of here and that our shadow assistant minister for higher education spoke of in the other place: we are absolutely willing to do what is necessary in relation to reducing red tape, but we do not want to see the watering-down of protections for international students, which would threaten international education, which, as I said earlier, is one of our biggest export industries. So we reserve the right to make those amendments here in the Senate in that regard.


Any harm to Australia's reputation as an education provider will really stem the increasing flow of students into this country and the flow of export income along with them. I am sure the government understands the importance of that, if nothing else—the importance of this market to our bottom line in relation to our economy. We know the freedom that is available to students globally now and that they shop around and look at what is the best and most affordable education on offer to them. Australia may not always be their first port of call, but we want them to make the choice about coming to Australia and being educated here on the basis of quality, on the basis of safety and on the basis that they are not exploited—that they are able to come here and live safely, comfortably, in a supported, multicultural community and come out of it at the end with a really decent quality education and an enjoyable experience as a student whilst here. That is what we would want for our own sons and daughters if they were to travel overseas and study in an institution in another country, and I cannot see why we would want anything less than that for international students coming here to Australia.


On the basis of that, Labor will support in essence the main first part of this bill, but we certainly will be moving amendments in the committee stage and making very clear the reasons why this bill is flawed in its second part. We have shown over the years that we were able to clean up the mess of the Howard government and ensure that we did not get a repeat of the collapse of this educational sector with the closure—the necessary closure, of course—of those colleges and the withdrawal of enrolments. We want to ensure that in this country we have a proud, well-functioning, properly regulated international education market that continues to provide billions of dollars to our economy. The only way we will do that is by ensuring we have good legislation, with good regulations that help make that happen, and a positive attitude to our approach to international students in this country.

Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:27):  I also rise to make a contribution on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. This is an important industry for Australia. The senators opposite are calling on us to be positive about this. We are very positive about this sector. It is in fact, as a number of reports show, probably one of our largest inbound industries in terms of capital. It is about third after iron ore or coal. Nationally there are over 420,000 students who choose to come and study in Australia, from over 193 different countries. Not only does that provide work for our educational institutions but, as someone who is involved in our foreign affairs, defence and trade committees and efforts, I believe it is an incredibly good expression of soft power and soft diplomacy, getting people to come here to experience Australia. Overwhelmingly, those people go home to their own countries with a positive experience of Australia. 


In fact, a survey of students was done just recently by the University of Adelaide, in my own home state, and overwhelmingly the students said that South Australia was a great place to come because it felt safe, things were close, the people were friendly and the standard of education was good. So they went home with a very positive view of Australia. As we have seen from things like the original Colombo Plan and now the New Colombo Plan, which has been a particular initiative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, those ties matter. Those long-term interactions with people of other countries, both the students and their families, and their employers in the future, matter because we actually build understanding between people who are going to be conducting business transactions and building relationships that will affect our economy as well as theirs.


To answer Senator Singh's comment, we are very positive about international students and education because it contributes a lot both now and into the future. In South Australia in particular it is an area that has been growing significantly. In the last year alone there has been about 8½ per cent growth in the sector. We have gone from just over 28,000 students studying in South Australia to now nearly 31,000 students in South Australia. In terms of the value to our economy, over $1 billion a year is brought into the South Australian economy. Depending on which reports you read, the estimates are that over 7,000 jobs are directly or indirectly created as a result of international students choosing to study in South Australia. That is a very positive thing for us. It is not guaranteed though. We cannot always assume that that is going to occur.


If we look at cost, for example, in a recent survey that was done of over 5,000 students from 15 different nations, two key things were identified. The first was that Australia was not necessarily the cheapest place. In fact, for these 5,000 students who were surveyed across a range of courses we were one of the most expensive places. It was estimated that, on average, around $42,000 was required by the time they paid fees and paid for their support—things like accommodation, transport or just living in South Australia. Given that people have consistently said that South Australia is a cheaper place to live compared to many other spots in the world then clearly a lot of that comes down to fees. In Singapore, for example, it was nearly $3,000 a year cheaper than in Australia to live and study. In the USA it was some $6,000 a year cheaper. This is an international market where students can choose, or parents can choose, with their children, where they entrust their children to go and study. If price is an issue—and it is certainly something that is reflected in the studies—the more expensive it is for our providers to provide education then the attractiveness of Australia as a place to be doing business is reduced.


The second key finding was that, for these 5,000 people who were surveyed, the perception was that Australia was no longer the highest in terms of quality. I think we are about No. 5 in terms of quality. Clearly, we should be seeking to help our providers in these sectors reduce their costs and focus on putting their effort into the quality of education as well as the experience for the student, so that the story that goes home to prospective students and families who may be looking to send their children here is that Australia is a safe and friendly place and that it offers quality education and affordable education.


Government policy does matter in terms of affecting those things and affecting demand. Deloitte Access Economics highlighted in one of their reports that between 2010 and 2012 there was about a 19 per cent decrease in the value of the international student sector due to changes in Australia. They said in their report that those changes were due to a number of things. Three in particular came down to government policy, which was a tightening of skills requirements. In 2010, occupations like hairdressing and cooking were removed from the skills occupation list. The number of people who were applying for visas fell from over 31,000 in 2008-09 to 693 in 2010-11. Regarding the temporary stay requirement, in 2011, students were required to prove that they were temporary residents and had no intention to stay permanently. The impact of the genuine temporary entrant requirement resulted in the acceptance rate falling—in this case from India—from 90.8 per cent in 2007-08 to only 49.6 per cent in 2010-11. There was also a crackdown with new visa requirements that allowed students who studied at bachelor level to stay for up to four years after they graduated. But because this only applied to people at university, the demand for VET subsequently decreased.


Some of those measures are valid, although at the moment there is significant debate around visas and whether we should have further reform of visas, given that some of the people who are here studying as international students and who are keen to remain are studying in areas where there are recognised shortages and skills. If Australians are not choosing to do that study and get the qualifications and we have businesses suffering as a result because they cannot attract a skilled workforce then it appears logical that if someone has chosen to come and study in Australia and pay for their education and then wants to remain and work in that sector and contribute back to Australia's economy that is something we should be encouraging.


The point I make here is that government legislation does make a difference. That is why it is important that the changes we make in this sector value what this brings. Speaking as a South Australian, I am clearly keen to make sure that South Australia retains the value that it currently has and, in fact, grows. I think the state government has set a target of around 34,000 people by 2017 as something it would like to see. We need to make sure that legislation we bring forward does, in fact, help these providers to deliver a better quality of education at a lower cost.


The reforms that have been proposed in the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 are enablers to do just that. These reforms, as you would expect, have been developed with considerable consultation with the sectors and with overseas students, particularly their peak body, over the last couple of years. Their peak body has indeed made submissions to the Senate inquiry that was conducted into these bills.


The reforms in schedule 5 of the bill are going to deliver some $76 million worth of savings to providers just through reducing red tape and duplication. As I highlighted, we are in a competitive environment, and parents have a choice as to where they encourage their children to go and study. As we have seen, Singapore and the US are both significantly cheaper on a per annum basis than Australia. So the net effect of being able to reduce the cost to providers, by some $76 million each year, will go some way to helping them to make sure that Australia remains an attractive place for people to send their children. That also means that, rather than duplicating efforts and dealing with red tape, these providers can spend more time improving the quality of the education that they are delivering. The Council of International Students, who were one of the groups consulted, indicated in their submission to the Senate inquiry that they do not see that this bill in any way weakens student protections. In fact, they welcomed aspects of the bill, such as the flexibility in terms of being able to provide more than 50 per cent of their course fees up-front if they wish to.


I will go through some of the particulars of the bill, but I thought it was important to set that broad context first. It is important for Australia, and it is particularly important for South Australia. We value it and we recognise that it needs to be affordable and quality, and one of the ways to achieve that is to get rid of unnecessary duplication and red tape. That is the target of this bill, with some $76 million of savings. It has not been done in isolation; it has been done in consultation both with the providers and, importantly, with the international student body, who are the people who are directly impacted by this. So, for those who wish to criticise the bill, it is important to recognise this does have broad support from the people who are impacted by it.


Schedule 1 of the bill goes to streamlining registration, monitoring and quality assurance processes for education providers to provide a more seamless system. This means that the providers under the ESOS Act will be aligned with their domestic registration. So, rather than having to register twice, there will be the one process that deals with both their domestic and international markets—which seems to a logical person just to make sense. The requests for information for providers will also be reduced, with external regulatory bodies being able to use information collected for domestic registration in registering providers under ESOS. When I speak to small business in Australia, many sectors, including the education sector, tell me that one of the most frustrating things is having to provide the same information multiple times to different government departments or, in some cases, to the same government department but for a different purpose. Any legislation that we can provide that means that they only have to provide the information once is just good governance let alone a benefit to providers.


Schedule 2 looks at internal review of decisions. This saves time for providers by giving them access to an internal review process for decisions taken by the regulators. It provides the option to avoid lengthy appeals processes through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal when an internal review may in fact be a better way to resolve issues and to save time and resources. Importantly, in terms of consistency, the ESOS Act becomes consistent with domestic legislation for providers.


Schedule 3 looks at ministerial directions. It allows the minister to direct an agency to focus on a particular issue in the sector. Whether it is, for example, academic misconduct or cheating, they can direct the agency to look at that issue without having to actually identify a particular provider. That provides a good balance in being able to focus their effort without being seen to unfairly disadvantage any particular provider.


Schedule 4 looks to increase the powers of the Tuition Protection Service director to support quality assurance in international education. As I said in opening and setting the context, that survey of 5,000 students and their families found that quality was one the determining factors that they take into account when choosing where to come for their study. The TPS director, who is someone who is often privy to information about the activity of providers, plays a vital role in making sure that the providers meet their obligations to students. If the TPS director sees issues that are not being rectified by providers, they can go to the regulators with recommendations that allow them to take quick action against the poor practices of particular providers. That is another way of making sure that we have a system in place that works with providers and, if need be, directly with the regulators in a targeted way to lift the quality of what is being provided. Schedule 5 goes to other amendments, which is where we see the $75.9 million in savings for providers annually. As I said, this is going to be a significant boon in terms of making the sector cost competitive.


Some of the practical issues that have been raised and are now reflected in the bill go to things like removing student default reporting. Currently, providers have to report within five days if they think a student has defaulted. But some of the reports indicate that there is sometimes uncertainty as to whether it is a genuine default—that is, a student has in fact chosen not to turn up at all for a course—or whether there has been a problem with transport or getting into the country or establishing themselves and turning up on the day. Whilst information still has to be provided, the reporting time frame has been extended to 31 days to enable them to ascertain whether or not it is a genuine default as opposed to reaching a conclusion within the first five days. Both providers and students indicated that they felt that time frame of five days was too short. Examples provided included an illness that might have prevented a student from turning up. For students under 18, clearly the welfare of that student and the duty of care of the provider to have an interest in the welfare of the student is important. So a reporting requirement of 14 days remains where the student is under 18. That measure around the student default reporting and refining their system saves some $16 million annually for the students.


One of the areas that the student peak body for international students particularly supported was allowing students to have more choice in how much of their fees they paid up-front. Currently, the law restricts providers from collecting more than 50 per cent of student fees up-front. This bill allows students to pay more if they wish. What that means is that, if there are favourable exchange rate conditions or other reasons it suits the student or their family to pay up-front, then they have the option to do that. Short courses continue to be exempt from this requirement and the definition has increased up to 25 weeks which better reflects short-course enrolment patterns. Again even this small change to better reflect what actually occurs on the ground is a saving of $1.2 million annually.


The last area in here that has a significant saving for the sector is the removal of the designated account. At the moment—unlike domestic providers who can use the fees that are paid to invest directly in the innovation and developing of their product, their facilities and the quality of the course—international students have to hold prepaid tuition fees in a designated account, which means that they cannot use it. Public providers, such as universities, TAFEs and government schools, do not have to do that. Having private providers able to invest this money into the quality of the course means that they can act in the same way as public providers do. There will still be the ongoing financial viability checks to make sure that they are a fit and proper person to run the course and have the flexibility, but the estimates are that this will save some $27.7 million annually making them more cost effective and increasing competition.


As I said at the start, this is an important sector for Australia—over 420,000 students for South Australia and more than 30,000 moving towards a target of 34,000 by 2017. It is worth more than a billion dollars to our economy. We need to get the settings right so that they remain cost competitive and they can focus on providing a quality education. I welcome this bill and we will be supporting it.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-11-30,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (13:47):  It is also a great pleasure to rise to support this particular piece of legislation and associate myself with the comments of my colleague Senator Fawcett, who was right to say it is extremely important that we maintain the competitiveness and cost-effectiveness of our university sector if we want it to maintain its position as a very attractive place for international students to come to study. I certainly want to maintain that position. 


It is one of the largest export earners in our country. It has huge upside potential to grow, particularly with the growth to our north in the Asia-Pacific region. Like many of our export industries, it stands in a uniquely geographically determined area that can benefit from the rise of Asian countries and the increasing numbers in the Asian middle class. Of course, those people, as they go to the middle class, want a better education for their children—they are no different to Australians—they want a better future for their grandchildren and they will look to other areas of the world to make sure that they can receive the best education possible so that they can live up to that potential.


I do think education is somewhat different in that it faces different challenges and risks than other sectors that are similarly exposed to that Asian growth—for example, in agriculture where the rise of an Asian middle class will certainly drive uptake of premium Australian products. As people seek to define themselves by the clothes they wear, the cars they drive and the food they eat, they will look to countries like Australia, which are known to produce premium food, to seek those needs. While that phenomenon will be there—people will look to higher quality education—another thing will happen in parallel to the increasing economic growth and sophistication of Asian economies, and that will be the improvement of their universities in Asia. Their universities will increasingly become some of the better in the world as they invest in their own institutions, as their economies become stronger and more able to invest in higher education to a similar extent than we can in this country.


That will create both opportunities and challenges for our university sector. The opportunity will be there because there will be increased demand from both numbers of students in Asia and also the willingness to pay for a good-quality education from Asia. There will also be increases in supply of high-quality education in our region, particularly in Asian countries and that will make it more difficult for our domestic university sector to compete.


Just to labour on this point a little bit, in a particular ranking released earlier this year—there are different measures of world university rankings—the 2014-15 rankings reported that two Asian universities are now in the top 25. The University of Tokyo and the National University of Singapore are now within the top two of the 25, compared with only one last year and none in 2011-12. Five years ago there were no Asian universities in the top 25 in the world and now there are two. I have not got this particular ranking in front of me for all universities, but the last time I looked there were no Australian universities in the top 25 at all. We usually have one in the top 50. 


In the top 50 there are six East Asian universities—from Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and South Korea. Now in total 24 of the top 200 universities in the world are in Asia. That is just a small demonstration of what is occurring in our region and why it is so important that we continue to support a strong, competitive and cost-effective sector here in Australia so that we can maintain its position as a strong magnet for students to come here and study. A key part of that is making sure that the regulatory burden on our university sector is not over burdensome, and is not put in place to an extent which would limit or inhibit its ability to compete with those Asia-Pacific universities.


This bill is not going to be a panacea for all those risks and challenges but it has make some important changes that will improve the competitiveness of our universities the changes that will reduce the amount of the overlap, duplication and red tape imposed on that sector. Senator Fawcett has usefully outlined what some of those changes will be. To put them in context, they stem from changes to the broader regulation of our higher education in about 2012, by which time the Commonwealth government had two type to agencies—with the Australian Skills Quality Authority and the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency—to provide overall regulatory oversight of the quality and standards of our tertiary sector. It was an important development to make sure those standards were maintained across the country. 


Those standards were in place for domestic students but of course they had an impact on the quality and standards of university courses for all students around our country. However, because we lifted the bar on the standards and oversight for domestic students, they had not been aligned with the regulatory standards we had in place for overseas accreditation. This is what this bill seeks to align. The education services for overseas students have different regulatory standards and different agencies covering that sector. This bill seeks to align those with the high domestic standards we now have in place. For example, we will allow only one designated agency to be in charge of both overseas and domestic students' accreditation—the TEQSA and the ASQA. We will allow the internal appeals processes of those bodies to deal with any complaints that may arise from the teaching of overseas students, instead of having to go to the and more costly and convoluted Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That will save red tape and costs. We will allow the minister to direct TEQSA and AQSA in regard to the accreditation arrangements for overseas students, just as the minister can for domestic students, and we will also expand the functions of the Tuition Protection Service, which functions as the director of that service, which is in place to help protect overseas students and the quality of their studies.


All of those changes would appear to be supported by the opposition, at least in the recently tabled Senate committee report into this bill. They did not see opposition from Labor senators on that committee. I welcome that support. The Greens unfortunately, in their dissenting report, have rejected all of those changes and have not proposed any alternative scheme. The Greens have harped back to the fact that a lot of these things were put in place in the 2009 review conducted into the sector, conducted to make sure that there were high standards for overseas students. What they have ignored is that since 2009 we have put in these other agencies—AQSA and TEQSA—to improve the standards of domestic arrangements. We have somewhat brought the domestic standards and obligations up to what was deficient for overseas students. So there is no need now for specific overseas student regulations. That is something the opposition has accepted and I welcome that. 


The review which led to the changes in this bill was commissioned in May 2013 by the then Labor government. It obviously did not report until after the election and this bill seeks to put in place some of the recommendations, although further consultation was conducted on those recommendations and we now have this bill. So largely supported by the two major parties in this place is a constructive attempt to streamline regulations in this sector. There are some other amendments that are smaller in nature but do nonetheless provide substantial savings of up to $76 million for the sector. Reporting time frames for complaints will no longer be just five days but will be 31 days. Students will be allowed to pay up front in full for their fees if they so choose. At the moment the up-front fees are capped at 50 per cent. While that cap will remain—that an institution cannot ask for more than 50 per cent up-front payment—if a student so desires to pay more than 50 per cent of his or her fees up-front, they he will be allowed to do so—a sensible change which allows students to have that choice. If, say, they feel the exchange rates are attractive or they would like to make the payment while their parents are willing to do so and not after their marks come back, that is a fair and reasonable change which again I believe will be supported in the Senate committee report from the opposition. There will also be removal of the strict restrictions on regulations of the study period which students must cover—at the moment, 24 weeks. We will make that more flexible. 


My understanding of the Senate committee report is that the only matter of disagreement is what is called the designated accounts at the moment. So private overseas student operators must maintain a designated account for the fees and funds provided by overseas students, to put into what seems to be a trust account at the moment—I do not think that is a term in the legislation—whereas other public institutions do not have to do that when they are offering the services. Obviously some are not really competitively neutral between the public and the private sectors and this bill therefore seeks to remove that anomaly to make sure that public and private providers are at the same level.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Where are the crooks?




Senator CANAVAN:
  The problem with the Labor Party is that they seek crooks everywhere and they just want to put regulation on everyone, including on the people doing the right thing. Why should we seek to impose more regulation on those providers doing the right thing rather than to clamp down on those doing the wrong thing? We should be rooting out the people who do the wrong thing, not putting up the cost for our entire university sector. That is what Labor are proposing to do. They are ignoring the fact that we have increased standards in universities since 2009. They are ignoring the fact that the vast bulk of our education providers have a good name and provide good services. By opposing this motion, they are dragging our tertiary education sector through the mud by somehow saying that there are sharks everywhere. Will what kind of message does that send to overseas students?



An opposition senator interjecting—  




Senator CANAVAN:
  Yes, Senator, you know a lot about sharks, I know. What sort of message is that sending when most of our education providers do the right thing? They provide excellent services and we should get behind them and support a more streamlined regulatory structure for our tertiary education. (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:35):  I would like to say a few words on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015, quite independently from what I have just said! Hopefully by now senators might actually be reaching for the detail of this report. And if senators are not reaching for it, maybe their staff might be so they can actually look at the detail of it.


Labor does not oppose the goal of streamlining all of the different aspects. We have to acknowledge that circumstances change. As I have indicated, a bit like tax avoidance, one has to recognise that there are different circumstances that need to be met. But we strongly urge the government to revise this package, because its presence in this form is likely to aggravate the problems the bill has sought to resolve. In particular, Labor has great doubts about the effect of removing the requirement that private providers must hold tuition fees paid before the commencement of a course in a designated account. I will be moving amendments to strip that provision from the legislation.


We also have concern about the consequences of lifting the prohibition on the provider receiving more than 50 per cent of the tuition fees before a course begins. While we do not oppose the measure outright, we have doubts about how it will actually operate. It will be a challenge to the regulators to ensure that provisions are not abused. These bills take us down a path that has become, regrettably, all too familiar under this government. Under the guise of cutting red tape and removing supposed burdensome regulation the proposed legislative change opens the door to further abuses. This is what happened in the ill-considered attempt to change the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Authority.


In that case, fortunately, the undermining of TEQSA was prevented because the government accepted criticisms of the bill that Labor had made, and amended it accordingly. The government in this case has no interest whatsoever in looking at the perhaps unintended consequences of their folly.


I hope the government will, however, demonstrate a willingness to consider the bills before the chamber. The question arises: why does the government keep trying to dismantle robust regulatory frameworks for the provision of educational services? The answer can only be that the government's ideological preference for private provision blinds it to the abuses that manifestly occur when there is inadequate regulation to maintain standards and protect students.


Last year's TEQSA bill risked repeating that lamentable history of the Howard government, when a flood of shonky providers threatened to undermine the reputation of the entire international education industry. Some senators will remember the saga of Greenwich University, which was a scam degree factory operating out of Norfolk Island and which the Howard government allowed to run rampant for four years. It is not the only example of dodgy practices—merely the most bizarre.


Between 2008 and 2011, 54 providers of educational services for overseas students collapsed, affecting 13,000 students and triggering a major crisis in the industry. The effect on reputable providers, who do strive to maintain standards and treat students fairly, of course meant that they were often overwhelmed by the avarice and corrupt practices of the shonks and the sharks. When that practice came to light, it tainted the entire industry, the good with the bad. It is a familiar story and one which is being played through in the VET sector around the country today. That is why when Labor came to government we established the higher education and VET regulators, TEQSA and ASQA, and instituted the Tuition Protection Service and other protections for international students. We cleaned up the international education industry in this country and saved Australia's reputation as an education provider.


That is a reputation that must be protected. I remind senators that the provision of international education services brings some $18 billion a year into the Australian economy. I have indicated that it is the third largest export industry after iron and coal. It is probably the largest in Victoria. Any harm to Australia's reputation as an education provider will stem the flow of students into this country and will of course cause enormous damage to our export capacity.


I should also point out that it is important that we actually learn the lessons of history here. Senators will be aware that this is the experience of the Howard government. International students continuing to be exploited by education providers and by employers is an ongoing problem which we need to address. The Australian taxpayer and the students are defrauded. Sometimes even public agencies have been implicated in that exploitation. Only three months ago a joint operation in Melbourne by the AFP, the Australian Borden Force and ASQA resulted in three men being charged with serious migration and workplace exploitation offences. I have indicated that that was the operation on the St Stephen Institute of Technology, owned by Baljit Singh and Rakesh Kumar; and the Symbiosis Institute of Technical Education, owned by Mukesh Sharma.


Foreign students were lured to Australia with promises of receiving working visas or permanent residency after completing their courses at these colleges. Once they arrived, however, no education service was actually provided. Instead they were subcontracted to work for Australia Post, sorting and delivering packages for below-award wages. Mr Singh was a labour-hire contractor for Australia Post, which has since severed its relationship with him. But it is appalling that such an arrangement could ever have begun. Although the colleges are alleged to have provided no training, they charged international students fees of up to $10,000 as part of this scam. The St Stephen Institute was one of the higher education providers granted access to streamlined visa processing under the 2014 budget measures and their subsequent deregulation measures. They were provided special entry provisions to allow people to work as subcontractors for Australia Post and to be ripped off, and students were paying $10,000 for the privilege.


Streamlining visa processing is, of course, another one of those deregulation measures for individual students. It reduces the paperwork—there is no doubt about that—but it also increases the responsibilities for education providers. This is why Labor when we were in government did not approve streamlined visa processing from non-university providers. We were concerned that to do so would risk a revival of the shonky practices of the Howard era. Our concerns have been vindicated by the St Stephen Institute.


Senators will also be familiar with the media reports of the scandalous behaviour of underpayment of foreign students employed by the 7-Eleven chain of convenience stores. Employees at 7-Eleven stores were paid $12 an hour to work in one of the most dangerous retail jobs in the country. Convenience stores experience an average of three robberies a week.


Adele Ferguson, who covered the 7-Eleven stories for Fairfax and the ABC, also exposed underpayment of the delivery drivers for the Pizza Hut fast food chain. Drivers hired by Pizza Hut franchises were paid $6 a delivery, with two deliveries per round trip. Drivers had to provide the car and pay full maintenance, fuel and insurance. They were hired as contractors, although this was clearly a scam. They were, in effect, employees of the franchise. Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, your committee has highlighted this particularly scandalous behaviour. But they were not even paid according to the enterprise agreement. This kind of arrangement is a classic trap for international students.


In the case of the 7-Eleven workers they are typically reluctant to complain because they are afraid of being penalised for infringing their visa obligations. The government has recently passed up an opportunity to provide greater protection for foreign students. It rejected Labor's amendments to the Migration Amendment (Charging for a Migration Outcome) Bill 2015 which were passed by the Senate last week. Those amendments would have extended the bill's provisions to include people on student visas and working holiday visas as well as 457 visas. They would have included protection for whistleblowers who exposed the conditions of businesses like 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut. The amendments would have also prevented vulnerable people such as international students being hired as sham contractors, because they would not have been able to obtain an Australian Business Number. Of course, they could only be hired as staff under regular conditions of employment where their conditions under their student visas could have been checked. But the government rejected these safeguards being included in the migration bill.


So it is more urgent now that we redraft this current bill that is before us. It does not take a great deal of imagination to see how the removal of the need for providers to hold fees in a designated account is an absolute gift to the disreputable private providers. You might as well tell them to take the money and run. The operators of St Stephen Institute of Technology would have loved to have been able to operate under the regime that these bills would introduce. The government, apparently, does not lack the imagination there, does it? It does not take any lack of imagination to see that happening. This sector, however, understands the implications only too well.


In its submission to the Senate inquiry—and I quoted this this morning in consideration of the printing of the report—TAFE Directors Australia stated:


In the current environment where there is so much public concern surrounding the actions of some less reputable private providers, TDA feels it imperative that the requirement for retaining pre-paid fees in a designated account remains.


Government Education and Training International, an agency of the Tasmanian government, commented, in its submission:


The designated account ensures private providers are able to guarantee consumer rights of students in times of provider failure … the designated account should remain to provide this protection in the more vulnerable private sector.


The Tuition Protection Service, while acknowledging the view of those who want to remove the designated account obligation, argued that that remains, 'an area of potential risk for the TPS', which 'would prefer the retention of this integrity measure'.


The TPS submission noted that the worst outcome would be the abolition of the designated account obligation together with removal of the existing limits on prepaid fees which, of course, is exactly what this bill proposes to do. So the body set up to provide the protection is telling us, 'Don't do it.' And the worst outcome would be exactly as this government is proposing: that it be done.


By itself, the amendment to prepaid fee limits has the arguable merit of giving students greater choice and flexibility. That will be the government's case. But abolishing the designated account requirement is dangerous and, in combination with the removal of the prepaid fees, is in fact pernicious. Defenders of the abolition of the requirement have argued that it is not needed now because we have an Overseas Student Tuition Fund and that should fulfil the role of the previous account. That is exactly what the fund was not designed to do. It was envisaged as a last resort—not as a right; as a last resort. If it had operated this way, then—as I have said in the previous discussion—in the events of 2008 to 2011 the fund's resources would not be able to cope.  I suppose then that we would have recourse to the government again? So private providers would be bailed out by the government—is that the argument? And the real assurance scheme is going to have to be the Commonwealth budget? These are people who are making money out of students. You should ensure that there are proper consumer protections in place. As I said, this fund, the Overseas Student Tuition Fund, was envisaged as a last resort instrument.


Some may object that the majority of providers are not shonks and sharks—I have heard this argument once or twice before—and they do not exploit students the way I have suggested. Of course that is true, but the problem in this industry is not the majority it is the minority. The problem in this industry is the rotten apple in the barrel which always ruins the whole barrel. The regulation framework has not been set in place because of what the compliant majority do. It exists because of what the rorting minority do—the ones that actually damage this country's reputation and do such harm to students that they rip off. What the shonky minority does is that it destroys this industry. That is why this is so important. 


We acknowledge there are some aspects which could always been improved—I do not know a scheme that could not—and eliminating any duplication between the work of TEQSA and ASQA and other agencies through an aligning of reporting of registration requirements is more than reasonable, but the abolition of essential regulatory requirements, such as the designated account, will not result in streamlining; it will be opening the door for the crooks. 


The system will not flow more smoothly, because the rorts will come thick and fast. The government's ideological obsessions for deregulation and for privatisation are clouding its vision in all sectors of education. It refuses to see that admitting private providers to contestable funding under the proposed deregulation of higher education will mean the degradation of Australia's world-standard public university system. It has had early warnings in that regard. We have seen what has happened in Victoria with the TAFE system after the introduction of contestable funding in the VET sector. But still the government will not see this. And we see the crisis that has now developed with VET FEE-HELP. But the only interest that the government have is in tinkering at the edges of these problems so they can say, 'We've dealt with that,' and move on.


I will have a lot more to say when the relevant sections of the bill come before the chamber in the committee stage, but, with respect to the bill before us now, the wilful blindness of this government needs to be called to account. Despite the continuing media reports about rorts and exploitation of international students, the government is intent on making life easier for the rorters themselves. For the sake of the international students in Australia and for the sake of Australia's international reputation, we will be urging this government to reconsider these measures.


When these questions are put to the chamber, I trust that senators will have had an opportunity to read the minority report, the additional comments that the Labor Party has presented, in regard to this legislation. This is not an area in which we should act in haste, particularly given the start-up date for private providers is the middle of next year. What is the urgency here? Why is it necessary for the government to try to pull stunts like we have seen this morning, in terms of bringing on the committee report early, and then attempt to ram this legislation through? Why is it necessary to behave in this way unless there is a blind obsession with deregulation for the sake of deregulation, no matter what the evidence to demonstrate that there are colleges out there that pose an unacceptable risk to this nation's reputation and an unacceptable risk to students who enrol in good faith, only to find that they are used and abused in a manner which is unconscionable, even to the point now where the ACCC has had to take action against some of these crooks? Their own regulators should have moved much more rapidly to deal with this question in a timely way, to prevent these people regaining registration, in some cases, or being registered at all, in others. The circumstances are clear, the evidence is abundant and I trust that senators will consider these matters carefully given the long-term consequences— (Time expired)

"Simms, Sen Robert",AG,2015-11-30,"



Senator SIMMS
 (South Australia) (11:55):  I rise to speak to the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. The Australian Greens have long supported the protection of Australia's reputation as a provider of world-class higher education and training. From 2008 to 2011, a number of international students were left without either alternative placements or refunds when multiple education providers went out of business, so the then Labor government recruited Bruce Baird to lead a review into the ESOS legislation. Senator Carr has touched on some of the aspects of that review. 


The Baird review found that there were untenable amounts of risk in the system for international students. Given this, it recommended a change in regulation and the creation of a risk management framework to protect international students from exploitation and to protect students from the risk of being left without either a refund or a qualification in cases of provider bankruptcy or market exit. To achieve this, it recommended the introduction of the Tuition Protection Service, which would assist international students to complete their qualification by finding alternative placements or, at worst, reimburse them in cases where providers went out of business.


The bill before the parliament today would unwind many of the regulations around the Tuition Protection Scheme that were put in place by the Labor government in response to the Baird review. These include the ending of the requirement of providers to hold student fees in a 'designated account' until course commencement; the removal of the 50 per cent cap on the up-front costs that are chargeable for longer courses; the removal of the concept of a 'study period'; and the lowering of reporting obligations for student defaults.


The minister, along with some other voices within the sector, now says that he has renewed confidence in the sector and that these regulations are just unwarranted red tape. The Australian Greens do not agree with that. Just last week another major provider in the VET sector, Vocation Limited, went into administration, leaving potentially 12,000 students in limbo. I ask the minister: how on earth can he have confidence in such a system, in such a sector? The Liberals are great at talking about removing red tape. When it is about protecting students, they want to remove red tape, but we know what happens when they take away the red tape: they roll out the red carpet for the shonks and those who are going to exploit vulnerable students. It is all part of the Liberal Party's obsession with a deregulation agenda. We have seen it being rolled out in our higher education sector across the board. We know that, if they win the next election, they are going to revive their plans to deregulate the university sector as well, potentially opening students up to huge amounts of exploitation and saddling them with lifetimes of debt, through skyrocketing HECS fees. That is the agenda of the Liberal Party when it comes to education in this country: 'Let's remove the red tape that actually protects students and let's leave them at the mercy of the market.' That is their agenda.


The Greens are not the only sceptics here. Here is an excerpt from the NTEU submission to the committee inquiry into the bill:


Supporters of the proposal to remove the designated account and 50% rules as a way of reducing provider compliance costs and red tape argue that it is justified as the international sector is more stable than when the current provisions to TPS were introduced in 2012. While we acknowledge that there have certainly been improvements, supporters of the changes argue that the RIS is premised on the assumption that the risk of circumstances (that is, the turmoil the sector experienced over the period 2008-2011) which was the catalyst for these and other changes is now very low or non-existent. However, given the recent evidence of widespread problems within the private vocational sector … we are concerned that both the Government and the sector are seriously underestimating the current levels of provider risk.


I repeat: 'seriously underestimating the current levels of provider risk'.


The NTEU goes on to say: 


As such the assumption that it is fine to pull back on regulatory protections is being made under a false premise.


Indeed, the Australian Greens agree that this decision is based on a false premise. Due to the problems within the VET FEE-HELP scheme, as identified in the recent Senate inquiry into the for-profit VET sector, there are more questionable providers than ever before. This is a scandal. Indeed, the Prime Minister has described it as such. Yet apparently the minister still has faith and confidence in this sector. It is our belief that the minister and the government have got their priorities completely wrong here. They need to sort out and tidy up this sector. They need to stop trying to pass the buck. We know that it was the Labor Party that brought in this system, but ultimately it is the Liberals that are in government and they need to try and find a solution.


Of course, the Greens have been advocating for many years that we should be cutting off funding to for-profit providers and redirecting funding back to TAFE. The government should be focusing on fixing this sector before they start going down the path of deregulating further, cutting away red tape, as they call it, and exposing students to huge amounts of risk. That is precisely what the government will do if this is legislated for today. That is precisely what will happen today if this legislation passes. We will be exposing students to more risk when we have not even solved the problems within the sector.


If the problems within the VET FEE-HELP scheme were to be fixed, it is quite possible that providers who rely on rorting the VET FEE-HELP system would struggle to stay afloat. After all, that is their business model. Many of the for-profit providers have an international student component to their business model so there is a structural risk to these international students' qualification and tuition if there is not appropriate regulation. What happens to those students and who carries this risk?


Given the problems identified here, it is the position of the Australian Greens that now is not the right time to pursue the deregulatory agenda contained within the bill. Now is not the time to be deregulating this industry further when we have rorts and scams endemic within this sector. Now is not the time to be saying: 'Let's remove the protections and let's expose students to even more risk.' It would be reckless and irresponsible to do so. It would pose too great a risk to students and Australia's international reputation as a world-class tertiary education provider. So the Greens will not be supporting this bill. We encourage other senators in this place to join us in our opposition to this bill.

"McKenzie, Sen Bridget",Nats,2015-11-30,"



Senator McKENZIE
 (Victoria) (12:03):  I rise to speak in support of the government's Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. We have over 2½ million international students studying in our great country. It is, as Senator Carr said, one of our great export success stories. In my own home state of Victoria we are keenly aware of the benefits of a vibrant and efficient international education system, but we are also aware that it is where issues arose and risks were exposed. As a result, we are keenly aware of the importance of having an appropriate regulatory environment for international education so we can continue to provide a world-class education to students from around the world, and particularly those in our immediate region, who seek to have all the great things that Australian higher education can give them.


International students studying at our institutions are provided with a new way of learning. Rather than focusing on rote learning, there is a lot more team work and collaboration. There are team assignments et cetera, which they do not necessarily have exposure to in their own education systems. That is in addition to the personal friendships that they make. Many of them build fabulous friendships. We have heard time and again that the relationships that are formed through studying and working together can often lead to some fantastic outcomes once people get out into their professions and become leaders. I look at the Old Colombo Plan, and indeed the New Colombo Plan, in terms of delivering on all that international exchange can provide both for the exchangee and the exchanger.


International education also provides over 130,000 jobs in Australia. It is a very significant industry. The Deloitte report, looking at where is our competitive advantage as a nation post the mining boom, identified international education as one of the top five industries that are going to provide an economic underpinning for our nation going forward. So it is very important to get the settings around this right. We are not the only place where students can choose to study. We are No. 3 behind the UK and the US. It is a highly competitive environment. Canada wants more—everybody wants more—of the international student pie, so we have to get the settings right.


There is a complex interrelationship between the various arms of government that impact on a student's decision as to where they are going to study. It is not just about the reputation of the higher education institution. It is about the visa settings, post-education and pre-education, the value of the dollar and the distance from their home. So there are a whole range of issues interplaying here. That is why I am incredibly pleased that our government has chosen to approach international education from a strategic perspective. We set up a council—a group, if you like—and we got the ministers responsible in all those different areas, as I said, to come together for the first time and start to have a national conversation around where we are going to focus with international education.


When I went to uni and sat on a university governing council, international students were seen as the cash cow. International students were seen as the way for higher education institutions to underpin their balance sheets. That is not an educative process. International students were wrongly viewed as a way to make up for successive governments' shortfalls in funding for higher education institutions. Our government has gone back to the drawing board and has put trade, education, foreign affairs and immigration in the same room and has said, 'How can we focus on building this industry from a strategic perspective and really deliver outcomes, not just for our institutions and our local economies but also for our regions and for the very students who choose to study at our fabulous institutions?' So well done; because it is an incredibly international competitive environment.


The amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act—or, as we are all calling it here today, the ESOS Act—will have the practical effect of reducing certain unnecessary regulatory burdens currently placed on education institutions. This legislation will also improve the quality and reputation of Australia's international education industry whilst maintaining protection for students. The contributions of Senator Carr and Senator Simms went to that very important issue. We do not back away from that at all. As you will see later in the week with our VET FEE-HELP bill, we are very, very focused on ensuring that international students and domestic students are protected in our educational systems. At the end of the day, if we do not protect students, they do not have to purchase international education from us; they can go somewhere else—and they will. This is a highly mobile population. We on this side of the parliament are very well aware of that. So any amendments that we are making to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act will absolutely have that at the forefront.


We want to get the settings right to protect students so that they and their families can have confidence that, when they study here in Australia at one of our fabulous institutions, it will be a high-quality experience. We want the best possible experience for those who choose to study here in Australia—out of all of the places in the world that they could choose to study in. We want it to be enriching and valuable to their personal lives and, indeed, to their professional lives over the course of whatever they do. Ultimately, we want to protect those students who are far away from home studying in a place where English is their second language or, in some cases, their third and who are far away from their usual support structures. We want to have integrity of process and an education system that reflects the fair society we endeavour to always have in this country. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that we are a government that is focused on fairness, and fair principles underpin the changes that we have put forward as part of this legislation.


In his contribution, Senator Carr made consistent reference to dodgy providers. I know through the work of the committee that you chair, Madam Acting Deputy President Lines, and which I am the deputy chair of, that this is an experience and an issue that we are very, very aware of and I know that we are both committed to ensuring that students, whether they are domestic or international, are not subject to unethical practices that seek to take advantage of a person's disadvantage. As I said, the VET FEE-HELP bill is coming through later on this week, and I am looking forward to both the Greens' and the ALP's support for the measures to crack down on those dodgy providers so that we can continually get more and more integrity into our system. We know how serious the VET scandal is. We know that the former government did not mean for these unintended consequences to occur as a result of their legislation. But the reality is that that is how these unethical operators have chosen to treat students—and we are not going to have truck with it. So we really do look forward to your support.


Senator Carr also spoke about reputational damage to our nation and damage to our third-largest export. Senator Carr, we do need to learn the lessons from history. That is exactly what these bills seek to do. They seek not to burden providers with unnecessary regulation but to allow them to be as flexible as they need to be and as flexible as our students need them to be; to be connected to industry; and, at the end of the day, to be focused on outcomes so that the student experience is fulsome and valid for them. We are not a do-nothing coalition. We have identified the cheats of the industry and the blind-eye mentality of the previous Labor government. We know that they were allowed to get away with it under the previous government, and we say to the Australian public that it will not happen again. Vulnerable students will never again be able to be taken advantage of in a heinous way. Never again will taxpayers' money be used to prop up crooked operators who tarnish our valuable and vital international education industry.


We need a comprehensive scheme—and this is the world's most comprehensive student protection scheme; absolutely—but we need it to be targeted on where the risk is. We need it to be focused on where it can give the most benefit to the international students and to those providers who employ over 130,000 Australians in our communities and provide such a significant contribution to our economy. They need to be able to be freed up from the unnecessary regulation whilst keeping the regulation that will benefit in terms of protecting students.


Senator Carr went to the process of consultation. These bills have come as a result of extensive consultation with international education stakeholders. As I have said, our government has been talking to stakeholders in international education for a very long time. Very early in coming to government we recognised this as one of the key pillars of our economy going forward and pulled together the right ministers who have been focused on getting a strategic vision for our nation in this space. We are across the detail. That is why we know what changes to make and where to make them. That is what is important.


Our Department of Education and Training was even congratulated by the Council of International Students. I noticed that, while Senator Carr was very keen to talk about the TAFE directors—who, might I say, have a bit of a conflict of interest in the comments they made around designated accounts—the Council of International Students, the very people this legislation seeks to protect and who we congratulate on coming, congratulates the department for its 'commitment to ensuring that student voices' are heard. In turn, the reforms are very well tailored to solve the real loopholes and problems. They conscientiously seek to add and continually improve the legislation that underpins the successful operation of our international export industry.


The coalition has acted on the plethora of negative evidence about the scheme and delivered this suite of bills to rectify the highly embarrassing problem. We will be tabling our report to this legislation later in the day. It was a really interesting set of submissions that we got. I wanted to briefly read some of the submissions to our committee that support the amendments the government is putting forward.


The Australian Council for Private Education and Training said that the amendments:


Are common sense regulatory reforms that align the domestic and international regulatory frameworks and clarify and confirm the roles of the regulators.


They will reduce the overlap and duplication that has been apparent. And there is overlap and duplication. While those on the other side do not see that as an issue, here on this side we recognise that when you duplicate and overlap what you actually do is waste time. And what you do for organisations that are focused on providing education is you cost productivity; because, while you are filling out all those forms for two different regulators, you are taking your eye off the prize. What you should be doing is providing a quality educational experience for international students in this country.


The Overseas Students Ombudsman said:


The OSO transfers certain complaints to the TPS, where it is better suited to deal with those complaints. This includes complaints about provider closures and complaints about an unpaid refund following a student visa refusal, where the TPS can pay the refund directly to the student.


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection noted that the amendments reflect Australia's visa program. They said:


Increasing the flexibility of education providers to claim more than 50 per cent of tuition fees upfront complements Australia's student visa framework, in which some students are required to show that they have sufficient financial resources to cover course fees, living expenses and travel costs in order to obtain a student visa. The financial requirements for student visas are designed to reduce the risk of international students experiencing financial hardship while in Australia and ensure that international students have adequate financial support for the duration of their studies.


Another inquiry that the committee is looking at goes to working visas. We heard about the shonky practices of 7-Eleven. In certain countries it was promoted that you would have no problems at all in Australia as an international student getting a job. You really did not need to worry too much about having enough money in the bank account to cover your full costs because you could always get job. What we have seen is those students absolutely exploited over a long period of time with respect to that. They are having to take on work that is not appropriately or legally renumerated, which is a great shame. We need to ensure that the legislation surrounding and regulating international students' education does complement our visa program.


Australian Government Schools International noted that often it is not the students themselves who are responsible for paying for their courses but parents, governments or other organisations, all of whom might prefer the option to pay all fees up-front upfront. Their evidence is that 'removing the restriction on payments of 50 per cent of tuition fees provides parents and students with greater choice and flexibility'. Here on this side we understand that flexibility, particularly in education, is fundamental.


When I went to uni to study science in Melbourne, I had to be there from nine to five. It was not a 20-hour a week course. I had to be there on campus. I had to move away from home if I needed to et cetera. Going back to study as a mature age student the flexible options were fantastic because by then I was a parent of many young children—fabulous young adults now—and I needed the flexibility. I was living in regional Australia, so I needed the flexibility afforded by online options and indeed studying on weekends or studying at night—being able to fit into my own life. That increasingly over time is exactly where higher education has had to position itself in order to meet the expectations, not just of international students, but also of our domestic student cohort. Funnily enough, it fits in with our government's focus on having an agile economy that meets the demands of our citizenry and our economy.


Universities Australia also noted that parents would prefer to make payments of more than 50 per cent and, because of the difficulty of getting funds out of some countries due to internal unrest or restriction, some parents would prefer to make tuition payments up front rather than leaving large sums of money in students' everyday accounts in Australia. That is a very sensible common sense approach to the reality of what we are dealing with, that these people are not growing up in the very comfortable leafy suburbs which the Greens represent or even in the suburbs the Labor Party represents. These students come from places where the stability of financial institutions and the stability of the wider society cannot be guaranteed. 


The Independent Schools Council of Australia and the Australian Council for Private Education and Training also made positive comments. The report will be handed down later today. Obviously, as a government senator, I am incredibly proud of the legislation which seeks to get the balance right between protecting students and growing our industry.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (12:23):  I rise to put remarks on the record as a Labor senator in regard to Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. 'Streamlining regulation' is the part which first caught my attention and I worry about what that might mean for who gets the benefit and who ends up paying the cost. One of the things we have seen on occasion after occasion since the election of the Abbott-Turnbull government is days where they have heralded great advances for the nation in terms of cutting red tape. In the midst of their haste to cut red tape—which is also sometimes very necessary regulation to ensure that people have the safety and protection against very powerful interests that would exploit them—we have already seen this government throw the baby out with the bathwater on more than one occasion. That is why we need to pay close attention to this legislation and to watch carefully what it is the government say they are seeking to do and what the unintended consequences of them, in their haste, pressing forward may end up costing those who need the protection of regulation that this government seem too hastily ready to remove from too much legislation.


Let us have a look at what ESOS is—the term we use for 'education services for overseas students'—and why it is such of an important debate for our country today. The fact that international education is our highest earning service in terms of export means that this bill requires incredible scrutiny. We know that the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2002 and the National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students 2007 were instrumental in establishing obligations on Australian institutions to make sure that international students received services of a high quality.


This is an area where students have not always been guaranteed access to high-quality education nor access to processes that were transparent and enabling and gave them a right to ask questions about the quality of the services they were receiving and to ensure that funds they provided for courses were being properly spent and well allocated to their education. The ESOS Act was established to make sure that tuition assurance and refunds for overseas students were available.


I want to make some remarks on Labor's amendment, foreshadowed by the minister in the chamber this morning, which will go to the fifth schedule in the act, talking about the need for providers to keep fees in a separate account. It goes to the first principle of why the act was established in the first place. Sometimes, like the great romances people might have, they might start off wonderfully but when things start to fall apart, there needs to be a way for there to be redress, where a parting of the ways can be done in a way which does not unduly benefit one over the other. Sadly international students often arrive with a language disadvantage and a language set of practices that do not enable them to fight big institutions and perhaps because of a lack of understanding about the processes in Australia, they were required by legislation to have greater protections wrapped around them.


The other role of ESOS when it was established was to protect and enhance Australia's reputation for excellence in education and training services. I know there has been sufficient commentary already about the critical demand for providing assurances of the quality of the experience people are going to have when they come to university in Australia. The foreshadowing of changes to the VET legislation, which in my view are way too late, by a very tardy government in regard to the VET sector, contrast markedly with their haste to change things with this legislation and their haste particularly in their early period of government to get rid of protections from all sorts of legislation. We want to make sure that this significant industry, this significant enabler of learning right across the globe, which we are a part of, maintains its standards and improves constantly on those standards in a highly competitive environment.


The role of ESOS originally was also to ensure that educational institutions report information that is necessary to support the administration of immigration laws in regard to student visas. That was a critical part of it. Labor will always look at this legislation making sure that there is due regard given to that dimension of it. I put on the record my incredible concern about the exploitation of students who are on student visas who are now a part of the conversation in the public place about the 7-Eleven franchise chain. I know that the Acting Deputy President, in her role as the chair of the Education and Employment References Committee, is leading a very significant inquiry into the practices of a company that has decided that the exploitation of student workers for their own purposes is a ripe ground for growing their business in the most unethical way.


Here we have students coming to university—clearly intellectually capable students, though they might lack a degree of cultural knowledge about what a fair wage is in Australia—who have been engaged by franchisees. With their wages being paid by head office—let's not let head office off the hook, as well—those students have had their visa status used against them. This plays into other action from the government, and is why our looking very carefully at this piece of legislation is so important. Those very students who are going to be disadvantaged by the 7-Eleven chain continuing this practice are the students who are desperately in need of this government giving them a visa amnesty. Yet we have a government that refuses to do that.


So students can be vulnerable in a number of ways, not just in their interactions with the institutions at which they seek to study but also in terms of exploitation of the fact that they are on a visa, and a visa with very specific restrictions. This visa says they are allowed to work for no more than 40 hours over a two-week period, and when they have broken that arrangement—often unknowingly, by coercion by their employer—they find themselves in a situation where they have no power. They are just looking for a little income to feed and clothe themselves and to pay for the necessities for their study so as not to be a burden on their families back home, and they are being exploited.


So it is not all good news in this sector. I have had students say to me: 'I thought that I would come to this country and that I would find a fair and free democracy; that my wages would be safe.' Yet what we are seeing is wage fraud being perpetrated on these students. So before we start throwing out regulation—because this government said that they are going to come in and cut regulation, as if that is going to absolutely transform the lives of every person in the country in a positive way—we need to give it the due scrutiny it deserves.


Why do we need this universal protection scheme? I guess the Tuition Protection Service provides both a universal and a streamlined approach to placing or refunding students when their educational institution cannot meet its obligations. This reality, the Tuition Protection Service, came into being because we had revelations of an incredible inadequacy of supervision in the sector that, in the period of 2008 to 2011, led to 54 educational institutions closing and over 13,000 international students being affected by those closures. One of the big problems is that only 11 of those 54 educational institutions were actually able to meet, or partially meet, their refund obligations. We should not forget that. The legislative change undertaken by the Gillard government in the last parliament was significant and effective in redressing that big problem. At the time there were three tiers of tuition protection: there were providers who were meeting their obligation to students; there were the tuition assurance schemes; and there was the ESOS Assurance Fund. The ESOS Assurance Fund is a critical part of schedule 5 in the piece of legislation that is being put here today.


When that ESOS Act of 2012 came in to deal with risk—and this is where Labor's concerns with this particular piece of legislation lie—it was to support the viability and the sustainability of that tuition protection scheme. To ensure that, there was a limit on the amount of course fees that could be collected by the educational institution. Basically they could not take the money and run, which is what we saw happening. The limitation was to make sure they could not collect more than 50 per cent of the total fees for courses of more than 24 weeks duration prior to a student commencing the course. It was very clearly aimed at reducing potential refund liabilities for both the educational institution and the tuition protection scheme. It also required stronger record keeping of student contact details and of academic progress to make sure that students did not just land in the country and disappear off the radar, with the money being held by the institution and no servicing of that student's education occurring. They were the reasons for the changes in 2012.


Let's come to where we are now. What we have in this piece of legislation is a call from the federal government to change this legislation one more time on the strength of 27 submissions from organisations. In principle, Labor does support the streamlining of regulatory and reporting requirements as much as they can be improved, once the sector has settled in response to Labor's original intervention with the 2012 legislation. But I have some concerns about the changes that are being proposed by the government here.


There are two parts. The first part, if we look at this explanatory memorandum, is all about streamlining registration and monitoring providers with the purpose of lining up reporting requirements and registration periods. The first response to that is that it sounds okay at first blush; if we can use new technologies in new ways that make transparency still achievable but with a lower impact on the people who have to enter, monitor and report the data, then essentially Labor would support that. This is consistent with the review of reporting requirements for the universities that was put forward by PhillipsKPA, which was one of the critical documents that was commissioned as part of Labor's consideration of the 2012 amendments to the bill. It was commissioned in August 2012 and released in 2013.


But there is a second part of the government's deregulation agenda embedded in this bill, that wants to remove a range of requirements that really affect the providers. While we have some support for those, we have concerns about the way in which that may be open to interpretation and that it may lead to a loss of security of funds for students who find themselves departing from an institution.


Some of the proposed provisions we see from this government really leave Labor senators with some concern around the removal of the requirement to report all instances of a student default, the definition of what a study period might be and the requirements for providers to enter into agreements with each overseas student, setting out the study period and the tuition fees payable for each student period. The government says that it is better to deal with this through a national code. But Labor have concerns not only because of the scale of the exercise that is undertaken and the value of the industry that is at risk if we get this legislation wrong; also the project of revising the national code is something that is being undertaken right now by the government. Without the clarity of what that national code looks like, there are probably some questions we should ask about what the current legislation might allow because it is going to draw on the code for some of its strength.


In regard to the measure amending the restriction on education providers receiving more than 50 per cent of tuition for a course before the student commences the course if it is longer than 24 weeks, Labor understand the arguments that have been put that the change is going to give students the ability to pay more. But what does that mean in practice and what does it mean to ensure that students are genuinely freely choosing to do that, and where is the point at which we can get some oversight of whether there is coercion? 


If I could go to the explanatory memorandum and look at the facts about one of the arguments being put by the government that there is regulatory failure and that they need to change it because students have limited choice on payment options. The data they source tell us that only seven per cent of students, on average, made a significant prepayment of more than one semester at their time of enrolment. Granted it does go on to say that there is significant variation by sector, with ELICOS students paying 44 per cent in advance compared to only four per cent in the higher education sector and five per cent in the VET sector, the problem here is that students really should be able to pay everything up-front. This is an imposition by not allowing them do something administratively simpler and to get the discounts that are available when you pay up-front. But if seven per cent is the number of students who are going to get the benefit of that then I wonder how broad that general claim really is and how valid that argument really is. 


That is my constant concern with this government. I have just seen them do so many dodgy things and try to sneak through advantages for those who already have the most while kicking those who have the least when they are down. I do raise some concern about that. 


As I said earlier in my remarks, when students commence their studies in Australia—and tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of students now have come through and have had wonderful learning experiences in this country under different regimes and taken back an advantageous view of Australia's tertiary sector—we all know that, from time to time, things do come to tears, things do fall apart. That is why, with reservations, Labor will support this legislation. But we will seek to amend it specifically with regard to the student's capacity to have clear sight of the money that should be rightly theirs if their course, for any reason, does not proceed, or if they become unwell and they cannot proceed, that the money that they have paid up-front, even if it is only seven per cent, should be available for them to have access to. 


We cannot allow the situation to occur, once again, where the failures of tertiary institutions were so significant that hundreds of thousands of students were negatively affected. The impact on those individual students is something that I am sure they still keenly feel and that their families still keenly feel. Their families often go without a great deal to enable one particularly gifted child the opportunity of studying in Australia. Families who have been disadvantaged by that investment falling over need great protection. 


While supporting this legislation in principle and the capacity of technology and new systems to improve and streamline the way in which students might be enrolled and their fees taken, Labor will make sure—and we will seek the support of the crossbenchers—in our amendments that the money that needs to be there when things fall away, when it all ends in tears and the milk is spilt—




Senator Xenophon:
  When things fall apart.




Senator O'NEILL:
  A great title for a novel—that students and their families who are investing in them and their futures can access a fair and timely response and secure the funding return that is their just due.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (12:43):  I have a short contribution to make in respect of the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. I support the second reading of this bill but I do have a number of concerns in relation to the bill, in particular the removal of the requirement for private providers to keep fees paid by students in a designated account—a matter that was raised by Senator O'Neill. I will address my concerns shortly but, to begin with, it is important to reflect on the importance of international education to Australia and to my home state of South Australia—and, indeed, the home state of our education minister. 


International education activity arising from international students studying and living in Australia contributed $18.2 billion to our economy in 2014-15. This is an increase of 14.2 per cent on the previous financial year. In fact, I hope it increases even more with a lower Australian dollar. May the Australian dollar go below 70c as soon as possible because the low Australian dollar is good for our higher education sector in terms of overseas students. It is terrific for our manufacturing sector, and it is very important that, if the dollar keeps going down even a bit further, that just makes us so much more competitive with other countries.


Looking at the economic contribution in more detail, the higher education sector generated $12.5 billion in export income, with the VET sector generating $2.9 billion in earnings. In my home state of South Australia, export income generated from international education last year amounted to $1.127 billion—so $1,127 million. According to statistics sourced from the Department of Education and Training's website, in 2014, there were 249,990 overseas student enrolments in higher education in Australia. In the vocational education and training sector, there were 149,785 overseas students. Unless my maths is wrong, we are talking about 400,000 overseas student enrolments in either the higher education or the vocational education sector.


The Department of Education and Training has also released a research snapshot in relation to international students studying science, technology, engineering and maths, or the STEM subjects, in Australia. The research revealed:


In 2014, 31.5% of all postgraduate research students at Australian higher education institutions were international students. Even higher proportions were in STEM fields, including Engineering and Related Technologies (54.2%), Information Technology (51.6%) and Agriculture, Environmental & Related studies (45.6%) …


Given the importance of international education activity to Australia's economy and Australia's reputation abroad, it is essential we have a framework in place that ensures its administration and regulation is appropriate and robust. The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015, the bill that we are now debating, seeks to amend a number of acts that regulate the international education sector. These amendments will create education services for overseas students agencies, who will have direct responsibility for education providers' registration and for monitoring education providers' compliance with their obligations under the various acts. Education services for overseas students agencies will include the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency and the Australian Skills Quality Authority. By clarifying that these two bodies have direct responsibility for registering providers and monitoring compliance of providers, this bill creates more certainty in the education sector about who is responsible for what.


This bill also makes a number of amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000. The first relates to decisions made by the education services for overseas students agencies. Under the current legislative framework, decisions made by the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency and the Australian Skills Quality Authority can only be appealed in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This bill will allow for internal review of decisions made by these agencies. It will help to ease the caseload of the AAT by giving providers and ESOS agencies the ability to reach an agreement between themselves in the first instance. If that means fewer lawyers being involved or less legal work being done then so be it. I can say that as someone who still has my practising certificate—primarily for pro bono work, I should say.


The measures I have just described are some of the more straightforward measures in the bill. It is important to note that concerns have been raised in relation to a number of other measures. For example, in its submission to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill, the National Tertiary Education Union raised concerns about the proposal to remove the requirement for overseas education providers to keep prepaid student fees in a 'designated account', the matter that Senator O'Neill referred to previously. The government argues that forcing education providers to keep prepaid fees separate in a designated account limits the provider's competitiveness and its ability to invest in innovation in order to improve its operations. However, additional flexibility is not necessarily always a good thing, as we have seen from the collapse of some providers in the VET sector and private colleges. By the way, the overwhelming majority do terrific work, but if private providers collapse then that can leave students in the lurch and damage our international reputation as a quality higher education and vocational training provider. In relation to their opposition to this provision, the NTEU, the National Tertiary Education Union, pointed to the ongoing volatility of the private education market—although I would like to think that some of the reforms that Senator Birmingham, as education minister, is proposing to the VET sector will alleviate or deal with some of those concerns. That is why I welcome Senator Birmingham's bill in relation to this, which I understand we will be dealing with tomorrow. The NTEU are concerned that these changes will:


weaken protections for overseas students studying in Australia, and


threaten to undermine international reputation of Australia's tertiary education sector.


That is a direct quote from their submission. The Tasmania University Union argues that requiring providers to keep fees in a separate account serves as an accountability measure. In their submission to the Senate Education and Employment Committee, the TUU wrote: 


If students do not start a course they initially enroll in, it is essential that they be refunded their payment. The requirement that Universities have a separate account for the funds paid by overseas students prior to commencing their course streamlines the process of checking that students have been refunded.


Removing this process not only removes transparency from the use of overseas students fees; but also increases the work involved in overseeing refunds.


I think there are a number of good points made there by the TUU.


This bill also seeks to remove the requirement that providers not be allowed to charge more than 50 per cent of tuition fees up front for longer courses. The government believes this improves flexibility for students or their sponsors, especially those who may be studying here on a scholarship and may be able to cover the course cost up front. There are concerns that, by removing the 50 per cent cap on student fee contributions prior to a course starting, we may see pressure being placed on students to pay more than 50 per cent of fees, even though they are not required to do so by law.


I spoke earlier about the significant contribution international education activity makes to the Australian economy. In order to enhance this contribution, it is imperative that we have systems in place to encourage overseas students to be here, particularly in areas of low population and economic growth. It is an issue on which I hope to engage with the Minister for Education and Training, with Assistant Minister Colbeck and, indeed, with Immigration Minister Peter Dutton. I think that there is a compelling case in regions and states with low population growth and low economic growth—in particular South Australia and Tasmania, because we are below the Australian average for population growth and economic growth. South Australia, sadly, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the nation. It is a position that we do not want to be in. We face much greater challenges in employment with the demise of manufacturing in the automotive sector at the end of 2017 unless there is some urgent work done to claw that back, to keep car manufacturing in South Australia.


I believe that there is a compelling case for students in low-population-growth areas and regions to have an incentive to study in those regions. That could be that they are allowed to work a bit longer, allowed to stay a bit longer, than in other states. I think that would act as an incentive for those students to study in those low-population-growth, low-economic-growth areas. That is a matter for another time, but I would like to think that it is something that will receive bipartisan support. I know that in South Australia I have had discussions with opposition leader Steven Marshall, who has shared these concerns, and spoken to state government ministers, Labor government ministers, who similarly, I believe, would like to see more international students in my home state.


So, while I support the measures in this legislation insofar as they relate to education and overseas student agencies, I do have reservations about the other deregulatory measures being pushed for by the government. I would like to have an opportunity to engage further with the government, the opposition and my crossbench colleagues in relation to those measures. But I think it is important that we support the second reading stage of these bills and then see what can be drawn out of the committee stage in terms of any necessary amendments or sensible compromises.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (12:53):  I would just like to start by putting the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 in the context of the sorts of changes that the Turnbull government is seeking to put across all aspects of education in our country, whether it is early childhood education and care, primary school, secondary, TAFE or other education. In that concept, there is one word that links all of those services together, and that is 'deregulation'.


We have heard the concerns of the sector in relation to deregulation. Last week in this place, Labor asked the minister a number of questions about the casualisation of the early childhood sector. We saw in the media a couple of weeks ago comments that Minister Birmingham made previously about moving to a voucher system in primary schools. Imagine that: a voucher system, completely deregulating our primary school sector! We have seen the sorts of concerns and indeed the explosion of private colleges in the TAFE area, and we have seen in Victoria the Victorian government move to take back 8,000 TAFE qualifications.


And now we have seen—and we have fought in this place and in the wider community—the Turnbull government's deregulation of the university sector. We spent most of last year fighting their moves to introduce $100,000 degrees. Despite them trying to say that we got it wrong, that has now been shelved, but it has not gone away. It is still their intention to introduce $100,000 degrees, just not yet, because they have not got the support for it. Labor from day one, along with the National Union of Students and a whole range of other community organisations, has opposed that move, and thankfully crossbench senators and the Greens also do not support the deregulation of universities, which would make it incredibly expensive and prohibitive for a range of Australian students to attend university.


Those opposite can shake their heads, but deregulation is the key word from the Turnbull government when it comes to education, whether it is early childhood education and care—and I must say I was appalled last week to stand in this place and hear about early childhood education and care. We all know the critical impact that early education has on children from the ages of nought to three, and what did we hear from the Turnbull government? We heard 'business models' and 'profit'. How disgraceful. There was no mention of quality.


Again, we see in this place the impact of the government's proposal to deregulate international students. It is important to acknowledge that international students are big business for Australian universities. This is one thing I have learnt in all of the inquiries that we have done across the university sector, whether they were into the government's disgraceful attempt to introduce $100,000 degrees or this latest move by the government to deregulate. International students are big business, but they should not just be big business. We should be proud of the country being able to offer quality educational services to all who seek them, whether it is our own local students or it is international students.


What should be at the forefront of that experience of people coming to study at university in Australia is quality: proper, quality courses that change people's lives. I can say from my own experience as a very young mature-age student—I went to uni as a 26-year-old, and I went to Murdoch University in Western Australia—that that was a life-changing experience. That is what we want higher education to be. We want it to change people's lives, to give them greater opportunity. That is really what we want to do.


Unfortunately, we know that that requires our universities to be transparent, and it requires regulation. It does not happen on its own. It is not a trickle-down effect. It does not happen because nobody is watching, and it will not happen if we continue to deregulate our higher education sector. Of course, it should be regulated to the highest standards. The privilege to go and study at a higher education institution should be made available to many people in our community, whether they are international students or not. That should be an opportunity that is open to all. But it should be a proper opportunity, a life-changing opportunity, a life-enhancing opportunity.


That needs good, strong regulation—of course, not overregulation. That is not what Labor is calling for. It needs regulation to make sure that, when international students pay funds, those funds are protected and that universities act with great transparency and act in a proper way in relation to international students, because they are big business. Certainly, when we held the inquiry into the government's shelved $100,000 degrees, university after university told us that international students were a significant part of their student body. It did not matter if they were a rural or regional university or, indeed, a university based in our capital cities: international students were very much a core of their student bodies. We want to make sure that that core is protected—and, of course, our reputation.


We want to keep and indeed enhance our reputation as a country which is open and transparent, a country where students can come without fear of being ripped off and without fear of paying a lot of money and not getting a quality course or indeed not getting a degree at the end that is worth very much. Those are very important and they are also important to Australia, to continue as a leading country in terms of international students. We have world-standard universities and we have quite a small university body, which reflects our population, and we do want to keep that at world standard. We can name the universities which are competing at world standards and which are very highly ranked, but I think that all of our universities are at a world-standard level. So we want our reputation to be upheld. We want that quality and our reputation to grow and we want to continue to be held at a particular level.


International students make a significant investment, as do their families when sending a child overseas. Not only do they have to pay fees but that child also has to be supported either through working or through continuing to be supported at home. Families make a significant decision when they choose an overseas university, and we want them to keep choosing Australia so we have to have the highest standards. We have to have a quality educational service, and in order to get there we need regulation. It will not happen without regulation.


When Labor was in government we commissioned a review of reporting requirements for universities and, of course, Labor does support, in part, some of the streamlining of regulation. We do not want to see students and universities overburdened by regulation, but we do want to see very clear protective regulation in part. And some of that streamlining of the regulations is outlined in the bills, as recommended in that report—a report which Labor commissioned.


The second part, though, relates to the government's deregulation agenda. As I said at the outset, in early childhood education and care right through to higher education the government's keywords in those areas are not quality, protection for students or even cost, surprisingly. It is 'deregulation'.


As Labor has said, and as you will hear other Labor senators say in this place, that is a danger, as it seeks to remove a range of requirements that affect providers and were indeed partly introduced in response to the last major crisis in the international colleges in 2008 and 2009. None of us in this place, no matter where we come from, want a return to that—where our international reputation, particularly in relation to Indian students, was well and truly on the line. We had some awful protests. We had Indian students allegedly being bullied. We had collapse after collapse, with shonky operators taking the significant funds they received from international students and fleeing. We do not want to see that, because that is not the sort of country we are. We are not a country that promotes shonks and we are not a country that allows people to rip students off in that way. That is not who we are as a country. And of course, that was significant damage to our reputation. Partly, that collapse occurred because we did not have the regulation in place.


We do need to keep updating regulation. It is probably not appropriate to say that regulation that applied in 2008-09 is going to lead us forward from 2016 onward. It does need to be something we continue to review, because regulation can become a burden if it no longer matches what is being provided. But regulation in and of itself is required because none of us in this place want to go back to what we saw in 2008 and 2009. And we know already that in the era of international education we must have proper regulation that protects students who come here in good faith.


When you choose a university it is a very exciting time. You make the choice and you make your decision about what sort of degree you want to pursue, and it sets your career opportunities up for the future. It is a very exciting time, so we want to make sure that the highest standard of regulations are in place so that that decision made by the international student and their family is made in an environment they can feel comfortable in. We want to make sure they know they will get the highest-quality education and will be secure in the knowledge that they are not going to get scammed or ripped off by a shonky operator or someone taking advantage of them.


It is very confusing when you come to Australia from another country. You arrive and everything is different, and you may have English as a second or third language. It is an environment where we need to welcome students, and we need to be able to say to them confidently, 'We have good, strong regulation in place that's going to protect your interests. It's designed to protect you as the international student.' It is us saying in another way how much we value that international student and their family making that often-difficult decision to send their child overseas to study.


When Labor were in government we initiated in response to those college collapses in 2008-09 a range of reforms, including the creation of the Tuition Protection Service. Alarmingly, some of the requirements in this bill seek to remove those protections that Labor put in place.


We have seen another form of exploitation of international students in this country with the appalling and shocking exploitation of students by 7-Eleven. We heard in evidence that students were getting paid $12 an hour. The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the union in the retail sector, told us that they had calculated for one of those international students that he was working for about $5 or $6 an hour. That is shameful, and I am not suggesting for one minute that anyone in this place thinks that is okay, but it does demonstrate that where international students are concerned there is a market for some who are unscrupulous to exploit them. In the 7-Eleven case, we have already heard in evidence just from the Fels panel that they have done underpayments for 101 students, and that amount of underpayment is more than $2 million. I think people perhaps do not appreciate that these are low-paid jobs. These are jobs where students are earning about $20 an hour, so, to get to an underpayment of around $23,000 per student, which is what the Fels panel is telling us, is a staggering underpayment.


We have also heard, in relation to 7-Eleven's international students, how they were forced to work more than 20 hours a week, breaching their visa conditions, putting at risk their university career and degree, putting at risk all the money their family had got together to enable that student to come to Australia to study—all of that put at risk because a dodgy company chose to exploit them. We know that in the area of visa workers for international students the current regulations we have are not enough. We certainly want to see a beefing up of regulation there.


Of course I am not suggesting for a moment that our universities are behaving with some of the unscrupulous practices we have seen from 7-Eleven and others—Pizza Hut just last week. These are all going on now. But it does clearly demonstrate that international students are seen by some as big business. Obviously, where there is a lot of money out there, we do see elements of exploitation. In the cases of 7-Eleven and Pizza Hut, there has been shocking exploitation of international students.


That damages our reputation. It may not be about the quality of the educational experience the student is receiving, but nevertheless people reading the story—particularly a student looking at Australia as a market to come to to study next year—will take it into account. 'Gosh, I've got to work to look after myself, and I'm entitled to work 20 hours a week, but it seems that I'm going to be exploited.' That is bad for everyone. It is certainly bad for our reputation overseas and it is bad for our universities to be caught up in that kind of story. If there is no story—if people have a good story about the quality of their educational experience in Australia and a good story about not being exploited at work—that in and of itself promotes Australia as a destination that is safe and welcoming to come to. So we do not want to see that kind of thing. We know that, if we want to retain our reputation and our world-class systems, international students need more protection, not less.


Labor certainly wants to put on the public record in the Australian parliament that these bills before the Senate today remove or weaken student protections. We want that loud and clear. We do not want there to be any mistake that Labor thinks that this is additional protection for students. We do not. We absolutely believe and want on the public record that these bills remove or weaken student protections. These bills will not, as the government states, give international students more protections; they will give them less. We are very clear about that. It is wrong to argue, as the government will, that all deregulation is good. We can look back at the events of 2008 and 2009 to see the perils of not having enough regulation in place, of getting the settings wrong. None of us in this place want to go back to that situation. It is there for us to learn from, but it would seem that the government has not learnt or is not listening, because the current bills will weaken protections for international students. That history of 2008 and 2009 shows us that regulation is needed.


We do not want to see scams and rip-offs of international students. We see in the visa area that without adequate protections students are vulnerable. International students are big business, and some unscrupulous operators will take advantage. We do not want that. It is bad for all students. If there is a scam around an Australian university, that affects not only international students but also the local students who have a choice about what university they go to. 'No, I won't go to University X, because they've had all that horrible scam of international students.' It affects us all. We want a quality, well-regulated system that protects international students.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (13:13):  The Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 really has two main parts. The first part is streamlining of the regulatory and reporting requirement. The opposition does give its support to that part in itself. However, the second part relates to the government's deregulation agenda in higher education and seeks to remove a range of requirements that affect providers and that were largely introduced, in fact, by Labor when in government in response to the last time we had a major crisis in the international education sector, which followed the collapses of colleges in 2008-2009 in particular. That is the part the opposition has grave concerns about, will move amendments to and will ask the government to reconsider.


When we talk about the international education sector, the international education market, we need to recognise the importance of quality—the importance of safeguarding that quality and having strict standards in relation to that quality. We know that this is an incredibly important part of the Australian economy. I understand it is second to coal and iron ore in terms of how important it is to our economy and worth some $18 billion a year. So, over and above the economic benefits that we know the international education market has, we need to ensure that, we as a country, stand proud in what we deliver and what we provide. Regulation is so important, because we know that there are those out there who, unscrupulously, will take advantage of any loophole they can find and offer dodgy courses which will lead, unfortunately, to the outcomes that we saw during the Howard era.


I want to draw on a little bit of history, though, in talking about the safeguarding of overseas students who come to study in Australia. This idea of a single framework to safeguard overseas students was first introduced by the Hawke government through the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991. It has had quite a reform journey since that time, and quite rightly so, because we are not talking about an education sector that is static or a time period that is static. Regulations must change as circumstances must change, so perhaps the protections that were provided back in 2009 or in 2012 may not be appropriate for international students in 2016. That is why the opposition takes a very constructive approach to looking at what is needed for the international student sector.


This issue, though, of standards and of safeguarding quality, I have to say, is dear to my heart. I am the daughter of someone who migrated to Australia as an international student. It was the attractiveness of the standards and the quality education that Australia provided then, in the 1960s, which made Australia a drawcard for my father, as it did for so many other people, so many other overseas students at that time.


And it has continued to be. Australia has been, certainly, right up there with a number of other countries in the world as a place to come and study and receive a quality education and a quality outcome in that process. But, unfortunately, we have had some hiccups over the last number of years. It is for those reasons that Labor, when we talk about offering international students a pathway for the future, stand very firm on the need to have 'safeguarding quality' as a key to maintaining our high reputation. Why do we do that? Because if we value every human being as equal to ourselves then we would want the same standards provided in higher education to those students coming from overseas to study here as we would want for ourselves. We would not want those students being exploited. We would not want those students to receive a watered-down degree, or have watered-down protections in relation to the fees that they have paid and the educational outcomes that they have then received in return. 


That is why this kind of ideological zeal that this government has in relation to deregulation is just so wrong-ended. It is completely wrong-ended. It is fine to want to reduce some red tape. We all understand that. We all understand the importance of streamlining something to make things easier and run more efficiently for students, as well as for those education providers, but, to me, talking about deregulation speaks of weakening those necessary and effective protections for overseas students that are needed now more than ever.


We do not want in this place—and I am sure I speak for all senators—a repeat of what occurred during the Howard era with all of those terrible scams that were put out through those colleges operating at the time, which, as we know, culminated in not only a major economic crisis but also an educational crisis with the international education enrolments collapsing at that time. I think it was, if we look back, an issue of naivety on behalf of the Howard government at that time, which Labor, when it came into government, had to fix up in a fairly major way. Between 2008 and 2011 we saw 54 colleges collapse and 13,000 students affected, of whom only 312 students got refunds from their educational institutions.


Since then, there has also been the saga of Greenwich University, where a scam degree factory operated out of Norfolk Island, which the Howard government allowed to run rampant, I understand, for some four years. It was not only an example of dodgy practice—it was really quite a bizarre situation.


I think that the efforts of all of the reputable providers who strive day in, day out, to maintain high standards, treat students fairly and with dignity are tainted, unfortunately, when there is some dodgy education provider in the mix. That is a shameful thing—when we know that there are so many good education providers out there whose reputations get damaged in the process.


Unfortunately, there have been too many familiar stories in this space, though. It is that concern that I certainly have. I know that Senator Lines also touched on issues to do with the recent sham with contracting arrangements at 7-Eleven. We saw something similar with Australia Post as well recently, with international students being exploited. Even though we are aware of some of these cases—7-Eleven, educational colleges, Australia Post—it raises the question of how many scams or exploitations of international students we are not aware of. This is only what is being reported and what has been found out. We know that there could indeed be a number of reports that go hidden, and in that sense we are left in a cloud of secrecy.


So I do raise the importance of the additional comments that were provided in the Senate committee report on this bill. They went into some detail as to what Labor's position is—the fact that we support the positive elements of this bill but that we want the government to reconsider those provisions that we do not see as reasonable. Anything that is reasonable, of course, we would support, but we have that anxiety, as I mentioned, about the potential consequences of the deregulation agenda of this government.


If I can reiterate the position that Senator Carr spoke of here and that our shadow assistant minister for higher education spoke of in the other place: we are absolutely willing to do what is necessary in relation to reducing red tape, but we do not want to see the watering-down of protections for international students, which would threaten international education, which, as I said earlier, is one of our biggest export industries. So we reserve the right to make those amendments here in the Senate in that regard.


Any harm to Australia's reputation as an education provider will really stem the increasing flow of students into this country and the flow of export income along with them. I am sure the government understands the importance of that, if nothing else—the importance of this market to our bottom line in relation to our economy. We know the freedom that is available to students globally now and that they shop around and look at what is the best and most affordable education on offer to them. Australia may not always be their first port of call, but we want them to make the choice about coming to Australia and being educated here on the basis of quality, on the basis of safety and on the basis that they are not exploited—that they are able to come here and live safely, comfortably, in a supported, multicultural community and come out of it at the end with a really decent quality education and an enjoyable experience as a student whilst here. That is what we would want for our own sons and daughters if they were to travel overseas and study in an institution in another country, and I cannot see why we would want anything less than that for international students coming here to Australia.


On the basis of that, Labor will support in essence the main first part of this bill, but we certainly will be moving amendments in the committee stage and making very clear the reasons why this bill is flawed in its second part. We have shown over the years that we were able to clean up the mess of the Howard government and ensure that we did not get a repeat of the collapse of this educational sector with the closure—the necessary closure, of course—of those colleges and the withdrawal of enrolments. We want to ensure that in this country we have a proud, well-functioning, properly regulated international education market that continues to provide billions of dollars to our economy. The only way we will do that is by ensuring we have good legislation, with good regulations that help make that happen, and a positive attitude to our approach to international students in this country.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2015-11-30,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (13:27):  I also rise to make a contribution on the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015. This is an important industry for Australia. The senators opposite are calling on us to be positive about this. We are very positive about this sector. It is in fact, as a number of reports show, probably one of our largest inbound industries in terms of capital. It is about third after iron ore or coal. Nationally there are over 420,000 students who choose to come and study in Australia, from over 193 different countries. Not only does that provide work for our educational institutions but, as someone who is involved in our foreign affairs, defence and trade committees and efforts, I believe it is an incredibly good expression of soft power and soft diplomacy, getting people to come here to experience Australia. Overwhelmingly, those people go home to their own countries with a positive experience of Australia. 


In fact, a survey of students was done just recently by the University of Adelaide, in my own home state, and overwhelmingly the students said that South Australia was a great place to come because it felt safe, things were close, the people were friendly and the standard of education was good. So they went home with a very positive view of Australia. As we have seen from things like the original Colombo Plan and now the New Colombo Plan, which has been a particular initiative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, those ties matter. Those long-term interactions with people of other countries, both the students and their families, and their employers in the future, matter because we actually build understanding between people who are going to be conducting business transactions and building relationships that will affect our economy as well as theirs.


To answer Senator Singh's comment, we are very positive about international students and education because it contributes a lot both now and into the future. In South Australia in particular it is an area that has been growing significantly. In the last year alone there has been about 8½ per cent growth in the sector. We have gone from just over 28,000 students studying in South Australia to now nearly 31,000 students in South Australia. In terms of the value to our economy, over $1 billion a year is brought into the South Australian economy. Depending on which reports you read, the estimates are that over 7,000 jobs are directly or indirectly created as a result of international students choosing to study in South Australia. That is a very positive thing for us. It is not guaranteed though. We cannot always assume that that is going to occur.


If we look at cost, for example, in a recent survey that was done of over 5,000 students from 15 different nations, two key things were identified. The first was that Australia was not necessarily the cheapest place. In fact, for these 5,000 students who were surveyed across a range of courses we were one of the most expensive places. It was estimated that, on average, around $42,000 was required by the time they paid fees and paid for their support—things like accommodation, transport or just living in South Australia. Given that people have consistently said that South Australia is a cheaper place to live compared to many other spots in the world then clearly a lot of that comes down to fees. In Singapore, for example, it was nearly $3,000 a year cheaper than in Australia to live and study. In the USA it was some $6,000 a year cheaper. This is an international market where students can choose, or parents can choose, with their children, where they entrust their children to go and study. If price is an issue—and it is certainly something that is reflected in the studies—the more expensive it is for our providers to provide education then the attractiveness of Australia as a place to be doing business is reduced.


The second key finding was that, for these 5,000 people who were surveyed, the perception was that Australia was no longer the highest in terms of quality. I think we are about No. 5 in terms of quality. Clearly, we should be seeking to help our providers in these sectors reduce their costs and focus on putting their effort into the quality of education as well as the experience for the student, so that the story that goes home to prospective students and families who may be looking to send their children here is that Australia is a safe and friendly place and that it offers quality education and affordable education.


Government policy does matter in terms of affecting those things and affecting demand. Deloitte Access Economics highlighted in one of their reports that between 2010 and 2012 there was about a 19 per cent decrease in the value of the international student sector due to changes in Australia. They said in their report that those changes were due to a number of things. Three in particular came down to government policy, which was a tightening of skills requirements. In 2010, occupations like hairdressing and cooking were removed from the skills occupation list. The number of people who were applying for visas fell from over 31,000 in 2008-09 to 693 in 2010-11. Regarding the temporary stay requirement, in 2011, students were required to prove that they were temporary residents and had no intention to stay permanently. The impact of the genuine temporary entrant requirement resulted in the acceptance rate falling—in this case from India—from 90.8 per cent in 2007-08 to only 49.6 per cent in 2010-11. There was also a crackdown with new visa requirements that allowed students who studied at bachelor level to stay for up to four years after they graduated. But because this only applied to people at university, the demand for VET subsequently decreased.


Some of those measures are valid, although at the moment there is significant debate around visas and whether we should have further reform of visas, given that some of the people who are here studying as international students and who are keen to remain are studying in areas where there are recognised shortages and skills. If Australians are not choosing to do that study and get the qualifications and we have businesses suffering as a result because they cannot attract a skilled workforce then it appears logical that if someone has chosen to come and study in Australia and pay for their education and then wants to remain and work in that sector and contribute back to Australia's economy that is something we should be encouraging.


The point I make here is that government legislation does make a difference. That is why it is important that the changes we make in this sector value what this brings. Speaking as a South Australian, I am clearly keen to make sure that South Australia retains the value that it currently has and, in fact, grows. I think the state government has set a target of around 34,000 people by 2017 as something it would like to see. We need to make sure that legislation we bring forward does, in fact, help these providers to deliver a better quality of education at a lower cost.


The reforms that have been proposed in the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2015 are enablers to do just that. These reforms, as you would expect, have been developed with considerable consultation with the sectors and with overseas students, particularly their peak body, over the last couple of years. Their peak body has indeed made submissions to the Senate inquiry that was conducted into these bills.


The reforms in schedule 5 of the bill are going to deliver some $76 million worth of savings to providers just through reducing red tape and duplication. As I highlighted, we are in a competitive environment, and parents have a choice as to where they encourage their children to go and study. As we have seen, Singapore and the US are both significantly cheaper on a per annum basis than Australia. So the net effect of being able to reduce the cost to providers, by some $76 million each year, will go some way to helping them to make sure that Australia remains an attractive place for people to send their children. That also means that, rather than duplicating efforts and dealing with red tape, these providers can spend more time improving the quality of the education that they are delivering. The Council of International Students, who were one of the groups consulted, indicated in their submission to the Senate inquiry that they do not see that this bill in any way weakens student protections. In fact, they welcomed aspects of the bill, such as the flexibility in terms of being able to provide more than 50 per cent of their course fees up-front if they wish to.


I will go through some of the particulars of the bill, but I thought it was important to set that broad context first. It is important for Australia, and it is particularly important for South Australia. We value it and we recognise that it needs to be affordable and quality, and one of the ways to achieve that is to get rid of unnecessary duplication and red tape. That is the target of this bill, with some $76 million of savings. It has not been done in isolation; it has been done in consultation both with the providers and, importantly, with the international student body, who are the people who are directly impacted by this. So, for those who wish to criticise the bill, it is important to recognise this does have broad support from the people who are impacted by it.


Schedule 1 of the bill goes to streamlining registration, monitoring and quality assurance processes for education providers to provide a more seamless system. This means that the providers under the ESOS Act will be aligned with their domestic registration. So, rather than having to register twice, there will be the one process that deals with both their domestic and international markets—which seems to a logical person just to make sense. The requests for information for providers will also be reduced, with external regulatory bodies being able to use information collected for domestic registration in registering providers under ESOS. When I speak to small business in Australia, many sectors, including the education sector, tell me that one of the most frustrating things is having to provide the same information multiple times to different government departments or, in some cases, to the same government department but for a different purpose. Any legislation that we can provide that means that they only have to provide the information once is just good governance let alone a benefit to providers.


Schedule 2 looks at internal review of decisions. This saves time for providers by giving them access to an internal review process for decisions taken by the regulators. It provides the option to avoid lengthy appeals processes through the Administrative Appeals Tribunal when an internal review may in fact be a better way to resolve issues and to save time and resources. Importantly, in terms of consistency, the ESOS Act becomes consistent with domestic legislation for providers.


Schedule 3 looks at ministerial directions. It allows the minister to direct an agency to focus on a particular issue in the sector. Whether it is, for example, academic misconduct or cheating, they can direct the agency to look at that issue without having to actually identify a particular provider. That provides a good balance in being able to focus their effort without being seen to unfairly disadvantage any particular provider.


Schedule 4 looks to increase the powers of the Tuition Protection Service director to support quality assurance in international education. As I said in opening and setting the context, that survey of 5,000 students and their families found that quality was one the determining factors that they take into account when choosing where to come for their study. The TPS director, who is someone who is often privy to information about the activity of providers, plays a vital role in making sure that the providers meet their obligations to students. If the TPS director sees issues that are not being rectified by providers, they can go to the regulators with recommendations that allow them to take quick action against the poor practices of particular providers. That is another way of making sure that we have a system in place that works with providers and, if need be, directly with the regulators in a targeted way to lift the quality of what is being provided. Schedule 5 goes to other amendments, which is where we see the $75.9 million in savings for providers annually. As I said, this is going to be a significant boon in terms of making the sector cost competitive.


Some of the practical issues that have been raised and are now reflected in the bill go to things like removing student default reporting. Currently, providers have to report within five days if they think a student has defaulted. But some of the reports indicate that there is sometimes uncertainty as to whether it is a genuine default—that is, a student has in fact chosen not to turn up at all for a course—or whether there has been a problem with transport or getting into the country or establishing themselves and turning up on the day. Whilst information still has to be provided, the reporting time frame has been extended to 31 days to enable them to ascertain whether or not it is a genuine default as opposed to reaching a conclusion within the first five days. Both providers and students indicated that they felt that time frame of five days was too short. Examples provided included an illness that might have prevented a student from turning up. For students under 18, clearly the welfare of that student and the duty of care of the provider to have an interest in the welfare of the student is important. So a reporting requirement of 14 days remains where the student is under 18. That measure around the student default reporting and refining their system saves some $16 million annually for the students.


One of the areas that the student peak body for international students particularly supported was allowing students to have more choice in how much of their fees they paid up-front. Currently, the law restricts providers from collecting more than 50 per cent of student fees up-front. This bill allows students to pay more if they wish. What that means is that, if there are favourable exchange rate conditions or other reasons it suits the student or their family to pay up-front, then they have the option to do that. Short courses continue to be exempt from this requirement and the definition has increased up to 25 weeks which better reflects short-course enrolment patterns. Again even this small change to better reflect what actually occurs on the ground is a saving of $1.2 million annually.


The last area in here that has a significant saving for the sector is the removal of the designated account. At the moment—unlike domestic providers who can use the fees that are paid to invest directly in the innovation and developing of their product, their facilities and the quality of the course—international students have to hold prepaid tuition fees in a designated account, which means that they cannot use it. Public providers, such as universities, TAFEs and government schools, do not have to do that. Having private providers able to invest this money into the quality of the course means that they can act in the same way as public providers do. There will still be the ongoing financial viability checks to make sure that they are a fit and proper person to run the course and have the flexibility, but the estimates are that this will save some $27.7 million annually making them more cost effective and increasing competition.


As I said at the start, this is an important sector for Australia—over 420,000 students for South Australia and more than 30,000 moving towards a target of 34,000 by 2017. It is worth more than a billion dollars to our economy. We need to get the settings right so that they remain cost competitive and they can focus on providing a quality education. I welcome this bill and we will be supporting it.

"Canavan, Sen Matthew",Nats,2015-11-30,"



Senator CANAVAN
 (Queensland—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (13:47):  It is also a great pleasure to rise to support this particular piece of legislation and associate myself with the comments of my colleague Senator Fawcett, who was right to say it is extremely important that we maintain the competitiveness and cost-effectiveness of our university sector if we want it to maintain its position as a very attractive place for international students to come to study. I certainly want to maintain that position. 


It is one of the largest export earners in our country. It has huge upside potential to grow, particularly with the growth to our north in the Asia-Pacific region. Like many of our export industries, it stands in a uniquely geographically determined area that can benefit from the rise of Asian countries and the increasing numbers in the Asian middle class. Of course, those people, as they go to the middle class, want a better education for their children—they are no different to Australians—they want a better future for their grandchildren and they will look to other areas of the world to make sure that they can receive the best education possible so that they can live up to that potential.


I do think education is somewhat different in that it faces different challenges and risks than other sectors that are similarly exposed to that Asian growth—for example, in agriculture where the rise of an Asian middle class will certainly drive uptake of premium Australian products. As people seek to define themselves by the clothes they wear, the cars they drive and the food they eat, they will look to countries like Australia, which are known to produce premium food, to seek those needs. While that phenomenon will be there—people will look to higher quality education—another thing will happen in parallel to the increasing economic growth and sophistication of Asian economies, and that will be the improvement of their universities in Asia. Their universities will increasingly become some of the better in the world as they invest in their own institutions, as their economies become stronger and more able to invest in higher education to a similar extent than we can in this country.


That will create both opportunities and challenges for our university sector. The opportunity will be there because there will be increased demand from both numbers of students in Asia and also the willingness to pay for a good-quality education from Asia. There will also be increases in supply of high-quality education in our region, particularly in Asian countries and that will make it more difficult for our domestic university sector to compete.


Just to labour on this point a little bit, in a particular ranking released earlier this year—there are different measures of world university rankings—the 2014-15 rankings reported that two Asian universities are now in the top 25. The University of Tokyo and the National University of Singapore are now within the top two of the 25, compared with only one last year and none in 2011-12. Five years ago there were no Asian universities in the top 25 in the world and now there are two. I have not got this particular ranking in front of me for all universities, but the last time I looked there were no Australian universities in the top 25 at all. We usually have one in the top 50. 


In the top 50 there are six East Asian universities—from Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and South Korea. Now in total 24 of the top 200 universities in the world are in Asia. That is just a small demonstration of what is occurring in our region and why it is so important that we continue to support a strong, competitive and cost-effective sector here in Australia so that we can maintain its position as a strong magnet for students to come here and study. A key part of that is making sure that the regulatory burden on our university sector is not over burdensome, and is not put in place to an extent which would limit or inhibit its ability to compete with those Asia-Pacific universities.


This bill is not going to be a panacea for all those risks and challenges but it has make some important changes that will improve the competitiveness of our universities the changes that will reduce the amount of the overlap, duplication and red tape imposed on that sector. Senator Fawcett has usefully outlined what some of those changes will be. To put them in context, they stem from changes to the broader regulation of our higher education in about 2012, by which time the Commonwealth government had two type to agencies—with the Australian Skills Quality Authority and the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency—to provide overall regulatory oversight of the quality and standards of our tertiary sector. It was an important development to make sure those standards were maintained across the country. 


Those standards were in place for domestic students but of course they had an impact on the quality and standards of university courses for all students around our country. However, because we lifted the bar on the standards and oversight for domestic students, they had not been aligned with the regulatory standards we had in place for overseas accreditation. This is what this bill seeks to align. The education services for overseas students have different regulatory standards and different agencies covering that sector. This bill seeks to align those with the high domestic standards we now have in place. For example, we will allow only one designated agency to be in charge of both overseas and domestic students' accreditation—the TEQSA and the ASQA. We will allow the internal appeals processes of those bodies to deal with any complaints that may arise from the teaching of overseas students, instead of having to go to the and more costly and convoluted Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That will save red tape and costs. We will allow the minister to direct TEQSA and AQSA in regard to the accreditation arrangements for overseas students, just as the minister can for domestic students, and we will also expand the functions of the Tuition Protection Service, which functions as the director of that service, which is in place to help protect overseas students and the quality of their studies.


All of those changes would appear to be supported by the opposition, at least in the recently tabled Senate committee report into this bill. They did not see opposition from Labor senators on that committee. I welcome that support. The Greens unfortunately, in their dissenting report, have rejected all of those changes and have not proposed any alternative scheme. The Greens have harped back to the fact that a lot of these things were put in place in the 2009 review conducted into the sector, conducted to make sure that there were high standards for overseas students. What they have ignored is that since 2009 we have put in these other agencies—AQSA and TEQSA—to improve the standards of domestic arrangements. We have somewhat brought the domestic standards and obligations up to what was deficient for overseas students. So there is no need now for specific overseas student regulations. That is something the opposition has accepted and I welcome that. 


The review which led to the changes in this bill was commissioned in May 2013 by the then Labor government. It obviously did not report until after the election and this bill seeks to put in place some of the recommendations, although further consultation was conducted on those recommendations and we now have this bill. So largely supported by the two major parties in this place is a constructive attempt to streamline regulations in this sector. There are some other amendments that are smaller in nature but do nonetheless provide substantial savings of up to $76 million for the sector. Reporting time frames for complaints will no longer be just five days but will be 31 days. Students will be allowed to pay up front in full for their fees if they so choose. At the moment the up-front fees are capped at 50 per cent. While that cap will remain—that an institution cannot ask for more than 50 per cent up-front payment—if a student so desires to pay more than 50 per cent of his or her fees up-front, they he will be allowed to do so—a sensible change which allows students to have that choice. If, say, they feel the exchange rates are attractive or they would like to make the payment while their parents are willing to do so and not after their marks come back, that is a fair and reasonable change which again I believe will be supported in the Senate committee report from the opposition. There will also be removal of the strict restrictions on regulations of the study period which students must cover—at the moment, 24 weeks. We will make that more flexible. 


My understanding of the Senate committee report is that the only matter of disagreement is what is called the designated accounts at the moment. So private overseas student operators must maintain a designated account for the fees and funds provided by overseas students, to put into what seems to be a trust account at the moment—I do not think that is a term in the legislation—whereas other public institutions do not have to do that when they are offering the services. Obviously some are not really competitively neutral between the public and the private sectors and this bill therefore seeks to remove that anomaly to make sure that public and private providers are at the same level.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Where are the crooks?




Senator CANAVAN:
  The problem with the Labor Party is that they seek crooks everywhere and they just want to put regulation on everyone, including on the people doing the right thing. Why should we seek to impose more regulation on those providers doing the right thing rather than to clamp down on those doing the wrong thing? We should be rooting out the people who do the wrong thing, not putting up the cost for our entire university sector. That is what Labor are proposing to do. They are ignoring the fact that we have increased standards in universities since 2009. They are ignoring the fact that the vast bulk of our education providers have a good name and provide good services. By opposing this motion, they are dragging our tertiary education sector through the mud by somehow saying that there are sharks everywhere. Will what kind of message does that send to overseas students?



An opposition senator interjecting—  




Senator CANAVAN:
  Yes, Senator, you know a lot about sharks, I know. What sort of message is that sending when most of our education providers do the right thing? They provide excellent services and we should get behind them and support a more streamlined regulatory structure for our tertiary education. (Time expired)

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria) (15:05):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney–General (Senator Brandis) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Payne) to questions without notice asked by Senators Collins and Gallacher and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wong) today relating to ministerial standards and to the manufacture of the next fleet of Australian submarines.




Senator Bernardi:
  It's all about you, isn't it?




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  It is; thank you, Senator Bernardi. No, in fact it is about Mr Brough and whether there is a case to be answered. This, once again, was the subject of discussion in question time today. As we have heard, the new Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, says, 'There's nothing new here, so there is no case to answer,' and refuses to engage with serious questions about whether he conducted due diligence in the appointments he made to his executive. Again today we heard from Senator Sinodinos that there are still no answers to very important questions about what due diligence was conducted in the appointment—a very important appointment—of a man who would be Special Minister of State, and integrity and the responsibilities that are involved in that role.


Let us look at the reason that many feel there is a case to be answered. The first and most obvious is that Mr Brough himself confessed on 60 Minutes. Let me go to exactly what he confessed to. The question from Liz Hayes was:



Did you ask James Ashby to procure copies of Peter Slipper's diary for you?


Mal Brough's answer:


Yes, I did.


For him to suggest that it was not a clear question and maybe he was not in proper mind when he gave that answer is just ludicrous.


But let us look at the next issue that was canvassed in question time today, and that was with respect to the warrant. Again, I am incredulous that the first law officer of the land can suggest that warrants are just handed out willy-nilly and they do not really matter and it is not really important because guilt has not been established. As Senator Wong's question pointed out, guilt had not yet been established in relation to Senator Sinodinos but he was required to stand down. The only justification that there is no change in the ministerial standards of practice would be us going back to the John Howard approach to the ministerial standards, which is to pretend that they do not exist. So we have them; we just do not apply them.


Given that we do understand that a warrant does require the Australian Federal Police—and remember this is the Australian Federal Police—to establish reasonable grounds and that these cases are not to be taken lightly, it is incredulous that, as Attorney-General, Senator Brandis would suggest that it just does not really matter and that there is no case to be answered. What he hides behind, as I said, is that guilt has not been established. That is not the standard that has been applied in the past. What he is in fact doing is stonewalling. We saw that stonewalling last week when, as representing the Prime Minister here, he refused to take on notice questions to the Prime Minister regarding what due diligence the new Prime Minister conducted in this matter in establishing his new executive.


Today we saw another case of stonewalling when he did not answer my question in relation to what other members of the coalition frontbench were involved in this matter. He has refused to answer that question—a very important question—and one can only ask why. Is it a level of arrogance that this government should not be held accountable? Is it a level of arrogance that due diligence is not something that should be required in relation to very important appointments? Does he think that there genuinely is no case to answer when a minister of the government confesses on national television that he sought to procure Peter Slipper's diary using James Ashby? Of course there is a case to be answered. What is more concerning, though, is the quality of these question time answers and the stonewalling that has occurred for two days now on very important questions. (Time expired)

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:10):  It may have escaped the attention of Labor senators in this place—it might have even escaped the attention of Mr Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition—but time is running out for the Australian Labor Party. This year, 2015, was meant to be the year of big ideas for the Australian Labor Party.



Senator Gallacher interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  I know that you are not inclined to trust things from a coalition senator, but it is now the end of November and tomorrow is the beginning of December. Time is running out. We thought that this was going to be the year of big ideas, but what did we get in today's question time in the Australian Senate? We had a lame question from Senator Collins with respect to the so-called James Ashby affair and we had a lame question from Senator Gallacher.



Senator Gallacher interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  I will specifically address your question in a moment, Senator Gallacher, because the way that you presented the submarine issue was not entirely accurate. This is where we are up to on 30 November, with one more month and just a few sitting days to go, in Labor's year of big ideas. You would think that, having announced a big idea on the weekend—a big idea that is going to cost Australian families and Australian businesses—and announcing his climate change targets, Bill Shorten might have instructed his Labor senators to come into the Australian Senate and argue—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Smith, I am struggling to see the relevance to the question before us. I might just remind you of the question. It is that the Senate take note of the answers to questions asked by Senators Wong, Gallacher and Collins.




Senator SMITH:
  Thank you very much for your Christmas leniency and Christmas cheer, Deputy President. Let me refer specifically to two issues. The first is the so-called James Ashby affair. The Prime Minister has made his position crystal clear on this issue. He has said, firstly, that he has confidence in the member for Fisher as the Special Minister of State and the Minister for Defence Materiel and Science. He has said that Mr Brough is cooperating with the police and there is nothing at this stage to suggest that he should stand aside in accordance with the statement of ministerial standards. Finally, the Prime Minister has said that any investigation should be allowed to take its course if it is necessary. Those are the facts. Questions in relation to the Ashby affair do not need to find themselves in the Australian Senate question time. In the year of big of ideas, there should be other issues worthy of prosecution by Labor Party senators.


Let us go back to Senator Gallacher's question on submarine contracts and let us again get some facts on the table. Importantly, what was Labor's record when it came to submarine contracting? Where did Labor leave Australia's naval capabilities at the end of their six-year tenure? The first point is a simple one. The former government failed to make a decision on the Future Submarine project, risking a critical security and capability gap. That was your legacy, Senator Gallacher. Now Senator Gallacher and others say that they want a tender process. Who should we trust on this matter? Let's trust the Australian Defence department. The Australian Defence department says that a tender process, as proposed by Labor, would risk at least another five-year delay in the program and bring about yet another critical capability gap.



We had six years of inaction under Labor's alternative plan and they want another five years of delay—an 11-year capability gap for our naval forces. Instead, what the coalition has done is put in place a very robust process to choose the best possible submarine capability for the best price while at the same time maximising Australia's industry involvement. That has to be a good outcome. Why do we know that is a good outcome? Let's not listen to what coalition senators say. Let's not listen to what Labor senators might say. Let's listen to what Brent Clarke said from DCNS. What did he say? For those who are not aware: DCNS are very significant French naval shipbuilders. What did they say? On 25 May, Brent Clarke—more informed dare I say than anyone in this Senate chamber—said, 'It is pretty simple— (Time expired)

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (15:16):  I rise to make a comment with respect to answers given to questions by senators Wong and Collins. I commence my contribution by making the observation that there is a very dark shadow hanging over the integrity of the Turnbull government. We know that there was an opportunity for the government, for the Prime Minister, to answer some of the questions which need to be answered in relation to the behaviour of Mr Brough and his own admissions on prime time television, but unfortunately the questions remain unanswered. It is the responsibility of the opposition to continue to seek the answers. The Australian people need to be confident that the Turnbull government is, in fact, addressing the issues that it needs to address.


Senator Collins identified that it was Mr Brough's own words last year in the 60 Minutes program which have electrified the debate. Senator Collins has already drawn attention to this. When asked on 60 Minutes if he has asked Mr Ashby to produce copies of Mr Slipper's diary for him, the now Special Minister of State admitted, 'Yes, I did.' That is quite a significant statement by a person who is now the Special Minister of State.


We need to understand that Mr Brough is not only a minister of the Commonwealth; he is also a Special Minister of State, and being a Special Minister of State entails being responsible for a whole range of matters to do with integrity of government, including the Australian Electoral Commission and the entitlement system for members of the parliament. This is a responsibility which requires him to exercise the highest standards of judgement and integrity. When a person presents themselves and in their own words identifies the fact that they have prima facie committed an act which may well be contrary to the law—and that is a matter that needs to be determined—when a person makes an admission like that, and the person holds that particular position of Special Minister of State, I think it is incumbent on the opposition to ask questions about this and to seek the appropriate assurances and answers.


In the other place the Prime Minister was given an opportunity to be more fulsome in his explanation. In terms of identifying the decision-making processes behind, for example, the elevation of Mr Brough to the position of Special Minister of State—we know that Mr Brough was a supporter of Mr Turnbull in the change of prime ministership—the question remains hanging in the air as to whether or not Mr Brough was elevated into the position because of the fact that he has been of some political assistance to the Prime Minister. What decision-making processes were brought to bear by the Prime Minister in elevating Mr Brough? Surely Mr Turnbull was aware of what had been said on the 60 Minutes program last year. He would have been aware of what transpired in relation to the events concerning Mr Slipper. These are matters which are on the public record.



In answer to Senator Collins's question, Senator Brandis gave the indication that the fact that a search warrant has been issued in respect of Mr Brough, and that police have visited Mr Brough's home, is something which should just be brushed off, not worthy of much comment. 'Nothing to see here. Let's move along.' But we do know that search warrants are not issued lightly, and there must be some reasonable grounds before these things are exercised, so there are questions to be answered— (Time expired)

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2015-11-30,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (15:21):  It gives me no pleasure to rise and have to rebut some of the spurious arguments that have been put forward by those on the other side. It concerns me, in fact, not least of all that those who are most vocal in their interjections are the ones who are probably muckraking the most over this circumstance. What we do know is that the Prime Minister of the day will choose those people whom he believes are appropriate for the portfolios in which they will serve the people of Australia. Simply because one of the Prime Minister's chosen ministers is assisting police in establishing the facts and circumstances surrounding the demise of Labor's sleazy own pick for Speaker of the House of Representatives under Julia Gillard's tutelage I think is not cause for alarm. What would be more alarming would be if there were no cooperation taking place, but indeed there has been. The fact that Mr Brough has nothing to hide came through abundantly clear in the 60 Minutes interview, to which those opposite continue to refer. 


What I do not think is appropriate, and I think the Australian people share my point of view, is politicians acting as judge, jury and some sort of character executioner by standing in this place and using parliamentary privilege to throw down all sorts of smears of which they have no further evidence. We have seen accusations of hypocrisy being levelled before in this space. If I may recall, many of those who are firing the arrows and the bullets from the other side were the same staunch defenders of one Craig Thomson. 



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator BERNARDI:
  I am not sure I need to remind you, but I will anyway, for those opposite who continue to chirp and interject, that Craig Thomson has been convicted of using a union credit card for all sorts of expenses that took advantage—




Senator Conroy:
  Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I understand that Senator Bernardi is uncomfortable defending anybody who has the name 'Malcolm', but could you please direct him to debate the issues in the questions that were asked. Mr Thomson, to whom he is now referring, did not come up in any way, shape or form in question time. I would ask you to bring him back to trying to defend Mr Brough.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Bernardi on the point of order?




Senator BERNARDI:
  I am simply drawing parallels about the conduct of individuals in this parliament versus in the previous parliament, Mr Deputy President. It is entirely relevant.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I do not believe there is a point of order. 




Senator BERNARDI:
  Thank you, Mr Deputy President. As I was saying, there are those who are quick to rush to judgment of a matter and circumstances in the current environment, who are equally quick, and unwisely so might I add, in their defence of Craig Thomson. Mr Craig Thomson was a valuable and trusted member of the Gillard government, as was repeated on occasion after occasion. He was also trusted by the membership of the Health Services Union, although he spent their money on prostitutes and on a range of dodgy expenses, for which he has found himself in the courts. We knew on this side how guilty Mr Thomson was but we chose to let justice play out, rather than rush to judgment ourselves. 


The difference here is that those on the other side are making accusations while the police are conducting their inquiries. I find this extraordinary. The parliament deserves better than the kangaroo court being levelled by the Labor Party. We have to encourage all members in this place to participate as fully as possible in any police investigation so that they can clear up any abnormalities or misconceptions. While that is taking place, we should be spared from the childish accusations from those on the other side who have suddenly discovered 60 Minutes a year after the program went to air. Not one of them has the character to condemn one of their own. Not one of them has the character to stand up and say what is right and what is wrong. The only thing they are capable of doing is pursuing petty, partisan, political point scoring—the four Ps, for those on the over side. That is because they have nothing else going for them. They do not have a base, a principle on which to stand. The only thing they have is their partisan politics and that is something we need less of in this place. (Time expired)

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales) (15:52):  Yesterday I attended a very large demonstration in Sydney, and I was pleased to be there with Labor's Acting Leader and Deputy Leader, Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney, and a number of other senators from this place, and I know that all around the country many of my Labor colleagues attended similar events.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator McALLISTER:
  The senators are correct: I did not see any Liberal senators at this demonstration; I did not see Liberal senators standing up yesterday for meaningful action on climate change. That suggests to me just how out of touch the government is with community sentiment on this question, because the events over the weekend were attended by Australians from many walks of life. Our first peoples were well represented and honoured at these rallies. Faith groups were present at the rallies. Workers were represented—there were unions and representatives from migrant workers' groups present at these rallies. There were ordinary Australians from all walks of life who understand how very, very serious the challenge of climate change is, not just for Australia but for the globe.


What all of these people were asking for and what all of them expect from our government is that, when they attend the meetings in Paris this week, they will be putting forward a serious contribution on behalf of our nation that will allow the globe, the world, to start to take serious steps to address this existential threat. Sadly, those people are destined to be disappointed under the leadership of this Prime Minister. And of course we understand why that is: it is because, although the Prime Minister has made his personal views on climate change very plain on a number of occasions, he is hamstrung by a party room that fundamentally does not accept the seriousness of this issue, does not accept the science behind this issue and is unwilling to take any sort of serious action.


We do know what the Prime Minister thinks because he has told us very clearly what he thinks about Direct Action—the current policy mechanism. He said: 'The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is ""crap"" and you don't need to do anything about it. Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental fig leaf to cover a determination to do nothing.' That is a pretty clear statement. Those are words of conviction, are they not? But this Prime Minister is unable to act on that conviction—unable or unwilling to because of the forces in his own party room. We have heard them speak out again and again and again, and today, in a number of our national papers, we see the coalition party room playing up again. Because the Prime Minister has headed over to Paris, he is not here to defend himself. But what we see are the same repeat offenders—the repeat offenders who do not accept the policy, who do not accept that we should be taking action, and, as is reported in the AustralianFinancial Review, they are about to go nuts. It is the usual crowd: it is Barnaby Joyce; it is George Christensen; it is Senator Canavan; it is the former industry minister Ian Macfarlane. And they are tweeting about it, they are briefing on it and they are speaking up about it because these are people who, fundamentally, are unwilling to support even the modest action that is proposed by this government in Paris.


I want to talk a little bit about the targets that Australia is taking to Paris under this government, because they are woefully inadequate. The Liberal Party has committed Australia to a 26 to 28 per cent reduction by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. This target is not compatible with the internationally agreed goal to limit warming to two per cent.


Even at two per cent, we know that there are serious consequences. There are serious consequences for Australia. There are serious consequences for our Pacific neighbours. There are serious consequences for many people in the developing world who do not have the resources to protect themselves from the impacts of climate change. But this government cannot even bring itself to bring forward a target which would meet that two per cent goal.


The Climate Institute suggests that actually the government's target is in fact consistent with a three to four per cent rise in global temperatures. If all the other nations of the world go to Paris with a target equivalent to ours, this is the outcome we are presenting not just to our generation but to our children. And the Australians who were out in force yesterday and out in force on Friday night in Melbourne—all of those Australians were saying no. They were saying: 'This is simply not good enough. This is not the role that Australia wishes to play in the global environment.'


Modelling by The Climate Institute also suggests that, under these targets, we will have the most pollution-intensive economy and the highest per capita emissions in the developed world by 2030. How shameful! We can do better than this. We should do better than this, because we owe it to our Pacific neighbours and we owe it to many people in the developing world, but we also know that it is in our own interests.


We have heard, time and time again, of the impacts that climate change will wreak on Australians—on Australian industry, on Australian farming, on Australian tourism and on Australian suburban life. We know about the impacts of drying already in the agricultural regions in south-western Australia and also in south-eastern Australia. We know that a drying trend is likely to have very, very serious impacts on agriculture in those regions, and we also know that farmers, in very practical ways, are preparing for that, but it will have a devastating effect on our agricultural industries. We know how worried the tourist operators in Northern Queensland are about the impacts of a warming ocean on the Great Barrier Reef, and we know how very sad it is for many Australians that that treasure, which we hold in trust for the entire world, is presently on a path of deterioration.


We know how worried the insurance sector is about the likely increase in extreme weather events, about the costs that that will present and about the challenges in constructing an insurance market that can respond to the level of damage presented by very extreme storms and by increased cyclone intensity; We know how worried the insurance sector is about that, and we know how devastating that will be for the many communities who will be affected by these events.


What is unfortunate is that we also know that as the rest of the world moves to decarbonise, right now Australia is not doing enough to get on board with this global trend—with this economic trend. We need to make substantial investments in renewable energy. Under Labor, renewable energy was booming. Australia rose to be one of the four most attractive destinations for global renewable energy investment, along with China, the US and Germany. Households with solar panels rose from 7,000 to more than 1.2 million. Jobs in the renewable energy industry tripled.


We made significant investments in renewable energy when in government. We established the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and we established the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. But it is a very different story under the Liberals. Under Tony Abbott, and, of course, continuing under Prime Minister Turnbull, the Liberal government has almost destroyed the renewable energy industry. Investment in large-scale renewable energy projects such as wind farms has fallen by 88 per cent. It is unbelievable that a government would preside over a collapse in industry performance at this scale. The intransigence, the indolence, and the indifference to this industry has been absolutely unbelievable. I say to those who are listening to this debate this afternoon that I understand how very serious this problem is, as do the people on this side of the chamber and in fact everybody except the people opposite. We understand that this is not a problem that will fix itself. It is a problem that will require real leadership, both domestically and internationally.


We are approaching a very significant global meeting. It is an opportunity for Australia to stand up, to take its place on the world stage and lead. But unfortunately we are sending overseas a Prime Minister utterly hamstrung by his party room—a Prime Minister who probably understands how serious this is but is unwilling to act and is incapable of acting. I say to all of you that Australians deserve much better than this.

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2015-11-30,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (16:01):  I too rise to speak on this matter of public importance. I have to say up-front that I could not agree more with the topic and with the need to take effective action on climate change. I am sure everybody in this chamber wants to leave the world and our environment in a better state than we inherited it. The simple fact is that this government is taking effective action that, no matter how much those on the other side hate to acknowledge, is making a real difference.


While we agree in this place on the need to improve our environment and to leave the world in a better state than we found it, what we very clearly do not agree on is how to achieve that goal. We on this side believe in practical solutions, versus those on the other side who have fanciful policies and a lot of rhetoric but very little substance and very few gains. For example, Labor's most recent emissions reduction plan, so to speak, is quite simply a flight of fancy, even under their own costings. If ever imposed, which clearly it never would be, it would kill our Australian economy. In contrast, this government is taking real and direct action to protect our environment without destroying the economy but instead contributing to it. Our practical, realistic climate change policies and emission reduction targets, in contrast to Labor's record when in government, are actually working. They are demonstrably working.


Australia is the 12th largest economy in the world, and yet we are only responsible for 1.5 per cent of global emissions. Here is the kicker for those on the other side, which they will never acknowledge, and it is a fact that they hate: Australia is currently on track to beat our 2020 emissions reduction target by 28 million tonnes, and our policies will ensure that we are able to meet the 2030 target of 26 to 28 per cent.




Senator Lines:
  That's because you are cheating with the way you are counting. It is clever accounting!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Those opposite may want to interject, but that is a fact. That is a demonstrable fact. I will say it again for the benefit of those here. We are currently ahead of our 2020 target by over 28 million tonnes, and we are well on track for our 2030 objectives. Despite all of the rhetoric and all of the marches and demonstrations they organise, the fact is that our policies are working.


Our target, unlike that of those opposite, is responsible. Our focus is on direct action—not talking about making changes. We are getting out in the Australian community, the Australian environment and the economy and implementing policies that actually work. In fact, the target we are taking this week to the Paris climate talks is, per capita, the second highest and second most ambitious of any G20 country. You might shake your head over there, Senator Lines, but it is true.




Senator Lines:
  I do shake my head! It is clever accounting!




Senator REYNOLDS:
  You might not like it, and you might not like the fact that those on this side are implementing—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Back
):  Direct your comments through the chair, Senator Reynolds.




Senator REYNOLDS:
  Apologies, I will refer my comments through the chair. That is what they cannot stand—that we are implementing policies that are actually working. Let's put the rhetoric aside and look at some of the demonstrable facts. The Emissions Reduction Fund has so far contracted 92.8 million tonnes of carbon reduction for an average price of $13.12 per tonne—nearly half of what a tonne of carbon abatement cost under the previous Labor government. Despite all of the rhetorical flourishes and everything that has been said in this chamber by those opposite, the Emissions Reduction Fund is working, and it is backed by Australian businesses. In fact, it has been so successful that there are currently 500 projects underway that are registered under the fund, and we expect this success to continue, all at a fraction of the cost of Labor's carbon tax.


Our other Direct Action policies, including the National Energy Productivity Plan to improve energy productivity by 40 per cent by 2030, are realistic, practical and deliverable policies for Australia. We also want to use our energy more efficiently, not put up the prices of electricity and other consumer costs as happened under Labor. So this week at the Paris climate conference the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for the Environment will send a clear message to the world that Australia is serious about addressing climate change. Again, that is in stark contrast to those opposite. This government is actually ensuring that Australia pulls its weight on the international stage when it comes to mitigating the effects of climate change. We are achieving real and significant emissions reductions, at around one per cent of the cost of Labor's carbon tax. I will say that again: we are making real change and reductions, at one per cent of the cost of the carbon tax which Labor imposed on the economy. We have actually implemented policies that are working and are on target to meet our goals.


What do we get from the Leader of the Opposition? The Labor Party has had five different carbon tax policies in five years. The Leader of the Opposition cannot make up his mind. First he promised to abolish a carbon tax, then he voted to keep it and now he wants to bring it back—which, inevitably, would see electricity prices skyrocket again. Even worse is the Greens policy. Fairly typically, it has been put forward with little or no thought as to how it would work in the real world. They want emissions reductions of 60 to 80 per cent by 2030. Not only is not just unrealistic; it is not credible, and it would simply kill the economy if it were ever introduced—and with the economy goes jobs.


Under Labor's previous carbon tax, under their own figures, Australia would have experienced a rise in carbon emissions from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes per annum by 2020—all of that at a cost of $9 billion to Australian industry and Australian workers. So, not only was their policy, by their own projections, going to increase carbon emissions; it was killing the economy, and it was not working. Couple the carbon tax debacle with other flip-flops and failures in implementing environment policy. Remember, they scrapped solar projects, they botched the integration of renewable energy into the grid and they wasted millions of dollars on stop-start funding for so-called green initiatives before a lot of these initiatives even got off the ground. And that continues today. Their ideological blindness is blocking the Carmichael mine. The practical consequence of that for the environment is that if India does not get our cleaner coal it will have to turn to other countries for much dirtier coal. That will inevitably increase pollution across the Subcontinent and also increase carbon emissions, not decrease them. The truth is that coal will remain a part of the energy mix into the future and will play an important role in alleviating poverty in developing economies.


How does all this contrast with the government's record? We are providing $15 billion in support of renewable energy. If you listened only to those opposite, you would think we were not doing anything for renewables, but of course we are: $15 billion worth of investments into renewables. We are establishing the Office of Climate Change and Renewables Innovation to bring a new focus to the role of innovation in the future of energy technology. As anybody who has had anything to do with the sector knows, more innovation is required in order to generate more and more baseload power. Australia has a strong record on renewable energy, and this government is committed to improving on it. We are supporting Australian households to reduce their electricity bills by further investing in rooftop solar energy. In Australia we now have the highest proportion of households with rooftop solar panels in the world, at about 15 per cent, and this government's support for rooftop solar will see more than 23 per cent of Australia's electricity coming from renewable sources by 2020—a doubling of large-scale renewable energy over the next five years.


So, despite everything that is said by those opposite, we are supporting and actually implementing policies that are demonstrably working, and we are putting a lot of investment into renewables and particularly into finding new and innovative ways of producing renewable energy. The fact is that this government is implementing ambitious but achievable emissions reductions targets under Direct Action—  (Time expired)

Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria—Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:12):  I too was at one of the climate rallies—the one in Melbourne on Friday, where tens of thousands of people marched in solidarity to see our government commit on the world stage to much more ambitious action when it comes to tackling catastrophic global warming. It was terrific to see so many ordinary people—mums, dads, families and so on—join together to call for more ambition. I think that is a reflection of the fact that a big change is happening within the Australian community—among business leaders, people who are very concerned about the direction our country is headed when it comes to attracting new investment. There is also a change in the political wind. We saw the announcement from the ALP, which I certainly welcome, of a 45 per cent reduction in levels by 2030. I think that is a good step forward—light in detail, no plan for getting there, but at least it has been put on the table by the ALP.


So, there is action here in Australia, and there is so much going on right around the world. The fastest-growing segment of China's energy generation sector is solar power. In the US, emissions standards and regulation are in place to help drive that change. California is committing to ambitious renewable energy targets. That is the eighth biggest economy in the world. In the UK we have seen the commitment to phase out generation from coal fired power. There are so many things happening internationally, but Australia is showing itself to be an international laggard when it comes to action on climate. Here we are in Paris, trumpeting the fact that we are on target to exceed our 2020 benchmark—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Aren't we?




Senator DI NATALE:
  Well, emissions are increasing. Let's just remember: our emissions are increasing. The reason we are on track to achieve that target is an accounting trick. It is simply an accounting trick with a carryover that allows us to meet that target while our emissions increase. That tells you all you need to know about whether achieving that target is of any meaningful value.


And we have Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull spruiking Tony Abbott's climate targets on the world stage—targets that, again, when it comes to international comparators with OECD countries, are the worst in the world. Based on 2000 levels, which are the benchmark that many other developed countries use, we are talking about a 19 per cent reduction. You can get bamboozled with the facts and figures, the numbers and climate targets and so on, but just know this: if we achieve the targets that have been established by Tony Abbott and taken by the Prime Minister to Paris, we will remain the biggest per capita polluter in the world. That tells you everything you need to know about the level of ambition when it comes to achieving those targets.


All this comes at a time when we have a prime minister who promised to put science and innovation at the heart of policymaking in this parliament. If he is true to those words then the targets we take to Paris need to be based on the best available science, and the best available science tells us that we should be achieving a 60 per cent reduction by 2030 if we are to ensure that what we are doing is consistent with the huge body of expert opinion when it comes to climate change. But it is not just about achieving an environmental imperative, as critical as that is. It is also about driving the innovation that we need in this country to transform our economy from one that is reliant on those sources of generation that helped us to achieve our prosperity over the last century but which will not be the pathway to prosperity over this coming century. We need to recognise that investment in renewable generation is precisely that—an investment—and that, while people discuss the costs of that investment, there is a much bigger cost in not acting.


The Prime Minister should start with a couple of simple things. He should abandon his plans to axe the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, for they are hubs of innovation that have helped to kick-start the transformation we need. And he needs to recognise that if he does not tackle this challenge he will simply be another prime minister who says one thing and does another.

"Lines, Sen Susan",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator LINES
 (Western Australia) (16:17):  I too joined the thousands and thousands of Australians who met and marched yesterday, demanding action on climate change. I marched here in Canberra. If you need clear proof that it does not matter who leads the Liberal Party, just look at the climate change policies: they are exactly the same. Despite a change in Prime Minister, the policy is written by the climate change sceptics, the parliamentary members of the Liberal Party—many of whom, I am sure, make up the 44 who did not vote for Mr Turnbull to be our Prime Minister.


It is not that Mr Turnbull, our Prime Minister, believes that climate change is 'crap', to quote the former Prime Minister. He does not. In fact, he is on the public record as saying quite the opposite, as recently as a few years ago:


The Liberal Party is currently led by people whose conviction on climate change is that it is crap and you don't need to do anything about it. Any policy that is announced will simply be a con, an environmental figleaf to cover a determination to do nothing.


He went on—I will not say it here, because I am sure it is unparliamentary language. But he described it as something beginning with 'bull' and said that not only was it that, but that Mr Abbott knew it to be that as well.


Despite not being one of the Liberal Party's climate sceptics, Mr Turnbull will do nothing about climate change because he knows he will lose the prime ministership. He lost the leadership of the Liberal Party once before because he stood up for climate change, so he already knows what the outcome will be if he airs his real views and beliefs that climate change is real.


We now know that three-quarters of Australians, according to the CSIRO research, believe in climate change—which is, funnily enough, about the same who believe in and support marriage equality. And, although Mr Turnbull says he supports climate change and believes it is real, and that he certainly supports marriage equality, he is going to do nothing about either. Why? Because he wants to be Prime Minister more than he wants to do what the Australian people want, whether it is about climate change or marriage equality.


The farce which Mr Turnbull used to describe the Liberals'—his own—climate change policy is really a farce being perpetrated on the Australian public, led by Mr Turnbull and his government. The Climate Institute's research states, 'The majority of Australians don't believe this government'—the Turnbull government—'is doing enough on climate change.' And the number of Australians who think that the Turnbull government is not doing enough on climate change is increasing.


Rather than thinking that coal is good for humanity, as the Turnbull government thinks, almost three-quarters of Australians believe it is inevitable that coal-fired generators will need to be replaced with clean energy. Sixty-five per cent of Australians do not believe in divesting wind power and solar power, yet what has the Turnbull government done? They have appointed a very expensive wind power commissioner who is paid $205,000 for a part-time three-year position. Again, why? It is a sop to the party's own climate sceptics and a sop to those crossbenchers who also do not believe in climate change. Mr Hunt has gone on to tell us that that will be within budget, yet the new wind commissioner is telling us that he is going to make outside appointments. I think we now need to know what is being cut to accommodate the climate sceptics within the Liberals' own party. And once again Mr Turnbull just backs in those old views.


Today, we saw that the Nationals—the great Nationals; the tail wagging the dog—in exchange for their support of Mr Turnbull, have taken another backwards step. First, Mr Turnbull put them in charge of water. He put them in charge of water!


And, today, they have urged the Prime Minister not to sign up to a communique at the UN climate summit in Paris, pushing nations to speed up the removal of subsidies on fossil fuels. Why? It could jeopardise the future of the diesel fuel rebate. The Nationals seem to have completely ignored the impact that fossil fuels have on climate change. Even the IMF have said that fossil fuel prices should reflect not only supply costs but also environmental impacts like climate change and the health costs of local air pollution. The IMF did not stop there; they went on to say that fossil fuel subsidies are also socially regressive.


Those climate sceptic Nationals discussed it at their caucus this morning and have sent a direct message, or was it a warning, to Mr Turnbull. The biggest joke of all came from Senator Canavan, who said, 'We'—the Nationals—'don't view the fuel rebate as a subsidy.' So what is it? Is it an entitlement? 


Let us see what Mr Turnbull will do to head off this latest backlash from his own coalition. Certainly, they have been tweeting about it, and Mr Christensen took to Twitter saying that if we signed the fossil fuel subsidy, it would be madness. And, then, guess what? Mr Turnbull assured that noisy rump of the Nationals that all would be okay and that nothing that threatened the rebate would be done. Again, the tail is wagging the dog. Mr Turnbull knows who he has to appease in his party and it is, again, the right-wing Tea Party elements, the climate sceptics in this case. It is clear that there are two very different futures for Australia: Labor and renewable energy versus the same old Liberals and coal. 


More research conducted for Future Super shows that 84 per cent of Australians think there should be more than 40 per cent of renewable energy in Australia. The Prime Minister is not interested in what the Australian people think. Mr Turnbull is only interested in the dirty deals with the dominant right of his party to serve his political ambitions. Despite them sending that wrecking ball across the renewable energy industry, their emissions reduction fund is a joke. But they will cling to this notion that somehow, with clever accounting, they are doing the right thing.


Was Senator Reynolds really saying in here that the thousands and thousands of Australians who marched over the weekend have got it wrong on climate change and the climate sceptics in their party have got it right? I do not think she is right. History will show we are right.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2015-11-30,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (16:25):  Again, can I try to bring a reality check to this debate which the Greens, the Labor Party and the ABC seem to continue to want to thrust upon the Australian public. Senator Lines and Senator McAllister talked about these thousands and thousands of people. Even according to the organiser's own estimates, there were 100,000 around Australia marching in support of this philosophy and against the Turnbull government, which means that there were 23,400,000 Australians who did not march and who think the government's proposals at Paris are just right. So 100,000, even according to the overinflated estimates of the organisers, marched around the whole of Australia; 23,400,000 Australians did not march. Keep that in your mind for a reality check.


As I always say about this debate, Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of all emissions of carbon in this world. If you shut down Australia completely, if there was not a skerrick of carbon coming out Australia, it would not make one iota of difference to the changing climate of the world or to the world's environment, not one iota of difference would it make. So you just need to bring some reality into these debates.


The Greens and the Labor Party hate the fact, absolutely loathe the fact, that under the Turnbull government, under the Abbott government, this nation is actually doing something to reduce emissions. That does not really matter if we stop all our emissions. It would not make any difference to the world's changing climate if carbon emissions are what are causing it. Nevertheless, Australia has gone along and we are reducing particulate emissions into the atmosphere. I think that is always a great idea. I am one of those who always acknowledge that the climate changes. I always say, 'Once upon a time, Australia was covered in ice and the centre of Australia was a tropical rainforest.' So of course the climate changes; always has.


Even if you accept that carbon emissions by mankind are causing something then Australia, with such a limited reduction, will make not one iota of difference. Having said that, Australia is one who meets its targets. We signed the Kyoto protocol, and we have actually beaten the targets we set ourselves then, whereas we are lectured by the American President, Mr Obama, about our Barrier Reef. Yet his country would not even sign the Kyoto protocol and wanted nothing to do with it at all. We have the American President come out and make promises. It is easy to make promises—just join the Labor Party or the Greens. It is so easy to make promises; it is a lot harder when you have to meet the promises you make. President Obama, as long as he is left in the White House, will have no influence whatsoever on the American reductions.


If you believe that carbon makes the difference and you want to do something about it then have a look at America, have a look at Canada, have a look at India, have a look at China. When their carbon emissions are down to what Australia emits then you might start looking at Australia and saying, We've got to take more drastic action.'


But I ask for this reality check. As I say this, 23,500,000 Australians did not bother to go along to the march organised by the Greens, Labor, GetUp! and the ABC on the weekend. Those 23.5 million Australians think the current government is doing a pretty good job. We are exceeding our targets. We are ahead of the game, and the Greens and the Labor Party just hate it.


The Kyoto targets I have mentioned. Australia makes a promise, we do it in all seriousness and we actually meet those targets that we set, and we continue to do that. I heard one of the previous speakers from the opposition talking about how it was a dirty trick—an accounting trick. But, of course, we use the same United Nations accountancy on targets as has been happening for some time and as the previous Labor government used. But it is like so much from Labor and the Greens: if the coalition does it it is bad, but if Labor do exactly the same thing then it is good.


Again in this whole debate, I ask for and urge some reality—a reality check on what this is all about. I emphasise that Australia has a responsible and achievable—I emphasise again 'achievable'—emissions reduction target. We are going for 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, and because it is Australia who has promised it Australia will meet that target, because we are one of the few countries in the world that have met their targets. We have done it without buying these dodgy credits that popped up all over the world and made the merchant bankers a lot of money. We have done it without buying those dodgy carbon credits. We have done it by serious, achievable and affordable emissions of carbon.


When this subject is debated, can I just ask Australians to take a reality check. Look at what really is happening. Australia emits less than 1.2 per cent of the world's emissions, and our emissions do not really mean much at all, but still we are going to follow along and reduce our emissions, as we have promised before and as we have achieved before.

"Day, Sen Bob",FFP,2015-11-30,"



Senator DAY
 (South Australia) (16:32):  From 1940 to 1976 the world's climate cooled. Numerous books were written at that time, including Lowell Ponte's 1975 book warning:


… Global Cooling presents humankind with the most important social, political, and adaptive challenge we have had to deal with for 100,000 years. Your stake in the decisions we make concerning it is of ultimate importance: the survival of ourselves, our children and our species.


Sound familiar? We now have exactly the same statements being made about global warming instead of global cooling. There has not been any global warming in 18 years, even though CO2 levels have risen. There was needless alarm about 36 years of cooling when CO2 levels were rising in the 1940s, '50s, '60s and '70s; there was needless alarm over the last 18 years as CO2 kept rising; and there is needless alarm today.


There is no evidence that CO2 has influenced the climate in the past or that it could do so in the future. Not only that; the additional CO2 that has been emitted has actually been beneficial, with increased vegetation and crop yields—food production—around the world. The world is a bit greener and a bit healthier thanks to CO2. Ninety-seven per cent of CO2 is emitted naturally. Only three per cent is man made, so it is ridiculous to suggest that it is the three per cent that is causing global warming, not the other 97 per cent. As for calling CO2 pollution, that is the most ludicrous, unscientific statement one could possibly make. Over the last 18 years there have also been fewer extreme weather events like cyclones, not more. Not only that; a slightly warmer climate would be beneficial. More people die from cold than die from warmth.


This is the most baffling and perplexing subject I have ever come across in my life, and I am at a loss to explain what motivates 40,000 people to gather in Paris—and, before that, in Copenhagen, Kyoto, Durban, Rio et cetera—when there is such a lack of evidence to support the theory that carbon dioxide causes global warming. The best thing that Australia can do at the Paris climate conference is to be a voice for truth, reason and scientific inquiry, not irrational climate alarmism.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (16:35):  With the important meeting of the Paris talks, which begins today in Paris to reach, hopefully, a global agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions on our planet, I really hope—very much so—that Australia becomes a leading light. But, unfortunately, I think my hopes perhaps will not be delivered, because we know that the government so far has not changed its stance from the Abbott government's position on climate targets, particularly the 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction target that it has set for itself, which does nothing, as we know and as the Climate Institute has said, to prevent global warming of two degrees. In fact, it is consistent with global warming of three to four degrees.


Having said that, I live in hope, and I also really hope that there are real gains made at this Paris summit. They may not be made by Australia, but I hope they are made by enough countries—the some 166 that have now pledged their emissions reductions—to ensure that we come out with a very positive outcome. Of course, this summit in Paris, this Conference of Parties 21, has taken a different approach. It has taken an approach where countries pledge what they are able to contribute and then hope to defend that as their reasonable contribution to limit global warming by two degrees. That is what needs to happen. We know that Australia's targets do not do that, but we are hoping that the outcomes from other countries make that happen.


The opposition, however, have very much put forward our position on climate change and renewable energy as a very positive one, one where we can actually make a difference. Over the weekend, I noticed that the Prime Minister described Labor's plan to reduce Australia's 2030 emissions and our policy to the next election of net zero pollution by 2050 as 'heroic'. Well, I have to say that I would much prefer to be on the side of heroism than on the side of failure. Unfortunately, unless the Prime Minister ignores his National Party colleagues, who are urging him, certainly, to do less, not more, and ignores Senator Macdonald, Senator Day—I could go on with a number of senators—and others in the other place from the very conservative side of the do-nothing approach, the forget-about-humanity approach, we will not have a strong outcome for this country out of this Paris summit.


Having said that, I know there is a lot of goodwill—very much so—at this meeting. That allows me to feel comfortable with the fact that other nations will hopefully do the right thing. I have spoken in this place before, though, about the importance of the Asia-Pacific, particularly some of our Pacific island neighbours but also Asian countries as well that will lead to sea level rises over the next decade or more, and how there is going to be a need, with the Green Climate Fund, to ensure that there is support for our region. That is why I also urge the Turnbull Liberal government to ensure that it does increase its contribution to the international Green Climate Fund. That is at least one way that we can hold our heads up high, even if the government is not going to change its current emissions reduction targets, which so need to be changed. The Green Climate Fund is crucial and will be discussed and contributed to by a number of nations at this UN climate meeting because the OECD has made it clear that it is some $30 billion short in its demand to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of climate change.


I guess I am pointing this out to some of those senators who take a different view so that they can take a reality check. It is very clear that they need to take a reality check and read some of the science and some of the reporting that has been done in the area of global warming. I would like to point to one area, and that is sea level rises in the Asia-Pacific. The most conservative estimates of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicate that sea level will rise on average at about four millimetres per year above 1990 levels by the period 2090 to 2099. What does that mean? It means that in South-East Asia another 250 million people, particularly in poor rural areas, who live in the low-lying river megadeltas of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam—of which two million people will be directly affected by the inundation of sea level rise by mid century—will be affected. That is the reality check. That is what we are dealing with here. That is the result of global warming that has been caused by man-made influences through our activities, which we need to slow and curtail. It is already too late for so many of these poor people who live in these low-lying areas.


Nowhere, I think, is the threat more imminent than in the Asian region. That is why those small developing island countries in the Pacific, which are highly vulnerable to storm surges, to coastal erosion, to flooding and to inundation, need the support and the protection that we can provide. That is what we can do through our contribution to the Green Climate Fund.


So I urge our Prime Minister, while he is over there, to stay true to the position that he once held, and that is that the Direct Action policy is 'a fig leaf', is 'a farce', is 'a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale'. They are his words. I urge him to recognise that that is not the policy that he believes in and that we need strong action on climate change to do our part when we make our contribution to limit global warming to two degrees, in the hope that we can hold our heads up high for our sense of humanity.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2015-11-30,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (16:42):  I am delighted to rise to comment on the need to take effective action on climate change. I am going to focus very much on the word 'effective' in my contribution. As said previously by Senator Macdonald and others, climate is itself continually changing. Climate has continually changed over millions of years, and I think perhaps it is an oxymoron to use the term 'climate change'. We can make a comment on effective action on climate.


But, as Mr Hunt, our Minister for the Environment, said the other day, not only did Australia meet and exceed our Kyoto targets when many other countries failed to do so but kept criticising Australia but we also go into this process some 28 million tonnes ahead of our target for 2020. And then we are told by others on the other side, 'Of course, that's just creative accounting,' and yet, funnily enough, it is the accounting method used by the United Nations. It is the accounting standards that Labor used when in government. But all of a sudden, when the coalition government led by Mr Turnbull is able to achieve these outcomes with Direct Action, what do we suddenly see? It is all 'creative accounting'.


When we speak of effectiveness, I want to reflect on some of the renewables and other sources that are absolutely phenomenal. I start with hydro, or hydroelectricity. As we know, Tasmania is very, very strong in the hydro space. There is the Snowy Mountains authority. And we have the capacity, I understand, in Far North Queensland for the Tully-Millstream proposal, which would be generating in excess of 1,000 gigawatt hours per annum once that project was up and running. We certainly need to be expending our resources in that area.


In my home state and city of Western Australia and Perth, there is the excellent work undertaken by the Carnegie Wave Energy company, which won an award only recently in The Australian's 2015 Innovation Challenge. And what have Carnegie done using funds partially provided by the successive Commonwealth Labor and coalition governments? We now see a significant proportion of HMAS Stirling's power and desalinated water on Garden Island, south of Perth, being generated by wave action from Carnegie. Secondly, the company has only just recently raised a significant sum of $7.5 million to deliver on renewable energy for the island of Mauritius. How fantastic is that space?


On solar application we have heard others speak already; there are 2.4 million solar hot water systems or solar PV units, and 15 per cent of Australian homes now have solar units on the roof. That is double that of Belgium, which is next, which in turn is double that of Germany, at 3.7. And they say by 2020 we could well have 1 million solar battery technology performances here in Australia. How fantastic would that be?


We often hear the comment of how the Americans are starting to meet their targets—and do you know how, Mr Acting Deputy President? It is because they have moved substantially from coal generated to gas generated electricity. We in Australia probably have the world's largest gas reserves, and by 2019 we will go past Qatar as the biggest exporter of LNG in the world—so how fantastic is that going to be? I would also like to mention briefly again the capacity identified by the CEFC in the recent report showing there is potential for more than 800 megawatts of new generation from bioenergy, which they say could avoid some 9 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually.


The point to be made is that Australia's excellence in this space is our capacity to innovate and our capacity to develop new technologies and then to extend them through other parts of the world, especially in those developing countries of the world that cannot afford to pay for this new technology. That is where Australia's contribution lies, and why it is not recognised is beyond me. A prime example is the work of Carnegie.


I want to talk in the few minutes left available to me about the term 'effective'. I want to speak for a few minutes on the ineffectiveness of industrial wind turbines and make the point that it is estimated to be about 18 years for an industrial wind turbine to repay the greenhouse gas cost of originally developing it and putting it in place. For those who are interested, and for those who are not, it is about 18 years of use, so by the time an industrial wind turbine is getting to the stage of being decommissioned you will tend to find it is getting somewhere near the original cost of its greenhouse gas.


But those in South Australia would know, and you are one of them, Mr Acting Deputy President Edwards—and Senator Ruston and Senator Wong are here in the chamber—that on November 1, the first day of this very month, at 10 pm, across South Australia there was a blackout. More than 100,000 homes were without power—why? For two reasons. First of all is the enormous reliance on wind power now in South Australia—and you would not believe it, but the wind did not blow. And at the same time the wind was not blowing there was an interconnector problem with bringing the power coming from Victoria's coal fired Latrobe Valley. So we had a circumstance then, for that period of time, that South Australia and those 110,000 homes were without power, as were the small businesses and other businesses around.


In the United Kingdom, only in the last month did the UK government have to pay those heavy users of electricity factories and others to actually decrease their power for a period of time, again simply because of the lack of wind power. Having moved to rely on that particular form of energy for that purpose they are predicting now that it is going to cost them some billions of pounds into the future to compensate high-electricity users so that they can keep the lights on in their residences.


As we know about wind power, it is unpredictable. First of all, you do not know whether the wind is going to blow this time tomorrow. Secondly, you have absolutely no idea how much generation you are going to get. It is unreliable: you do not know how long the wind is going to blow for, and of course without other forms of generation it is totally unsustainable. So what we are going to see in South Australia over time is a higher and higher loss of reliability and, as we know, as a state South Australia has the highest cost in this nation for electricity.


I am a Western Australian, and we are all asked, as we should be in a nation, to make sure we support every state. But which manufacturing operations are going to want to go to set themselves up in South Australia when the supply of power is unreliable and it is the most expensive in the nation? It is no wonder the Premier, Mr Weatherill, is so actively trying to have a look at nuclear. We know that it is the ultimate when it comes to being a source of energy which produces no carbon at all.


The point to be made in these final few minutes is that when you have a high proportion of renewables, particularly wind-turbine-generated power in a community, you pay three times. First of all, you pay for the power. Secondly, you pay for the subsidy of the industrial wind turbines to the tune of about half a million dollars per turbine per year. Then, increasingly, we are going to be paying some sort of subsidy to keep the baseload power generation going. I certainly support the notion of effective action.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (16:50):  I strongly support the need to take effective action on anthropogenic climate change. It is up to us to do what is necessary to meet this challenge and to meet it as soon as possible, because the costs of not acting now will be much higher in the long run. The issue is: how do you drive the best possible reduction in emissions as efficiently as possible? Senator Back does have a very good point in terms of wind energy. It is intermittent and it is unreliable. In terms of the renewable path, it is much better to go down the path of large-scale solar, for instance. And South Australia needlessly has the highest power prices in the nation.


My concern with the previous government's carbon tax policy, the Labor government's tax policy, was that it was a huge revenue churn, and that itself is inefficient. Back in 2009, when the now Prime Minister was opposition leader, we jointly commissioned Frontier Economics to prepare an alternative emissions trading scheme. It was in my view cleaner, greener and smarter, because its churn on revenue was lower and it was based on energy intensity. I believe it has an enormous amount of merit.


Politics has intervened. I have worked constructively with the coalition since the election to improve its Direct Action legislation, to strengthen the safeguard mechanism and to make the overall scheme much more accountable and practical. We have heard what the costs of emissions reductions have been: an average of $12.25 per tonne.


More must be done. I think it is a good thing that our Prime Minister is in Paris. I think the previous Prime Minister had no intention of going there. The fact that Malcolm Turnbull is there is a good thing. We also need to regularly review emissions targets. I believe the 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030 needs to be much more ambitious, so I will work constructively with my colleagues on both sides of the chamber to see what we can do in practical terms to reduce emissions as much as possible, to constantly review those targets and, of course, to be aware of the damage that has been done, not to ignore issues of adaptation.

I do so noting that this is a relatively new institution in the Australian public sector and the function it performs is also relatively new: in particular, that function of requiring private sector organisations with employees numbering more than 100 to provide information about the number of men and women and the level of pay provided to those men and women is extremely important and a function that I think everyone in this chamber ought to support.


Of course, this new function was established by the previous Labor government. In introducing the bill that provided for this function, then Minister Collins said, 'Gender equality is essential to maximising Australia's productive potential and to ensuring continued economic growth.' The bill that she introduced brought in new obligations for reporting, including reporting on pay and the gender pay gap. It was a response to the persistent gender pay difference in this country. I note that the gender pay gap has not really budged in any substantial way since I graduated from university. It hovers around 19 per cent and is still sitting there on the latest reports.


The annual report that has been tabled talks a little bit about the work of this agency in bringing forth the information we need to tackle the problem. The firs thing to note is that we, through this agency, have created a world-class data set. It was launched in November 2014 and reports on a range of metrics. One important metric is the pay gap based on total remuneration. The gender pay gap is revealed at 24.7 per cent, which is an absolutely extraordinary figure. The agency has also set about providing customised information to those business entities that report to it, so the businesses that are providing information to the WGEA receive regular confidential, customised reports that allow them to assess their own performance, have a look at how they are going relative to other organisations and assess over time whether the strategies that they have in place are actually making a difference.


The acting director, Louise McSorley, in the report that has been tabled notes that this positions Australia as a world leader. The says that the agency has been approached by other governments and organisations around the world for our insights. You can also see in the report that the agency has been quite vigorous in reaching out to businesses. There is a list of the many public presentations and talks that have been pursued by staff from the agency getting the message out there that gender pay matters and that gender equality at work matters.


There are some encouraging results reported. We see the percentage of women in leadership increasing from 26 per cent to 27½ per cent. We see the number of employers conducting gender remuneration gap analysis rising from 24 per cent to 26 per cent. We see the percentage of employers with a strategy or policy to support employees with caring responsibilities rising from 55 per cent to 57.8 per cent. But of course there are still many challenges to address. These are important improvements and are in my view a direct response to the information that has been made available through this agency and program of work. However, there is still quite a lot of work to do.


The latest figures reveal, as I said, a very substantial gender pay gap. They show that this is worst in the finance sector. They show that only 15½ per cent of CEOs and 27 per cent of key management personnel are women. There is still a very big problem in this country with employers finding senior roles for women that allow them to exercise their leadership capabilities and to receive the pay that they deserve. The consequence of that is a persistent difference between the pay received by men and the pay received by women.


I think we should all be enormously supportive of the work by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. There was some talk, early in the Abbott government's period, of winding back the functions of this agency and winding back its budget. That seems to have been put on the backburner. I think that is a welcome change and hope that there are no attempts from the government to revive that strategy.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (16:58):  I wanted to again note the work of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. Senator McAllister has pointed out some of the key work that this agency does. Its core job is to ensure that we in Australia understand exactly what is happening in workplaces around workplace gender. That was what the legislation was originally developed to prove. The workplace gender agency since its introduction has done large collections of data. We have had two rounds of that data collection which are now on public record and which indicate what is genuinely happening in Australian workplaces and reflecting the obstacles to ensuring that there is gender equity and the ways that employers can work effectively to make change within their workplaces.


As a result of that, there have been ambassadors of change developed within the workplace gender agency who are core employers who have acknowledged that within their own workplaces, to achieve workplace gender equity, there must be changes. These employers have volunteered to be part of promoting the role of the agency; promoting the role of the need to have effective data; and also to identify, very clearly, that, as long as there is no workplace change, there will continue to be an ever-growing workplace gender gap. We know that. Whilst the workplace gender pay gap in Australia has fluctuated and whilst there continues to be some discussion around the edges about what exactly are the amounts of money involved—what is counted and what is not—the one real thing is that this gap continues to grow.


Recent data indicates that, this year alone, there has been a slight increase in the overall gap between payment received by women employees and male employees in our country. The positive thing is that there is work being done to address that. I want to give credit to the employers who voluntarily agreed to be part of the education campaigns that the agency has run, in particular 'In your hands' that was launched at the end of September 2014, focusing on educational programs about gender bias and how people can improve the work in their own agencies. The data sets have now been created, for the first time, to provide benchmarks at the industry level so employers can see how they are going in comparison to other employers within their own industry. Employees and employers can see what is happening in their agency and sense the commitment that has been made by the leadership in their agencies.


Unfortunately, we do have the list of non-complying agencies, non-complying organisations, non-complying businesses. There are 44 who are listed in this year's annual report. I am not going to read them all into the record today but there could well be a time when I will read them one by one, organisation by organisation. For various reasons, they have chosen not to comply with the expectations, being an organisation with over 100 employees, nor look at what is happening in their organisation nor fill in the data collection from the agency.


These 44 organisations and businesses cross a range of industries. There are a number in transport; there are a number in the cinema industry; and, certainly, the one that interested me—the jewellery industry. I would imagine that there would be many people who are working as purchasers in this organisation who do not understand that this particular company has decided, for whatever reason—and I do not know the reason—that they will proudly be listed in 'Appendix 1: Non-compliant organisations' for this financial year. I really do encourage people to check out who is on that list, because the whole idea of naming and shaming is to ensure that the shame is known.


This year's annual report from WGEA lists the work that has been done. I want to give credit to the two previous directors of the agency, particularly Helen Conway, who was there up until 6 March 2015; Louise McSorley, who came in and worked for the period 7 March to 18 October and was able to keep going, particularly with the ambassador program; and also welcoming Libby Lyons, as the newly appointed CEO who commenced in her role on 19 October. I encourage people to read the report, and I seek leave to continue my remarks.

 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (19:31):  I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill, which I understand were circulated in the chamber earlier today.

Senator CONROY
 (Victoria—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (19:31):  I rise to address Labor's support for schedules 1 and 3 of the bill. Labor also supports the government's proposed amendments that would ensure that schedule 2 of this bill does not proceed at this point in time. In light of the government's decision with respect to schedule 2, the opposition will not be moving the amendments to the bill circulated on sheet 7753 and 7754 at this time.


Schedule 1 of the bill will affect changes that will enhance the Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme, or VVRS, and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. This will mean that an amount equivalent to the permissible earnings for special and intermediate recipients will be disregarded for VVRS participants when determining whether the person's reduced daily pension amount should be increased and will give them the same benefit from permissible earnings as is received by a non-participant of the VVRS.


Schedule 2 of the bill was intended to streamline the appeals process into a single pathway for a reconsideration or review of an original determination under chapter 8 of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act.


Schedule 3 of the bill will expand the war graves regulation-making power under the Defence Act 1903 to include graves of service dependants buried in Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia.


As we said, Labor supports schedules 1 and 3 as sensible and welcome measures, but it does, however, have concerns with measures proposed in schedule 2. The goal of improving the manner in which determinations of the Department of Veterans' Affairs are managed was identified in an important report undertaken by the previous government—namely, the Review of military compensation arrangements. The review was accepted by Labor's former veterans affairs minister, the honourable Warren Snowdon, in May 2012. While this report was cited by the current government as justification for schedule 2, we would do well to recall the report's recommendations. In particular, I draw senators' attention to the following parts of the report:


17.91 If no cost awards are available under the single path, members pursuing claims for peacetime service (who do not have access to merits-based legal aid) are put at a disadvantage. Currently, the availability of the second path allows this to be taken into account.


17.92 Implementation of a single path would therefore require rethinking the current position in relation to costs and legal aid.


… … …


17.94 However, the Committee’s preference is to have a full costs jurisdiction for all MRCA applicants at AAT level. This would allow legal and other representatives to assess the merits of cases and pursue them on a ‘no win, no fee’ basis.


Labor's then Veterans' Affairs minister, Mr Snowdon, accepted the report's recommendations as they pertained to establishing a single appeals pathway for our veterans. Labor continues to support the ideal of establishing a single appeals pathway for our veterans, but that single appeal pathway must achieve certain key policy goals. It must be fair. It must present both the DVA and individual veterans with the opportunity of procedural fairness. It must be appealable on fair terms. It must aim to lessen the time that veterans spend bogged down in an appeals process. Labor is not convinced that these important goals have been met in schedule 2, as presently drafted.


We thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for his constructive approach with this bill and willingness to listen to the concerns of Labor, the crossbench and other stakeholders. We commend the course of action to the chamber.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",Ind.,2015-11-30,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (19:34):  I rise to contribute to the in-committee debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2015 Budget Measures) Bill 2015. When the minister replies, I will seek clarification and confirmation on whether schedule 2, clause 9B has been omitted from the amended version of the legislation. It appears that the contested and controversial schedule 2 will be scrapped by this government. There are many nervous veterans who would like to hear the words from the minister, personally.


I have no objections to schedule 1 and schedule 3 of the proposed government legislation. Schedule 1—$0.7 million over the next four years—will expand the range of services available under the Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme, the VVRS, and make changes to the way certain periods of work undertaken as part of the VVRS, income earned from that work and periods of unemployment affect the rate of disability pension and/or service pension paid to participants. As a matter of fact, I welcome that. I congratulate the government for doing that. That is a wonderful thing. I know that there are a lot of veterans and families who are very appreciative of that.


Schedule 3, relating to the graves of dependants of member of the Defence Force—at a cost of $1.8 million over four years—allows the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to amend Regulation 31 of the Defence Force Regulations 1952 so as to provide for the repatriation of the remains of service dependants buried in the Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia.


However, I do have concerns and suggestions for schedule 2 and specifically clause 9B which I strongly oppose. This provision, as it stood in the unamended legislation, undermined and weakened veterans' fundamental legal rights and decreased their chances of appealing bad decisions made by the Veterans' Review Board. The provisions, which would have harmed our veterans, relate to the legal costs, which can be awarded to veterans by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for successful appeal applications to decisions made in the Veterans' Review Board. Under the current system, costs can be awarded to veterans should their appeal to the higher authority, the AAT, be successful. That right to access costs would be taken away from our veterans should this legislation be passed in its original form, or indeed in an amended form which was leaked to me. It was there in black and white at clause 9B, which read, on the version that found its way into my office somehow:


After subsection 357(6) Insert


(6A) if in any proceedings, the Tribunal varies or sets aside a reviewable determination made by the Board, the Tribunal must not make an order under subsection (2) or (4) in favour of a claimant in relation to the costs of those proceedings if: 


(a) In the course of the review by the Tribunal, the claimant provided to the tribunal a document relevant to the review, and


(b) The tribunal is satisfied that, at the time when the Board made the reviewable determination, the Board did not have the document, nor was the document reasonably available to the Board; and


(c) The Tribunal is satisfied that, if the Board had the document at the time when the Board made the reviewable determination, the Board would have made a determination more favourable to the claimant than the reviewable determination.


Translating that legal speech into easily understandable English, it means that, if the veteran introduces to their legal process new information as part of their appeal in the form of a doctor's report, supporting statements from former ADF colleagues, witness statements from family and friends, medical statements from GPs outside the defence system, personnel files from Defence, summons documents or psych documents, then that veteran will have to pay for their legal costs, even if the veteran wins their case before the independent appeals tribunal. This provision was clearly designed to deter veterans from appealing decisions made by the Veterans' Review Board.


Who would appeal a bad decision if you would be forced to pay for the legal costs no matter what the outcome of the legal proceedings? That is exactly where we were heading. Most fair-minded Australians would expect that, if an independent judicial tribunal found in favour of a claim by one of our veterans, that veteran's legal costs would be reimbursed. It was not the veteran's fault that a wrong decision was made in the first place, so why should they be forced to pay extra for what was essentially a government mistake?


Without the amendment, it would have made things significantly harder for the veteran and their personal legal team to subject the Veterans' Review Board decision-making process to independent scrutiny. While the government likes to peddle the mistruth that the Veterans' Review Board is a fair and independent body, the simple fact is: veterans are not allowed to take their solicitors into those hearings, and many of the members of the VRB are legally trained. I do not see where the fair playing ground is in that. We have a situation where, quite often, the veteran and his or her advocate, who do not have official legal training, walk into a room full of government representatives who have official legal training. To rub salt into what has become a gaping wound, the public servants who serve on these government bodies, should they have a grievance and want to appeal before the AAT, will be able to be awarded legal costs should their appeal be upheld. It is a shocking example of where public servants are being treated better and given more legal rights than our veterans.


Before I close, I would like to broadly comment on the state of affairs within Veterans' Affairs. I had high hopes when the old minister, Minister Ronaldson, was replaced with the new minister, Stuart Robert. Those high hopes lasted for about five minutes into my first and likely my only meeting with Minister Robert. It is clear from the tone and attitude of the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs that, despite the fact he is a veteran himself, his loyalty is to the Liberal Party and not his former comrades, certainly not the diggers from non-commissioned ranks. That is for sure. I raised a couple of very important veteran cases with the new minister, and his dismissive and misleading comments shocked me to the core. 


The only hope I have for justice to be delivered to veterans who have been betrayed, bullied and ignored by successive governments is for a royal commission to finally be established. We will get there in the end. A royal commission would give thousands of veterans a chance to put their hands on a Bible, tell the truth and lift the lid on the dysfunction, endemic corruption, abuse of office, misconduct and cover-up from the highest levels of Defence and Veterans' Affairs. It will take a massive backlash from the public to force this government into establishing a royal commission, but I am confident that, when the stories of veterans like Marcus Saltmarsh, SAS Trooper Evan Donaldson and Jordan Woodruff, just to name a few, are properly told, the white-hot anger from the Australian people will be felt, even by politicians who think they are untouchable in this reinforced and insulated building.


In closing: when the minister replies, I seek clarification and confirmation from her that schedule 2, clause 9B, has been omitted from this amended version of the legislation.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:41):  Mr Temporary Chairman, I was going to see if the minister wanted to respond to Senator Lambie with that confirmation. Perhaps you could get her to do that in a second. I will just say a few quick words. The Greens have been working constructively with all parties, especially in recent days, on this legislation. We have met with stakeholders. It does concern me how much influence a couple of legal firms have had in what we are discussing here today. There are other stakeholders, and the Greens have not been lobbied by any veterans' groups around this legislation, which I find quite interesting. Nevertheless, I think there seems to be a unity ticket on the fact that we need a simplified single pathway for veterans' review. That seems to be acceptable to all stakeholders. However, we are not going to be voting on that tonight, I understand. That will come back next year. It has been sent off to committee. I have read those reports. I think it is time to be constructive and actually get an outcome for veterans, rather than just attacking the government, which I see all the time.


We do understand that this is complicated, that there is history and a lot of individual cases, but I do believe the intent of this was to actually make this easier for veterans groups. I am glad that Senator Lambie insisted this went away to committee. The committee certainly made some constructive recommendations, including, as was mentioned earlier, the potential to award legal costs through the AAT stage. That is something the Greens actually approached the government with during the week, about an amendment. I think the government had already prepared amendments to that particular aspect of this bill, but that will be dealt with at some stage in the future. The Greens are quite happy to vote for amendment (3), opposing schedule 2, and to support amendments (1) and (2).

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (19:45):  Let me make a few remarks in summary and indicate to the chamber, the shadow minister and other representatives in the chamber that the government does intend to come back in 2016 with schedule 2, which will enable further discussion of the issues raised by Senator Lambie, Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Conroy with respect to the provisions of that schedule. However, they are not part of this discussion tonight in any way, shape or form now that those amendments have been carried.


May I make just a few summing-up remarks. The bill before the chamber gives effect to two veterans affairs' 2015 budget measures that benefit the defence and the ex-service community. These benefits begin with enhancements to the Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme operating under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. These enhancements to the scheme will expand the range of services available to include medical management and psychosocial services. These additional services can further assist a participant's recovery through comprehensive, individually tailored rehabilitation interventions that include treatment monitoring and case management, pain management, family education and counselling to assist a participant to adjust to their disability.


Further enhancements to the scheme will result in recipients of the special rate or intermediate rate of disability pension being able to retain more of their pension and a more favourable pension adjustment regime for participants who start the scheme but experience prolonged absences from the workforce. These enhancements to the scheme are designed to encourage participation of more eligible veterans and members so that they are able to benefit from the substantial long-term health benefits that are associated with rejoining or remaining in the workforce.


Finally, the bill will amend the Defence Act to enable the repatriation of the remains of eight service dependants buried in Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia if requested to so by the families of the deceased. A change in government policy in January 1966 meant that, whilst most veterans killed in action in Vietnam were repatriated to Australia for burial, 24 were in fact buried in the Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia. On 25 May this year, the former Prime Minister offered to repatriate the remains of these and a number of other Australian servicemen and service dependants buried in the Terendak Military Cemetery. These amendments will enable the War Graves Regulations made under the Defence Act to authorise the repatriation of the eight service dependants if requested to do so by their families.


These 2015 budget measures contribute to this government's commitment to recognising and meeting the needs of current and former members of the Australian Defence Force and their families. I thank members of the chamber for their consideration of this bill and their constructive discussion of those parts of the bill which have currently been excised, and I seek the support of the chamber.

The provisions, which would have harmed our veterans, relate to the legal costs, which can be awarded to veterans by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for successful appeal applications to decisions made in the Veterans' Review Board. Under the current system, costs can be awarded to veterans should their appeal to the higher authority, the AAT, be successful. That right to access costs would be taken away from our veterans should this legislation be passed in its original form, or indeed in an amended form which was leaked to me. It was there in black and white at clause 9B, which read, on the version that found its way into my office somehow:


After subsection 357(6) Insert


(6A) if in any proceedings, the Tribunal varies or sets aside a reviewable determination made by the Board, the Tribunal must not make an order under subsection (2) or (4) in favour of a claimant in relation to the costs of those proceedings if: 


(a) In the course of the review by the Tribunal, the claimant provided to the tribunal a document relevant to the review, and


(b) The tribunal is satisfied that, at the time when the Board made the reviewable determination, the Board did not have the document, nor was the document reasonably available to the Board; and


(c) The Tribunal is satisfied that, if the Board had the document at the time when the Board made the reviewable determination, the Board would have made a determination more favourable to the claimant than the reviewable determination.


Translating that legal speech into easily understandable English, it means that, if the veteran introduces to their legal process new information as part of their appeal in the form of a doctor's report, supporting statements from former ADF colleagues, witness statements from family and friends, medical statements from GPs outside the defence system, personnel files from Defence, summons documents or psych documents, then that veteran will have to pay for their legal costs, even if the veteran wins their case before the independent appeals tribunal. This provision was clearly designed to deter veterans from appealing decisions made by the Veterans' Review Board.


Who would appeal a bad decision if you would be forced to pay for the legal costs no matter what the outcome of the legal proceedings? That is exactly where we were heading. Most fair-minded Australians would expect that, if an independent judicial tribunal found in favour of a claim by one of our veterans, that veteran's legal costs would be reimbursed. It was not the veteran's fault that a wrong decision was made in the first place, so why should they be forced to pay extra for what was essentially a government mistake?


Without the amendment, it would have made things significantly harder for the veteran and their personal legal team to subject the Veterans' Review Board decision-making process to independent scrutiny. While the government likes to peddle the mistruth that the Veterans' Review Board is a fair and independent body, the simple fact is: veterans are not allowed to take their solicitors into those hearings, and many of the members of the VRB are legally trained. I do not see where the fair playing ground is in that. We have a situation where, quite often, the veteran and his or her advocate, who do not have official legal training, walk into a room full of government representatives who have official legal training. To rub salt into what has become a gaping wound, the public servants who serve on these government bodies, should they have a grievance and want to appeal before the AAT, will be able to be awarded legal costs should their appeal be upheld. It is a shocking example of where public servants are being treated better and given more legal rights than our veterans.


Before I close, I would like to broadly comment on the state of affairs within Veterans' Affairs. I had high hopes when the old minister, Minister Ronaldson, was replaced with the new minister, Stuart Robert. Those high hopes lasted for about five minutes into my first and likely my only meeting with Minister Robert. It is clear from the tone and attitude of the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs that, despite the fact he is a veteran himself, his loyalty is to the Liberal Party and not his former comrades, certainly not the diggers from non-commissioned ranks. That is for sure. I raised a couple of very important veteran cases with the new minister, and his dismissive and misleading comments shocked me to the core. 


The only hope I have for justice to be delivered to veterans who have been betrayed, bullied and ignored by successive governments is for a royal commission to finally be established. We will get there in the end. A royal commission would give thousands of veterans a chance to put their hands on a Bible, tell the truth and lift the lid on the dysfunction, endemic corruption, abuse of office, misconduct and cover-up from the highest levels of Defence and Veterans' Affairs. It will take a massive backlash from the public to force this government into establishing a royal commission, but I am confident that, when the stories of veterans like Marcus Saltmarsh, SAS Trooper Evan Donaldson and Jordan Woodruff, just to name a few, are properly told, the white-hot anger from the Australian people will be felt, even by politicians who think they are untouchable in this reinforced and insulated building.


In closing: when the minister replies, I seek clarification and confirmation from her that schedule 2, clause 9B, has been omitted from this amended version of the legislation.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (19:41):  Mr Temporary Chairman, I was going to see if the minister wanted to respond to Senator Lambie with that confirmation. Perhaps you could get her to do that in a second. I will just say a few quick words. The Greens have been working constructively with all parties, especially in recent days, on this legislation. We have met with stakeholders. It does concern me how much influence a couple of legal firms have had in what we are discussing here today. There are other stakeholders, and the Greens have not been lobbied by any veterans' groups around this legislation, which I find quite interesting. Nevertheless, I think there seems to be a unity ticket on the fact that we need a simplified single pathway for veterans' review. That seems to be acceptable to all stakeholders. However, we are not going to be voting on that tonight, I understand. That will come back next year. It has been sent off to committee. I have read those reports. I think it is time to be constructive and actually get an outcome for veterans, rather than just attacking the government, which I see all the time.


We do understand that this is complicated, that there is history and a lot of individual cases, but I do believe the intent of this was to actually make this easier for veterans groups. I am glad that Senator Lambie insisted this went away to committee. The committee certainly made some constructive recommendations, including, as was mentioned earlier, the potential to award legal costs through the AAT stage. That is something the Greens actually approached the government with during the week, about an amendment. I think the government had already prepared amendments to that particular aspect of this bill, but that will be dealt with at some stage in the future. The Greens are quite happy to vote for amendment (3), opposing schedule 2, and to support amendments (1) and (2).

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (19:45):  Let me make a few remarks in summary and indicate to the chamber, the shadow minister and other representatives in the chamber that the government does intend to come back in 2016 with schedule 2, which will enable further discussion of the issues raised by Senator Lambie, Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Conroy with respect to the provisions of that schedule. However, they are not part of this discussion tonight in any way, shape or form now that those amendments have been carried.


May I make just a few summing-up remarks. The bill before the chamber gives effect to two veterans affairs' 2015 budget measures that benefit the defence and the ex-service community. These benefits begin with enhancements to the Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme operating under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. These enhancements to the scheme will expand the range of services available to include medical management and psychosocial services. These additional services can further assist a participant's recovery through comprehensive, individually tailored rehabilitation interventions that include treatment monitoring and case management, pain management, family education and counselling to assist a participant to adjust to their disability.


Further enhancements to the scheme will result in recipients of the special rate or intermediate rate of disability pension being able to retain more of their pension and a more favourable pension adjustment regime for participants who start the scheme but experience prolonged absences from the workforce. These enhancements to the scheme are designed to encourage participation of more eligible veterans and members so that they are able to benefit from the substantial long-term health benefits that are associated with rejoining or remaining in the workforce.


Finally, the bill will amend the Defence Act to enable the repatriation of the remains of eight service dependants buried in Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia if requested to so by the families of the deceased. A change in government policy in January 1966 meant that, whilst most veterans killed in action in Vietnam were repatriated to Australia for burial, 24 were in fact buried in the Terendak Military Cemetery in Malaysia. On 25 May this year, the former Prime Minister offered to repatriate the remains of these and a number of other Australian servicemen and service dependants buried in the Terendak Military Cemetery. These amendments will enable the War Graves Regulations made under the Defence Act to authorise the repatriation of the eight service dependants if requested to do so by their families.


These 2015 budget measures contribute to this government's commitment to recognising and meeting the needs of current and former members of the Australian Defence Force and their families. I thank members of the chamber for their consideration of this bill and their constructive discussion of those parts of the bill which have currently been excised, and I seek the support of the chamber.


Bill, as amended, agreed to.


Bill reported with amendments; report adopted.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2015-11-30,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (21:49):  I rise to share with the Senate the recent launch at Parliament House of the Tom Uren Memorial Fund, which I was delighted to attend with so many of my Labor colleagues. I joined a number of Labor MPs and senators, including shadow ministers Anthony Albanese and Tanya Plibersek, to support and listen to Tom's dear wife, Christine Logan, to discuss Tom's legacy, his long campaign against nuclear weapons, and the memorial fund itself, which honours the life and work of this champion of the anti-war and anti-nuclear movements. The Tom Uren Memorial Fund was established by Christine Logan and Tom's close friends to support the important work of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons—ICAN—in Australia, raising public awareness about nuclear dangers and building support for disarmament.


In the final month of World War II, Tom Uren witnessed the second atomic bombing of Japan, on the city of Nagasaki, on 9 August 1945. He described it later:


It reminded me of those beautiful crimson skies of sunsets in Central Australia, but magnified about ten times stronger ... It's never left me.


It was a crimson sunset, Tom learned later, that obliterated between 40,000 and 80,000 human lives, with thousands more to die later from burns and radiation poisoning, and it left horrific scars in the flesh of many survivors. It was a sunset of unimaginable death and destruction that would have been far worse, as Professor Fred Mendelsohn put it during the fund's launch, 'but for the bad weather and winds which caused the nuclear bomb to miss its planned target in the middle of Nagasaki by 3 kilometres'. This truth becomes even starker when we realise the nuclear bomb that had previously destroyed around 80,000 lives in Hiroshima was also considered very inefficient because it only fissioned about 1.4 per cent of its nuclear material.


According to ICAN, today nine countries together possess more than 15,000 nuclear weapons. And most of those weapons are many times more efficient, effective and powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. With the detrimental effect of nuclear weapons on humanity, who would not want their children and grandchildren growing up in a nuclear-free world? People like Tom Uren knew this before anyone else. For Tom, it was paramount. I quote him:


The struggle for nuclear disarmament is the most important struggle in the human race.


He later told a journalist:


I really do think that the dropping of a nuclear bomb on human beings, generally, was a crime against humanity …


I could not agree more.


The vast majority of Australians want their country to help end the age of nuclear weapons because, in Fred Mendelsohn's words, 'they recognise that there are no scientific barriers to eliminating nuclear weapons, only political barriers'. Labor is fully committed to pursuing this goal as an urgent humanitarian initiative of the highest order. Indeed, it was the Keating government that established the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons 20 years ago this month to deliberate on issues of nuclear proliferation and how to rid the world of nuclear weapons. It is also worth reflecting on the fact that this year marks 70 years since the US atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which claimed more than 200,000 lives. And so, with that fact in mind, Labor's new national platform, adopted at our national conference this year, confirms our party's unequivocal support for the negotiation of a global treaty banning nuclear weapons. And we welcome the growing momentum for a treaty as a significant first step towards eliminating the ultimate menace.


Last December, the Austrian government issued a historic pledge to fill the legal gap for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons—and 120 nations have so far endorsed the landmark document, signalling their readiness and determination to start negotiations on a ban. And 135 nations supported the next step—that is, a UN working group to start discussing elements for a treaty banning nuclear weapons. But Australia, I regret to say, was not one of them. In fact, according to ICAN, over the past two years Australia has been among the most vocal and active opponents of the fast-growing international movement to prohibit the use, production and stockpiling of nuclear weapons. At this year's UN General Assembly Disarmament and National Security Committee, Australia voted against, or abstained from voting on, all significant proposals to advance nuclear disarmament. Australia has refused to accept the view expressed by four-fifths of the UN membership that any use of nuclear weapons would be unacceptable on humanitarian grounds. Indeed, Australia has sought to establish a counter-narrative that humanitarian concerns must be balanced against the supposed security benefits derived from nuclear weapons.


And whilst Australia does not itself possess nuclear weapons, and never has, successive Australian governments have claimed that Australia is protected by the so-called US nuclear umbrella. But the United States has never publicly affirmed this policy. The late Malcolm Fraser described it as total fantasy. But claiming its existence, no matter how absurd, has profound implications. It says to the world that Australia considers nuclear weapons to be militarily useful, strategically necessary and morally acceptable, that Australia believes nuclear weapons are legitimate instruments of war and that, in extreme circumstances, it would be reasonable to use such weapons for military gain, to extinguish hundreds of thousands of lives. This is simply not acceptable. It is not an acceptable proposition for Australia to have.


Professor Mendelsohn said:


The leaders of nuclear-armed nations argue that they, unlike others, are responsible and can be trusted to wield these nuclear weapons. But who is to decide if one is trustworthy or not? How can a country such as the United States, which clings firmly to an arsenal of several thousand nuclear weapons, expect to persuade others, such as North Korea and Iran, to abandon their nuclear ambitions?


Rejecting the bomb is by no means a radical proposition. In the words of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, 'There are no right hands for wrong weapons.' Australia has rejected and banned other inherently inhumane and indiscriminate weapons such as antipersonnel mines, cluster munitions and chemical and biological weapons long before the United States has been willing to do so. Australia rejected these weapons categorically by joining conventions that outlaw them. Indeed, we helped pioneer the chemical weapons convention. If Australia wants to deal with the issue of nuclear proliferation as a key priority for our national security, Australia must pursue disarmament.


I urge my parliamentary colleagues who have not yet done so to sign ICAN's global parliamentary appeal for a nuclear weapons ban and join the 804 parliamentarians in 42 countries who have already done so. The only way to liberate the world from the terrible potential of nuclear conflict is to disarm, reduce and, eventually, abolish nuclear weapons. And that is why I commend wholeheartedly Christine Logan and Tom Uren's friends for establishing the Tom Uren Memorial Fund to continue Tom Uren's legacy of peace and disarmament in the hope that one day we will indeed live in a nuclear-free world.
