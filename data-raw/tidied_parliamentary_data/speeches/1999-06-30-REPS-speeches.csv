"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—With this debate, the government's GST finally makes it over the legislation line. We have all seen the footage of the Treasurer grinning like a cheshire cat, that trademark smirk of his on arrogant display. But have we seen anyone on this side of the House looking glum and downcast? Do we look worried at all? Not at all. Just remember that he who laughs last, laughs best. We know that these bills and the amendments that we are debating now are Labor's ticket to re-election. The polls show that, without a shadow of a doubt, if there were an election held now, we would win. We have every reason to believe that nothing about the government's GST package will change that between now and the next election.
Just today, the Financial Review reported on the ongoing disaster that is Canada's GST. Over there they call it the `gouge and screw tax'. The President of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said:
People still despise the thing. The politicians who think we will go away are wrong.
She says that, under their GST, tax evasion has boomed and `the underground economy 
 is an enduring factor of the GST'. In Canada, the Progressive Conservative Party, which introduced the GST, was reduced to just two seats at the following election—just two! Members opposite might like to reflect on that.
The first opportunity that voters in Australia will get to pass judgment on this legislation will be in Victoria at the forthcoming state election. I welcome that because Jeff Kennett is the father of the GST. We know that he is now trying busily to disown this bastard child, but if we go back through the record and do the DNA test we will find that he is the father of the GST all right, and Victorian small businesses and retired people in particular should let him know exactly what they think of his GST.
—It seemed like a good idea at the time.
—Probably so. We have a bit of trouble suppressing a smile when we discover that the Taxation Office has been left with a $1 billion funding shortfall for GST administration. The Taxation Institute of Australia and the accounting firm Arthur Andersen have said that the tax office 
 is massively underresourced. The fact is that it simply will not be able to cope with this task, just as the ACCC has been massively underresourced and simply will not be able to cope with this task.
Then we read about the retailers who say that they should be allowed to increase their percentage on each sale where there is a wholesale sales tax cut. Can anybody in this House seriously believe that there is not going to be GST based profiteering? Can anybody seriously believe that prices are not going to go up by substantially more than the government's claim of 1.9 per cent?
Mrs Stone interjecting—
—The parliamentary secretary believes that prices will not go up. We admire her confidence and her bravery. Then we hear from the myriad groups who have not been adequately catered for in the transitional provisions. For example, the jewellers now face going out of business while waiting for the GST and the promised lower prices to arrive.
There is one other point I want to make in the limited time available to me. Today is 30 June. From tomorrow, the savings rebate—the centrepiece of the Howard government's 1997 budget—disappears, some 12 months ahead of the income tax cuts which come associated with the GST. This cynical exercise of withdrawing the savings rebate 12 months ahead of the income tax cuts will rob taxpayers of $800 million. The most galling part is that the government claims that it has withdrawn the savings rebate because of the benefits that will flow from the tax reform package. What a nerve!
The government lectures us about l-a-w tax cuts. Labor put these into superannuation. An ordinary worker would have stood to benefit by some $100,000 had the government continued with our program of co-contributions. In abandoning co-contributions, it has robbed ordinary workers of $100,000. This money was said to go into the savings rebate. Where is the savings rebate? It has disappeared—gone. The government says it will compensate people for GST in 12 months time. What a fraud this has been on the Australian people, and they should reflect on the fact that the 
 savings rebate has disappeared some 12 months ahead of the GST and the income tax cuts that are associated with it. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Southcott, Andrew, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—Clearly, the challenge for the Australian Labor Party now, as they oppose this legislation, is to promise to repeal it and reintroduce the wholesale sales tax. We have heard that they have a problem with broadening the base, with including services in the base, so the only option they would have left is to go back to the old Labor system that they are defending. This is now the defining principle of the Australian Labor Party: they will die in the trenches to defend the wholesale sales tax, they will die in the trenches to defend the differential rates—the 32 per cent tax on television, radios and so on. That is the principle which the Labor Party stand for.
The Labor Party is now the party of reaction. The defining principle is that the Australian Labor Party opposes government policy. When was last time we had a new idea come from the Australian Labor Party? Why is the Labor Party opposed to tax reform?
We heard the Leader of the Opposition's speech last night. The Leader of the Opposition, the great windbag, came in and said, `I support tax reform,' but he does not support broadening the base. If you do have a problem with broadening the base, you have to ask yourself: what is the Sydney bed tax applied by the New South Wales Labor government? What is that? That is a tax on services, that is broadening the base. It is not a tax on beds; it is a tax on services. If that is the way the Labor Party feel, they should run at the next election with the policy of repealing the government's tax legislation and reintroducing the wholesale sales tax—reintroducing the tax legislation that was implemented in the 1930s, reintroducing the differential rates that Arty Fadden introduced in 1940 as a temporary measure to tax luxury items in a different way during World War II.
There has been a bit of talk recently about how young Australians are supporting the coalition government more and more. Young Australians, 18- to 24-year-olds, have traditionally supported Labor much more than the 
 Liberal Party. What you have now is a group which sees that it is only the Liberal and National parties that are actually promoting ideas in the national interest, that are actually promoting economic reform.
During the period of the Hawke and Keating governments, there were a number of economic reforms that the Liberal Party supported in the national interest. When Labor came to privatise things like Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank—things that they had not raised in an election campaign; in fact, they had promised not to privatise them—they received the support of the coalition. Things like floating the exchange rate, reforms to industry and so on were supported by the coalition.
I pose a question to the Australian Labor Party: in the last three years, what economic reform of the government have you supported? When we turned the budget from a $10 billion budget deficit into a budget surplus, what support did we get from the Australian Labor Party? When we decided to reform the tax system, what support did we get from the Australian Labor Party? The Australian Labor Party have been irrelevant to this debate. In one year's time, the people of Australia will receive $12 billion in income tax cuts. The level of taxation overall is going to be lower. This is going to be the biggest reform of the indirect tax system. It is going to be the biggest reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations since Federation. In all of this, we are cutting $4½ billion from the cost of exporters and we are cutting $10½ billion from business costs.
We ran on this policy at the election, and we have now implemented it in legislation. I pose this question to the Labor Party: do you really believe that, for the next two years, people will treat you seriously as an alternative government if all you have to offer is opposition to government policies? That is all you have. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Cox, David, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I want to quickly outline the principal reasons why I have opposed the Howard government's tax package. The principal reason is probably why the government have introduced it—that 
 is, the tax mix switch they have achieved by this legislation.
During the last election campaign, when I was asked at the door why the government was introducing a GST, I carried with me a table that showed the government's estimates of what the tax mix switch would mean to individual Australians. I referred people to two types of families as a good example of what the government was doing.
The first family was on an income of $150,000 and had one child. It was a two-income family and the income was earned equally, so it was a couple with a $150,000 income earning $75,000 each. When the government proposed this legislation, that couple stood to gain in excess of $150 a week. By comparison, a family with one child on $20,000 a year where both had part-time jobs and both were contributing half of that family income would receive less than $16 a week. That is the principal unfairness and the reason I oppose this tax.
In putting together the compensation package that allowed those tax cuts for the affluent, the government sought to fund part of it by a measure called common treatment of entities, which is effectively the proper tax treatment of trusts as companies. In their ANTS document, the government said that this would raise $1.67 billion in the year that the GST comes into force. We have passed the GST bills in this place. The Labor Party has totally opposed them and for very good reason. We have not seen the legislation to collect that $1.67 billion—largely from the wealthiest Australians, largely from high wealth individuals—presented in this place.
Instead, we have seen it referred off to the Ralph review and told that it is not settled policy. It is not settled policy because it has been referred off to the state conference of the Queensland National Party. So we will wait for their adjudication on this further measure, which might have brought some fairness to part of our tax system but which is, in effect, going to be a further demonstration of just how unfair this whole tax deal is going to be.
The other issue that is of great concern to me is compliance costs. In 1981 the Prime Minister, after his first tilt at doing this, got 
 up in the old parliament and said that the Fraser government had pretty quickly abandoned the idea of a multilayered VAT, which is the same as a GST, because of the heavy administrative burdens it would place on taxpayers and taxing authorities. The regulatory impact statement that was presented with these bills showed $1.9 billion of compliance costs for Australian business and another $300 million for the Tax Office. That is before the train wreck of a tax deal that was done with the Democrats that is going to greatly increase the compliance costs.
This is a double tax on jobs. When John Hewson prepared his GST he proposed to abolish payroll tax. It hasn't happened in this one. A GST is a tax on value added. Most value added comes from labour. A GST is, therefore, a double tax on employment. We are going to see that in our service industries.

"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—I rise to support the government on this whole question of tax reform. We have noted the comments from the Senate and the amendments that have been made. This is a significant period to be in government. It is a most significant time to be in this parliament because we have seen the most far-reaching tax reforms in Australia since Federation. It certainly is a great credit to the Prime Minister, who has championed the cause of tax reform for a long period, and also to the very dedicated effort of the Treasurer. The Minister for Workplace Relations has had a significant role as well.
—Which one are you going to vote for?
—It is very interesting to hear interjections from the opposite side. It is a very sad day for them. Where do they go? They have shown themselves to be economic troglodytes of the first order with no sense of direction, no policy, no idea where to go. I see various members on the other side of the chamber for whom I have some respect. I would be interested to know what their real view is. Where do they stand? Do they want to go back to a wholesale sales tax? Do they want to go back to a situation where we depend on a narrowing tax base? That might 
 have worked some 20 or 30 years ago when we had a very broad-based manufacturing sector, when we depended for our exports predominantly on the rural sector, but today it is a very different economy, a very different Australia. The service sector is now the fastest growing and the most significant sector in Australia. You people have no idea how you can approach this in terms of the service sector.
You talk about fairness and equity. This bill is about fairness and equity, and you mentioned that. You feel that it is not appropriate that international visitors who come to this country should pay some contribution to the welfare of people in Australia, to the welfare of older Australians. You talk about fairness and equity. This is exactly what it is about. Unless there are substantial changes made, the older people in the community, the disadvantaged people in the community, will have a shrinking tax base. The honourable member, who I know has economic qualifications, would be aware of the degree to which the indirect tax base continues to shrink year by year. Your former leaders saw the need for a widening of the tax base, moving in the direction of a GST. Political lack of nerves had them move in the other direction. They were about keeping themselves in government, not about tax reform.
This legislation provides significant tax cuts. One hundred per cent of Australian taxpayers will be better off and 80 per cent will pay only 30c in the dollar. The legislation contains $2.5 billion of family allowance provisions. Is that unfair? Is that inequitable? Not at all. The wholesale sales tax will be removed, which means that taxes in a whole lot of categories will come down to 10 per cent. They were previously a significant amount more. The legislation will provide incentives for exporters, a wholesale review of federal-state government relationships and the removal of a whole lot of unfair taxes such as the BAD tax, the FID tax and stamp duty on shares.
The bed tax is another example. You talk about tourism! The damage done by the bed tax in New South Wales is being felt right across the industry—10 per cent off the top— 
 and they all know that they are going to be a lot better off. That is why the industry said that they supported the GST. The tourism industry are in favour of major tax reform—as the whole of industry is—because this is going to take Australia forward into the new millennium. This government has taken the hard decisions and it has shown the way. It is about reforming the Australian economy and tax system, and we on this side of the House are very proud of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for the great initiatives taken.

"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I can certainly tell the member for Cook that there is nothing to celebrate today in my electorate of Gellibrand. It is fine for us to be talking about economic reform, but what the member does not want to address is the impact it is going to have on my electorate, particularly on the basic issues that run from ones like education right through to the leisure activities of the constituents in my electorate and many others. One of the issues that I would like to raise today in this debate is the issue of private tuition. It has been fine for the government to run around and say that education is going to be GST free. It has certainly been fine that private school fees are going to be GST free. But, if you happen to be in my electorate and are a public school student that needs some remedial maths attention and your parents want to organise private classes for you, I think the members opposite would probably be unhappy to admit that those parents will pay a GST.
How is that fair? How is that equitable? How, actually, will that help those families in my electorate who mostly, I might say, are in the socioeconomic groups that will not be receiving the massive tax cuts that some of the high income earners will be receiving? They will be penalised, despite this myth that the government wants to promote by running around and saying, `Private tuition is not really an issue.' We are not talking about tennis classes, flute lessons, piano classes or learning how to play soccer better, although those things actually are still important for our community values; we are talking about remedial maths and adult education. Adult 
 education is another interesting area. The government has backed down a few times on that. It has been forced to make a few changes through its negotiations with its wider coalition partners, the Democrats, but the Democrats have sold out on this issue as well.
Adult education will be GST free only if it is actually to further your employment prospects in some way. How is this government going to work out whether community education or adult education is actually for the purposes of improving somebody's job prospects or so that somebody can enjoy their recreational time more or so that somebody can communicate with their neighbours better if perhaps they want to learn a different language? Perhaps some elderly migrant settling in our country might want to learn English. Something that a number of the members opposite, and certainly a lot of people outside this House, have a strong view about is people who come and settle in this country being able to speak English. That is fine, but if those people choose to go and do one of those courses to improve their English to improve their participation in our community as active citizens they will pay a GST. These educational courses should not be penalised just because they do not necessarily lead to some recognised qualification or lead in all circumstances to improved job prospects.
One of the things that I find particularly offensive about this package is that not only are we still going to be taxing some basic and important educational areas but also we are going to be taxing leisure. Take a look at the exemptions that have been granted by this government to the high rollers at the Crown Casino in Melbourne and at the amount of money that is spent in my electorate by very large numbers of the community. I think all of us in this House know that when gambling gets serious it actually is a social problem. The many pensioners who want to spend one day or one hour a month down at the local RSL club in Sunshine, the High Point Tavern or the Yarraville Club are not going to get an exemption, are they? But a high roller who comes here from overseas with millions of 
 dollars to spend is going to get a GST exemption under this government's package.
What I want to say about this package is that the government must be addressing its priorities. Some of their backbenchers in the House today must be looking at its priorities—are they to the millionaires or to the pensioners? We oppose this package because we are actually concerned about those people who are going to be worse off in the community. We are concerned about their living standards. We are concerned about them having the money to be able to pay for food. We are also concerned about them being able to have some leisure activities.
—Pensioners get a percentage increase. They are going to be better off.
—I think that the member for Cook is interjecting that the pensioners are going to receive some sort of compensation. That is true. The government has been forced—through the evidence that was produced in the Senate committee—to actually increase that compensation, but not sufficiently, and for the low income earners who are not on a pension but are still struggling to make ends meet their families will still pay a GST. They will pay it when they take their kids to the movies over these holidays, they will pay it if they want to go to the RSL club and they will pay it on their kids' tuition classes.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—If my colleague the member for Gellibrand had any real concern about pensioners, she would be today out there welcoming these changes. Certainly under this government our pensioners stand to gain from these changes while under the former Labor government's regime pensioners lost. I go back to the history of tax reform. Under the Hawke government the best brains in the country were brought together to discuss tax reform. We know that after that summit the recommendations were that we go to a goods and services tax regime. However, we know that, for political reasons, the then leader did not have the stomach to really do what was right for Australia, but he did what was right for his political expediency.
We went on then to see John Hewson take up the cause and stake his political career on tax reform so that Australia could have a tax system that took it into the next century without having to penalise groups in the community like pensioners, families and small business. I remember that after we lost the 1993 election, when John Hewson had the courage to go to an election on tax reform, and Labor had won, they promised they would not raise taxes. What did they do immediately after that election? They raised sales taxes. I remember the pensioners coming into my office and saying to me, `We would have been better off under John Hewson's GST scheme than having voted this government'—the then Labor government—`back into office and having costs rise without no compensation to pensioners.'
This government has not been forced to provide compensation to pensioners. Right from the outset this government has protected pensioners and those on fixed incomes by providing concessions in its tax reform package. That has always been part of the reform package. So we see now that in this package pensioners not only will get their additional benefits from having increased pension payments but also will find the cost of many goods decreasing because of the removal of the sales tax on so many items we buy today—those hidden taxes that many in the public are unaware of and taxes that Labor kept putting up.
One of the major reasons I think we need tax reform in Australia today is that we have had a tax system that targets specific groups in the community. Those specific groups have been particularly families trying to raise children and small businesses. Small businesses have been the backbone of this country's economy, providing the most jobs for people in the community. They were particularly targeted under the former Labor government, which had to find creative ways to raise taxes and so targeted the small business sector to achieve that, producing through that a very uneven and very unfair tax system. What is important about this taxation system is that it does try to ensure that the burden of tax is shared evenly and 
 fairly throughout the community. There should not be one particular group in the community that is targeted to pay more tax than other groups in the community.
That was what was happening under the Labor government. They targeted particular groups. We saw the introduction under Labor of the fringe benefits tax which targeted businesses. It was one of the worst forms of tax in the sense that the compliance costs almost outstripped the tax that was raised. So we could not keep going the way we were going. We clearly were not raising sufficient taxes and the burden of tax was not spread evenly and fairly throughout the community. That is what this tax system does. It will take this country into the next century. We can be very proud as a country—as a government and the people joining together having recognised the importance of tax reform—for having achieved this. It is a very great day for Australia. It is a personal victory for the Prime Minister who again staked his personal political future on this reform. He has done it not for political expediency but for the national interest—for the good of Australia and Australians—so that we have a system that will take us into the next decade and the next century with confidence and the ability to perform economically and therefore be able to give the Australian people the social benefits that they deserve from having a strong economy.

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I do not actually share the big excitement of the members opposite at the prospect of the Prime Minister's big tax adventure, as he described it. Of course they are all tied to this big tax adventure, but I wonder who else is going to go with the Prime Minister on this one. We know the Democrats are stuck there with him on it. I think it is going to be an adventure into the wilderness for the Democrats, though, as the effects of this tax, its unfairness and its impact on society and business really come to be seen. Of course big business will go with the Prime Minister on this adventure because they made a massive investment in conning the Australian public in the pre-election advertising and lobbying that went on to get 
 this GST. And of course wealthy Australians will be quite comfortable with this GST. And why would they not be? The tax package is designed to assist them. It is really all about giving them a leg-up and who cares about the rest of us. That is the truth. The majority of Australians will be left behind, struggling with price rises and the insecurity that will come with the squeeze on jobs that will result from the GST.
It was very interesting to see in the Australian yesterday the report of some Liberal moderates who were lamenting the growing gap in status and living standards within Australia between the rich and the poor. With the passage of this bill today, with this GST coming onto the Australian scene, they will certainly have their job cut out for them, because there is no question but that this is going to hit lower income Australians, average families and average workers and make life very difficult for them.
In 1996, when this government was elected, we saw the government really put this country to sleep with the huge budget cuts, severe cutbacks to services and the backward looking social agenda that this government promoted. It has squashed this country's aspirations and put the country to sleep. That was bad enough, but now we are starting the bad dream—the nightmare of the GST. I hope that it is just a bad dream. It would be great in this particular case to actually be able to go back to my electorate and say, `Listen, we were proved wrong. Sorry, I was wrong. Everything we said about the GST was wrong.' But that is very unlikely, because if you look at the enormous weight of evidence that came out in the Senate inquiry, and also from overseas experience, it tells us very clearly what we can expect when the GST comes in. It tells us that this is going to be a very unfair tax. There have been no great pains taken to hide this. It is very clear that people on incomes of over $100,000 are getting massive benefits to the tune of $75 a week extra under this package, whereas middle income earners are expecting something like 39c to a two-income family on about $45,000.
Mr Emerson interjecting—
—Yes, great. Won't that be good? I look around my electorate and talk to the people there about what their concerns are. They might get a TV or video every 10 or 15 years. Rent, a night out at the leagues club, their second-hand cars, the maintenance on their older houses and cars are all going to go up and make life that much more difficult for them. It is an unfair tax. But probably what galls me the most is that it is so unimaginative. This package is a handout to the wealthy and a slug on the poor and average Australians. It is so unimaginative. What is in there for young people?
—Less than a dollar a week.
—Less than a dollar a week? They might be able to spend that on the increased HECS that the government has saddled them with. They might be able to spend that instead of the youth allowance that they will no longer get under this government. Their lives will be so much more difficult and their aspirations further squashed.
What has this package got for the growing regional area that I come from? We are looking to a future where we can engage in growing service industries, information technology industries, the education industry and the tourism industry to supplement our traditional base. What do we get? We get a tax that will slug those industries and make our progress, our development, that much more difficult to come by. It is an unfair tax. It has nothing for the people of Capricornia—they have said so once and they will say so again.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—This is my 22nd speech on the GST since my election on 3 October last year. Never before has the political divide between the coalition and Labor been so sharp, never before have the ideals of Liberal and Labor been so diametrically opposed, and never before have the stakes been so high in this battle of ideals. As Australians awaken to the dawning of the 21st century in the new millennium, they must question what sort of a society we aspire to be. Australians have traditionally embraced the notion of a fair go. We are in grave danger of losing our egalitarian streak, of tolerating ever-widening inequality, and the 
 GST package will accelerate Australia along the road of inequality. This is the Prime Minister's dream, aided and abetted by the Treasurer, who should know better.
The government's GST package offers tax cuts of more than $80 a week to high income earners, but it offers less than a dollar a week to many young people. It offers no more than $2.60 a week to age pensioners, and it provides a clear loss to many self-funded retirees—a point that seemed lost on the government when Mr Howard paraded himself as the champion of self-funded retirees and introduced a tax package which will make them clear losers. Lower income earners and pensioners are highly vulnerable to the goods and services tax, and they are highly vulnerable to an increase in the GST rate. This has been the experience of 22 out of 23 countries which have a GST. Lower income earners and pensioners are highly vulnerable to a government cutting holes in the compensation safety net, which was precisely the experience of New Zealand.
Let us be clear: the government is not introducing a GST to fund extra social services such as education. From 1 July next year, financial assistance grants, the untied grants to the states, will be abolished entirely. After the so-called transition period with the states, the specific purpose payments—that is, the tied grants—will be available to be cut, and they will be cut. Seventeen billion dollars of those specific purpose payments are at this stage used to fund vital social services, but they will be used by a conservative government to fund further cuts to higher rates of income tax when the specific purpose payments are cut. That is the agenda. This government has no interest in repairing the income tax base. The Leader of the National Party has told his party room on trusts, `We will kill it in cabinet.'
We are in the information age, and Australia is divided into two halves. As Professor Bob Gregory has said from his analysis, `One half of Australia does not know how the other half lives.' Never before has the strength of Australian society depended so much on providing a decent education for children in the disadvantaged half of Australia, yet the GST 
 will apply to basic education costs—to school uniforms, to school shoes, to stationery, to public transport. So do not believe the government and do not believe the Democrats when they say education is GST free. It is not. I see that the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs is here. He knows very well that education is not GST free.
In his speech last night the Prime Minister invoked the memory of his heroine, Margaret Thatcher, who declared, `There is no such thing as society.' The Prime Minister of Australia shares this view. He has the view that equality does not matter because there is no such thing as society. His agenda is to continue to cut higher rates of income tax and to increase consumption taxes. That is what he wants to see happen. This will be associated with cuts in tied grants to the states or vital social services, including support for children in disadvantaged areas. I hope the Prime Minister is not malicious in this, but I am not so confident about that. Perhaps he just does not know how the other half lives. How would he? He has been in parliament for more than 20 years representing a relatively affluent electorate.
The battle of ideals does not end here today with the passage of this legislation. The Australian Labor Party will fight for the honour of representing ordinary Australians in government and restoring basic fairness, decency and equality of opportunity for Australian society.",REPS,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (BONUSES FOR OLDER AUSTRALIANS) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice—an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians. It will be recorded as the day when the social compact that has governed this nation for the last 100 years was torn up. It will be recorded as the day when the nation's taxation system moved from progressivity to regressivity. It will be recorded as the day when the parliament of the country said to the poor of the country that they could all go and take a running jump. And it will be recorded as the day which marked the beginning of the end of 
 tied grants to the states—grants which have underpinned much of the social development of the nation over the last quarter century. The national tragedy is this: so much of what is being done here today is not able to be undone or, if so, not for a long time.
Last night the Prime Minister gave us his exposition of why the government is embarking on this new $33 billion taxation odyssey. He said the GST represented the fifth pillar of national economic reform. He said the first was financial deregulation, which he rightly attributed to the previous Labor government. He said the second was national tariff reform, which he again rightly attributed to the previous Labor government. He said the third was fiscal consolidation, the fourth labour market reform and the fifth the GST. The latter three, of course, he kept for his own legacy.
I will leave to one side the absurdity of the claim concerning fiscal consolidation. In fact, it is a bit difficult not to fiscally consolidate when you have a natural turn in the business cycle such as the one we have seen in the last several years. I will also leave to one side his dubious claims concerning the doberman-driven approach to labour market reform pursued by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. But I will not leave to one side his claim concerning the last pillar, the GST, and what is supposed to be achieved by this pillar in genuine, as opposed to rhetorical, national economic reform.
Last night the Prime Minister and the Treasurer finally had their big opportunity to argue the logical case for this consumption tax—to argue just how this tax package will boost economic growth, how it will boost employment, how it is supposed to overcome what they claim to be a collapse in the revenue system of the Commonwealth, how it will enhance fairness and how it will advantage small business. But what did they do last night? They squibbed it. Do you know why they squibbed last night, Madam Deputy Speaker Kelly? Because there is not a case to argue on any of these points.
Through the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, sitting at the 
 table, we would present to the Treasurer a very simple challenge. Answer us this simple question: if this is so good for the nation, tell us how much the economy will grow by as a consequence of the introduction of this tax package which it would not otherwise grow by. Give us a number in terms of what additional jobs will be generated for the nation as a consequence of the introduction of this package which would not otherwise have been generated. Give us a number in terms of how much the revenue system of the Commonwealth is supposed to be collapsing by which this new tax arrangement will compensate for. Why doesn't the government give us these numbers, despite our repeated requests for it to define and quantify just what it hopes to achieve? Because the government knows that the numbers are all bad. That is why we have such silence from it.
The only thing we had from the Treasurer last night—this Treasurer who is almost like a personality permanently in search of sincerity—was his latter-day discovery of the poor. This is new. At five minutes to midnight, we were given a new rationale for the GST: to secure, he said, the social bonus; to look after the poor, he said. This is a most novel approach indeed from the Treasurer. It is doubly novel coming from a party that does not have a social policy or believe in social policy. It is a party that believes it is best to replace social policy by noblesse oblige.
There are two fundamental flaws in the logic of what the Treasurer had to say in this place last night. Firstly, he claimed that the revenue system was broken and incapable of delivering sufficient revenues for the future but he adduced no evidence to that effect. Secondly, he said that the Liberal Party's vision was somehow to redress this social imbalance for the future and to be concerned about the nation's social base. But the fact remains that the entire drift of Howard government policy these last three years has been to destroy the social base of the nation and to retreat from the role of government overall.
Finally, there is the sincerity of this government in approaching this package altogether. In 1996 the Prime Minister said 
 that we would `never ever' have it. In 1999 the Treasurer said that it could never be food exempt, otherwise the economic rationale for the whole package would collapse. This package is a disaster for the nation. It will deliver only inequity; it will deliver only unfairness. It will not provide any substantial jobs. It will not additionally grow the economy. It should be rejected by the Australian nation. (Time expired)

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I indicate that the opposition has no objection to the amendments which the 
 government is putting forward here. This is evidence of our good faith, our sincerity in relation to issues of genuine taxation reform. So, when the government comes before the House—as it has done in relation to this bill and these amendments—with proposals which we believe are worthwhile and do constitute genuine taxation reform, we are only too happy to support them. What we are not willing to support are endeavours by this government, under the guise of taxation reform, to shift the taxation burden towards those who are least able to afford it. This has been occurring in relation to the imposition of a GST. A GST will impact most severely on low income earners; it will impact most severely on those who are retired and for whom it is too late to go back into the work force and earn new money under the lower income tax rates; and it will impact most severely on small business.
As the shadow minister for small business at the table and others are aware, it is small business that will be transformed into tax collectors, with the number of tax collection points going from some 75,000 or 80,000 existing wholesale sales tax collection points to some 1.3 million tax collection points. In the process small business will end up with a massive administrative burden—and this from the government which has promised to cut the red tape burden for small business by 50 per cent. What a joke that will turn out to be!
Let me indicate that we are not prepared to support the kind of tax reform which shifts the burden onto those who are least able to afford it, in circumstances where the government proposed that $6.6 billion of taxation cuts—over 50 per cent of its original income tax cuts plan—would go to the top 20 per cent of income earners; in other words, shifting the taxation burden in a regressive way. We are not prepared to support that.
We see evidence from abroad that the price rises as the result of a GST will be much greater than the government has claimed and that it is in no position to monitor—much less enforce—the rate of price increase. Consequently, all the calculations in its various packages and scenarios about people being better off and worse off will turn out to be 
 inaccurate. As a result, many Australians will be worse off following the introduction of the GST. It will impact most severely on small business, most severely on retired people and most severely on charities and community activities. As we have been indicating today and previously, we will continue to oppose that legislation. But because the amendments that have come back before the House do constitute legitimate tax reform we are happy to support them.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak in support of the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999 . This bill will form the basis of the question regarding a republic to be put at the referendum that, I understand, will be held on 6 November this year. Before the question can be put to the people, a referendum bill such as this should secure an absolute majority in each of the two houses of the federal parliament, and to become law it will then require a double majority in a sense from the people—a majority of all those voting and majority support in a majority of states.
Whilst I will be supporting the bill, I will not be voting for this bipartisan appointment of the president model endorsed by the Constitutional Convention communique, nor do I support Australia moving from a constitutional monarchy to this or any other model. 
 Few things are more difficult or more painful than change. Yet it is change more than anything else which characterises the society and the world in which we are now living. But change for its own sake, change which is unprincipled, has the potential to do enormous damage.
John Kenneth Galbraith, the great North American economist, said that, if people are given the choice of change or proving that change is unnecessary, most people start working on the proof. Late in 1997 one of my constituents sent me a book authored by the German physicist and philosopher Bernhard Philberth entitled Revelation, which is a fairly heavy but recommendable theological read on change and how people deal with it. In it Philberth said of change:
Progress leads to chaos if not anchored in tradition. Tradition becomes rigid if it does not prepare the way for progress. But a perverted traditionalism and a misguided progressivism propel each other towards a deadly excess, hardly leaving any ground between them.
That, in a sense, summarises what in many ways has been happening in our own country over the last three or four years, and nowhere is it more evident than in the debate about constitutional change.
We have one group of Australians, whose sacrifices and values really made the country what it is today, who really question why change is necessary and who are deeply concerned that the sorts of values that were so important to them may not be the cornerstone or the foundation of the future that we are now striving to build. Then, at the other end, we have Philberth's progressivists who seemingly want cultural and economic change for its own sake and who neither understand nor respect the values of Philberth's traditionalists.
Today in 1999 we stand on the threshold of a new century and also a new millennium. It is a time during which we consider what we will leave in this century and that which we wish to carry into the next. When Sir Henry Parkes delivered his Tenterfield oration in 1889 and called for the establishment of a people's convention to devise the constitution which would be necessary for bringing into 
 existence a federal government, he could not have possibly envisaged the enormous economic, technological, cultural and social changes that would sweep the face and fabric of Australia over the following century. But he and his co-authors of the Australian Constitution could look back on thousands of years of civilisation and hundreds of years of governance to those things of enduring and stable constitutional value in what was still then very much changing times. Perhaps unsurprising for the time, they chose a constitutional monarchy. Yet here we are a century later, with 100 years of experience, free of insurrection and political instability and seemingly free of the political and judicial corruption endemic in other parts of the world.
Our GDP per head of population is now four times higher than it was a century ago. But, over the past 20 years, something has happened to young Australians. Confidence in the future is a minority position in almost every survey taken of young people's attitudes to the future over the last five years. When I was 10—I am now 40, so my 12-year-old kids think I am half-dead—you could go from one end of Australia to the other and it was essentially a homogeneous society. We had a common set of values and beliefs that held us together—God, king and country. You knew what it meant to be an Australian and, in a very real sense, you had a sense of belonging to the society in which you lived. Inevitably, these things change, but you have to ask yourself whether, over the last 20 or perhaps 30 years, we have created a country in which many young people feel that the only thing they have to believe in is themselves and that there is perhaps no God, king and country—not as much as there might have been when I was a young boy.
There are two principal reasons why I support the constitutional arrangements. I am not a person who hangs portraits of the Queen around my home, and I am one of those people who feel a bit uncomfortable going to Rotary dinners and toasting the Queen—all I can seem to think about is Prince Charles and some of his phone conversations with 
 Camilla. It does not have anything to do with the soap opera antics of the royals.
My support for the constitutional monarchy relates to two principal arguments. I know my friend the member for Kooyong will smile and perhaps disagree with me as I say this: the most important things that have happened to me in my life and changed the way I think have happened when I least expected them to. On 24 April 1992, I got on a plane to go from Melbourne to Sydney, and I picked up the Melbourne Age. As you usually do at that time of year, I read a profile piece of a then 99-year-old man who had landed on the beaches of Gallipoli. Even with the push for euthanasia, halfway through this article he said, `I am glad I will be dead soon, because I do not want to be alive when Australia becomes a republic.' It was quite a striking remark for someone to make.
About a week later, I turned on the ABC on a television in a Brisbane hotel room. The ABC used to run an excellent program called Attitudes which was an avant-garde approach to youth issues. It was covering the issue of a republic. Young people of 16, 17 or 18 years of age were asked whether they thought Australia should become a republic. All enthusiastically embraced the concept. They were then asked to name one minister in the then federal government. Only half could name one. Then they were asked to name a second minister. Not one could name a second, and then not one knew what the Australian Constitution is, let alone what it does. I thought, as I watched and listened to this, that whatever we have means much more to a generation of Australians than I will certainly understand. If we are to embrace and adopt change, we have a responsibility to say to the next generation in the year 2020, `I'm sorry we got our constitutional arrangements wrong, but we were in a bit of a hurry to see the balloons go up during the Olympic Games.'
The second reason will seem ethereal to some members. You can open a newspaper or turn on a television or radio in any part of the country on any day of the week and you confront evidence of a society that is failing in many ways. We have amongst the highest 
 suicide rate of young people in the industrialised world. We have a preoccupation with death also in the form of a euthanasia debate, whatever one's attitude to that is. We have elevated gambling to the status of a religion in many parts of the country. We have a level of drug use, legal and illegal, which has reached unprecedented levels. Each day brings further evidence of the growing divide between the extremes of wealth and poverty. We are not unique in this regard, but I will go back to my earlier remarks about the mesh of values that holds our society together and provides resilience for young people.
Many young Australians feel disengaged from the political process. They feel that the institutions—whether it is the political process, the judiciary, the Constitution, churches or whatever you like—have left them behind and they are not expecting any meaningful role in decisions that are taken about their lives. I believe that in marginalising churches and ethics based and philosophical organisations from public policy debate, in diminishing over the last 20 years the importance of parenting as a full-time occupation, in trivialising the importance of voluntary work in holding our society together and in diminishing respect for institutions—as I certainly believe Mr Keating did when he was the Prime Minister—we have created a culture in which young people think, `The only thing I have to believe in is myself.' You get a group of 16-year-olds together and ask them, `What does it mean to be an Australian? Who are your heroes, and why do you have such confidence in them?' We have said to young Australians in so many ways that they, and only they, are the centre of their own moral universe.
This debate is critically important, but the destiny of our country will not be determined by the economic indices with which we are so understandably obsessed but by our values and our beliefs, the way we see ourselves and the world, and the way we relate to one another. These are very subtle but powerful forces that influence how we feel about ourselves. Values, as Richard Eckersley has said, matter because they are essentially about how we get along with each other. They also 
 mould our identities, our beliefs and our goals. One of the things that I do not think is appreciated by many people in this place—but I think is quietly understood by many Australians—is that the emerging political battles are not between Labor and Liberal. They are not between the left and the right. They are instead an emerging political divide between those who, on the one hand, have an ethics and values based philosophical approach to life's problems and its solutions and, on the other, those who see nothing other than the primacy of markets as an end unto itself. This, as I know from listening in 1997 to my friend the member for Kooyong, seems to have translated into a deep-seated ache in the community for a king. The wish for a popularly elected head of state reflects, in my opinion, an ill-chosen vehicle for meeting an exasperated, underlying desire among Australians for a leader who is above politics—someone who is not beholden to our political parties and who is seen not to be enmeshed in the Westminster system of political confrontation.
I know that some members will be thinking, `Well, what the hell has this got to do with changing to a republic or not?' I would suggest to you that it actually has everything to do with our constitutional arrangements. In terms of the more mundane, the reluctance of Australians to change the Constitution seems to be matched only by their reluctance to read it. A large number seem unaware that Australia has a written Constitution, let alone a bicameral federal parliament. Constitutional monarchies are of course historically most stable. They are free and democratic societies while most of the world's republics are not. I have noted that those who are fondest of pushing a republic seem not to have lived in one. Of the six oldest democratic nations, four have British origins and four are constitutional monarchies.
Almost all of the republican push, as the member for Kooyong has said at another time, is based on a fallacy and I think a deliberate distortion. Australia is a totally independent country. I have never owed allegiance to the Queen of England. My loyalty is to the Queen of Australia, which of 
 course is a distinct legal entity. Sovereignty, at least since Charles I was beheaded, has resided here in the parliament. It has resided with the people. The real question is not the one that is frequently put up by republicans: do we want an Australian head of state—which makes you wonder what Sir William Deane is—but how can we as a nation, as a federation, best govern ourselves in a world that is vastly different from what it was 100 years ago?
The real constitutional issues that face us are not whether we have a president, nor indeed whether we have a preamble to a Constitution that most Australians have not read. The real question that faces us is the relationship between the three tiers of government. How many politicians do we need in this country? What sort of purpose should they actually serve? How can we best conduct our affairs as a nation in a rapidly shrinking world, economically and culturally, when we have a number of states and territories working under a federation? It continually seems that we are too frightened to address the real questions we need to face as Australians and we are dealing with, in many senses, what I believe to be window dressing.
The problem for the republicans, the people who push this model, is that, if you try to give all the power the Governor-General currently has to someone who is elected, you are actually separating status from glory. As the member for Kooyong has said earlier, the royals get status but they have little real power in this country, while the people's representatives—that is, us—have power but, I can assure you, as you know, we have no glory.
An elected person, even under this two-thirds majority of parliament model that will be put to the referendum, immediately becomes a politician. As soon as you politicise the powers of the Crown instead of them being used only for the common good, they can be used for party or personal political advantage. Anyone who thinks that you will not have political parties organising the election or promotion of a president, even in a two-thirds parliamentary model, is deceiving themselves. 
Somebody who is above the political fray frees everybody up to serve Australia without being political in their motives and actions. Executive power, the power to govern, is vested by proposed section 59 in the president. The Federal Executive Council is to advise the president and the president is required to act according to the advice of the council, the Prime Minister or another minister of state. However, proposed section 59 in this bill also recognises that the president may independently use a power which was a reserve power of the Governor-General. It stipulates that any use of such a reserve power must be done in accordance with the constitutional conventions relating to the exercise of that power.
If you think about that, that is going to change the fundamental workings of the Australian political system. Governor-Generals are appointed by the monarch on the advice of one person—the Prime Minister. That Governor-General is not supported by any electoral mandate, but the reserve powers of the Governor-General are formidable. Governor-Generals can, and in some circumstances have, as the member for Kooyong said in addressing the John Stuart Mill Society, choose the Prime Minister, and they have on occasions selected the leaders of the minority parties. They can dismiss governments on the grounds of breaching the Constitution and they can refuse the government's advice that parliament be dissolved. The Governor-General can also dismiss a Prime Minister who cannot secure supply.
The republicans' proposal would create a presidency that combines the powers of the Governor-General with an unprecedented degree of parliamentary and political legitimacy and national authority. If two-thirds of us in this parliament—and, as those in the gallery know, this is something else that is wrong with this place; no matter what we say here, they disagree or vice versa—vote for a person to become the president of Australia, in the minds of Australians that person will have far more moral and political authority than the Prime Minister of the country. The Prime Minister is elected by the members of his or, hopefully soon, her political party and 
 then leads that party with a policy platform to an election to the Australian people.
But imagine a situation where all the people in the Liberal and National parties vote for a person and at least half the people in the Labor Party vote for that same person. That person will be seen to have far more power and authority than will the Prime Minister of the country. The Prime Minister is constantly under attack not only from the media, the opposition and members of the Australian community but also at times from members of his or her own party. But if you have a person who would in many cases have much more support than that Prime Minister, and you gave that person all the powers that are currently possessed by the Governor-General, you will change the balance of power in our country—a country that has, as I said in my opening remarks, enjoyed an enormous amount of stability which is the envy of the rest of the world.
In all of the emphasis on symbols there are two things that have been obscured. The first is that changing to a republic and a presidency will, as I said, change our political institutions. It will change the patterns of authority and legitimacy that have evolved since Henry Parkes and his colleagues got the Australian Federation going. The second point which has to be emphasised again is that an appointed Governor-General changing to a president and elected by a parliament possessing the powers of the Governor-General is going to have an enormous and detrimental impact on the political system.
In day-to-day political life it would not matter a great deal. But once or twice every decade in our country are great moments in our history, and Australians would look to an elected president—certainly elected by a two-thirds majority of parliament and more so a popularly elected president—to intervene in the affairs of government. Apart from anything else—I go back to my other remarks—it is time we stood up in this country and transmitted a sense of respect and understanding and education of our constitutional arrangements to the next generation of young Australians so they can understand how our country has evolved and why this is so 
 important to us as Australians before we embrace change that most people do not understand. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I note that the member for Bradfield, prior to me, raised a number of matters which are frequently raised by monarchists and those supporting the retention of our existing constitutional arrangements, and I will endeavour to meet those arguments. The republic referendum bill will be submitted to the people on 6 November. It will require a double majority—that is, it will require a majority of votes from Australians and a majority of Australians in a majority of states supporting the bill. So effectively it has the traditional referendum safeguard.
The proposal which is being submitted is a faithful reflection of the outcome of the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention of February 1998 and significantly a recommendation, by and large, that came from Dr Lowitja O'Donoghue, who is an Aboriginal Australian. That is significant in the context that when our Federation was formed Aboriginal Australians were excluded in most states from that vote. So that is of particular historic and noteworthy significance.
Fundamentally, as the Leader of the Opposition said, this bill proposes to alter our Constitution so that it will provide for an Australian citizen, chosen from nominations submitted by the people and approved by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the parliament, to replace the British monarch as Australia's head of state. The Leader of the Opposition argued, and we strongly support, the fact that those three criteria should be included in the long title to the bill, but that is a matter which will run the course of discussion.
Compare and contrast the selection of an Australian citizen nominated by the people, selected by a two-thirds majority on a bipartisan basis, with the Leader of the Opposition endorsing the Prime Minister's nomination, with the rules of succession that apply to our current head of state. The rules of succession which arise from the Act of Settlement 1700 and the Bill of Rights in the 17th century 
 provide that succession of the British monarch is limited to the heirs of the body of the Princess Sophia, Electress of Hanover, granddaughter of James I. So that is the chromosomal, if you like, trail of our hereditary monarch. That has to be a precondition to becoming the monarch.
Also, I was alarmed to hear from my adviser that those two acts—the Act of Settlement 1700 and the Bill of Rights 1689—would exclude me from ever becoming our head of state under our present system. Why? Because those bills provide that anyone who should marry a `Papist' or be `reconciled to the Church of Rome' shall be excluded from and incapable of inheriting, possessing or enjoying the Crown. I am married to a Roman Catholic. It is an outrage in this day and age that those rules of succession would include a religious exclusion. Nonetheless, they do and those rules of succession very much apply. They cannot be varied without the consent of the United Kingdom, Ireland and all its dominions.
But in order to consider whether change is appropriate it is necessary to have regard to our current Constitution. Just last week, in the case of former Senator-elect Heather Hill, the majority judgment of the court said that, while the text of our Constitution has not changed over the last century, its operation certainly has. It is regrettable that so many Australians are ignorant of our constitutional provisions. It is important to remember that our Constitution was brought into existence by an act of the United Kingdom parliament—the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. It is important to realise that the preamble itself states that our Federation is `one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'.
Section 1 provides that the legislative power of the Commonwealth is `vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives'. Under section 2, the Governor-General is formally appointed by the Queen. Under section 58 of the Constitution, proposed laws may be reserved by the Governor-General `for the Queen's pleasure'. Under section 59 of 
 the Constitution, laws may be disallowed by the Queen. Under section 61 of the Constitution, the `executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen'.
Australians are substantially ignorant of the extent to which we have been under the influence of the British government throughout this century. For example, the British Nationality Act and Status of Aliens Act 1914 provided that `any person born within His Majesty's dominions and allegiance' was deemed to be a `natural born citizen'. Our Citizenship Act 1948 provided that an Australian citizen was also a British subject. It was not until 1981 that the British Nationality Act was amended so that, for the purpose of British law, reference to Australians as being British subjects was withdrawn. Similarly, it was not until 1 May 1987 that all reference to the `status of British subject' was withdrawn from our Citizenship Act.
It is not commonly known that until 1 December 1987 diplomatic appointments were approved by the Queen as part of the royal prerogative. Since December 1987, they have been made through the Governor-General in the exercise of that Crown prerogative, but up until then that was not the case. So it is important to realise that we have had a strong connection with the British Crown; we have literally been under and subject to the British Crown. That has evolved to a stage where we have now developed independence in all but one respect: our head of state.
As early as 1904, Professor Corbett wrote in the Commonwealth Law Review that the powers of the Crown under the Australian Constitution were far more extensive than those which existed in England at the turn of the century. He wrote:
In Australia, . . . these powers . . . loom here larger than in their country of origin.
From Federation, we developed to a stage where, in 1931, the Statute of Westminster was passed, a United Kingdom act, providing that the United Kingdom could not legislate with respect to its dominions, which of course included Australia. That was endorsed with the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942 by the Australian government. However, the United Kingdom parliament still had the 
 ability to legislate with respect to states and there were also continuing appeals to the Privy Council, which locked our judicial system very much into that of the Commonwealth.
The Australia Act 1986 was passed by the Commonwealth, mirrored by the Australia Act 1986 passed in the United Kingdom, again showing the influence of the United Kingdom parliament. It was with those two acts that we finally obtained independence politically and judicially from the United Kingdom. Now, a century on, we have obtained our political and judicial independence from the United Kingdom.
This bill will substantially rectify the inconsistencies that are contained in the actual wording of our Constitution. It retains and respects the current procedures needed to retain our system of federal representative parliamentary democracy while allowing Australia to have one of our own—an Australian—as our head of state.
The opponents of change, those who ultimately support the status quo, are divided as to why they support it. Those who favour a monarchy have argued that the bill will endanger our system of government, as the previous speaker did. Those who favour a more radical change argue that it does not go far enough. But, if you look at the main features of what will be our new structure, you can see that an appropriate balance has been achieved.
Firstly, there are those who have criticised the bill as not being democratic enough, as not giving Australians a direct say in the identity of our head of state. Compare that to what happens now: the Governor-General is effectively appointed by the Prime Minister. Under the proposed bills, every Australian will have the right to nominate or be nominated to serve as president.
Subject to the person satisfying the same qualifications that apply to an Australian seeking election to the federal parliament, the Presidential Nominations Committee will accept and consider all such nominations. The committee will provide independent advice to the Prime Minister as to who the president should be. That committee will be made up 
 of representatives of the state governments and representatives of the community. It will provide a short list to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister in turn will have to obtain the consent of the Leader of the Opposition to the appointment. Then that nomination, which will be made jointly, needs the approval of a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of parliament, including those elected directly from their electorates and those elected by proportional representation in the Senate. So, while that process is not a direct election by the people, it is certainly far superior to one person being chosen by another individual, namely, the Prime Minister. So it is much more sophisticated in the democratic input it receives from the Australian people.
If, however, it went to the stage of being a directly popular election, there is no doubt at all that you would see a politician coming through. Both the major political parties, perhaps others, would get in behind one or other of those candidates, and it is likely that that person would be elected only with a 51 per cent majority. The only way you are going to avoid a politician becoming a head of state, yet having input from the Australian people, is through the system proposed in this bill.
The second issue of controversy which frequently arises is with respect to the dismissal of the president. The bill has been criticised as leaving too much power to the Prime Minister to dismiss the president. But, again, the Governor-General can effectively be dismissed by the Prime Minister, albeit with the formality of that request being made to the British monarch. In other words, the current arrangements enable the Prime Minister to dismiss a Governor-General without any accountability whatsoever, whereas what is required under the proposed bill is that, while the Prime Minister can issue an instrument of dismissal, the Prime Minister remains accountable to the Australian parliament. He must, unless an election occurs, bring the matter before the parliament for the parliament's deliberation within 30 days.
Again, it is a far more democratic, instructive and accountable procedure than currently exists. In none of these respects can it be said 
 that the proposed bill damages or endangers our future constitutional arrangements. It is obviously a manifest improvement on those arrangements to which I have referred. In all respects, the bill will make our Constitution better.
For the first time in our constitutional history, the bill will also enshrine in our Constitution the institutions fundamental to the workings of our democracy. For example, there will be reference made to the offices of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, which are currently not recognised in our Constitution. The previous speaker referred to section 59 of the proposed bill, which is a significant section. It provides in one paragraph that:
The President shall act on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, the Prime Minister or another Minister of State; but the President may exercise a power that was a reserve power of the Governor-General in accordance with the constitutional conventions relating to the exercise of that power.
It firstly expressly recognises the existence of reserve powers but says that, in all but the reserve powers, the president must act on the advice of the executive council. The reserve powers are those powers of dismissal of a prime minister, appointment of a prime minister, acceding to a request to dissolve parliament or refusing a request to dissolve parliament. In all bar those areas, the president, as expressly stated, must act on the advice of the ministers. So it enforces and entrenches a system of accountable democracy.
With respect to the Crown prerogatives which have developed—those prerogatives are the Crown prerogative to declare war, to declare peace, to enter into treaties and to make diplomatic appointment, to which I referred earlier—they are, again, expressly recognised in the Constitution. There is currently no recognition of those Crown prerogatives. But, again, insofar as they are not reserve powers, those prerogatives can be exercised only on the advice of the ministerial council—that is, the executive of the government. So we cannot have a situation, which could theoretically exist at present, where the head of state could exercise Crown prerogative to declare war on another state. That 
 cannot happen under these proposed constitutional arrangements because the action must be taken on advice.
Equally for the first time the existence of constitutional conventions will be recognised. They have not previously been recognised in our Constitution, and the exercise of reserve powers, to which I have referred, will have to be exercised in light of those constitutional conventions. There is recognition in section 8 of schedule 3 that those constitutional conventions will develop over time. Far from breaking our connection with history, far from breaking our connection with the Westminster system, which I agree with the previous speaker is a fundamentally important system which has been the cornerstone of the successful democracies throughout the world, it specifically preserves the continuity of those fundamental principles, in particular the principle of responsible democracy.
The bill specifically provides for and preserves actions performed by the Governor-General, the parliament and its proceedings, the qualification of senators and members, the executive government, the courts and their jurisdiction and proceedings before them. It will enable the states to determine whether or not they themselves want to have a republic system of government. If they do not, they can retain their links to the monarchy.
It will also enable and specifically acknowledge our federal system of government, and it will generally recognise the reality of where we are today in Australia—that is, we are an independent, proud and sovereign nation. We are entitled to our own independence not only in substance but in form. Our most important and fundamental document, our Constitution, should reflect that fact. It should reflect the fact that any child born in this nation can aspire to anything they want, including our head of state, which currently they cannot.
In this debate there will be others who disagree because they do not think it goes far enough or because they think it damages our system. They should ask themselves these questions, and reasonable Australians will: do they want to see an Australian as our head of state but do not want it to be a politician? Do they want to keep our current system of 
 government, and do they want change, carefully thought through, to be change by evolution and not revolution? Clearly, this bill does that. It is a sensible path between two extremes, and it will give Australians what we so richly deserve: a full and final declaration of our status as an independent and proud nation.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—The Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999 will alter the Constitution by establishing Australia as a republic with a president, if the change is supported at a referendum by a majority of Australians—by a majority of voters in a majority of states. The bill has emerged from a long process of debate that has deep wellsprings in Australia's history and Australia's current circumstances. It is a debate which focused on basic concerns about Australia's nationhood and identity and the balance between our traditions and our future.
The bill delivers on the commitments made by the coalition both in opposition and in government. The commitment was to have a Constitutional Convention and to put to the Australian people the consensus that emerged from that convention. That commitment has been kept. The model which attracted the most support at the convention was the model of a president appointed by a two-thirds majority of the Australian parliament.
The bill would remove most of the Constitution's references to the monarchy and convert Australia's system of national government from a constitutional monarchy to a republic with a president as a head of state vested with the executive power of the Commonwealth. The constitutional change would entrench a mechanism for choosing the president involving the establishment of a committee to consider and report to the Prime Minister on nominations for the president from the public. Following consideration of the committee's report, the Prime Minister would move, seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, in a joint sitting of the Commonwealth parliament, that a named Australian citizen be chosen as president. A two-thirds majority of the members of the Common 
 wealth parliament would need to approve the motion.
The president's powers would be the same as the Governor-General's, and the constitutional conventions applying to the exercise of the Governor-General's power would apply to the president's power. The president would not be a member of a parliament, or legislature or a political party, and the president may be removed by the Prime Minister, but the Prime Minister must seek the approval of the House of Representatives for the removal within 30 days unless an election is held.
This is the essence of the bill to establish an Australian republic, but it does need to be said that the attitudes of the Australian population to a republic are complex. The republicans are split. Symbolic change to an Australian head of state will satisfy one group. The other group want to elect the president; deny this and they switch and support the status quo.
The monarchists are also divided. A majority is committed to the Crown as an institution. A significant minority, but for a personal attachment to Queen Elizabeth II, would favour a republic. There is undoubtedly a variety of perspectives on what the change would mean. For some people, the success of the referendum would mean a fundamentally important and positive advance in our sense of ourselves as Australians. Many supporters of the so-called minimalist republic model embodied in the bill, such as the member for Melbourne, would probably agree that Paul Keating's equation of a change to a republic would mean a rejuvenation of the Australian national spirit.
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—Actually, the Leader of the Opposition said that, if you scratched most members of the Labor Party, they would turn out to be direct electionists as well. So you are full bore?
Mr Tanner interjecting—
—So you are voting against the bill?
—No.
—Mr Keating, when Prime Minister, said:
. . . the creation of an Australian republic can actually deliver a heightened sense of unity, it can enliven our national spirit and, in our own minds and those of our neighbours, answer beyond doubt the perennial question of Australian identity—the question of who we are and what we stand for.
Some of those opposing the republic have championed the constitutional monarchy as the defender and guarantor of the stable, free and tolerant system of government that has evolved in Australia since Federation. Australians for Constitutional Monarchy have, in the past at least, claimed as their mandate, `The defence of the Australian Constitution written and voted for by Australians.' I have to say that monarchists, since the convention, have been joined by radical direct-election republicans, apparently not including the member for Melbourne, who oppose the support of this bill.
Underlying the minimalist republicans' views is a belief, embodied in the most substantial sentiment of the convention and in the constitutional alteration bill, that the change to a republic in its minimalist form is purely symbolic bringing with it no real change to the processes of the Australian political system. The fact, however—and here I do agree with my colleague the member for Bradfield—is that there will be a significant impact from a change to a republic, from a Governor-General to a president.
As I have outlined before, Governors-General are appointed by the monarch on the advice of a single individual, the Prime Minister of the day. Governors-General are unsupported by any direct democratic or parliamentary electoral mandate. Despite this, the reserve powers of the office, the powers exercised not on the advice of the government but at the personal discretion of the Governor-General, are formidable. These powers are consistently in play and do profoundly affect the politics of our nation.
Governors-General can in some circumstances choose the Prime Minister and have on occasions selected leaders of the minority party. Governors-General can dismiss governments on the grounds of breaching the Consti 
 tution. Governors-General can refuse to accept the government's advice that the parliament be dissolved. A Governor-General can, and has, dismissed a Prime Minister who cannot secure supply.
The present republican proposal would create a presidency combining the powers of the Governor-General with an unprecedented degree of parliamentary legitimacy and national authority. I think it should be reasonably self-evident that the creation of a presidency, retaining the reserve powers as provided for in this bill and the constitutional conventions that apply to the exercise of those powers, alongside the unprecedented parliamentary support and national authority that such a president would have, would over time significantly change the operation of our political system. I believe that we need to face this fact.
I also believe that we need to face another fundamental fact. The indications are that the model proposed by the convention and embodied in this bill to alter the Constitution for a republic with a president elected by politicians is not currently preferred by the majority of Australians. Since the early 1990s, 70 per cent of Australians in all states, from all walks of life, whether male or female, whether Liberal, Labor or Democrat, have expressed the wish that if we are to have an Australian president he or she should be directly elected. In the year since the convention, the minimalist republicans have not persuaded public opinion to change its mind. Over the past few months, polls have indicated that a significant majority of Australians are more likely to support constitutional change if the president was elected by the people rather than by the parliament.
I think it is true, as the member for Bradfield said—I did agree with a number of things he said, but I did not agree with his fairly basic, metaphysical pessimism—that the wish for an elected head of state does reflect an underlying desire in the Australian community for a leader above politics not beholden to parties, a leader who is directly chosen and capable of being dismissed by the will of the people. The expectation that an elected president would meet these wishes and desires 
 might seem idealistic, and the cynics' bottom line on anyone wishing to be elected president is probably best summarised by the graffiti: `No matter who you vote for, you always end up with a politician.'
However, the public's idealism is a potent political force. Dismissing a public preference that appears to be so clearly expressed and so enduring does have consequences. My overriding concern is that for a debate designed to define Australia's constitutional character into the next millennium the process is in grave danger of being undermined by cynicism, opportunism and, perhaps most corrosively, a systemic failure to address disenfranchised public sentiment.
Appearing last week in a panel debate on ABC TV, who was it that introduced and concluded the debate on behalf of all those opposing the current republic referendum proposal? It was Ted Mack, that self-styled radical republican. That such person should oppose the minimalist republic model is not startling in itself, but when radical republicans advocating the direct election of a president speak on behalf of constitutional monarchists, something curious is happening. The Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy convener Kerry Jones explained why Ted Mack was presenting their case by saying:
The model—
in the bill—
will see politicians voting for a president, not the people of Australia. That's why we welcome our colleagues Ted Mack and Phil Cleary, who have stood up throughout the debate and said give people a vote, give the people of Australia a say if you're going to change to a republic.
Ms Jones and the monarchists appear to have abandoned their principled defence of a constitutional monarchy, opting instead to tactically support the newly arrived advocates of a direct election of the president. Ted Mack presents the no case on behalf of Ms Jones and Ms Jones extols the virtues of directly electing a president in a republic. The two groups are united, not by ideology or common principles, but by outcomes, by the common objective of defeating the minimalist republic model. The new-found alliance is a variation on the old maxim `the enemy of my 
 enemy is my friend'. But, as with all such alliances, they tend to be uncomfortable and they bring with them disturbing consequences.
Earlier this year I argued that there was a strong likelihood that a majority no vote would leave unanswered a fundamental issue—the issue of whether the no vote is a genuine affirmation of a constitutional monarchy or a protest vote by Australians who support a directly elected president but who do not have the option of expressing their view. The newfound alliance between the direct electionists and the monarchists has all but made that likelihood a reality. The alliance of the two groups is made possible because the current referendum process has failed to provide supporters of a direct election with any constructive avenue of expression.
Monarchists, alert to the considerable public support for a direct election of the president, have joined forces with the radical republicans, despite their diametrically opposed positions, in order to maximise their numbers to mount a spoiler campaign against the minimalist republican model. The 6 November referendum provides no opportunity for the expression of views by the substantial proportion of the population who would prefer the direct election of a president.
We are now faced with the reality of holding a national referendum to determine the future of our system of government that, regardless of the merits of the argument, fails to give expression to the preference indicated by a majority of the nation. A successful no vote at the November referendum will under these circumstances resolve little. It will not reflect the endorsement of our current system of government, nor will it provide a clear indication of community sentiment. It would send out only one message: the minimalist model on offer is not the desired option. A successful no vote will not tell us whether the majority of the country favours the retention of the monarchy or prefers the direct election of the president.
The other feature that became apparent in Sunday's debate is that enjoining forces, both the monarchists and the direct electionists, have gone negative. They cannot extol the 
 virtues of their respective cases because that is the one thing that would divide them rather than unite them. Instead, they keep united by repeatedly attacking the minimalist republic model. The focus of the debate has shifted from the relative strengths and weaknesses of both sides and has repositioned itself into a relentless attack on the minimalist republic model.
My concern is that, rather than resolve the current debate, the referendum outcome is likely to sow the seeds for disputation and generate a legacy of disillusionment and disenchantment. The irony is that the whole purpose of this exercise has been to provide the community with an opportunity to have a real choice in our head of state, yet at the same time we are failing to give full expression to community sentiment. We seek to unite rather than divide the Australian community, yet at the same time we are providing no opportunity for a substantial majority of the population to express their preferred option. Any victory from the process is likely to be a hollow one if it is merely tactical rather than a positive endorsement of the merits of one side of the debate or the other. There is a very real danger that the republic referendum risks being overwhelmed by unsustainable contradictions, not grasped by either side of the debate as each strives for what is at best a momentary and, ultimately, a possibly Pyrrhic victory.
We need a considered, full and frank debate over the very real consequences of constitutional change and the changes that will arise from the proposed reforms. Minimalist republicans should not pretend that their proposal would not mean significant change in our political system. Monarchists should dispense with the mythology that we will return to normal after a successful no vote. This will only happen if a no vote is a genuine endorsement of the current system, rather than a protest vote against a republican alternative that a majority finds unacceptable.
The radical republicans must spell out more fully the very serious and complicated constitutional implications of a directly elected president. They need to provide an adequate explanation, detail the serious constitutional 
 concerns over the role and division of powers between the office of president and the Prime Minister and address the creation of alternate sources of authority and legitimacy and the possibility of a directly elected president emerging as a politicised extension of our political parties. They need to face up to the fact that an elected president's democratic legitimacy, flowing directly from the people's choice and the people's vote, would be unsurpassed. Once elected, the president would become a key symbol of national unity and, unlike a Prime Minister from either side who faces consistent, corrosive attacks from Her Majesty's opposition, the president would have no competitors.
The electors would, at a minimum, expect a popularly elected president to express his or her views on national issues and voice their concerns. The president's impact on public opinion would be substantial. Government, opposition, the public and organised interest groups would seek presidential support, and the president's own views would of course find public expression. A new authority and a new influence would be created, and this would impact on public policy and shape political manoeuvres in novel ways. Tensions would undoubtedly emerge between the president, the Prime Minister and the other political institutions that currently dominate the field.
The president that the Australian people currently indicate they want would not just have a new democratic mandate because of direct election; he or she would also have the reserve powers of the Governor-General. In times of crisis, many—and not just the public at large—would look to the president not just for speeches but for actions. It is impossible to anticipate in detail how Australia's political system would evolve under elected presidents with real powers. One thing is certain: there would be frictions, uncertainties and new accommodations that, over time, would profoundly change our system of government.
Australia has an opportunity to deal with the issue of the republic and our head of state in a thoughtful and deliberate way. If we do not grasp this opportunity, the likelihood is that, at some future point, we will find our 
 selves in a position where fundamental structural decisions are driven by political momentum and passion, which will minimise the chances of achieving outcomes that the nation would intend and desire. This referendum debate is about the future of our Constitution. Since 1996, I have argued that it deserves a proper, open, free and honest hearing. It is not about winning at all costs. It is about what we set out to resolve: coming to national consensus, which reflects the informed wishes of the Australian people. Ultimately, the Australian Constitution belongs to the Australian people. Only they can and should decide what form of government we should have. We should maximise their opportunity to choose wisely. But I am afraid that, unless the character of the debate changes, the chances of this are receding. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I am very pleased to be speaking on this historic bill, the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999 . I first raised issues of the need for constitutional reform and a republic—that is, an Australian head of state—in my university lectures in the 1970s. In my book of 1980, entitled Australian Democracy in Crisis , published by Oxford University Press, I devoted a whole section to what I considered then to be the drastic need for reform of the Australian Constitution. Nineteen years later, the Australian Constitution is still in need of drastic reform. As L.F. Crisp pointed out long ago:
The essential nature of the Commonwealth's working system of executive government comes then, not from the words of the Constitution but rather from a whole set of constitutional conventions of responsible governments.
This is the critical point—that the democratic features of the Constitution are based on conventions. However, conventions are open to interpretation and such interpretations do not necessarily refer back to the principles of democracy. Furthermore, it is not clear in Australia, as it is in the United Kingdom, that such constitutional conventions will be considered binding by all persons in the struggle for power.
Allan Patience has argued that Australia's Constitution pays scant attention to the principles of parliamentary democracy. He said:
Rather than liberal constitutional principles, it has been the politics of a narrow pragmatism and parochialism, tempered by an obsequious deference to an outmoded colonial authority, that has guided constitution making in this country.
It is not widely known that according to the constitutional document itself:
The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives . . . 
And I emphasise the words `the Queen'. Furthermore, this constitutional document gives a very substantive veto power to the Governor-General. Again, let me quote something here which I said in 1980:
The powers given to the Governor-General under these provisions are enormous and do not derive from any democratic requirement.
The provisions that I am referring to are worth repeating. They are in section 58, which says:
When a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to this Constitution, that he assents in the Queen's name, or that he withholds assent or that he reserves the law for the Queen's pleasure.
These are very important provisions in the constitutional document. And, of course, it continues:
The Governor-General may return to the House in which it originated any proposed law so presented to him, and may transmit therewith any amendments which he may recommend, and the Houses may deal with the recommendation.
Whatever democratic features exist arise from a faith or a trust that the Queen's representative shall act in accordance with the conventions of democracy. It is on this trust and not on the constitutional document itself that the legitimacy of the Australian state as democratic is based.
The question arises: how powerful are these constitutional understandings? What is to prevent a Governor-General acting in an undemocratic fashion and frustrating the majority's will by refusing to sign important draft legislation and then make it law? It is simply the reliance on the conventions. But, as I have said, how reliable are these conven 
 tions? The difficulty with the reliance on conventions is dramatically highlighted when conventions are broken—an issue which arose during the sacking of the Whitlam government and the constitutional crisis of 1975. From the beginning of the Australian Federation, the general view has been that the Queen and her representative must always act on the advice of the ministers of the government. Edmund Barton stated this point very clearly when he spoke about this matter. I do not have the quote here. Barton's view, which is that the Queen's representative must always act in accordance with the wishes of the ministers, has been challenged. Indeed, it was challenged during the 1995 crisis by constitutional expert Bob Ellicott, who said in terms of that crisis:
It is apparent from a reading of the Constitution that some powers are given to the Governor-General in Council and others simply to the Governor-General. It is, I think, significant, that the powers of dissolution conferred by Ss. 5 and 57 are given to the Governor-General . . . 
meaning to the Governor-General without it being necessarily in council. This refers to the powers for the dismissal of the executive. If one takes a literal reading of the constitutional document, in section 62 it says:
There shall be an Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor-General in the government of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Council shall be chosen and summoned by the Governor-General and sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during his pleasure.
That is very important. In general, we have had a situation where this has been the case. In general, the Governor-General has acted on the advice of his ministers. That has been the practice in Australia. But it should be clear from this that the constitutional document has in fact been a compromise between those who thought of the Governor-General as having significant reserve powers which he exercises on behalf of the Queen and those who have wanted a real commitment to democracy made clear.
This brings us to the current debate. I believe that, rather than the current limited proposals, it would have been better to have addressed the issues that I have mentioned here today—that is, to have had a thorough 
 constitutional overhaul, especially of chapter 2 of the constitutional document. Many specialists believe that the constitutional document contains many outdated provisions which are grossly inadequate for a modern democracy. However, it became clear during the Constitutional Convention—and I recognise it here—that it would have been very difficult to get a community consensus on this matter at this time, especially given the general propensity of the Australian people to be very conservative on constitutional change issues.
This leads me to the central reason why I am supporting this legislation. Under the current constitutional practice, the Queen of England appoints the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day. This practice can become very difficult in a democratic nation in at least two circumstances that we might refer to. The first would be when the appointed Governor-General, who is appointed by the Prime Minister, is too partisan or too biased towards one side of politics and exercises his status, position and even his powers in that way. A second problem is when the appointed Governor-General seeks to exercise direct reserve powers in contradiction to the advice of the democratically elected government and Prime Minister, as happened in the 1975 crisis.
I believe that the current bill achieves a very important result in constitutional terms—that is, to address this issue. We can look at two positive features of the current bill, in terms of this referendum and these changes. Firstly, as many speakers have already said, it provides the opportunity, finally, to have an Australian as our head of state. The real and symbolic significance of this change is huge, especially in our modern multicultural society, where people from many countries no longer perceive any need for a formal association with Great Britain. In saying this I do not in any way wish to take away from the enormous contribution which British culture and especially political and legal traditions have made to our society. However, my second point, which I want to emphasis in light of the comments that I have already made, is that, under the proposal before the parliament 
 the head of state or the president will no longer be appointed by the Prime Minister. Rather, as the Parliamentary Library has said in its Digest, in terms of these constitutional provisions:
The constitutional provisions would simply require the Prime Minister to consider the report of a committee regarding nominations for appointment before putting forward a nomination for President. In order to effect the selection of the President, proposed s. 60  would then require the leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives to second the Prime Minister's nomination and would require the President's nomination to be passed by a two-thirds majority of members and senators at a joint sitting. There are additional constitutional criteria imposed on the aspirant to the Presidency, who should be qualified and capable of being chosen as a member of the House of Representatives, and must not be a member of an Australian parliament or a member of a political party.
A very important change to our Constitution is involved here. This approach is intended to guarantee that the office holder is a person of political independence who can objectively perform his or her duties without fear or favour and is not excessively beholden to the government of the day or the Prime Minister of the day. In theory, it should help overcome many of the difficulties encountered in the 1975 crisis. It should ensure that the President of Australia will be a person of objectivity and substance.
This change in the appointment is very significant. Those who insist on a president directly elected by the people do have a point, but their argument is much weakened by the new arrangements, in my opinion. Indeed, the original proponents of the direct election approach at the time of Federation were concerned precisely because of the excessive powers vested in the British monarchy and because of the huge potential problems involved in the process of the appointment of the Governor-General. In fact, at that time Alfred Deakin said:
. . . the ambition of the democracy of this country is an ambition to shape its laws, to guide its destinies, to widen its opportunities, to make life in this country better worth living than it has been hitherto. For this purpose, the position of a representative in any of these colonies is infinitely superior to that of governor-general . . . If he (the governor-general) becomes a personage in the 
 political life of the country, his office must be elective. We cannot afford to have in our constitution any man exercising authority, unless he derives it from the people of Australia.
However, the proposals in this bill, I would maintain, overcome the concerns which Alfred Deakin had. They also avoid some of the pitfalls—which, for example, the member for Kooyong referred to—which can occur when we have a directly elected presidency, especially when we are going to retain the basic structure of a Westminster style system.
So I believe that the bill before us, to provide for a republic with an Australian head of state and for the selection process involved, in general terms is a significant progression in constitutional terms. It will help us to overcome some of the causes of the 1975 crisis. It will also help us to unite as a people because this person will have been selected—on the basis of a committee of expert, eminent Australians—as a recommendation to the Prime Minister, approved by the Leader of the Opposition and then approved by a two-thirds majority of parliament, which is of course the vast majority of the representatives. It means that there will have to be approval from more than one political party—from both the government and the opposition. I believe these safeguards are significantly different from the situation we have been in all these years.
It is sad that it has taken so many years—24 years since the 1975 constitutional crisis—for us to come up with these provisions, but I suppose one can only say better late than never. There is, however, one provision in the bill which I, having said all this, have some concerns about. It is a provision which has the potential to create some serious difficulties for us in the future. I refer to proposed section 62, about which the Parliamentary Library says:
Proposed section 62 is likely to be the most controversial of all the proposed changes. This proposed section allows the Prime Minister to remove the President with instant effect by an instrument signed by the Prime Minister. While the proposed section goes on to require that the Prime Minister seek the approval of the House of Representatives for this action there is no sanction should this requirement not be satisfied. Furthermore the failure of the House of 
 Representatives to approve the removal of the President does not operate to reinstate the President . . .
This provision does have some very serious difficulties and has created some genuine discussion in the community and amongst experts. The library says:
There has been disquiet . . . regarding the differences between the recommendations made by the Constitutional Convention on the question of how the Prime Minister can remove the President and the Bill's implementation of these provisions. The Convention specified that `[t]he vote of the House would constitute a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister' whereas the Government—
that is, the current government—
has chosen not to include provisions enshrining this consequence for the Prime Minister who dismisses a President—an action which could conceivably not have the support of the majority in the House of Representatives.
This is a very important comment and of concern. It means that there could be a situation in which, for example, a Prime Minister loses the majority support of his own party and, in order to defend himself in this situation, simply sacks the president and creates a constitutional crisis of some sort.
Even if the House of Representatives then says, `This is not a legitimate action,' because the Prime Minister is not forced to put that proposal to the House of Representatives, we could get into all sorts of difficulties. So I really think that those who have expressed this concern have a point. Nevertheless, I believe this can be overcome in future legislation. I do not believe that this small point should be allowed to hold us back from the huge achievement which this legislation involves—that is, to achieve at the turn of this century an Australian republic that we can all be proud of, with a president chosen through an open process and a president who can be independent of the government of the day. I support the bill. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I want to say how much pleasure I have in speaking in this House today on the Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) Bill 1999 . I did not find my earlier experience in this House yesterday, and even indeed this morning, listening to the debate on 
 the GST nearly as pleasurable. On the one hand we had yesterday a day which will be marked down as one of the sadder days in the history of this parliament. But I think today and this debate mark a very important day in our history.
The eloquent words which have been used already by other members speaking in this debate have indicated how strongly bipartisan the view that we should change the Constitution really is. Despite the fact that the Prime Minister and some other members of the coalition are clearly opposed to the idea of a republic, my own feeling is that we are on a journey which will not be stopped by the obduracy of a few recalcitrants on the government benches.
I want to raise a couple of issues today, one of which relates to the importance of seeing this as the first stage of a longer process. I noted the comments of the Leader of the Opposition in relation to a number of matters to do with this legislation. They are important enough to bear at least some recapitulation. The first of those is the issue of the title of the bill. You will recall that the Leader of the Opposition suggested that a more appropriate title of the bill would be: `A bill for an act to alter the Constitution to provide for an Australian citizen, chosen from nominations submitted by the people and approved by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the Commonwealth parliament, to replace the British monarch as Australia's head of state.' As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, that is not a radically different set of words to those which form the title of this bill, but they do identify exactly what we are on about—that is, replacing our current head of state, who is a British monarch and, as we heard from the High Court recently, not only Queen of Australia but also now the queen of a foreign power.
As we go into the next millenium and the centenary of our federation, we contemplate bringing the Constitution to where it ought to be: in an Australian document which reflects the aspirations of Australia now—not of the British Commonwealth necessarily. It should reflect the importance of Australia as a nation that is asserting itself within world fora as an 
 independent republic devoid of any extraneous ties to another nation as we currently have with the Crown. We need to exercise our rights as a nation to finally cut the cord and ensure that our nation's head of state is an Australian. That, it seems to me, is a fairly simple proposition which I know to have very widespread support amongst the Australian community, despite the best efforts of those who would claim to want a continuation of the monarchy.
I will refer again to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. In the context of changes in our governance and our relationship with England and the Commonwealth in terms of the original document—our current Constitution—I understand that, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, there has been a radical change in the way in which Australia has developed its democratic institutions over the last 150 years. To illustrate this point, the Leader of the Opposition gave the example of the history of the franchise in this country and how we were the first nation to give women the vote. Despite the actions of the suffragettes, as important as they were in the context of England, South Australia first gave women the vote in 1894. That was, in the context of the time, a fairly radical thing to do.
It is of interest to see that, if we look at the referenda proposals which have been put to the people since Federation, we have not been very successful in marketing to the community the importance of changing the Constitution. It is noteworthy that perhaps one of the more notable successes was the 1967 referendum, which recognised for the first time Aboriginal people as part of this nation. The importance of that referendum was that it exposed some significant flaws in the current Constitution which yet need to be addressed. It should come as no surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am someone who advocates that, when we are contemplating future change as we inevitably will, we need to think about how we will address some of these significant flaws.
There is a debate about the preamble, as we know, and the recognition of the role of indigenous Australians and their relationship 
 to this country prior to it being occupied by the British and annexed by the Crown. This was done in a way which has obviously caused a great deal of distress and hurt to indigenous Australians in terms of where they are in Australian society today, and that is without commenting on the acts of murder which were part of a deliberate process of genocide throughout much of our history until the middle of this century.
But now, at the turn of the century and the centenary of our federation, it is time to revisit some of these issues—not, as the Prime Minister would have it, with a black armband view of history, but with a realistic view of what this nation is, where it came from, what its future holds, and what we are as a community. It is not by dint of looking backwards that we need to understand these things. We only have to understand the contemporary debates and the contemporary views which are being expressed by people from all walks of life in this country to see that there is a need to change the way in which we view ourselves in terms of this Constitution.
It is important, therefore, that when we take this question to the people—the question being the title of this bill, whether they approve of altering `the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with a President chosen by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth parliament'—we ensure that, given the way in which the debate will unfold, those of us who are strongly supportive of the idea of changing the Constitution to ensure that it expresses what contemporary Australia is and how we view ourselves in the world do not throw the baby out with the bathwater by confusing the debate over that crucial issue as expressed in the question, although, as I pointed out earlier, we would like to see that amended to make it more explicit.
Nevertheless, on the basis that this becomes a question, we do not want to have that question confused by the elements of disharmony which have been fostered by some in the community who say they in fact support a republic. Those are, of course, the 
 people who say they support a direct election of the president, who oppose this view and say they will combine with the monarchists to white ant the process which is now under way. They will try to get a no vote so that the majority of people in a majority of the states vote against this. That seems to me to be fairly stupid. Any reasonable person understanding the nature of our history and the success rate of our referenda proposals as they have been put to the people would not contemplate on the one hand expressing strong support for Australia becoming a republic and then deliberately set on a course to white ant the very question that will bring about that republic. It seems to suggest to the Australian community that they are not serious about constitutional change.
If we want constitutional change, we need to ensure that we have those dissident elements at least sublimating their views to some extent for the broader value of having a republic—never mind the fact that they may have some particular attitudes about the way in which the president is chosen. The fact is that we want an Australian president as head of state. We want to become a republic. It is fairly simple, I would have thought.
I want to point out to those people who would be advocates of this course that, coming from the Northern Territory, as I do, I experienced last year a similar sort of exercise, which was the question of whether or not the Northern Territory should become a state. I need to point out that the person responsible for advocating the position and setting the question was the then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who is to be elected unopposed as the President of the Liberal Party of Australia I understand this week—even as soon as Friday. You do not have to particularly be enamoured of the former Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to understand that he made an enormous error when he put the question to the people. The way that error came about was the way he put the question to the people and its hidden motives.
The question we have in front of us in this constitutional debate—the current debate—is a fairly simple question, as I have pointed 
 out, which asks whether or not we should have a head of state and how that head of state should be selected, not on broader issues of constitutional change. It is worth repeating the question that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly decided they would put to the Northern Territory community for the Northern Territory to become a state:
Now that a constitution for a state of the Northern Territory has been recommended by the statehood convention and endorsed by the Northern Territory Parliament, do you agree that we should become a state?
Had the question been, `Do you agree that we should become a state?' there would have been overwhelming support for that position in the community. But, because the Northern Territory government, under the leadership of Shane Stone, chose to say there was a constitution which had been agreed to by the assembly without reference to the broader community, people became very suspicious. That suspicion was well founded and resulted in the defeat of this proposal.
If we want to ensure the success of the current proposal, then in my mind it is very important that we keep the debate as simple as possible and the question as simple as possible. I know there are those who, like me, believe that we need to do a fairly radical overhaul of the Constitution at some point, but that needs to be done in the context of gradual change. It will not happen if the advocates of change say that we should put all these cards on the table at once, and invite the community, and those people who would oppose the development of a republic for this nation and successful change of the Constitution in other areas, to vote on the question. It will not happen if we invite division.
I say to those people who are advocates of direct election that, if they really want to have a republic, they must accept in the first instance that the proposal being put to the people later this year will deliver that republic to them. Then, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out earlier this week, we will have to contemplate what other changes we need to bring about to the Constitution. They need to be thought through and debated in a considered way and in much the same way as 
 the Constitutional Convention operated to bring about this particular question that we are currently debating in the form of this bill. That needs to happen, too.
Just because some person believes that they are the fount of all wisdom, and if their view does not prevail they will not support the proposition that is going to be put—even though their general direction is to support the idea of a republic—and they will take their bat and ball and go home, is inviting defeat of this question. What they will endeavour to do in the context of the debate is engender suspicion about the motives for change and, by so doing, support the monarchists' representation of why we should not have the referendum question supported.
That seems to me not only to be head in the sand stuff but also that these guys have not learnt or understood the way in which this nation has operated for over 100 years and the difficulty we have had as a community to change our Constitution. It will only happen through an educative process. We have a consensus position, effectively, and we need to understand that, if that consensus is strong enough in this parliament and we are prepared to advocate the position, we will walk out of this place in the full knowledge that there is every likelihood we can bring the Australian people to a point where they will support this referendum.
I say again that there is a need for important changes to other parts of the Constitution. Not least of these is the need to acknowledge those demands made by indigenous Australians for a recognition of their place in the Constitution—a properly recognised place. There has also been an argument, which has a lot of merit, about the recognition of women in the Constitution. There were arguments previously about a bill of rights. There are all sorts of things that we should be contemplating in terms of modernising the Constitution.
We are a strong, stable, democratic nation. We have the ability to bring about change without throwing a spanner in the works in terms of the way in which our Constitution is administered, the way in which this parliament operates, the way the will of the 
 people is represented through the parliament, or the way in which the political processes operate generally. We have a very stable democracy in this country. It can countenance and handle change. This particular piece of legislation is important in that regard.
As we reach the centenary of Federation and go into the next millennium, a fitting and just reward for the work of all of those people who have been participants in our democratic processes over the last 100 years would be to bring this Constitution to a position where it recognises us as an Australian republic with an Australian head of state. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—It is always nice to have a staunch republican presiding over the House at a time when we are discussing the establishment of a republic. I understand the emotional timbre in your voice as you make your pronouncements in this House, Mr Deputy Speaker.
Every time I meet school students from my electorate I always make the point that perhaps amongst one of them there will be a councillor on Blacktown or Penrith city councils, or even a mayor or a state member. But if they aspire to my position, I ask if they could leave me a little bit of time to negotiate with my bank manager. I notice in the House today, and it is not unusual, that we have two groups of school students in two of the galleries. What a thought it might be if one of those students might one day aspire to be, and in fact become, a president of the republic.
When I came into this place in 1984 I had no thought that, in my term as a member of parliament, this parliament would be discussing a bill to give effect to the verdict of people, should they vote in a referendum for a republic, to alter the Constitution to give effect to the people's will. I am delighted that it should be so.
It is my privilege to serve on the joint select committee that has been proposed to examine this bill and consult with the Australian people to see how adequately this bill reflects the views and the resolutions of the Constitutional Convention. The bill we are discussing provides for various alterations to the Constitution which would replace the role 
 of the Governor-General with that of a president and provide a method for choosing and dismissing the president.
As a member of parliament, I have only ever had one other opportunity to be involved in a constitutional change and that was when our Deputy Prime Minister and Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, put four propositions in 1988. These are not in any particular order, but they were that there should be freedom of religion, that local government should be recognised, that people whose land was acquired by governments should be fairly compensated, and, of course, a four-year term. The failure of that referendum is an object lesson for us.
Given your detailed knowledge of these matters, Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that it was Peter Reith who championed opposition to these referendums. In regard to the four-year term, I always thought it was unfortunate that we were not prepared to accept the coalition's view that, if we were given a four-year term, senators should be given an eight-year term. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are a New South Welshman, you will recall that at the time the upper house of the New South Wales parliament then enjoyed a 12-year term. But we rejected that and, as history goes on to show, the referendums were lost.
The point I want to make is that it is a desire of the Labor Party and others to update our Constitution and make it relevant to the men and women of Australia. We cannot do it on our own. The coalition cannot do it on its own and we cannot do it. We really do need to have a consensus. So it is with the republic. Having both sides of parliament supporting this proposition is of the utmost importance, given all the difficulties that can occur with constitutional change.
The Leader of the Opposition in his contribution to the debate suspected that there may have been some direct election republicans sitting behind him. I am not sure whether it is good to confess, but I must say that, having listened to the Australian people, my inclination would be for there to be a direct election. But I accept that this is not what the process of the Constitutional 
 Convention delivered. What did the process of the Constitutional Convention deliver? It was that the people of Australia should have the right to nominate prominent people—as we have enjoyed with Governors-General, who are not necessarily political people, and in fact they seem to be avoided—to be considered as president of the republic. Then it will require a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting of both the Senate and the House to elect such a person. This really means that either party who is in government cannot afford—and I do not know that they have necessarily done it in the past—to nominate a partisan figure who would not enjoy the support of others.
The outcome of the Constitutional Convention was to say that, as near as possible, we want to replicate the system that with one exception has served Australia so well. This bill that we are currently debating tries to do that. But, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory pointed out, the people of Australia have the right to actually contact the committee. They can write to us or telephone, and communicate via the Internet or by any other means they wish, to let us know how adequately in their minds this bill and these provisions reflect the Constitutional Convention.
There are those in the community who say, `Why support this? This has not been a big enough change. We want to go a lot further.' There are even those within this side of the parliament who may have that view. My response is that, given the difficulties of achieving success at referendums, we need to move slowly. It would be nice on our side of the parliament if we had a commitment that in government we would regularly seek to give people the opportunity to update the Constitution, perhaps once every term and coinciding with every election.
How ridiculous it is that in our state of New South Wales we have a fixed four-year term for local government—everyone knows when that election will be—and a fixed four-year term for the legislative assembly in New South Wales but, when it comes to the national parliament, we have three-year terms. How silly. It would be one of the changes 
 that I would be keen to see happen. Another might be a constitutional amendment to try to overturn the High Court's Brandy decision which would allow us to more adequately develop federal tribunals in our justice system. It is a good thing to take these issues on a regular basis to the people and listen to their will but, if we are going to be successful we do need to put aside our party differences, act in a bipartisan way in the national interest and take these issues to the people.
One of the things that this referendum is not about is a judgment on the Queen. In fact, of all women we have on the international stage, overwhelmingly the majority of Australians have a high regard for her and for the role that she has performed. But, as we go into the next century, as we go into the next millennium, it is all about whether it is appropriate that someone who is not an Australian should be our head of state. Some people, I am sure, were upset with the recent decision of the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, about Senator-elect Heather Hill, who had British nationality. The High Court—the highest court in our land—decided that the UK was a foreign power. So irrespective of what you think of that judgment—I happen to think it was the correct one—here you have the highest judges of the land saying that our head of state is the head of a foreign power. What other country would tolerate that situation?
So, as I was saying, isn't it going to be great when members, including members of the coalition, can go around their electorates and can say—if this referendum is carried—to the young people of Australia, `One of the things that you can aspire to is to be our head of state; you could become the first person from this area or from this state to be the President of Australia'? I think that is a marvellous thing. I would be absolutely delighted if one of the students in the 55 schools in my electorate of Chifley went on to be the President of Australia—a marvellous thing.
I would like to draw to the attention of the House—indeed, the Leader of the Opposition already has done it—the title of the bill, 
 which of course will be there on the ballot paper, and that is:
A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to establish the Commonwealth of Australia as a republic with a President chosen by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament.
There is nothing that is untrue in any of that, but I think for republicans a better title would be, `A Bill for an Act to alter the Constitution to provide for an Australian citizen, chosen from nominations submitted by the people and approved by a two-thirds majority of a joint sitting of the Commonwealth Parliament, to replace the British monarch as Australia's head of state.' I think that more accurately reflects the sentiments that surround the issue of Australia becoming a republic. It is one of the things that the committee will need to consider as it goes around Australia. Interestingly enough, I think it will be of value to find out what the people think about those two titles or about any other title.
I can say, without in any way wanting to invoke challenges of breach of privilege, that the committee did meet yesterday for the first time. It was a public meeting. One of the issues people have raised about Australia becoming a republic is: what does it mean for the President, like the Governor-General, to be the Commander-in-Chief? Is there some secret provision in this bill that would allow the President to assume to himself or herself some dictatorial power by use of this title? It made me think: what does it mean when we say, `The Governor-General is the Commander-in-Chief'? I know that at one time he had to personally sign every officer's commission. No-one could be appointed as an officer of the ADF without a signed commission from the Commander-in-Chief, nor could you dismiss an officer without his express approval. That requirement has subsequently been removed or delegated.
Of course, the point needs to be made that under our current system the Governor-General has few powers to himself, but in all of these things, including being Commander-in-Chief, he acts on the advice of ministers. He may question the advice, he may delay responding to the advice, but he acts on and consistent with that advice. I think that is 
 very, very important to understand. I guess this bill is about wanting the best of both worlds; that is, the current constitutional arrangements—which, as I say, with one exception have served this country particular well—to be replicated with our president. If there is an issue about the need to change that further down the track, there is always the opportunity, but there is only one group of people who actually have the final say about those changes—just as they do with this—and that is the people of Australia.
As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is the double provision in referendums for changing the Constitution. That is, we need not only a majority of people to support a constitutional change but also a majority of states. I again offer my humble suggestion to improve the number of states issue by leading a secession movement in Western Sydney and creating a state—but I cannot see that happening for some time—although I need to reiterate that by the year 2017 we will be more than 2½ million people and will be the majority of Sydney. That is, people in Western Sydney will outnumber all of those on the North Shore and in the eastern and southern suburbs.
So I speak for a 10 per cent slice of all Australians at the moment when I say that I am a Western Sydney member. But I am confident, Mr Deputy Speaker, because in my part of the world we have one of the great benefits—as I know you do in the Illawarra—of being a very multicultural society. We have people from different countries who, at some point or other, have chosen to make Western Sydney their own. Whilst, for some people, contemplating a change in the Constitution to become a republic is difficult, many of those already come from a republic. Indeed, I will get in a plug for my Filipino community, of which I have the largest concentration in Australia; they are marvellous people. This year, the Filipinos are celebrating 101 years since becoming a republic. They seem to have been able to survive it. It is not a life-threatening condition, you might say.
I, along with all my other colleagues, get particular joy from being able to speak on bills like this. We sincerely hope that there 
 can be a consensus that rises above mere politics to embrace this important change and enter more appropriately the next century and the next millennium. I look forward to the bill being enacted, and I look forward to the referendum.
Debate (on motion by Mrs Sullivan) adjourned.",REPS,<title>CONSTITUTION ALTERATION (ESTABLISHMENT OF REPUBLIC) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—I am continuing my earlier contribution to the second reading debate on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999 . This is the bill that the coalition government has introduced to protect Australian children from some of the offensive and septic material that is on the Internet and to try to make sure that this extremely valuable information and educational tool is something we can all be confident and proud of as being a resource available to younger generations. It is an enormously powerful tool, bringing to households around the world, free of any tyranny of distance, access to material, insights, culture and information that should make a very positive contribution to the future for the young people who take the time to look through it.
In my previous contribution, I highlighted that, in amongst that enormous capacity that exists with that tool, there was something that I described as `cyber-septic'. I was drawing attention to the contribution by the member for Bonython and the position of the Labor Party, where glib remarks and words of concern were not backed up by any action. There was hand-wringing. People over there were saying, `We don't condone the sort of nonsense and filth that is on the Internet.'
Mr Lee interjecting—
—The member who is interjecting is reinforcing that position by saying that the Labor Party, again, on this issue, has no view. But the thing that has been missed by many, and particularly by those opposite, is what it is that we are trying to achieve. I went through some examples of my 18-month-old boy who, some time down the track, may have wanted to see what a giraffe looked like—an innocuous inquiry. We do not have giraffes in the electorate which I represent, on Melbourne's Mornington Peninsula. But, if you put an inquiry into any search engine, what do you find?  You get pictures of young people engaged in sexual acts with animals. I cannot quite see how the vision of an information or educational tool is met by that test.
I notice that, when the facts are put on the table, Labor Party members opposite become 
 silent, because this is the reality. In the information technology world, there are a lot of people who talk about the virtual this and the virtual that. These are the facts: when you put something into a search engine like Alta Vista—you make some inquiries about some activities you could engage in at school where there are some very reputable companies offering the sorts of games and educational things that I hope a lot of young people spend the time to get involved with—you come across all sorts of activity that I cannot even begin to describe in this place out of courtesy to those in this chamber and to those who are listening.
What sort of capacity for good, for education and for the development of young minds does this tool represent when an innocuous inquiry puts you smack bang—inadvertently—in amongst filth and smut? What confidence can parents have when their sons and daughters are at home in the study doing research and come across this sort of material? In this country, 20 per cent of households have access to the Internet. I would put it to you that many more households would more willingly get involved in the Internet if they could be more confident about its application and its benefits for the family.
I can give other examples—and I will not spend too much time on this. If you were in the devastating situation of being caught in an incident of sexual abuse or something of that kind and you did not know who to turn to because the people whom you trusted and relied on and whom you turned to for advice may have been involved, you think, `I will make an inquiry on the Internet to maybe get some advice about how to handle such a devastating incident.' What do you come up against? You are in a fragile frame of mind. Your whole world has been turned on its head because of some episode. You put in an inquiry to a search engine. What do you come up with? Do you get something helpful? Do you get some support for the trauma that is in your life? No. You get page after page about naked children, porno, rape, photos about things that have gone on, and snuff incidents in other parts of the world. I will not go into the specifics, but it is just disgusting. At a 
 time when you need help and you turn to this information tool, that is what you get.
The bill which is before the parliament is trying to give the tool a chance. If you are faced with a situation of workplace harassment and you are trying to find out who you need to talk to, what people could be there to support you, if you put in an innocuous inquiry like `workplace harassment' to Alta Vista, a search engine that is available on the Internet, you struggle to find your way through some things about electronic devices and what you can do with them, about bosses that perpetuate harassment in their workplaces. And this is put forward as entertainment at a time when you are looking for advice and information.
What a waste of a resource that has an enormous capacity to bring good to this world. The bill before the parliament today is trying to give the resource a chance and to give Australian families and young people the confidence that this tool that is available, that can bring the whole world to your home, no matter where you live, can actually be used for some good things.
I will not give any more examples, but let me assure you that there are bucketloads of them. As I pointed out in my earlier contribution, these are nothing other than innocuous inquiries put into the search engine. It is not like people are going out to find this sort of smut. It is something that comes towards you through innocuous inquiries about legitimate concerns when you are searching for information or looking for some guidance. You might even be looking for some help. And that is what you are faced with.
Those who oppose what the government is doing do not like talking about that. They would rather live in this virtual world where they talk only about the capacity and the potential of the Internet. I do not doubt the capacity and the potential of the Internet. I do not doubt that it is there to deliver good for people around the world and for the citizens of Australia. That is its potential. Its reality falls some way short of that. For Australian families around the country, this government is trying to make sure that we are doing what 
 we can as a nation to enable the Internet to get a bit closer to fulfilling that potential.
We do that in a number of ways. First, we do that by recognising that the Internet has a great capacity to improve people's lives and give them access to information which they may never otherwise have been able to obtain, in a time frame that eliminates the tyranny of distance and other access to information problems. It opens a whole new world of opportunity for far-flung communities throughout our country. It enables people to be put in cities around other parts of the world, to offer their product, to share their insights, to put their experience in front of others and to put an educational resource at the fingertips of young Australian boys and girls.
This bill, though, seeks to recognise the fact that the Internet can also be used to disseminate illegal and/or highly offensive material. I have just given you a sample of what the reality is at the moment. The bill establishes a mechanism to regulate the carriage of content over the Internet, keeping in mind that the government regulation can never, on its own, completely provide the perfect solution. I am not standing here before you today and saying that this will solve the problem entirely. It will not.
Mr Stephen Smith interjecting—
—Perhaps those opposite are saying that it will not solve it at all. I say to the ALP spokesman who is at the table: why don't you try to type in a very innocuous search inquiry and see what you come up with?
Mr Stephen Smith interjecting—
—The member for Perth!
—There is nothing clever about the way in which an innocuous inquiry can inadvertently put you in that situation. The member for Perth is having to resort to interjection and cyber babble to try to mask the fact that the Labor Party is without a policy on this subject. Everybody agrees with the fact that something needs to be done. But our AWOL ALP—absent without leadership ALP—again cannot come up with anything 
 other than to say that whatever anybody else says is wrong.
The computer industry is now starting to recognise that something has to happen. That is from a position where the computer industry was saying, `Leave it to us, we'll sort it out. We'll self-regulate.' But for those members in this place who have taken a keen interest in this subject, what did we get in the last few months of this campaign? We have had the computer industry telling us about all the things they can do to get around any useful step forward the government puts. So when you look to the industry itself, which is saying, `Give us a chance to self-regulate,' some within the industry do not want to know about it. They do not share the conviction and the view of those on this side of the parliament and the vast majority of Australians that something needs to be done, even if it is only to save this tool from itself.
When you look to the computer industry itself as a way of maybe providing part of the solution, some within the industry are not prepared to take up the challenge. But there are some who are. Those who are receive encouragement under this bill. You will hear some members opposite saying, `Look, it failed in the United States of America.' What they are misleading you about is that the US proposition was entirely different from what the Australian government is trying to do. In the United States, the Communications Decency Act was struck down by the United States Supreme Court. It was struck down for a reason: it was pre-emptive. It sought to prescribe in advance what was good and bad content. That is a hazardous task. Someone seeing me jogging might well describe that as bad content because I cannot keep up with the member for Curtin. The fact is that community standards change and evolve over time, and the US act tried to put in place a mechanism to prescribe what is good and what is bad.
Our act does not do that. Our proposal says, `You, the Australian people, signal what you find offensive.' We will apply the same sort of rules that we apply to what is on television, what is in movies and what is in magazines. It will be a complaint based situation where we then look at the individual circum 
 stance against what are acceptable standards at that time and then take action. So this is entirely different from the United States proposition. Again, those opposite, AWOL Labor—absent without leadership Labor—do not want to confront the fact that this is a different proposition from that of the United States. They stand there hand-wringing on content contortions, basically saying, `We know that something needs to be done, we're not condoning the filth that's there.' Let me remind people in the parliament that this is filth generated out of innocuous inquiries. This is not somebody who is into peek and perve experiences on the Internet. This is an innocuous inquiry where you get page after page of content described in a way that would be unparliamentary. I cannot even go into the details of it. But that is what this proposition is.
I ask everyone in this House, as we enter question time, to again hear about how the coalition government is planning for the future and is implementing policy. It is such a vivid contrast to AWOL Labor—absent without leadership. This government is getting on with the job of addressing what is of concern to the community. We are doing what we can to support those in the Internet industry who want to make sure that this tool has the capacity to fulfil its potential. That potential is something that those opposite want to talk about in ignorance of the reality of the sort of content that is there at the moment. Clearly, there are some complicated issues. The tool here gives the Internet industry and consumers a chance to decide how they can deal with this problem. There is encouragement for everybody; it is a light-handed regulatory regime. But it is in vivid contrast to the mealy-mouthed words of the ALP, AWOL Labor—absent without leadership—who do not have a position on this subject at all.

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, did you read the foreword to your `Research Green Paper' before signing it? Do you stand by your claim in the foreword that `Australia's public investment in research is large by world standards and private investment is growing'? Isn't it a fact that you have misled the Australian public, because you know that in 1998 the Australian Bureau of Statistics said:
For the first time since the ABS surveys of R&D commenced, estimates for business expenditure on R&D have fallen.
As you know, in 1999 the ABS said:
For the second consecutive year estimates of business expenditure on R&D have fallen . . . a decrease of 4% on 1996-7 and 7% on 1995-6.
Minister, did you deliberately mislead or are you in denial about the damage your government has already done to Australia's research and development effort?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Research and Development: Business Expenditure</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1,question
"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—This question comes from the representative of a party which proposed to actually cut research expenditure in the last election campaign! The Labor Party went to the last election with a proposal to reduce expenditure on research in universities. Its own forward estimates petered out and it did not commit enough money to sustain research expenditure. I not only read that foreword to the green paper before I signed it but wrote the foreword to the green paper, and the statements in the foreword are absolutely correct.
—Oh, dear me! Many have had these problems with you before.
—It might be worth reminding the opposition and the House about this government's commitment to research. Let us just look at what the government has put into university research since 1995-96. In 1995-96—the last year of your government, the last year of the Labor Party government—the federal government committed $346.4 million to research. This coming year, 1999-00, the government will be committing $437.6 million.
—What have you done about funding grants?
—The Leader of the Opposition!
—The question was about research. Let us just focus on the question you have asked.
—No, tell us about the $840 million in cuts and why—
—The Leader of the Opposition will exercise more restraint.
—They do not like the answer, Mr Speaker. They do not like the answer because they have been misinformed by the spokesman for the policy vacuum over there, the member for Dobell. Government expenditure on research has gone up very substantially.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. My question was about his misleading claim that business expenditure had increased. He knows it has decreased and he should come back to the question.
—The member for Dobell will resume his seat. The minister is being relevant to the question. The minister will respond.
—I was asked about whether or not research expenditure was growing, and I am putting before the House the figures that demonstrate that it has grown very substantially. It is also worth making the point that taxpayers put more money into R&D in Australia as a proportion of GDP than do all but two of the OECD countries. Our public expenditure on research is exceptionally high. Not only that, business expenditure on research has grown very substantially over the 
 last decade, and the research paper will encourage further investment in research. It will encourage an entrepreneurial culture in Australian universities.
This question demonstrates that the Labor Party is totally out of touch with what is happening in university research, it is totally out of touch with what is happening in education and, until it replaces the member for Dobell as the spokesperson for education on its side, it will remain out of touch.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Research and Development: Business Expenditure</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1,answer

"Lee, Michael, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—We have seen some of the best that the House of Representatives can offer in the debate this afternoon on the announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister and, unfortunately, I have to say that we saw some of the worst that the House of Representatives can offer earlier in 
 question time when the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs misled this House.
—He wasn't telling the truth.
—That is probably true, I can say to the member for Hunter, but let me make it absolutely certain that the minister misled the House. The reason why we can say that is that, as often happens at question time, the opposition went to some effort to see if we could set up a little trap. Our hope was to see if there would be some way we could encourage the minister to put a foot into this little trap that we set. You often go to a lot of trouble to ensnare a minister into misleading the parliament but in some ways we had the minister for education come in and say, `Where's the noose? Let me put my head into the noose.' The reason I say that is that the minister released his long-promised green paper on research today, and we cannot even get past the foreword for the green paper before we come across a statement that is 
 clearly untrue. The statement that is untrue in the foreword, the first page of printed text in this paper, is the following:
Australia's public investment in research is large by world standards and private investment is growing.
That is a statement over the signature of the minister for education, Dr David Kemp.
We tried to give the minister the benefit of the doubt. We thought he might have read the cover and signed the cover but not read the document, and we tried to give him that out. But instead he rushes in, puts the noose around his neck and not only says that he failed to understand what he was saying but he actually claimed authorship of the foreword—and he nods his head again now. He actually said in question time, `I wrote it. I wrote this misleading statement. I wrote this falsehood.' The point we make is that, if the minister makes that statement, he has to answer for that statement. We refer the minister to the 1996-97 and 1997-98 Australian Bureau of Statistics studies on the level of private investment research. In the foreword he said that private investment in research is growing. That was his claim in the letter; that was the falsehood in the foreword signed by the minister. But in fact this is what the Australian Bureau of Statistics said in their 1996-97 study:
For the first time since the ABS surveys of R&D commenced, estimates for business expenditure on R&D have fallen.
That is what they said for 1996-97. For 1997-98 they said:
For the second consecutive year, estimates of business expenditure on R&D have fallen.
They go on to say there has been a decrease of four per cent on 1996-97 and seven per cent on 1995-96. So there has been a seven per cent decline in business expenditure on research since the change of government.
Here we have the minister prattling away on ABC radio at lunchtime saying, `What we need is an ideas economy. What we need is to encourage research in Australia. What we need to do is to try to encourage business investment in research.' Yet the minister is so out of touch he does not understand that his government has presided over a reduction of seven per cent in business expenditure. It is 
 no wonder there has been that reduction when you realise that this government has reduced the 150 per cent tax deduction for business research and development and wound it back to 125 per cent. It has made decisions on funding for universities that have basically meant that universities have had to cut back their research effort. This government has taken a whole series of other decisions that have made it more difficult for the private sector to carry out research.
—Utter rubbish!
—The minister interjects `rubbish'. It just goes to show that he is in denial. He says that it is a total falsehood. I challenge the minister: tell us where the Bureau of Statistics is wrong in this year's report and last year's report? You tell us where the ABS figures are wrong, Minister. You say in your foreword that private business investment and research is growing. When we challenged you at question time today, you said that the statements were absolutely correct. That was his statement in parliament today, and that is a statement that was misleading. If the minister made that as a deliberate statement, then he may have deliberately misled this House. That is what we say. When that minister for education said that the statements were absolutely correct, he misled this House. We are entitled to ask whether he has deliberately misled the House. Our contention would be that he needs to think very carefully before he makes statements like this.
—You are choosing your words very carefully.
—I am, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you realise. The point we make is that this minister has misled the House. This minister misled researchers and the public when he signed this foreword, when he wrote this foreword, when he made the false claim that private investment in research is growing. They are all false. The point is that this minister is in such a state of denial that he will not accept the damage his own decisions have caused. He will not accept the damage that has been done to universities right across the country because of cutbacks that have been made. He does not accept the damage 
 that has been done to private sector investment in research.
The proof that he is so out of touch is this: how many times have we seen this minister actually out at a campus of a university? How many times have we seen him visiting Monash University or Sydney University or Curtin University or Wollongong University? I challenge the minister to release a table that demonstrates on how many occasions he has actually stepped foot on a university campus during daylight hours. I use the words `daylight hours' very carefully because we all know that there has been some speculation about this minister being seen only at night and being able to be seen when rays of sunlight hit his flesh. I have to make it clear. The important point to make here is that we challenge the minister to visit a few universities and find out what is happening on the campuses in daylight or at night. We will be there. We challenge the minister to debate these issues about how much Australia is spending on research and development.
This minister has been working on this green paper for quite a while. The green paper was foreshadowed in the May budget last year. There was a leak to the Australian's higher education supplement saying that it was coming on 11 November last year. The interesting thing is that the leak to the Australian supplement said that the plan was to wind back the role of the Australian Research Council, to cut back the awarding of research scholarships and to increase the funding that was awarded in block grants directly to universities. It is now some 14 months later—a very long gestation period. In fact, the gestation period for this green paper has been longer than the gestation period for the black rhino. It has been 14 months.
The black rhino might have conceived this. It has taken 14 months—the black rhino's gestation period—for it to appear. What has appeared is not a black rhino; it is actually a white poodle, because the white poodle is the complete opposite to what we were told was going to happen last November. Last November the minister's office showed a few copies of the draft green paper to his friends in the 
 higher education sector, he leaked it to the higher education supplement—
Honourable member interjecting—
—I will leave that for others to speculate upon, but what he promised was the exact opposite to what has appeared today. Some people in the media say that the Labor Party does nothing but oppose.
—Hear, hear!
—The member for Dunkley interjects and says, `Hear, hear.' Let me make the point that in opposing the original draft of the green paper we have done something very constructive. We have stopped this minister cutting back the role of the Australian Research Council. It is by the Labor Party joining with vice-chancellors, with researchers and with people who were concerned about his original direction that has forced the minister to do a backflip, that has forced this minister not to proceed along the path that was outlined in that leak in the higher education supplement on 11 November last year.
The point we make is that the government have to first of all realise the damage that has been done before they can develop the right sort of plan for the future. As long as they continue to refuse to accept the damage that has been done to universities by their $840 million cutback in funding for universities and as long as they refuse to accept the massive cutbacks that have been made in private sector investment in research and development, then they will not be able to develop a plan that is suitable for Australia to encourage research and development.
The point we make is that the first thing that has to be done is that Australia needs to invest more in research and development. We need to invest more if we are to make sure that Australia is ready for the new millennium, if we are to be there encouraging investment in intellectual property that will develop licence fees, royalty payments and better knowledge in Australia.
Dr Kemp interjecting—
—The minister is showing by his interjection that he just does not understand what he is talking about. I make it quite clear. Let me show to the minister a graph that is 
 based on his own budget papers. This is not anyone's commitments, Minister. This is what the Commonwealth of Australia has actually spent. It is entitled `Total Commonwealth support for research and innovation'. I do not want to help the minister by doing his research for him, but he should look at his own budget papers, because they show quite clearly that the peak of total Commonwealth support for research and innovation was in the Labor years.
What have we seen since this minister has been minister for education and since John Winston Howard, the member for Bennelong, has been the Prime Minister? We have seen a steady decline in the Commonwealth's effort for total Commonwealth support for research and innovation. Minister, do you challenge that? Do you challenge this graph? Do you challenge your own budget figures? Minister, it is quite clear that you are in such a state of denial, you are so out of touch with what is happening out there on university campuses, you are so out of touch with the good work that is being done by researchers across the country that you just do not understand the damage that you have done.
So what is Labor's plan? Our plan is, first of all, to increase the Commonwealth effort on research, to increase the Commonwealth effort in encouraging innovation. We have made that very clear. We say that there should be an increase in fellowships for young researchers. We believe that this government's cuts in university operating grants and in university research grants have actually made it harder for those young researchers who finish their PhDs, who finish their postgraduate research scholarships, to become a lecturer, to become a tutor. That is the reason why, in a climate when the Howard government has cut back funding for universities, we have to provide more money for research fellowships, to help the smartest and cleverest of our young people who are out there doing postgraduate degrees to stay in Australia, to keep researchers in Australia, to keep them here working for our country rather than going to the United States or Europe or somewhere else to help them. That 
 is Labor's plan—an increase in funding for research and an increase in fellowships.
Our third item is that we believe there has to be additional support for research infrastructure at the universities. If the minister would get out of Parliament House, go out to the campuses and talk to the vice-chancellors, talk to the supervisors for those research projects, visit some of the research institutes, talk to some of the students, even meet an undergraduate or two, he would realise that there is a need for additional support for infrastructure. They need more money to make sure they can purchase the latest equipment so we can carry out world-class research in Australia. That is the third point of Labor's plan.
The fourth point, as the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for industry have made clear, is that Labor believe that there needs to be some changes to the capital gains tax regime to encourage research and development. At the last election we made it clear that we were prepared to come up with ways to encourage more venture capital investment in Australian research and development. We were prepared to offer 150 per cent R&D tax concessions for small and medium sized businesses and for large businesses that carried out a heavy amount of R&D. That was our plan at the last election and we are making it clear today that Labor believe that more needs to be done.
In contrast, this government cuts back funding for universities. That has to have an effect on the research that universities can do. They have less money to buy the latest equipment. They have less money to offer for scholarships for postgraduate students. They have less money to keep the best of our researchers and teachers at university. Those cutbacks at university have done enormous damage to our higher education sector.
We also believe that, in cutting back the funding for TAFE training, they have done damage. In cutting back the R&D tax concessions they have done enormous damage to the work that has been done by the private sector. You have only to look at decisions that are made by companies like BHP. BHP has virtually halved the investment it is making in 
 research and development. This is going to have a devastating effect on the work that BHP and its employees do in years to come.
These are the reasons that we argue that our country needs to do better than this green paper. Lots of words in this green paper, but not $1 more. It is like their statements on literacy—lots of words but not $1 more to help train young people who need more assistance to help read and write. There are lots of words in the green paper but not $1 more to help the researchers have an extra scholarship and help the universities buy more equipment to try to make sure people are doing the research that Australia needs. This is the biggest fault in this green paper. It is a government that is big on words, small on funding and does not understand that Australia needs to invest more and not less in Australia's high-tech research and development.

"Kemp, Dr David, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—We have just seen and heard why the Labor Party has no credibility whatever in education policy. The member for Dobell has got absolutely nothing to contribute. In fact, I doubt if he has even read the paper, because he did not refer to anything beyond the foreword. He got to the foreword; he did not get to chapter 1. There was no comment on any of the substantive proposals in the green paper. When the science community in Australia looks to see what the Labor Party's response is to the green paper, they will find that the shadow minister has not even read the green paper. That is the first thing that will become obvious.
The shadow minister did not refer to the Labor Party's election policy, which was a policy that resulted in cuts to research funding for universities over three years. The Labor Party's forward commitments came to an end during the budget period following the election, and the Labor Party made no commitments to bring research funding up to a satisfactory level. Labor promised only $57 million over three years, and that was a policy that would have left the Australian Research Council $91 million short over three years, as 
 that was the amount that would have been needed to maintain research funding.
By contrast, during the election campaign the coalition provided an additional $93.3 million over three years for research infrastructure and $59.8 million over three years for the SPIRT program, the program which has been highly successful in encouraging collaborative research between industry and universities and in leveraging very substantial industry funds for that collaborative research. The Labor Party's policy, as we know, was so bad that the member for Werriwa simply retreated to the back bench—one very obvious example, one has to say, of a brain drain on the other side of the House, the brain power draining away from the Labor Party front bench on to the back bench.
The member for Dobell has suggested that the comment in the foreword that private investment in research in Australia is growing is incorrect. The fact is that Australia traditionally for a long time has had very low levels of private investment in research and development. We have seen over the last decade or so a very significant rise in industry interest, in research and development, particularly as Australian industry responds to the greater openness in the Australian economy. The member for Dobell is troubled by this trend. He thinks that, because there has been a fluctuation downwards in the last two years, that somehow or other this invalidates the claim that private research investment in R&D in Australia is actually growing. When we look closely at the reasons for the rapid increase in the years before the last two years, we find that there was very systematic abuse of the syndication provisions under the rules laid down by the Labor Party.
The Labor Party has always defended that abuse very substantially. In fact, the syndication component of the R&D tax concession used up some $1.8 billion of taxpayers' funds through elaborate financing schemes, while generating only $400 million in actual sales. When this government came to office we said that it was essential to crack down on this rorting of the R&D tax concession. Inevitably, this has had an impact in recent years as an appropriate level and a properly based level 
 of research and development is established. If you look at the trend over the last decade, there is no doubt whatever that that trend is a rising trend in private investment in research and development.
Mr Lee interjecting—
—The member for Dobell does not understand trends. He understands very little in this area, and he has very little to say in this area. So there is absolutely no invalidity whatever in the claim that is made in the foreword to the green paper that private investment in research is rising. Nor is there any invalidity at all in the observation that Australia invests very highly in research and the level of public investment in research and development in Australia is exceptionally high. Indeed, by international statistics, the level of public investment in research is amongst the very highest in the industrialised world.
All the Labor Party can come up with on the green paper is: why doesn't it promise more money? I will tell you what this green paper is about. That sort of query shows the enormous lack of understanding by the Labor Party on what is necessary to achieve the sorts of objectives in research and development that I have been talking about during question time and that I have noticed the member for Dobell has picked up and started to parrot in the course of this matter of public importance debate.
The effect of the way in which the Labor Party went about structuring funding for research over its 13 years in office was that, first of all, there was a massive brain drain from Australia of the best and brightest researchers. The Labor Party had 13 years to get this right. Over the period from the early 1980s to the early 1990s, we found that tens of thousands of professionally trained Australians left Australia because they could not find the research environments in Australia that matched the research environments and the rewards that they could get overseas. This was due in very large measure to a quite deliberate Labor Party policy of spreading funding thinly across the whole of the Dawkins national unified system. As a result of that butter thin spread of research funds, 
 we had someone doing research on an area in Perth, someone else doing it in Queensland and someone else doing it in Melbourne and no critical mass whereby the country's best researchers could come together and develop world-class research and research environments.
The research green paper, for the first time, addresses that problem. Through the funding arrangements that we have made in the green paper, including the very imaginative portable research scholarships scheme, for the first time we will see critical mass developing. If the member for Dobell cared to talk to any of the leading scientists and researchers in Australia, he would hear that that was an absolutely critical objective—to give Australia a world-class research environment. He had nothing to say about this in his speech, probably because he had not read the paper. But if he had read the paper I am sure that he would not have had any alternative to put forward because this problem is a result of the way in which the Labor Party has funded research for the last decade and half in Australia.
It has taken the coalition government to address this issue. We will see, as a result of the policy proposals in this paper, young Australians—the best and brightest—coming back to this country, because this government will have created the sort of research environment that they are looking for. Indeed, we are already hearing anecdotal stories of Australians in the biotechnology and medical research area responding to the government's initiative in the budget and telephoning Australian research centres and saying, `What are the chances of me getting a position back here in Australia?' This is already happening. It is already happening because of the results of the government's policies. Nothing is more important than to get the overall framework for Australian research right. That is what the proposals in this green paper do. The Labor Party has nothing whatever to say about that.
One of the other concerns that I have expressed, and which this green paper addresses, is the failure, so often, of Australia to capitalise on the brilliant ideas and results of research. Our researchers are second to none 
 in the world in their capacity in the right environment and with the right support to come up with outstanding research findings. Australia does not have any problem in producing ideas. But we have demonstrated a significant national problem in commercialising those ideas, in bringing those ideas to development.
I have been a member of the Prime Minister's science council since the time I have been a minister and I have had the opportunity to hear Australia's top researchers talking about why this happens. That discussion always comes back to one fundamental point. It was not a point which was addressed by the member for Dobell, because he does not have an understanding of this issue. The point is that there is not an entrepreneurial culture in Australia's research community. The funding mechanisms that have been used to support research, the formulas that were put in place by the Labor Party, encouraged our researchers to think that, provided they produced a paper and got a publication, that was the end of the story. That was what the research policy of the government was.
There were no incentives within the system to commercialise that research. There was no incentive for the researchers to get on top of the issues of how intellectual property could be used, could be licensed, could be put out to generate start-up companies, spin-offs from the research effort. There are good examples of that which Australians have undertaken but, unfortunately, they are too few and far between. That is because the research funding framework that the Labor Party had in place during its time in office offered no incentives for the development of that entrepreneurial climate. This government has received a very clear message: we have to generate an understanding in the Australian science and research community that there are further steps to be taken if this country is going to get the real benefits of the research which it has done.
There is a huge potential for this country to generate new businesses and new jobs not just in areas like biotechnology and information technology—the great technology revolutions that will be supported and strengthened by the 
 proposals in this green paper—but across the whole many fields of research. This green paper proposes for the first time the mechanisms that will achieve that.
It does that, first of all, through an enormous enhancement that is proposed of the investigator initiated, peer reviewed competitive grants process through the Australian Research Council. What will come out of this is an Australian Research Council which has a greatly enhanced capacity to fund collaborative research with industry and to develop the strategic vision for Australian research which will help Australian researchers see the entrepreneurial opportunities which stand before them as a result of their intellectual achievements. It provides also for a new structure for the Australian Research Council so that, through a series of program directors, we will have people who can see the huge opportunities there are for interdisciplinary research.
One of the limitations that the Australian Research Council has had has been that the peer review process has focused very heavily on discipline based peer review. That means that people working within a single discipline found it much easier to get research support than people proposing really innovative cross-disciplinary research. Again, if you ask anybody who knows about Australian research at the moment, you will find that there is a tremendously widespread recognition that it is cross-disciplinary research that is actually going to deliver the great benefits in the future.
Mr Lee interjecting—
—Of course, we heard not a word about that from the member for Dobell because he has not read the paper. Even if he had, he would not have had any ideas about it because the Labor Party has not thought about this. The government is about building an ideas economy, about making sure that Australia's comparative advantage in its intellectual strength is converted into businesses, jobs and opportunities for the future.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—As we have learnt from the newspapers today, the government has released a green paper on 
 Australian research. It is clear the government is marching towards a market driven, fully accountable higher education system—so sad for Aristotle and Plato. The minister's foreword to his paper states:
The Government believes that a broad ranging discussion within the research and wider community on the policy framework for research and research training is the best way to develop this framework.
Again, he obviously has not remembered what he has written in his foreword because he just stated quite clearly, `This is it. Here it is. Like it or lump it.' It is not about consultation, as a green paper is meant to be.
If this consultative approach is the best way forward, how come the paper was sent to journalists yesterday with an embargo? Why was it not sent to the people who should be consulted on this brave new world of research? Is the minister trying to hide his defeat by his own colleagues over the VSU legislation by grabbing headlines over changes to research and research training as opposed to putting forward that legislation in the Senate? Or is he merely putting his foot down yet again and giving the appearance of consultation, which this government is very well known for?
This paper is another indication of the government's lack of vision and commitment to Australia's future in research and development. This paper does not propose one cent extra for research funding, nor does it replace the funding already taken away from the Commonwealth's expenditure on education, research and training. The Prime Minister painted his 1999 budget as the education budget. If he thinks that it was, it is fairies at the bottom of the garden stuff if he expects the Australian public to believe he is committed to education through budget reductions. This is a farcical way to go forward. Also, if the government is committed to research, why are we sending no minister to the UNESCO sponsored world conference on science? A hundred other ministers from around the world are going. Again, it is all sound and fury  but  nothing  of  substance  from  this government.
Research and research training are the keys to our future. Without them, we will not be able to provide the employment prospects for today, let alone for tomorrow. In my electorate of Chisholm, there has been a massive decline in traditional manufacturing jobs, and there is little on the horizon to replace them. Where will jobs emerge in an economy reducing its expenditure on R&D? Where is the hope for the generation X that the Prime Minister has said he now represents?
As the member for Dobell has rightly pointed out, the minister's foreword to the green paper boasts, rather amazingly, that there has been an increase in private investment. The minister must be too busy trying to get into the papers to read them or he would have noticed the article on BHP in the Financial Review on 27 April which is completely at odds with the assumption he has made in his foreword. The article states:
BHP's research and development effort—the single largest of any Australian corporation—is to be cut by half and its research centre in Melbourne will close. About half of the four research staff employed in Australia and the United States are expected to lose their jobs as the corporation's R&D spending will be reduced by about $100 million a year.
Shame. One of the other points it makes is:
BHP was one of the few training grounds where people could put into practice what they could learn at a university.
So much for saying that the private sector is out there putting in money. In my electorate there are over 6,778 registered businesses. They are companies that manufacture construction steel, plastic, ducted heating, power tools, trucks and drilling equipment just to name a few. In addition to these, there are many companies within my electorate that are at the cutting edge of new growth industries. I also have leading industries such as Bosch and Lockwood.
These industries would be far more greatly assisted by a return to the 150 per cent R&D tax concession they enjoyed under the Labor government. Recent ABS figures show that research and development funding was down another four per cent, or $157 million, in the last financial year—the second consecutive fall. This is a damning indictment of this 
 government's policies of neglect. Even the Industry Commission recognised there was a net benefit to the Australian economy provided by the 150 per cent concession.
There are two other facilities in my electorate I would like to talk about—Monash University, which I do not believe the minister has been to since he was last employed there, and CSIRO. Flicking through the university's strategic research objectives, one sees all the positive things that the university is seeking: to improve efficiency, to promote public awareness of the university's research achievement and to encourage strategic collaborations and maximise research spin-offs on outside earnings. Certainly the university appears acutely aware of its responsibility to contribute to advancing and applying knowledge through basic and applied research, and collaborating with other institutions in order to better the products and services that touch both industry and human lives. Moreover, Monash is aware that commercialisation of research has the potential to lead to the establishment of joint ventures and that jobs flow from this.
One would presume that these principles espoused by the universities are ones that the government would applaud. However, the government does not back up its words with funds. Successive Commonwealth budgets have confirmed that operating grants will be cut by a cumulative 5.9 per cent over the period 1997 to 2000, resulting in a reduction in funding of $11.5 million per year by 2000 for Monash alone. So much for the minister's claim that his government is doing so much more for this sector. Within Victoria, this situation is compounded by the cessation of the Making Places initiative and the absence of underlying growth in student numbers funded by the Commonwealth. In the Monash plan, the university gives a telling insight into how it sees its future:
There are, nevertheless, reasons to be confident that the University can continue to achieve overall growth in income from fee-paying students and from other sources. Overall the resource outlook is tight and achieving the objectives of the Monash Plan will require an imaginative approach to new sources of funding, careful management of re 
 sources and a disciplined approach to financial responsibilities.
So, sadly, as the government vacates the field, it will be students who pick up the slack through fee hikes. Monash have an established overseas student program that will be rapidly expanded in order to chase the export dollars. Many universities have also moved away from the more academic disciplines such as those in the arts faculty, which I believe will leave a significant hole. At Monash, there has been a significant reduction in the number of places within the arts faculty because they cannot chase the business dollars nor attract overseas students. Whilst much of the research dollar will now be focused on commercially viable projects—and this is commendable—we must make sure that we do recognise the importance of research in the fields of history, literature and economics, which all contribute to the intellectual health of this country.
The other facility within my electorate is CSIRO. It is a facility that I recently visited, and I do not believe anyone from the government has been there for a while. It is at the cutting edge of research and business—
—There are CSIRO facilities all around the place.
—I was talking about CSIRO at Clayton. I said no-one had been there for a while. CSIRO is at the cutting edge of technology—from producing plastic banknotes to the protection of old-growth forests and producing more accurate X-rays.
CSIRO, like Monash, is acutely aware of its role in generating products and new technologies in conjunction with the business community. However, the CSIRO conducts a lot of research that has no financial incentive but is nevertheless important to our advancement as a nation. Having met some of the dedicated scientists there, I believe it is absolutely critical that researchers maintain strong input into assessing the merits of research proposals.
Australia needs reform that encourages further funding of our research industry in order to harness our natural resources, skills, innovation, education and creative strengths—not this narrow vision of this government's 
 green paper. This green paper does not herald a way forward on new knowledge and new opportunities; it is rather backward looking in some respects. It opens up the way for the government to do the following: to introduce by stealth a voucher system by starting with vouchers for postgraduate students; to exacerbate the situation of new disadvantaged universities in research funding and, in turn, reduce opportunities for kids from poorer backgrounds who attend these facilities; to exacerbate the crisis in the humanities area; to create chaos, confusion and the loss of some existing schemes, especially large grants schemes and the CRC program—where we have had significant success; and to move away from a commitment to basic research by allowing a greater say for industries and others outside universities and the research field in assessing the merits of research proposals.
What hope for the future with a government which is more interested in shifting chairs on the Titanic than actually seriously looking at research and development and the future of our country.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Research and Development: Government Policy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,33,1,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—The attack today on the government is an attack by the member for Dobell on the government for having some ideas. It is an attempt to mask the fact that the ALP are a policy free zone, that the leadership is AWOL, that they are absent without leadership. The attack today is on the government not only for the ideas it has put forward in the past but for daring to propose new policy innovations and inviting the sector and those with an interest in it to have a contribution.
Mr Lee interjecting—
—The member for Dobell is probably struck by the embarrassment of the revelation that he is trying to hide the ALP's lack of policy with an attack on the government for having one. What an amazing MPI! It is a dark day for the ALP today. They are not only trying to argue that governments should not have ideas; they are actually suggesting that because they do not have any they somehow have the high moral ground. It is a fascinating time in Australian politics and 
 is probably why this has been such a good week for the coalition.
Nowhere is there such a genuine commitment to developing an ideas economy than here in Australia. You have heard the minister talk about the plethora of ideas and the integrated strategy that the government is pursuing to create and commercialise knowledge and ideas in this country. It is not just a single idea; it is not just the member for Dobell actually picking up the government's ideas, mucking around with semantics and then offering them as something new. This is actually an integrated, multiprong strategy by the Howard government to inject new vitality and to support excellence in research and development in this country.
Let us run through the comprehensive program. We have talked about a supportive economic and entrepreneurial climate. Nothing happens unless there is a prospect of return. The government has made sure that those foundations are in place. You look further into the government's program and you see strategic financial support for R&D—support where there is an idea, support where there is homework and a business plan for commercialisation, or where there is a need for a bit of extra work just to complete the idea so it can go to the marketplace.
The member for Dobell holds up a card saying that the ALP wants to bring back tax rorts—150 per cent R&D tax concessions, where the goal is not the commercialisation of ideas but getting a tax break. So the whole motive of the ALP's proposal is driven by a tax break, whereas the government is putting forward serious financial support for genuine ideas at a number of stages in the process of design, development and commercialisation.
We move on to the next prong of the government's strategy, renovation of research infrastructure—another commendable initiative of the minister at the table, and again something the member for Dobell is trying to pick up. The legacy that Labor left us pointed to an urgent need for investment in research infrastructure. I will come to that point in a minute.
Another prong of the government's strategy is talent development—having the people with 
 the skills exercise their skills and their gifts and their knowledge in this country, trying to make sure that there is a place for them, a fertile environment in this nation for our best minds to excel. You have heard some examples of that from the minister at the table.
But there is more. We have another prong to the strategy, a focus on commercialisation. It is about having business and the idea generators work closer together so that the innovations and the insights that bring us hope for opportunities into the future become a reality. That is the great contrast between what this government is doing and what the ALP is talking about. This is research reality that the coalition government is trying to prove, where the outcome matters, where benefits for the Australian community matter, where making a difference in our lives matters, where opening up new opportunities and new solutions for future generations matters. That is the basis of our policy. What does the ALP offer? It offers a tax rort, a tax incentive so you can chase a tax outcome. An idea? Oh, you mean there has to be an idea in it? Well, we had better whip around and talk to somebody if the tax break actually has to have an idea attached to it. The coalition starts with the idea and we work on making it happen.
But there is more to the strategy: improving the links between the idea generators and business. There is a suggestion from those opposite that having research people, having universities, having some of our best minds working with business is somehow bad. What an amazing proposition!
—Crazy.
—It is absolutely crazy. It is an extraordinary contribution from the member for Dobell.
Mr Lee interjecting—
—He is saying it is hardly a new idea. It is a new idea to you, member for Dobell, because that wasn't even in your rebadge of the good things the coalition is doing, calling them an ALP policy. You didn't even get to that point. You might be able to pick that up and call that a policy, although I think there might be some intellectual property problems with your policy. You 
 might need to talk to the minister at the table about ownership of ideas, otherwise you might have a real problem. So even that is on the table from the coalition strategy.
But it goes further. There are specific initiatives in the areas of biotech, medical research, marine research, greenhouse and global warming areas and alternative energy. It is not just a single, narrow portfolio driven by a union constituency approach to R&D; it goes across many portfolios in this government. This whole-of-government strategy is about making sure research effort delivers outcomes for the country. There are a number of portfolios within government that can make a contribution. The government recognises that. The member for Dobell should read more of the material the minister at the table makes available and he would get a sense of that as well.
Then we get to the point of this MPI today. The ALP are criticising the government's vision and commitment, but everything the shadow minister, the member for Dobell, said disproves his claim. Everything that he said highlights the fact that the ALP only has shallow allegations and close to idea theft from the coalition. The member for Dobell has problems with intellectual property ownership as he shops around for an idea someone else has generated, and then offers nothing to replace what we are doing. It is retro research. He wants to go back to tax rorts, where tax concessions are the goals of research. Forget the ideas, just go to the tax concessions. That is the only new thing he offered compared to things the government is already doing. What a great endorsement of the government's program by the member for Dobell!
His attack is on our latest instalment. The minister has released a paper with some more suggestions about how to drive this further. The latest paper is a discussion paper: New knowledge, new opportunities. It is about promoting excellence in research training. There is support out there from those who should know. The Australian Research Council's Professor Vicki Sara says:
The paper is an important step forward for the development of Australia's innovation system. Importantly it recognises that basic research 
 contributes to the innovation system in a fundamental and long-term way. It recognises the link between research and economic growth and jobs and also the social and cultural benefits research brings to our society.
An endorsement from those who know, an endorsement from those who are interested in joining the government in its effort to renovate and restore and revitalise R&D in this country. But why do we need to renovate it? Look at Labor's record. After 13 years of Labor what did the government inherit? It inherited an R&D situation in this country riddled with problems. Business expenditure was heading south. GDP was 25 per cent lower than the OECD average in terms of share of GDP on business R&D. Let us look at where our position was on the league ladder of R&D. Australia slipped from 18th to 24th under Labor in regard to business expenditure on R&D among OECD nations alone. We inherited this problem. This decay that we inherited the member for Dobell seeks to defend, wants to go back to. What is it, member for Dobell? Have you worked out a way to go backwards even more quickly? Have you got a new way of sending us down the tube even faster than before? Is that the only innovation you can offer us?
Then we look further. The ability of the CSIRO to effectively undertake research was compromised by Labor's $60 million cut to its triennium funding. Under Labor the research infrastructure at Australia's universities was cut to the extent that the Boston Consulting Group estimated that we needed a $125 million injection just to get the infrastructure in our universities.
That is the legacy Labor left us, and the member for Dobell wants to go back there. Why? So he can ruin it completely? Is that your goal? Is this a greenfields approach to R&D—wipe out everything that we have in our R&D effort in this country so you can start again on ideas that have been proven to fail? But the big crime of this, which the member for Dobell seems to forget, is that more than half of the postgraduate students who started their course in 1992 did not finish it in six years. What a waste of resources. The ALP is trying to defend that. That is like building half a road and saying you are done; 
 that is like getting halfway through an operation and saying, `Six years on, we might finish it if it is stimulating.' What a funny way to run policy. So we have inherited that situation.
There have been constructive steps across portfolios to make a real difference, and this is the latest instalment that the coalition government has to offer. There is something that the member for Dobell can do, and that is get on the train towards a better future for this country. He can think about what needs to be done to support the R&D effort in this country and also about what we can do to make sure our nation in the future hits above its weight in terms of R&D success and commercialisation so we can enjoy the prosperity that this nation rightly has at its feet. But you have to do something constructive and productive to do that: you have to put the policies in place to make a difference. Labor are AWOL—absent without leadership. (Time expired)

"Fischer, Tim, MP",NP,1999-06-30,"—From this position, I move my last motion ever at the dispatch box. I move:
That the amendment be agreed to.
The government welcomes the timely passage by the Senate of the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill 1999  and acknowledges the bipartisan support for the Export Market Development Grants Scheme that has been expressed in both Houses. Passage of this legislation ensures that Australia's small and medium sized exporters can embark on further export promotional activities in the knowledge that the government will continue to support their effort. Support from all parties for this legislation reflects yet again that the EMDG Scheme is an effective and efficient program delivering concrete assistance to Australia's export sector. The effectiveness of the scheme continues to be reflected in the export impact and job creation that it helps to generate. The government agrees to the amendment as proposed in the Senate and commits to undertaking a review of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme provided for in the amendment in the first six months of the year 2000. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been and will continue to be a vital ingredient in developing a strong and vibrant export culture in Australia. I commend this bill, as amended, to the House.",REPS,<title>EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,37,1,speech
"Brereton, Laurie, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—I am pleased to speak briefly on the Export Market Development Grants Legisla 
 tion Amendment Bill 1999 . As the House will be aware, when this legislation was previously debated, I moved on behalf of the opposition several amendments which related to the continuity of the EMDG Scheme: the $150 million annual funding cap and the public disclosure of information concerning the award of grants.
These issues, we are now aware, were further debated when the bill was considered in the Senate and, in response, the government gave its assurances that there would be a thorough review of the EMDG Scheme to be completed by 30 June in the year 2000 and that the review will address the issues relating to the continuity of the scheme, the public disclosure of information and areas for future improvement in the targeting and administration of the scheme. The government, I am pleased to say, also undertook to table annually the full list of grant recipients, together with statistical information on grant trends to specific markets. Provision for the review by 30 June 2000 has been made in the amendment to section 106 of the legislation which is being reported back to the House today. On this basis, the opposition is pleased to support the bill.
With the indulgence of the House, I would like to add a couple of comments to those that have already been made today in respect of Mr Fischer's announcement. I want to add our congratulations on the manner in which, with such vigour and energy, he has pursued a number of vital relationships around the world. I think his efforts to build understanding and an agenda between Australia and the countries of Latin America and between Australia and the Middle East must be considered amongst the most outstanding achievements of the last administration, the last 3½ years.
In acknowledging that, can I say in a personal sense today that, for the first time, I am feeling just a twinge of envy about Tim moving on. I would like, on behalf of myself and my wife, to wish him and his family every happiness in their life after politics.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—In my third instalment on this bill, I conclude my comments by saying that what the government is proposing is nothing like the Communications Decency Act in the US which set out to establish what was and was not acceptable content on the Internet. The bill sets up a mechanism to enable the ABA to classify online content using the same RC, X and R classification system that is used for film, television and video sold or broadcast within this country. The bill does not set up the government as a new, pre-broadcast, up-front Internet censor. It merely plugs Internet content into the same existing and accepted classification system that applies in those other mediums.
I, along with other MPs, have received hundreds of email messages about this bill, some not terribly creative. I think that out of those hundreds there might have been five that had any individual contribution to make, but some of them did make some valid points. I would have to say, though, that many were heavy on emotion and prophecies of an apocalyptic end to the Internet. But then there were others saying that nothing will stop the Internet. The opponents of this bill before the House cannot have it both ways. They cannot in one breath claim that the Internet is going to come to a grinding halt and in the next breath say that the Net is so powerful, so above anything governments within jurisdictions can do to improve the quality of the content it carries, that it will just ride over the top. You cannot have it both ways.
You cannot also say that it is a waste of time and yet at the same time have these dire prophecies of ISPs being brought to their knees. You cannot have it both ways there either. You cannot say that it is overly interventionist and yet at the same time claim that because there is support for the development 
 of the technology there are too many easy ways out. You cannot also say that the Net performance is going to come to its knees when the hardware that is produced to drive the Net is developing at 60 per cent to 70 per cent improvement in performance year on year on year. We all know that where there is a performance problem with the Net it has more to do with the network over which it is delivered and the lines that come into people's homes than it has with processing capacity. To those in the ISP industry, guys, you cannot have it both ways. There is obviously a need to do something.
There is an enormously positive influence for the future of civilisation with the Internet, but at the moment it is damaged goods. It carries filth. It carries swill. It stands in the road of some of the information and educational opportunities it presents for all Australians. If we allowed ourselves to be brought to our knees by those who oppose this bill by saying that it will not solve all the problems with the Internet, we would never do anything as a government. We would never seek to improve the employment situation. We would never seek to address poverty. We would never seek to do anything worth while that we know is hard unless we could get the absolute response we were after.
Let us bury that absolutism. Let us get behind a way of making the Internet not damaged goods. There are new opportunities for ISPs, family-friendly Net access, cyberspace without swill and a whole lot of ways in which the industry can use its creativity and work with this legislation. I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—The government's legislative framework is the equivalent of the lone postie in the Sydney mail exchange in the middle of the night individually steaming open the letters. As he comes across something that he thinks might be a bit sus, he gets on the phone, rings the local police officer and says, `I've got something here I'm a bit worried about. It's come from offshore. Would you mind faxing the Bermuda police and telling them we've got a problem.' Meanwhile, outside the post office, you have Minister 
 Alston, the minister for communications, and his toady, the member for Dunkley, holding up the placard saying, `It's all solved. The problem's all solved. You don't need to worry. And if anyone takes a contrary view, please understand, they support paedophilia.' That is the government's framework and that is the government's presentation.
The legislation will not work. The biggest crime the government has committed in public policy terms with the presentation of this legislation is to pretend to the Australian people, to pretend to the mums and dads, that it is going to solve the problem. It will not. There is deceit here, and a golden opportunity has been lost. The golden opportunity that has been lost is that this was the perfect chance, the perfect opportunity, for the government to say, `This is an opportunity for us to start to educate end users, to start to educate those users of the Internet and their families, to start to educate parents, grandparents, guardians, teachers and school principals as to how you can use the Internet and how to ensure that it is safe and appropriate for children and people in your care by end-use filtering, by empowering the end user to determine that which you want to regulate.'
The government's effort to regulate the Internet content will not work. It will not work because over 90 per cent of content comes from offshore. The fact that the government's legislation is unworkable is reflected by the legislation's framework itself. When you look at the legislation's framework, you find that the government has established a framework which, for onshore content or onshore material, uses the current classification regime of refused classification and X classification and effects a take-down notice system through the ABA and seeks to impose a restricted access regime for R-classified material.
For offshore content, for overseas content, you have a take-down procedure for refused classification and X classification, but R is not mentioned. R is not mentioned because the government knows that it simply cannot control that volume of content. The government's legislative regime is unworkable because the vast bulk of Internet content is 
 offshore, and the government's own framework acknowledges that it is simply unable to deal or grapple with that by the processes and mechanisms that it puts in place.
So what public policy crimes do we have here? We have the government presenting legislation which is unworkable. At the same time, we have the government through Minister Alston, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts, essentially pretending to mums and dads in the suburbs that without more this solves the problem, that once this legislation is passed by the Senate and the House you don't need to worry. The truth could not be further from that particular position. Rather than trying to have the lone postie sitting in the mail exchange individually steaming open the letters, if you want to seek to regulate content on the Internet, you have to do it in a thoughtful and sensitive way, in a way which is appropriate to that medium.
On this side of the House we say, yes, we do believe there should be a system of regulation for the Internet and the Internet industry and we say that should be a combination of legislation and industry code of practice. But if you are going to legislate for Internet content, then try to be smart  about it. It is not just us who say this; it is the government's own premier scientific research agency, the CSIRO. In the context of the introduction of this legislation by the government, the CSIRO in April of this year in a press release entitled `Content blocking on the Internet' stated:
Blocking access to certain Internet material by Internet service providers or `backbone' providers will be largely ineffective, a recent CSIRO report has concluded.
Instead, CSIRO recommends the use of filtering software by Internet users, enabling them to choose whether to filter Internet content, and to what extent.
. . .              . . .             . . .
The report found that blocking schemes implemented by ISPs (Internet service providers) can easily be bypassed.
The release goes on to say:
CSIRO recommended the Government work with the Internet industry to promote the use of volun 
 tary user-initiated content filtering, and that filtering software be made available to users free of charge.
That particular report predates April of this year. The CSIRO put out a press release releasing that report in April this year because that was after the government had announced its proposals and CSIRO was sending the government a message: what you are doing is wrong, what you are doing won't work, there is a more effective way in which you can address this problem.
The United States Senate has in recent weeks addressed this problem and addressed this problem in a very sensible way. I noticed when I was surfing CNET news.com on 13 May that the US Senate passed a resolution or an amendment to one of its bills. It was passed 100 to nil—it was unanimous. The report on CNET news.com says:
U.S. Internet service providers such as America Online would be forced to help parents protect children from objectionable material online by giving subscribers content-filtering software under a measure unanimously approved by the Senate.
The legislation would require all Internet providers with more than 50,000 subscribers to offer such software free or at cost within three years. AOL already provides filters to its more than 17 million subscribers, as do other Internet access providers such as MindSpring.
So the approach that the US Senate has taken is to say: if you are interested in regulating content, you are best seeking to regulate that content by end-use filtering, by empowering the end user, by educating the end user and providing that end user with assistance so far as filtering devices are concerned. So if you want to regulate Internet content, then you need to do it in a thoughtful and appropriate manner. You have to understand the unique characteristics of the Internet as an information and communications medium and you have to understand the adverse implications that heavy-handed, inappropriate mechanisms can have for the Internet industry and for Australia's attractiveness as an e-commerce jurisdiction.
It is important to remember some of the history of this legislation. The government was in long-standing conversation with the Internet industry over a long period of time in respect of an industry code of practice to 
 regulate this particular area, and the industry was into draft No. 4—or it might each have been draft No. 4A—of their code. What happened? One day the minister announced they were going to legislate and tipped out the legislation. The legislation contained things which the industry had never been consulted about in respect of regulation of offshore content and a whole range of other matters. The government did it for one reason and one reason only.
It is very appropriate that today is 30 June. It is very appropriate that today is the expiration of the terms of current senators because tomorrow, as you well know, Madam Deputy Speaker Crosio, Senators Harradine and Colston no longer control the Senate. So this was—and I do not reflect on Senator Harradine in any way in this respect—the government's effort to drag Senator Harradine across the line on legislation not related to this industry. This was part of the government's device, the government's edifice, the government's attempts to drag Senator Harradine across the line on the privatisation of Telstra.
So the government may think they have had a victory out there by blackguarding the industry and blackguarding opponents to their legislation by saying, `You should ignore them. They are the supporters of paedophilia. They are the supporters of criminal pornography.' I suspect that, if you asked the community what have the government done in respect of the Internet and its content, out there in the suburbs they would say, `We think they have done something, but we know in our heart of hearts it is related to dragging the Tasmanian senator across the line.' That is why the government's attempts to blackguard the industry and blackguard the opposition and blackguard other people in the community who have said that this is unworkable legislation have effectively failed.
So this legislation was introduced in some immodest haste for the purposes of dragging Senator Harradine across the line. What was the industry's response to the legislation and its introduction? The industry's response was effectively to go into a pink fit. It made the point that it regarded the legislation as un 
 workable, that it would give Australia a reputation of being an unattractive destination or jurisdiction for e-commerce, that the burdens you would place on Internet service providers would essentially grind the system to a halt, that it would bring the country in terms of attractiveness as an Internet destination into ill repute and put off investors, and that, in any event, the legislation would not work because the mechanisms were easily bypassable and, on the government's own framework, ignoring an R classification for offshore material would not deal with over 90 per cent of the content on the Internet.
So what is the structure of this unworkable piece of legislation? As I indicated very briefly earlier, with respect to onshore content—content put on the Internet within Australia—the government adopts the current classification regime of refuse classification, X classification and R classification. It says in respect of refuse classification and X classification that there is a take-down mechanism courtesy of complaint to the ABA, and that in respect of R material, you need to put in place a restricted access regime by way of age, identity, PIN and the like. With respect to offshore material, refuse classification and X material is subject to a take-down notice and an ISP must undertake or go through reasonable steps to ensure that that is effected.
So those opposite who seek to blackguard our position as being supporters of pornography or paedophilia should all understand that on not one occasion has the opposition queried or questioned the classification regime which the government has put in place, other than to say, `You are adopting the classification regime for films and for computer and video games; you are using the same regime for the Internet. This is a very fast moving area. You actually want to think at some point in the cycle as to whether that is the most appropriate vehicle, but we are happy to have that conversation or discussion at a different time.' So no-one on our side has queried the adoption or the take-up of those particular classifications.
I have noticed that those on the other side are always up there saying things such as, `I have got an 18½-month-old son and at some 
 stage he will want to see a giraffe.' We are all in our own way sons and daughters and mothers and fathers. I have a young son and a young daughter. When I go to open days at high schools and I see the computer room, one of the first questions I ask is, `What are your end-user filter arrangements?' So those opposite do themselves and the community a disservice by seeking to pretend that they are the only ones concerned about ensuring that young people in our charge and care are not the subject of access to inappropriate material. That is under the classification regime that, for the purpose of this exercise, we do not quibble with. It was we on this side, when in government, who introduced the comparable classification regime to video and computer games. Why did we do that? One reason was that very much of the material that you find in video and computer games and on the Internet relates to violence.
I frankly think that the question of young people having access to violent material—whether it is on free-to-air broadcast TV, subscription TV, computer games, video games or the Internet—is a matter of serious concern. Those opposite do themselves and the community a disservice by seeking to pretend that they are the only ones who have that concern or that interest at heart. The great crime is that the government seeks to pull the wool over the community's eyes by pretending that its regime will in any way have any effect whatsoever with respect to those matters.
The further general framework of the legislation is that, in respect of the take-down mechanisms for that content that I have described, an ISP has to take reasonable steps to ensure that, once being the subject of a take-down measure, a reasonable step is gone through. And the reasonable steps can either be agreed through an industry code approved by the ABA or, in default of the industry code, be agreed by the ABA itself. So the heart of this legislation very much goes to: what can you regard as reasonable steps on the part of an Internet service provider, an ISP, to respond to a take-down notice by the ABA? 
The bill was released by Minister Alston. It was the subject of consideration by the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies. That was the subject of a majority report by government senators and a minority report by opposition senators and Democrat senators. The opposition senators' minority report formed the basis of amendments which the opposition moved in the Senate, all but one of which were defeated and which it is proposed, by way of amendments circulated in my name, to move again in this House. The government itself moved a range of amendments, some of which I will detail but, as you would suspect, if you thought the bill was bad, their amendments were worse—but I will come to that shortly.
The Senate report and the public hearings saw a whole range of submissions from the industry. They repeated very many of the things that I have referred to previously. In the industry's view, the legislation was unworkable, the mechanisms would be easily bypassed, the offshore content would ensure that the regime proposed by the government was unworkable, the penalty regime suggested by the government for continuing offences in response to take-down notices were very harsh when compared with other penalties, and the government had failed to take into account a whole range of important matters so far as what reasonable steps might be.
Aided by those submissions, the Labor senators effected a minority report, as I have indicated, and that formed the basis of the amendments moved in this place. When debate on this legislation started, I was unable to attend the House and the amendments circulated in my name were formally moved by the member for Bonython. I take the opportunity to quickly go through the second reading amendment and the points made there and some of the amendments which we will go to in more detail in the consideration in detail stage which reflect the substance of the Labor minority report in the Senate and which, in very many respects, reflect the submissions made by industry when the matter went before the select committee. The second reading amendment circulated in my 
 name but formally moved by the member for Bonython reads:
. . . the House:
(1) express its concern that:
    (a)	 the legislation is being dealt with in indecent haste and with inadequate consideration;
That largely reflects the fact that the minister dropped this on the table with the view to getting legislation through the Senate before 30 June, with nothing other than Senator Harradine and Telstra in mind. He did not have the concern of Australian young people or Australian families in mind when he dropped this on the table, he had 16.6 per cent of Telstra in mind when he did it.
Secondly, the government's claim that the legislation will solve the problem of unacceptable content is not supported by the reality that the vast bulk of Internet content is generated outside Australia. The government's own framework just ignores R-rated material that comes from offshore. Why? Because 90 per cent of Internet content comes from offshore and the volume is simply too much for the proposed regime to cope with.
Thirdly, the proposals, including the idea of mandatory Internet service provider filters, are unworkable and easily bypassed. It is not just the opposition who says that, it is not just the industry who says that, it is not just the Internet service providers who say that; it is also the government's own premier scientific adviser, the CSIRO, who says that. The application of the narrowcasting classification regime's regulation of Internet content has not been thoroughly analysed and may well require revisiting in the future in view of rapidly changing and converging technology, which is the point I made earlier. There is no quibble with the classification regime. We are quite happy for the purpose of this exercise to adopt it, but the government might have borne in mind that this is one of the fastest developing areas of industry, and it might just have had a thought for the future.
Fourthly, the legislation does not include a sunset clause or provision for review, given the speed of change in this area. It recommends that efforts should be made by the government to pursue international agree 
 ments on the regulation of Internet content, and substantially more emphasis should be placed on end user empowerment through information and education campaigns for parents, schools and guardians about the use of the Internet and the end-use filter devices. That goes very much to the heart of our approach to this matter. If you are genuinely concerned about seeking to solve this problem, take a leaf out of the book of the US Senate—unanimous resolution of 100 to nil—and empower end users of the Internet and provide assistance by way of end-use filtering devices.
The amendments that are circulated in my name will be formally dealt with in the consideration in detail stage, and some are worthy of comment at this point in the cycle. I indicated that at the heart of the bill are the reasonable steps that an ISP must take to comply with a take-down notice of the ABA. It is suggested by way of amendments moved in the Senate and defeated by the government that the ABA ought to take into account:
. . . public interest considerations to be addressed in a way that does not:
(i)	 impose unnecessary financial and administrative burdens on Internet content hosts and Internet service providers; and
(ii)	 degrade the technical performance of the Internet in Australia to a material degree; and
(iii)	 inhibit the development of Australia as an attractive jurisdiction for the conduct of electronic commerce and for investment in that industry;
The point here is that you are dealing with an industry which has very vast economic and social potential for Australia and the world. If we are to have our role in that, we do not want to do things which in the event will not work but which have the effect of making our nation, or our jurisdiction, a less attractive place for investment in that industry. Secondly, in terms of reasonable steps, it is suggested by our amendments that those steps include:
. . . whether the particular steps are technically feasible, commercially viable and cost effective; and . . . whether the particular steps enable end users to be better informed about the use of, or 
 assisted in the actual use of, filter devices for self-regulation of Internet content.
This goes right to the heart of what might be regarded as reasonable steps. The phrases `technically feasible', `commercially viable' and `cost effective' are taken from the press release, second reading speech or explanatory memorandum of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, yet he finds himself incapable of adopting these by way of amendment to the legislation. I would have thought they were incorporated by the interpretations act anyway, but the fact that the minister has been effectively negligent in this area is reflected by the fact that he cannot even find his way clear to adopt his own words by way of amendment.
Finally, a substantive amendment moved by us provides for a review of the operation of the act. We suggested that a review be undertaken of the operation of the act and that the act itself be subject to a sunset clause, to take effect at the end of three years, on the basis that we are in such a fast-moving area, and the parliament ought to be required to revisit this particular area of activity.
There are a couple of amendments that the government moved in the Senate which I think are worthy of some brief commentary. By way of amendment in the Senate, in what is now clause 95 of the legislation, the government suggested its own review clause. Clause 95 says, in part:
. . . Before 1 January 2003, the Minister must cause to be conducted a review of the operation of this Schedule.
(2)	 The following matters are to be taken into account in conducting a review under subsection (1):
(a)	 the general development of Internet content filtering technologies;
(b)	 whether Internet content filtering technologies have developed to a point where it is practicable to use those technologies to prevent end-users from accessing R-rated information hosted outside Australia that is not subject to a restricted access system;
Subclause (5) of clause 95 goes on to say:
The Parliament acknowledges the Government's policy intention that, in the event that Internet content filtering technologies develop to a point where it is practicable to use those technologies to 
 prevent end-users from accessing R-rated information hosted outside Australia that is not subject to a restricted access system, legislation will be introduced into the Parliament to:
(a)	 extend subclause 10(1) to Internet content hosted outside Australia; and
(b)	 repeal subclause 10(2).
What the government is saying is, `We're going to have a review before 2003. Before we have that review, we will let you know that, firstly, we have pre-empted it and, secondly, it is our policy intention to pass legislation to extend the regulatory regime to Internet content hosted outside Australia.' All the advice currently is that that is unworkable.
So you have the ludicrous situation where the government puts a review clause in the legislation which predetermines its result and which effectively states what government policy of the day will be when we know, all things being equal and all things being happy, the current government will not be the government on 1 January 2003. The minister got himself into a most embarrassing pickle in the Senate. The legislation defines Internet content as:
. . . information that:
(a)	 is kept on a data storage device; and
(b)	 is accessed, or available for access, using an Internet carriage service;
but does not include:
(c)	 ordinary electronic mail; or
(d)	 information that is transmitted in the form of a broadcasting service.
So this legislation does not seek to deal with ordinary electronic mail. In other words, it does not seek to deal with live communication; it seeks only to deal with data which is stored to which the public have access.
The minister then went on in an amendment to the bill to define ordinary email as email that does not include a posting to a newsgroup. So an email is an email unless it is an email to a newsgroup. The minister seems to have some unusual fetish in respect of newsgroups and sets in the framework of the legislation a quite illusory distinction between an email to a source and an email to a source other than a newsgroup. The key point here is that, on the government's own admission, you cannot deal with the offshore 
 content. On the government's own definition, it does not deal with live Internet content; it only deals with stored content to which the public have access. So if anyone stores some content on a newsgroup to which the public have access, it is caught by the government's regime, however ineffective that might be.
On the passing of the legislation through the Senate, there were a range of reactions. Firstly, the industry reacted adversely and suggested—I think anecdotal evidence will no doubt, in the fullness of time, seek to be scientific evidence—that this would cause a range of industry to move offshore. Secondly, there was grave concern that this would bring about adverse international publicity so far as Australia was concerned. Unfortunately, the passage of the legislation through the Senate coincided with the communications minister's trip to Silicon Valley, where he was attempting to curry favour by way of investor attraction to Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald story on 7 June under the headline `Net bill an investor turn-off' was an appropriate rendition of the response that was received there. On 4 June in wired.com, I noticed that Yahoo denied Minister Alston's assertions that Yahoo had supported the online services legislation when he had a conversation with them in the States. So there was adverse international commentary there.
I also noted the editorial in the Australian on 3 June under the heading `Internet laws only window-dressing'. The editorial in part says that the legislation:
. . . simply will not achieve its aim of barring access to classified and otherwise ""offensive"" material on the Internet. The Communications Minister knows this and indeed has conceded as much. But the legislation will not realise Senator Alston's goal of protecting children (and worryingly, adults) from material deemed dangerous; paradoxically it threatens both the information technology industry and Australian mores of privacy and freedom.
The editorial goes on to say:
. . . the Government's de facto  censorship of the Internet which has conveniently helped to appease Senator Harradine might have been both more successful and less discernible.
And then:
. . . it should be employed by parents, not governments. If used in the home, such software will invest power where it belongs—in the hands of parents shielding children rather than governments protecting themselves from puritan powerbrokers.
So the same point is made by the CSIRO, the same point is made by the opposition, and the same point is made by the editorial in the Australian .
The government's legislation is unworkable. It is bad law. It will not meet the mischief or the evil which the government seeks to identify. The parliament will certainly need to revisit this area in the future. It is a deceit, which the government seeks to perpetrate on the Australian community, that this legislation will be effective. It is a great lost opportunity to educate mums and dads, school principals and teachers, parents and guardians of the great power and capacity of the Internet as a useful social, educational and economic tool. It is bad law. If the government rejects our amendments in this place as it did in the Senate, we will oppose the bill's third reading.
Debate (on motion by Miss Jackie Kelly) adjourned.",REPS,<title>BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT (ONLINE SERVICES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,47,1,speech
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1999-06-30,"—The purpose of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Online Services) Bill 1999  is to establish a framework for the regulation of the content of online services, as indeed the bill says. The legislation has three major objectives: to provide a means for addressing complaints about certain Internet content, to restrict access to certain Internet content that is likely to cause offence to any reasonable adult and to protect children from exposure to Internet content that is unsuitable for children.
Twenty-one per cent of Australian homes are currently accessing the Internet. The number is expected to climb significantly as the medium becomes the mainstay of home 
 entertainment systems. As I looked at these figures, I noticed that 27.3 per cent of that 21 per cent—over a quarter—are couples with children. Even in this early stage of the development of the medium we have a lot of children exposed to the Internet. We also know that in schools computer technology, including in many instances the Internet, is becoming a way of life.
It is not as though it is something that children are ignorant of and learn on the knees of their parents, as they might have in the old days. They probably come home more adept at handling the home computer and the Internet than some of their parents. Another indication of this is that for the previous 12 months to November 1998, 62 per cent of young  people between 18 and 24 accessed the Internet. We can extrapolate from that, and from this educational trend I was just talking about, that there is a large group of technically adept young people who have access to the Internet. For any government to step away from regulating it on the basis that it is too hard or that some overseas R-rated material might slip through is just too dreadful to contemplate.
The introduction of digital television and technological conversion means that in the not too distant future people will be able to access the Internet on their television using their remote control unit and their set top box. So a medium that is already accessible will become even more so. I point out that if it is on the television screen itself it will be less easy to regulate it in the home environment, especially if the children are more adept than their parents in handling the medium. Therefore, there is a need for a gatekeeper.
There has been some rather loud clamouring against this rather intelligent and far-sighted government measure by members opposite, who shamelessly, once again, take the elitist minority position. It is very easy to become superior and say that it is a new medium and that we do not need all these controls. However, it is another thing to try to pull it back once it is rampantly out there in the community.
The member for Batman criticised a number of aspects of this legislation in a publication 
 that he churned out as part of his party's litany of books. There has been criticism on the grounds that the government seeks to kill the Net because the legislation is somehow technically impossible to implement. We willingly acknowledge that there are technical difficulties with blocking all material hosted on overseas sites. However, where it is feasible, it should be done. Just because no other country has tackled this issue does not mean that we should sit back and allow the Internet to become a conduit into our homes for the filth of the world.
That may sound like a strange, fairly extreme statement. However, I remember listening one night to David Hill, the then general manager of the ABC, describing how Australia had accepted various forms of electronic technology. He mentioned black and white television; colour television, where we were better than most of the world; video recorders; and mobile phones. He went through all the technologies. There is no doubt that we will probably embrace the Internet more readily than most other countries.
Also, as a nation continent, Australia has some abilities that may not be available to other countries which are side by side in Europe, America and so on. We have a unique opportunity to set a standard for the world rather than to step away from our responsibilities. In effect, we are taking an international leadership position, and the success of this endeavour could see other countries follow our lead. I went just the other day to a meeting of the Singapore-Australia Friendship Group, and it was interesting to see politicians from the Singapore parliament come here to see how we run this parliament and its various activities, how we electronically keep in touch with each other and how we use the various systems within the building. So we are recognised as being a leader in these sorts of things. There is every possibility that we will be looked to as a leader—if not throughout the world then certainly in our region—to set a standard in such matters.
It is not acceptable to make no attempt at all. That is the easy option, the option that all too often we have tended to take in the past. 
 The bill is not designed to censor the Net, to restrict freedom of speech, to force web sites offshore or to kill the Net, as some of the critics and some elements of the media have claimed in recent weeks. Nor is it designed to invade the rights of citizens. In fact, in many respects it enhances the rights of citizens. The bill does not seek to extend Australian community standards to other countries, nor does it seek to remove the responsibility of parents or guardians to monitor their children's use of the Net to the extent that they can.
The Australian community has never accepted the proposition that, because parents have a primary responsibility for their children, government should step aside from the responsibility to create a safer physical and social environment for them. We have never stepped away from that responsibility. For example, we do not accept dangerous toys. From time to time we hear about dangerous toys slipping through the barriers. Kids get hurt by toys. We seek to eliminate those and to use the information we get at that stage to make sure, as more toys come into the country, that there are fewer and fewer dangerous ones.
We do not accept, for example, because some flammable clothing sometimes sneaks into Australia that it is all too hard, that we should allow everyone to sell flammable clothing and that we should not examine imports for flammable clothing. No doubt some things do get past. How horrified we all are when a child's nightdress or something goes up beside a heater. But it is not as if the government has not made some intelligent efforts to make sure that they do not get in.
We do not let our kids read unsavoury material. We do not just take it for granted. Some kids get access to pornographic material or to adult magazines—albeit ones that are quite legitimate. We know that for a fact, and I made a point of this when we had the so-called Cleo safe sex guide in the previous parliament. We did not accept the proposition then that it was necessarily safe. We knew that young girls of 12, 13 and 14 read Cleo and would be exposed to that material. It was interesting that the minister at the time, even though a review said that they did not see 
 anything terribly wrong with it, on reflection decided to have the remaining copies of that guide destroyed.
We do not accept that our kids should have access to adult films. In fact, I was the supervisor of a chain of theatres once, and we did not ever accept that you should let kids under 18 into adult films in the theatre. But some of them got past us. Of course they did. I remember one day I pulled up this girl. She had beautiful little pigtails and blonde hair, and she looked every bit of 15 or 16. I said, `You are not seriously expecting me admit you to this film.' `Oh,' she said, `Mr Neville, my name is Mary-Lou so-and-so. I am 24 years of age. I have a Bachelor of Arts and I am studying for my doctorate.' So sometimes they fool you. In the same way that I thought she was underage, I am sure there are other more sophisticated kids who would have been 15 or 16 who were getting in. But that does not mean we did not make the effort to stop it. The same goes for R-certificated videos. We do not allow kids to take them out of video stores; we insist that they are taken by adults. No doubt some of those kids send their mates in and look at those videos, but we do not abrogate our position because it is difficult.
The fact that some aspects of the bill are, in the opinion of some in the industry, unlikely to succeed is not argument enough for the government to ignore this issue and to allow the Internet to go unchecked as a conduit to the world's unsavoury material for our children. The member for Moreton gave us a very interesting example—I think it was in the House; if not, it was certainly in the confines of the building—of where his eight- or nine-year-old daughter was using the Internet and looked up `spice girls'. Three of the four pages that she looked up on `spice girls' were perfectly acceptable. The fourth one outraged even the member for Moreton. So there are instances where the stuff needs checking. I do not think we should resile from it just because it is difficult.
The Internet is quite unlike any previous medium insofar as children are being introduced to computer skills at a very early age and accessing the electronic media in a way 
 never before available. As I said before, most kids are probably more adept at using the medium than their parents. As an educative tool it is unsurpassed. It is also, if unchecked, an open gateway to exploitation of the young. That is the point I really want to make. That in itself, even if we forget every other aspect of this whole debate, should be a motivation for us to do something about it.
The bill does not completely clean the Net. The government has never claimed that it would. No law can be 100 per cent effective, whether it is preventing road deaths, workplace accidents, drug taking or, as I illustrated before, allowing flammable clothing or something like that into this country. It will never be totally effective. But the fact that you make an effort and that you do remove dangerous material in whatever field you are dealing makes the environment both socially and physically safer. The bill is a new law for the new problems of a new age in a new industry, and the government will remain vigilant to ensure that the law is as effective as possible.
We have three measures that we intend to implement that are sensible and are not draconian. We propose appropriate procedures for this industry to prevent access to objectionable material or illegal sites. Filtering technologies and education form part of the government's response. We take seriously our responsibility to prevent illegal and offensive material on television. Material rated X is not permitted on television. Material rated R can be shown on television only by subscription if there are strict adult verification procedures. That being the case, why should we not be looking to apply similar methods with similar rigour to the Internet?
The bill ensures that the content classification system used and accepted by Australians for decades, albeit that the system that rates movies and videos has been slightly modified over recent times—for example: G, PG, MA or R—is extended to include content on Internet sites. The government does not invent these standards or ratings. They are the products of an extensive process of community consultation, and I am at a loss to understand why anyone would be horrified at an 
 extension of this logic to the Internet system. That is the first reason.
The second reason is that the bill sets up a system so that Australians can complain to the Australian Broadcasting Authority about any illegal or highly offensive material that is on an Australian site and establishes a system to ensure that material is removed. I would have thought that, if the ABA were responding to a complaint made by an Australian citizen, it would not be unreasonable for the material to be removed—that is, assuming a prima facie case has been established.
Thirdly, the bill requires that the Internet industry should develop its own code of practice which, in part, will set out the technically feasible and commercially viable steps that the industry can take to prevent or restrict access to illegal or highly offensive material on overseas sites. Frankly, I believe that, if the Australian industry is serious, these measures in themselves may well be sufficient.
In short, the bill forms a comprehensive package to protect children that involves parents, which is their time-honoured responsibility; the community, by not denying them the right to object; the industry, by exercising their own standards of conduct and practice; and the legislation, the responsibility of government to a new form of media in a new age. The government is not coming from some position of knee-jerk reaction but from a consistent position of responsibility.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—On behalf of the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the fourth report of the committee for 1999 relating to the proposed Australian Embassy, Berlin—refurbishment of heritage buildings as a chancery and apartments .
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The report which I have just tabled concerns the proposal for the refurbishment of heritage buildings as a chancery and apartments for the new Australian embassy in Berlin. The estimated limit of cost for the project is $37.277 million. The committee has approved the renovation and refurbishment works. For this inquiry, the committee held a public hearing into the proposal in Canberra but was unable to inspect the proposed site due to provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 which does not allow the committee to meet overseas. One member of the committee did inspect the site in a private capacity when in Berlin on other parliamentary business and was therefore able to make more practical contributions to the inquiry. However, lack of first-hand knowledge on the site makes the task of assessing the merits of the proposal a difficult one for the rest of the committee.
In 1991 the Bundestag of the Federal Republic of Germany resolved to relocate the German capital from Bonn to Berlin. Relocation of the German government and the Bundestag is planned for mid to late 1999. The diplomatic corps is also in the process of relocating to Berlin. In 1995 the Australian 
 government purchased two adjoining heritage buildings in the Mitte district of Berlin following an extensive search for suitable premises and sites for the new embassy. These are the Wallstrasse 76-79 and Markisches Ufer 8 buildings.
The decision to purchase and refurbish the buildings was intended in part to be Australia's contribution toward the rebuilding of East Berlin. The buildings are 85 years old and are heritage listed. Although structurally sound, they are past their useful operational ages and have inadequate building services and layouts for their intended use. They do not meet current Australian and German building standards and lack amenities, building services and provisions for technology, safety features and occupational health and safety. Heritage elements of the building also require restoration. There is, therefore, a need for complete refurbishment of the buildings.
The proposal examined by the committee involves the demolition of much of the interior of the buildings and some elements of the facade, roof, basement and courtyard; conversion of the basement for use as a car park; refurbishment of the heritage elements of the building; replacement of all building engineering services; installation of two new lifts; fit-out of the chancery; landscaping of the courtyard; and fit-out of two apartments in the Wallstrasse building and four apartments in the Markisches Ufer building.
The total number of Australia based and locally engaged staff to be located at the new embassy will be approximately 55. This number includes representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Department of Defence and the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs.
The committee had a number of concerns with the proposal. In particular, the written evidence presented by the Department of Finance and Administration was insufficiently detailed. The cost breakdowns presented to the committee made it difficult to make an informed decision on whether the moneys allocated to the work would be utilised in the most effective way possible.
The provision of apartments in the proposal also concerned the committee. The rent for each apartment per annum is around $210,000, which is high in comparison with similar accommodation in Berlin. But the department which occupies the apartments will pay rental, which will be supplemented to the Department of Finance and Administration. Although DOFA advised the committee that they believed that the level of rent charged was reasonable, there was no documented rental comparisons for the committee to conclude that the rent was a reasonable comparable rate.
The committee questioned the value of restoring the building to provide all four-bedroom apartments. However, the committee heard evidence that the configuration and structural condition of the buildings limited the design and the mix of accommodation. The committee also received evidence which indicates that some Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff do not favour collocation of accommodation and workplace, preferring independent private accommodation. The committee agrees that there is a need for greater flexibility in locations where security concerns do not warrant collocation. However, in this case, the committee acknowledges that there appears to be few alternatives other than to use the extra space in the building for apartments.
The committee also expressed concern that some of the fees for the project appeared to be unreasonably high. The Department of Finance and Administration advised that this is due to the high costs associated with the establishment of an Australian project director and the fact that fee scales for professionals in Germany are very high. The committee also questioned DOFA on the use of German contractors rather than Australians. DOFA advised that, due to the heritage listing and the extensive restoration work required, engaging contractors with local knowledge was the most viable option in Berlin for a one-off project such as this.

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—I present the report from the Committee of Privileges in connection with the matter referred to the committee by the House on 25 March 1999—unauthorised disclosure of the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—On 22 March the member for Cunningham, Mr Martin, raised in the House a matter of privilege under standing order 346. He stated that, in a newspaper published that morning and in a radio program broadcast that morning, recommendations of the report of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Regional banking services: money too far away  were given fairly accurate and extensive coverage before the report was presented to the House later that day.
The Speaker asked the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration in the first instance to, firstly, consider whether in its opinion the matter had caused or was likely to cause substantial interference with its work, with the committee system or with the functioning of the House; and, secondly, to take whatever steps it could to ascertain the source or sources of any disclosure.
On 24 March 1999, the Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, Mr Hawker, reported to the House that his committee had not been able to identify the source of the disclosure. However, he advised that the committee had resolved that, while the disclosure did not constitute a substantial interference with its work, it did constitute a substantial interference with the committee system.
On 25 March 1999, precedence was given to a motion to refer this matter to the committee. The committee received submissions from

"Somlyay, Alex, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—I present the report from the Committee of Privileges in connection with the matter referred to the committee by the House on 25 March 1999—unauthorised disclosure of the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—On 22 March the member for Cunningham, Mr Martin, raised in the House a matter of privilege under standing order 346. He stated that, in a newspaper published that morning and in a radio program broadcast that morning, recommendations of the report of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration entitled Regional banking services: money too far away  were given fairly accurate and extensive coverage before the report was presented to the House later that day.
The Speaker asked the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration in the first instance to, firstly, consider whether in its opinion the matter had caused or was likely to cause substantial interference with its work, with the committee system or with the functioning of the House; and, secondly, to take whatever steps it could to ascertain the source or sources of any disclosure.
On 24 March 1999, the Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, Mr Hawker, reported to the House that his committee had not been able to identify the source of the disclosure. However, he advised that the committee had resolved that, while the disclosure did not constitute a substantial interference with its work, it did constitute a substantial interference with the committee system.
On 25 March 1999, precedence was given to a motion to refer this matter to the committee. The committee received submissions from 
 Mr Hawker and from Mr Martin and a memorandum from the Clerk of the House of Representatives. The committee determined not to investigate the matter any further as, in the circumstances, it did not consider any further investigations would have altered the Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee's assessment of the seriousness of the matter or have revealed the source of the disclosure.
The committee found that a person or persons with access disclosed information concerning the report of the standing committee without authorisation. If such a person or persons acted deliberately, he or she, or they, were guilty of a serious breach of the prohibitions in the standing orders. The committee views such unauthorised disclosures very seriously as they display an offensive disregard for the particular committee itself and, ultimately, a disregard for the rules and conventions of the House. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to ascertain the identity of the person or persons responsible on this occasion.
While the committee is unable to make any recommendation on the particular matter complained of, it reiterates proposals made by a predecessor committee for the consideration of the House.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—It has been a bit of a wait, but I am pleased to be speaking this evening about an event which is something of a celebration for indigenous Australia. Tomorrow will formally mark a new tertiary institution—the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education, formerly known as Batchelor College. The college will take its new title tomorrow when it becomes independent from the Northern Territory Public Service. It is the first independent, Aboriginal-governed tertiary education institution in Australia—and that is a landmark occurrence.
It is something I am very proud of as a person coming from the Northern Territory and as someone who has been an advocate of 
 this course for a number of years. Indeed, as Parliamentary Secretary for Employment, Education and Training in this place in the mid-1990s, I initiated discussions for this to happen with the Batchelor College and the Northern Territory government through the Department of Education, Employment and Training. So this separation comes as something which I believe is very important for indigenous Australia, indeed very important for Australia.
The institute will provide opportunities for indigenous people to gain recognised qualifications while maintaining and supporting their culture and languages. It has an Aboriginal board, the chair of which is Gatjil Djerkurra, who, as you all know, is also the chair of ATSIC.
Mr Speaker, I want on this occasion to recognise the importance of the decisions made by the board, the history of the organisation, the struggles it has gone through and the commitment of its staff and the communities which support it. They have in my view provided an exemplar for other institutions around Australia who seek to provide indigenous Australians with an opportunity they might not otherwise get. It has provided unique opportunities for indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory and across the borders into Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. It has done so with a great deal of proficiency. I think there are many challenges which it will confront in its new enterprise. I am sure it will meet these challenges and provide a great example for all of Australia.
I want to pay particular tribute to the person who is resigning as CEO to make way for an Aboriginal CEO, Veronica Arbon. The CEO I am talking about is John Ingram. John first took up his duties as principal at Batchelor College in 1985. He is a person who committed himself to the cause of indigenous education in Australia by way, initially, of setting up the Aboriginal Community College which is now Tauondi College in Adelaide. Prior to that, in the late sixties, he worked in Papua New Guinea and Malaysia as an Australian Volunteer Abroad under the auspices of the Overseas Services Bureau, now renamed 
 Australian Volunteers International; and he remains on its board.
Batchelor College is a specialist institution and it requires people with a great deal of awareness and understanding of the important educational opportunities that Aboriginal people properly demand. As well as intensely working for the college to achieve independence from the NTPS, John Ingram's last two years, in particular, have been spent trying to resolve the Abstudy debacle which arose in the 1997 federal budget and which still has not been resolved satisfactorily. One of John's goals was to hand over control of the college to an Aboriginal person, and this he has done with Veronica Arbon, a strong Aboriginal woman who will take on the role as Director from tomorrow.
John is married to Paia, with whom he has four children. His children have grown up during the 14 years John has been at Batchelor and they now form the main core of the percussion group Drum Drum and the group The Siale Dancers which perform traditional and contemporary Papua New Guinea and Southern Pacific cultural music. The family are active members of the multicultural society of the Top End. As Chairman of the Asia Pacific Cultural Village Association, John has been a leading force in the establishment of a permanent village to function as a multicultural education facility in Darwin.
John is to be commended, as are all of those who have committed themselves to the cause of Batchelor College and now the Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education. I want to thank John on behalf of the Northern Territory community for the commitment he has shown to the interests, not only of the Northern Territory but of Australia generally; and the commitment he has shown, particularly, to indigenous education in Australia where his performance has been exemplary.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—My interest today is drawn to the current inquiry being undertaken by the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. I have been hearing a lot about how retailers operate in Australia and have come to the conclusion that we have a very different and difficult problem here than is experienced by any other country which is similar to ours. We are a huge island continent with very few people. There is only so much room for so much trade, and the main premises of healthy competition are missing. This is particularly true of rural and isolated areas where the population is spread even more thinly and there is little ability to build economies of scale easily.
The groupings of supermarket chains tend to concentrate their efforts in competing for their market share where the local population is over 5,000. According to the Franklins chain, this is the size below which the local population cannot fall if they are to be able to afford to establish one of their stores.
In my area of Tasmania, I do not have a major town in my electorate with a population of 5,000. The biggest has a population of about 3,000, and the smallest are settlements of 10 or 20. Some of these settlements are more than an hour's drive from major towns and most of the time they rely on the local store in the smaller centres for their purchases.
From my activities with opposition committees, and as a member of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services, I know that there are many similar situations all over Australia. Customers in these isolated areas do not have the same opportunities to save money by shopping in stores that are able to exceed the critical mass for bulk buying of goods at the lowest prices, as laid down by wholesalers' requirements. However, despite this, stores in rural and remote areas do a good job in providing a service.
I believe that the present inquiry is too narrow and that it does not cover the many issues which affect retailers who are trying to compete under the terms of the national competition policy but who are unable to do so because such an uneven market situation exists in Australia. I believe there is a need for a complete review of the competition policy and the deregulation of the market so that some adjustment can be made for our town and country areas. I believe that a cap should be placed on the share of the market by Australia's three supermarket chains.
We also need to find ways to help small business learn about their rights and responsibilities when dealing with competition. That means more access by small business to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and more funds to help rural and regional communities. I believe this would be one way to even up the playing field a little.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>National Competition Policy</title>,Statements by Members,58,1,speech
"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—The Australian Sports Commission Amendment Bill 1999  represents complementary legislation to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Bill, which this parliament debated earlier this year and which the opposition of course supported. The Australian Labor Party is proud to have introduced the original legislation in 1990 that resulted in the establishment of the Australian Sports Drug Agency and is very proud to have been the mover of that initiative.
The move was a world first. It was the first time an agency as such had been underpinned by government legislation. Labor's goal in establishing the ASDA was to ensure that Australian athletes are able to perform and compete in an environment untainted by banned substances. The use of illegal performance enhancing drugs has serious repercussions, as we have witnessed in both international and domestic sporting competition. When Labor established the ASDA, one of the key aims was to implement it as a deterrent to any athlete who might consider using prohibited substances. To achieve this goal, the ASDA implemented a variety of strategies based on policy advice, education, advocacy and deterrents.
In 1996 and 1997, the ASDA performed a record number of anti-doping tests. Its success in preventing the use of illegal substances in sport is such that the ASDA estimates that 99 per cent of athletes have been deterred from participating in banned doping practices since its programs began. In fact, the ASDA has not had a single legal challenge against its testing program. Since Labor created the ASDA, it has proven itself to be worthy of the exceptional international reputation it has gained. The ASDA's stated vision of being the leading drug testing agency in the world is commendable and totally supported by the opposition. So, too, is the ASDA's strategy to make its anti-doping programs available to both elite and non-elite athletes. The role of the ASDA in education and policy advocacy is having a positive influence on young sports participants, who can now compete in the knowledge that every avenue is being pursued in the war against doping in sport.
The opposition is committed to seeing the ASDA maintain its enviable reputation, and we will therefore be supporting this legislation as we did the earlier legislation it builds upon. However we do have a few concerns, which I raised in debate on the earlier bill. I do not think I need go over them again. As usual, they go to funding and some of the core principles lying behind the bill that seem to be being dealt with in an administrative rather than a policy way.
It is very true to say that sport is an area of public policy that has always enjoyed bipartisan support, and so it should. Our leading sports people in particular are great role models for our children, and Australia has a proud history of performance in both national and international sport. This is a bill worthy of bipartisan support. The Labor opposition is giving that today, and we implore the minister to give sport the highest possible recognition within the ministry. 
 With the year 2000 Olympics coming to Australia in the not too distant future, that is more important than ever.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN SPORTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,59,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—I am pleased to rise today and also to follow the member for Hunter, Mr Fitzgibbon. It is interesting to be involved with him in various bipartisan exercises of recent days. Sport is one, tourism is another and being involved in the retail committee is certainly a challenge for both of us.
I would also like to congratulate the Minister for Sport and Tourism on her involvement in the development of this particular bill, the  Australian Sports Commission Amendment Bill 1999 . Obviously, work has gone on for some time in this general area but it has taken the leadership of the minister to bring together various elements. Her own experience as an elite athlete, as a rower, has obviously shown her first hand the need to keep sport clean within Australia.
Having been involved in Sydney's Olympic bid, I am aware that the Olympics in Australia need to have an image that is free of drugs. The Sydney games provide us with the opportunity to turn around some of the perceptions that linger at the moment. I was actually in Atlanta at the time Michelle Smith-de Bruin, the Irish swimmer, managed to collect several gold medals. As has been proven in recent days, she got there purely by cheating. Everyone at the Atlanta Olympics said, `This woman must be cheating.' She improved her times over a period of one year to a level that no-one had ever seen. She was suddenly breaking world records, and people said, `This is not possible.' She did it as a cheat. She cheated other athletes: Janet Evans, the great American swimmer; and some of our own, for instance, Samantha Riley. She cheated out of medals people who had done it the honest way. They were cheated of their opportunity to get the gold and silver medals because of someone's use of drugs. This is what this bill is about: eliminating the cheats in sport so that the Olympics in Sydney can be about being `faster, higher, stronger' without drugs.
Certainly this bill is similar to the one that came through the House several weeks ago that involved Customs providing information to the Australian Sports Drug Agency. It is a bit of a pity that the two bills did not come through together.
It is very good to see the minister in the chamber and to congratulate her on her leadership in bringing this bill together. Before the last election, she brought out a policy document called A winning advantage which was about trying to eliminate, as best we could, drug cheats from the sporting arena. Minister Kelly's own background in elite sport as a rower has provided leadership within the department.
When I spoke to Bill Rowe, who is the director of the National Office of Sport and Recreation Policy, it was clear that work has been going on but that it took the leadership of this minister to bring it to a conclusion, and we appreciate that. It is good to see someone in this portfolio with experience in sport, and it is certainly unique. We have seen that, in other places, the ability to win marginal seats has been important. Minister Kelly has shown the combination of someone who not only wins marginal seats but also has a sporting background, which is somewhat radical. So well done, Minister, and well done to the department and to the people who brought this together.
Basically this bill is about the customs department, which previously had this information, sharing that information with the Sports Commission. The last bill dealt with information sharing between Customs and the ASDA. This  bill deals with the Sports Commission. There are two parts to it: we want to eliminate drug cheats, but we also do not want to be in a 
 situation where any information the customs department has is provided to everyone at will—spread around or in the media—so that people are suddenly exposed in headlines on account of information given. I am sure no-one wants that. By all means let us catch the drug cheats, but let us also protect people's privacy.
We have in this bill the requirement that only the executive director of the Sports Commission has the information on an issue and that any other group provided with that information, such as the heads of the various sporting organisations, must provide written agreement that they will release it to no-one else. By all means take action, but I think it is most important that we protect people's privacy.
We have discussed the aspect of privacy; another aspect is how it is going to work. The customs department has a list of prohibited substances, so that when products—illicit drugs, whether they be for recreational purposes or for re-sale—are brought into the country, Customs can apprehend them. Of course, there are some recreational drugs that are not on the list of sports prohibited drugs because they are not seen as impacting in a positive way on the performance of athletes. Cannabis and cocaine are certainly two that are on the Sports Commission prohibited list. There are 140 substances on this list. They are not one and the same. There are also some drugs that are sport specific. If you are a weight-lifter, the types of drugs that will enhance your performance are quite different from the drugs that will be performance enhancing to a shooter. A shooter may need relaxants to go out there and shoot accurately. So a shooter has a different requirement from a weight-lifter. That does not mean that you allow one athlete to bring a drug in and provide it to an athlete in another code.
What happens is that Customs receive this information and they apprehend someone, when it is observed that the person is bringing in illicit drugs. They take action on one level. The information is then provided to the Executive Director of the Sports Commission where it is reviewed; they look at whether the drug is on their prohibited list. The executive director himself looks at it and if it is on the prohibited list, they advise the appropriate sporting association of what has happened. It is up to that sporting group to implement anti-doping policies, so they undertake the test program, et cetera.
I think this is fantastic. It is important and it has been a long time coming. I said to Bill Rowe beforehand, `Why has it taken until 1999 to get this bill through?' His advice was that it had been thought about for some time. The impetus of having the Olympics coming to Australia, the fact that there has been a whole lot of exposure of drug cheats over recent times and the arrival of the minister to take the leadership in this area have been important; the commitment was made before the election.
This legislation is worth while. It is a significant step forward. We are not only protecting the individual's privacy—and that is important—but also identifying through Customs where there has been apprehension about the use of performance enhancing drugs. We have then been passing that information on to the appropriate agency.
Also, there is the vice versa effect. If there is a strong rumour that an individual is taking a particular drug, sporting groups and particular associations pass this information on to Customs so that they are alerted. When that individual then goes through Customs they can check whether they are bringing in drugs.
Some might think this is a little hard. I personally do not. It is about being fair. Sport is not only about `higher, faster, stronger' but also about fairness—and this goes right to the heart of it. In the administration of the sports portfolio, you can have no higher priority in entering 
 the new millennium than that of catching drug cheats. Well done to the minister. Congratulations to the government. I commend the bill to the House.
Also, congratulations to the people who work in the Department of Sport and Tourism and in the Sports Commission. I thank them for their cooperation and for bringing the whole process together so that we can have the bill in this form. We look forward to an era which is going to do much to eliminate drug cheating in Australian sport.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN SPORTS COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,59,1,speech
"Kelly, Jackie, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—in reply—It is great to have heard the contributions from the member for Hunter and the member for Cook. The member for Cook has ably summed up the intent and will of the Australian Sports Commission Amendment Bill 1999 . In summing up, I will just briefly allude to the fact that these amendments are to enhance the overall effectiveness of Australia's anti-doping regime and to help us stay at the forefront of the international fight against the use of banned drugs in sport.
The bill will facilitate the exchange of very necessary information—as the member for Cook mentioned—between two key Australian agencies and that is improving the whole of government effort to rid sport of drug cheats. The provisions in this bill, in concert with provisions in the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Act 1999, will allow Customs to pass certain drugs related information to the Australian Sports Drug Agency.
These amendments have been developed in close consultation with, and agreed to by, the Attorney-General's Department and the Privacy Commission to ensure the rights to privacy are protected and maintained, as the member for Cook mentioned. I join with the member for Cook in thanking my department and the ASC for their contribution to this bill. I commend the bill to the House.

"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,1999-06-30,"—One aspect of the budget that I have been very disappointed in is the RONI funding that has gone to South Australia. You would think that there were nine Labor members in South Australia and only three Liberal, instead of the other way around, in terms of the influence that those members have on this government for infrastructure spending in South Australia.
About 12 months ago I mentioned in the House, with great disappointment, the lack of money and encouragement for infrastructure spending in South Australia. In particular, I referred to the Gillman highway and the third river crossing in my electorate of Port Adelaide. 
 When you examine the RONI funding throughout Australia, you cannot help feeling very cynical. I know that there are many safe Liberal seats—and I have heard members say it with great disappointment—where there is no funding whatsoever. There were some safe Labor seats—nothing. When you look at marginal seats and the RONI funding, whether you look at Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria, you see Liberal marginal seats—not National Party seats, but Liberal. That is a great disappointment. The one exception for the National Party was probably Hinkler, with the road funding going around the city of Gladstone.
South Australia, like Tasmania, needs particular attention to encouraging its economy. The Port of Adelaide is the most efficient port in Australia. It is continuing to be the most efficient port but it lacks part of the jigsaw puzzle. When Labor was in, we duplicated the Port Wakefield highway, we built the South Road connector, we built the Salisbury interchange bridge, and, as in a jigsaw puzzle, all the bits started to come together to build what I would think is one of the best transport hubs in the world.
Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know whether you have been to Antwerp or Amsterdam, which are probably two of the greatest ports in the world. We are talking about a third river crossing: there must be 50 or 60 in Antwerp. We cannot build one in South Australia—not one. It is a great disappointment because it would give South Australia, in terms of niche importing and exporting, a real boost in the sense of increased traffic into an efficient port; it would give a rail link, with direct access to all cities in Australia and to the Northern Territory. Yet, for the second time running, in this budget we have not been able to gain any funding whatsoever.
I have to say that the Liberal Minister for Transport in South Australia, Di Laidlaw, has tried to encourage the building of the third river crossing and to get money for that. I give her credit for that. It just seems a great pity that this is a government that fails to recognise the national interest or a way of dealing with the national interest other than by short-term political opportunism and the pork-barrelling of seats. I heard Mr Anthony speak earlier about a form of thinking—referring to the Newcastle-Wollongong-Sydney-Canberra triangle—which excludes anyone outside of that. How do you think South Australians, Western Australians, Northern Territorians and Tasmanians feel? We have, basically, a feeling that when it comes to any infrastructure matter outside of Brisbane-Sydney-Canberra-Melbourne there is no consideration given whatsoever. I think it is a great disappointment to the people of South Australia, in that they have nine Liberal members out of 12. One of them, the member for Sturt, must be very disappointed because Port Rush Road, a major arterial road in his electorate, is now going to be part of the route for semi-trailers, semi-B-doubles and goodness knows what else. His constituents will be very alarmed that this is going to be the major transport route from the eastern states to the Port of Adelaide, right through the middle of his electorate.
What are the other eight members doing? What influence do they play in the preliminary discussions on budget in terms of infrastructure spending in South Australia? I suspect very little indeed. This is a grave disappointment. I hope Di Laidlaw and the Premier of South Australia—perhaps along with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rann—can get the government to reconsider substantive funding for South Australia.
In my closing moments, I would like to acknowledge a good friend of mine, Mr Ralph Clarke, a member of the state parliament of South Australia, who is here today. I welcome him to the Main Committee.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,1999-06-30,"—The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
Background—Questions 1 to 3
In New South Wales, to which ""Round 13"" applies, the Home and Community Care Program is administered by the Ageing and Disability Department of the New South Wales Government.
(1) The New South Wales Ageing and Disability Department has indicated that it ran a series of industry briefing sessions for organisations interested in tendering for HACC growth funds in Round 13. There were 16 sessions, one for each of the 16 HACC regions, and a further 7 Aboriginal specific sessions.
Organisations tendering for HACC growth funds in Round 13 were required in their application form to indicate how their service cooperated and coordinated with other HACC and HACC-like funded services. Knowledge of the HACC and HACC-like service system was also required.
(2) Individual providers are required to demonstrate in their tender submissions how they have coordinated with the rest of the community service system. 

(3) Applications are considered by a number of panels each consisting of three members with representation from the Ageing and Disability Department, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care and an independent member drawn from the service provider sector to encourage objectivity and diversity in the selection process Selection panel members meet to discuss the selection process. In Round 14, benchmarks against which the quality of the applications can be measured were agreed In this way all panels apply consistent values when considering applications.
(4) The Commonwealth has not reduced the level of HACC funding provided for New South Wales in the 1998-99 Budget by $3 million. Indeed Commonwealth HACC funding for New South Wales in 1998-99 has increased by $5.7 million to a total of $155.9 million, representing 60% of HACC funding for New South Wales
(5) The Commonwealth has allocated funding in the expectation that revenue to HACC funded services amounting to 20% of governments' funding would be achieved by the end of the year 1999-2000. Any changes to fees policy and their implementation are matters for the States and Territories.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Home and Community Care Funding: Tenders</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,61,1,answer
