"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2007-08-13,"—This is a motion to extend sitting hours this week to deal with a raft of government legislation, including the legislation affecting the Northern Territory and Indigenous communities throughout Australia and the very important Water Bill, as well as other legislation. I make the point that this year is one of the shortest calendars in decades for sitting weeks. If the Senate were being adequately managed by the government, it would be sitting more weeks. It would not be sitting late into the night with open-ended sittings on Thursdays, but would have more sittings with time for all members to properly address legislation, rather than having extended hours and then the guillotine being dropped, as we are going to see repeatedly this week, to convenience a government struggling on its way to an election.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,0,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2007-08-13,"—The Aviation Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 amends the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 to further strengthen and clarify a range of aviation safety and security provisions. In particular, the bill amends the Civil Aviation Act 1988 in two primary ways: firstly, so that a person who is outside an aircraft can commit the offence of interfering with aircrew or endangering an aircraft or passengers. I note that this provision addresses recent concerns in the community—most recently reported today, in fact—about the pointing of lasers at aircraft approaching or taking off from major airports. Secondly, the bill adds a new part to create the statutory framework to provide for drug and alcohol testing and management.
There are also four major changes to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004: firstly, to more closely align aviation security legislation with maritime security legislation and make the transport security process more flexible; secondly, to provide for the making of regulations to prohibit activities outside airports that could adversely affect airport or aircraft operations in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s requirements; thirdly, to provide broader and more effective coverage of potential acts of unlawful interference with aviation, including further powers for Australian Customs officers at airports, in line with the recommendations of the 2005 Wheeler report, An independent review of airport security and policing for the government of Australia; and, finally, to provide for the making of regulations that would specifically describe those senior dignitaries and their families who are exempt from aviation security screening.
I am pleased to have been involved in the review of the bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport. While the committee recommends that the bill be passed, the committee raised a number of concerns, which I share. I foreshadow that I will move the second reading amendment tabled here today, to address those concerns. I understand that a second reading amendment has been circulated. I am concerned about the creation of an exemption mechanism for senior dignitaries, rather than use of the case-by-case mechanism already existing for security screening. Several industry participants also expressed concern about these provisions, including Virgin Blue Airlines, the Australian Airports Association and Adelaide Airport, who were opposed to any exemption.
Virgin Blue argued that ‘the approach adopted by the government introduces security vulnerabilities and risks to the security framework’ and therefore to the travelling public. Clearly, if a person who is exempt from screening and clearance under legislation can enter a sterile area or board an aircraft whilst in possession of a weapon or prohibited item, either intentionally or inadvertently, then this poses a risk to security.
I think it is fair to say that the committee reluctantly accepted the advice of Department of Transport and Regional Services officials—who themselves were acting on the advice of DFAT and the Attorney-General’s Department—that the amendments are necessary to meet Australia’s international legal obligations in relation to the processing of visiting dignitaries. They pointed out that the changes will not involve a large number of people, will meet Australia’s international legal obligations and will actually only create a power to grant an exemption.
As stated in the second reading amendment, which is being tabled at the moment, I call, on behalf of the opposition, on the government to consult further with the aviation industry and unions and to take into account their advice before exercising the power to exempt any senior dignitaries from security screening. Such exemptions should only be granted to meet the international legal obligations referred to by Department of Transport and Regional Services officials in their evidence to the Senate committee.
My second concern relates to the introduction of drug and alcohol management and testing programs. These measures are required to deliver better safety outcomes to Australian civil aviation and to maintain Australia’s international standing as a leader in aviation safety. According to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau pilot safety survey on the use of drugs and alcohol, more than 20 per cent of pilots who responded indicated that they felt that, at some point in the previous year, safety had been compromised in some way by alcohol, drugs or prescribed medication. The Hamilton Island air crash in 2002, in which six people lost their lives, is believed to be at least partly attributable to alcohol and drugs. So, whilst I am broadly supportive of the introduction of drug and alcohol management and testing, I am concerned about the exclusion of certain stakeholders from the consultation process and about the development of the detail.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has so far shown some willingness to consult further on the implementation details but has not been willing to include the Australian and International Pilots Association as a formal member of the drug and alcohol project team, despite the constructive contributions that that organisation has made to the process. The Australian and International Pilots Association, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, and the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union, who cover airport security, have all raised issues about the implementation of the drug and alcohol management and testing regime but are broadly supportive of the approach. In particular, the AIPA and the LHMU stressed the need for an approach based on harm minimisation, education and rehabilitation, rather than on punitive measures. In my second reading amendment, I call on the government to consult further with the aviation industry and unions and to take into account their advice regarding the practical implementation of the proposed drug and alcohol management and testing regime.
The third issue relates to the proposals concerning Customs officers in the implementation of recommendation VI of the Wheeler report of 2005, which recommends:
all police, AFPPS and Customs officers deployed to an airport be given clear and unambiguous powers, including to stop, search, detain and arrest where necessary within the airport and adjacent roads and parking areas
Given that Customs officers will now be undertaking police-like activities, I think it is important that the powers of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity also be expanded so that it can oversee these activities. Accordingly, the second reading amendment calls on the government to do just that.
Let me also say that the government could have exercised more haste in acting on the recommendations of the Wheeler report, and I note that there is also more to be done. Broadly speaking, I support the measures proposed in the bill, and we will be voting in support of the legislation. I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
                  “but the Senate condemns the Government for creating an exemption mechanism for senior dignitaries rather than using the case-by-case mechanism for security screening and calls on the Government to:
              (a)    consult further with the aviation industry and unions and take into account their advice before exercising the power to exempt any senior dignitaries from security screening;
              (b)    consult further with the aviation industry and unions and take into account their advice regarding the practical implementation of the proposed drug and alcohol management and testing regime;
              (c)    consult fully with stakeholders in the drafting of all relevant regulations subsequent to the passage of the bill; and
              (d)    expand the powers of Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, so that it can oversee the police-like activities undertaken by Customs”.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2007-08-13,"—As a senator for Western Australia and a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs and the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, I spend a considerable amount of time frequenting airports in capital cities and regional towns, as well as remote airstrips, so the amendments to this bill are of great interest to me. With the enormous increase in aircraft movements and passenger numbers throughout Australia, it is imperative that we, as a government, ensure that those involved in the aviation industry, both in the air and on the ground, have every opportunity to work in a safe environment.
The Aviation Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 was referred to the rural and regional affairs and transport committee for inquiry on 21 June 2007 and was due to report on 30 July 2007—which it did. Nine submissions were received and five groups of witnesses appeared before the committee. There was general support across the aviation industry for those amendments to the act which enhance security. There was little support for the amendment granting exemptions from security clearance for certain dignitaries.
Of concern to the committee and those who provided submissions was the fact that many of the proposed amendments to the bill will be implemented through regulations which are yet to be drafted. As a member of the committee, I was most concerned that the unavailability of the proposed regulations made it very difficult to assess the implications of the proposed amendments, especially in the area of security exemptions for certain dignitaries and their families.
The Aviation Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007 contains four sets of amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and two sets of amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988. These amendments are intended to strengthen security and safety in the Australian aviation industry. Aviation security continues to be a high priority for this government and constant review is needed to ensure the Australian aviation industry is responsive to changing threats to our security. The government takes aviation security extremely seriously and has invested more than $1.2 billion in aviation security since 11 September 2001.
The first amendment to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 makes changes to transport security programs which will more closely align aviation security legislation with that of maritime security legislation and will give certain industry participants far greater flexibility during the transport security programs process. This amendment will improve the administration of transport security programs and enhance existing aviation security by allowing the aviation industry participant to request the cancellation of their transport security program. Examples of this could be discontinuance of a regular public transport service or operations from a particular airport; changes to the time frame needed to process applications for transport security programs; and more flexible approval arrangements for the life span of a transport security program.
The bill allows broader and more effective coverage of potential acts of unlawful interference with aviation, including additional powers for eligible Australian Customs officers who operate at security controlled airports. The amendment utilises eligible Customs officers at parts of the airport where uniformed police are unlikely to routinely visit but which are visited by Customs officers. The intention of the amendment is to complement, not replace, the law enforcement role. It is important to note that under item 19 of section 91 of the bill, a new paragraph, 91(1)(d), is to be inserted to make it clear that a person who is an airport security guard is not an eligible Customs officer. This ensures clear differentiation of the roles of eligible Customs officers from the roles of airport security guards and law enforcement officers. The additional powers given to eligible Customs officers include: stop and search provisions; requesting people to leave an aircraft, airport or an area or a zone of an airport; restraint and detention until the arrival of a law enforcement officer; and the removal of vehicles from an area or zone of an airport.
It is proposed that eligible Customs officers will only exercise these powers when a law enforcement officer is not immediately available, where prompt action is required to prevent a security event from developing or continuing or when intervention is necessary to detain persons believed to have been involved in a security event. The implementation of this recommendation demonstrates the commitment of the government to strengthening aviation security.
The bill also clarifies provisions which relate to the screening and clearing of dignitaries. The amendment will allow the regulations to specifically describe those dignitaries who are to be exempt from aviation security screening. The amendment will provide, through regulations, for the most senior dignitaries, their spouses and minors to be exempt from aviation security screening. Other dignitaries and VIPs will still be able to apply for an exemption on a case by case basis.
As mentioned earlier, members attending the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport hearings into this bill were particularly concerned about this amendment and spent a great deal of time clarifying this point with the Department of Transport and Regional Services. There was also considerable opposition from the industry participants, including Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd, Australian Airports Association and Adelaide Airport Ltd, to the granting of exemptions of any type. The committee was particularly interested to determine whether proposed changes to the legislation, allowing a particular class of person exemption from security screening, could create a dangerous precedent.
Australia has a great record in the area of airport security. The following incident, which was reported in an article in the West Australian on Saturday, 4 August, is worth mentioning to illustrate this, despite the embarrassing situation which occurred. It concerned Perth Airport and an overzealous security guard. The Prime Minister of Malta went through the screening process and he had a mobile phone in his pocket, so he was taken aside into a private room and actually frisked by a security guard. This caused a problem. The Australian government is very serious about its obligations and responsibilities to protect foreign dignitaries from harassment or impairment of dignity, whilst at the same time Australian airlines need to maintain the highest standards of security at airports to ensure the safety and security of the travelling public, including visiting dignitaries. That issue has been rectified. It shows that our security screening is working, but perhaps in that instance things could have been managed a little better. Security at airports is, of course, of great importance at this time with so many international dignitaries and their families visiting Australia for APEC.
During the Senate inquiry into the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007, officers representing DOTARS told the committee that the amendment came about as a result of advice suggesting that Australia had not been meeting its international legal obligations in relation to the processing of visiting dignitaries. They went on to state that the changes would not involve a large number of people and that the amendment was only creating the power to grant an exemption. The fact that this power will be implemented through regulations which are yet to be drafted is of concern and, even with the department’s explanation, I know that other committee members share my concern about this amendment. Accordingly, we reported this concern in the report to the Senate, which was tabled out of session, on 30 July 2007.
The fourth amendment to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 includes minor modifications to several existing provisions and a new provision to cover interference with the operations of a security controlled airport by a person who is outside the boundary of the airport. I think this is very important as our airport boundaries seem to be becoming more and more congested, with cars unable to get parking within the airport waiting on roads outside and also with the number of buildings that are being built on airport land adjacent to the airport. This unfortunately gives a lot more cover for any person that may be going to cause disruption.
Under new section 38B, regulations will be able to be made which prescribe offences with respect to activities that cause disruption of, or interference with, aviation or airport operations within the airport. This amendment also extends the coverage of the act to disruptive actions that take place outside the boundaries of a security controlled airport. The amendment is consistent with requirements from the International Civil Aviation Organisation, of which Australia is a member. Disruptive conduct within an airport includes making remarks about bombs in baggage at check-in or screening points and leaving items of baggage or parcels unattended within a terminal building. Another issue is check-in rage, caused through huge queues at our airports, with people becoming very frustrated trying to get luggage checked in and then having to queue again to go through the security screening. The check-in situation often gets out of hand at Perth domestic airport, with so much extra activity and only two security screens operating. I congratulate the staff involved in this area for their tolerance and patience in dealing with an almost impossible task.
I note an article published by the Kalgoorlie Miner on 20 July 2007 about a study commissioned by the Queensland University of Technology in conjunction with Brisbane Airport Corporation which will analyse airport data on the efficiency of passenger screening for prohibited items. The study will investigate whether the airport staff are prone to missing security threats because of the potential for distraction in busy airport terminals. It will also look at the suitability and personalities of staff who perform these duties, which are often very long and tedious. The article states:
Brisbane Airport Corporation operations manager Stephen Goodwin said the research would help the airport better understand the effectiveness of security screening.
“The aim of the results is to provide a safer, more secure airport,” he said.
This amendment also deals with disruptive conduct outside an airport, which can include directing light-emitting devices such as laser devices into the airport through or over the top of the airport’s perimeter fence. Senator O’Brien earlier referred to an article in the Australian which said:
A QANTAS pilot has been forced to take leave after having a laser beam shone in his eyes as he was coming in to land at Sydney airport.
The incident follows reports last week of a Qantas pilot hit by a laser beam while landing at Darwin airport. Both pilots were forced to travel as passengers on their return flights.
In a separate incident, a third pilot was also hit by a laser beam while landing at Sydney on Friday night. There have been 80 reported cases this year of lasers being directed at aircraft.
So I think that, under these circumstances, these amendments are very important. It is important to note that laser beams can reach aircraft from up to five kilometres away, making it very difficult for police to catch the offenders. Under the proposed changes to the Civil Aviation Act, individuals who direct lasers at aircraft may be jailed for up to two years, which I think is very important.
—So they should be.
—During the committee’s hearing, DOTARS explained that the new section would operate within the context of existing laws which define unlawful interference with aviation. This does not include lawful advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action that does not result in or contribute to a security event. These amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 are intended to enhance the legal framework used to regulate and maintain security and safety within the Australian aviation industry.
The bill also contains two sets of amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988. Section 24 is amended to extend the offence of interfering with aircrew or endangering an aircraft or passengers to apply to a person who is outside an aircraft. As previously mentioned, there is concern in the aviation industry about the increasing incidence of lasers being used to interfere with an aircraft, particularly on approach to and on take-off from airports. The amendment to the Civil Aviation Act will mean that a person who threatens the safety of an aircraft, either by laser or by other means, will be committing an offence.
The second amendment creates a statutory framework that will permit the making of regulations for, and in relation to, the development, implementation and enforcement of drug and alcohol management plans and of drug and alcohol testing for persons who perform or are available to perform safety-sensitive aviation activities. The amendment also states that the results of drug and alcohol tests are not admissible in legal proceedings other than under the Civil Aviation Act and regulations or in other proceedings that could be prescribed in the regulations for this purpose. Under the new legislation, safety-sensitive personnel will include: flight crew; cabin crew; flight instructors; aircraft dispatchers; aircraft maintenance and repair personnel; aviation security personnel, including screeners; air traffic controllers; baggage handlers; ground refuellers; other personnel with airside access; and contractors. I believe that the aviation industry moving this way is a very strong message to contractors in other industries that they should get their acts together as well.
The new regime will consist of two components: industry and CASA. Industry participants may elect to randomly test their employees; however, it is not intended that such random testing be mandated by CASA. Rather, CASA will engage a contractor to undertake random testing on its behalf. I found it disappointing that some representatives of the aviation industry who were present at the committee hearing doubted that drug and alcohol problems were present in their industry. It is most unfortunate but it is now a reality that drugs have found their way into every section of society. No industry, group or sector is immune. After much debate and discussion, the representatives were ultimately supportive of the introduction of mandatory drug and alcohol testing throughout the Australian aviation sector, recognising that the absence of evidence does not necessarily mean there is not a problem.
After agreeing to the amendments, industry representatives made a number of comments about the practical implications of the new arrangements and the regulations which would govern the proposed regime. The Australian Federation of Air Pilots was particularly concerned with the location and timing of random tests. Testing in the aircraft, in the vicinity of the aircraft, in the gate lounge or on the tarmac would, of course, be unacceptable.
Through these amendments, the government is committed to ensuring that workers will benefit from a safer workplace knowing that their colleagues are not impaired by alcohol or drugs, and the public will benefit from a safer aviation industry. In the committee’s report to the Senate, the committee members stated that we anticipate that the drafting of regulations will be based on full consultation with all stakeholders. The successful implementation of the bill will depend largely on the extent to which concerns such as those raised by stakeholders during the inquiry are addressed. In conclusion, I would like to support the passage of this legislation, as aviation security is strengthened by these amendments without imposing significant additional costs and burdens upon the aviation industry.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-08-13,"—I too would like to address a few brief comments to the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007. Our nation’s security is an increasingly important issue. That is attested to by the fact that the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee, of which I am a member and which conducted the inquiry into this bill, increasingly seems to be spending time on hearings to do with legislation relating to security not just at airports but also on our waterfront, whereas you would normally expect the committee to deal with things of a more agricultural nature. The nation’s security is something that the Australian Labor Party takes very seriously. The introduction of this legislation is a small step in the right direction towards strengthening our nation’s safety and security. The bill contains six groups of amendments: four to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and two to the Civil Aviation Act 1988.
In 2005, several government agencies participated in a review conducted by Sir John Wheeler which culminated in the report entitled An independent review of airport security and policing for the government of Australia. The Wheeler report assessed the security of Australia’s airports and identified some areas where security could be improved. The report contained 17 recommendations, including the recommendation to review the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and relevant regulations, to ensure that the legislation encourages a culture of proactive and ongoing threat and risk assessment. Two years on, the government is beginning to implement some of those recommendations, but we have to ask: why has it taken so long, given that this is such an important issue for the nation?
I notice that the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union, which has many aviation security personnel as members, made a submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill. In that submission, the union expressed its concern with the length of time the government has taken to implement the Wheeler report recommendations. We should heed the comments of the union which represents people working at the very front line of Australia’s airport security.
While Labor welcomes the bill and will support it, I would like to take the opportunity to outline some areas of concern. The changes made to the Aviation Transport Security Act include allowing exemption for the most senior dignitaries, their spouses and minors from aviation security screening. I am aware that there needs to be a balance between security requirements and passenger movements, and our international reputation. Indeed, as Senator O’Brien pointed out in his speech in the second reading debate, we need to be mindful of our international legal obligations. No-one disputes that airport security measures can, at times, be irritating to travellers as well as sometimes mystifying in their application. I think anybody who has been through an airport knows that you never know whether you are going to be picked to have your luggage examined by Customs or not. I understand the reasons for that, but it is sometimes mystifying as to who gets picked and who does not for the various components of both security screening and Customs investigation at the airport.
However, it is possible that exemptions will cause more problems than they are intended to solve. A number of questions need to be asked and answered. Who are considered to be the most senior dignitaries? Who will determine who those people are? Where will we draw the line? At a time when airport security is of such high importance, we must consider all the possible repercussions of such a change. Adelaide Airport Ltd, along with the Australian Airports Association, do not support the exemption of certain dignitaries from aviation security screening. I commend Adelaide Airport Ltd for again taking the time to make an important submission to yet another Senate inquiry into aviation.
As those opposed to the exemption provisions stated in their submissions, if anything dangerous that could threaten the safety of those within an airport or aircraft is planted on a so-called senior dignitary, we may not have the opportunity to identify the danger before it is too late. While some may see security screening as an invasion of privacy or an irritation—an invasion that a senior dignitary should not have to endure—the security of our nation is far more important. With exemptions, we need to ask: are we creating a gap in our security, a gap which could potentially be exploited?
The second amendment to the Aviation Security Act 2004 is a result of a recommendation made in the Wheeler report. It seeks to provide ‘more effective coverage of potential acts of unlawful interference with aviation’. Part of this will be providing certain Australian Customs officers with additional powers to provide immediate response to acts that could potentially interfere with aviation. It has been proposed that those eligible Customs officers will only be able to exercise the powers when a police officer is not immediately available, when quick action is required to prevent or stop a security event or when a person believed to have been involved in a security event needs to be detained. These changes, depending on how they are executed, could improve airport security significantly.
However, concern was expressed at the Senate committee inquiry about the lack of detail provided. Adelaide Airport Ltd, as well as the Australian Airports Association, wanted more detail with regard to who would be deemed ‘eligible customs officers’. Too much in this bill has been left to prescription by regulations which the parliament has not seen. Of course, regulations are not subject to the same initial scrutiny as primary legislation.
The remaining amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 enhance the current transport security program, bringing it into line with maritime security legislation. These changes are not controversial, as they seek to improve both aviation security and the administration of transport security programs.
A much needed change to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 is the broadening of the offence of interfering with a crew member or performing an act which threatens the safety of the aircraft or a person on board. Currently, this offence is limited to persons who are on board an aircraft or within a security controlled airport. The proposed amendment will extend the coverage of the offence to include persons who are outside the aircraft and airport. As we have heard, the Senate committee heard evidence of people using lasers to interfere with aircraft, both when taking off and landing, and today there are newspaper reports of that situation happening to a pilot who was flying a plane from Canberra to Sydney last Friday. It is a very frightening development and very worrying for not just people who fly in aeroplanes but also the staff who work on them. Anything that can be done to prevent such ridiculous and dangerous behaviour needs to be done. Currently, persons who perpetrate those sorts of acts are not considered by the law to be committing an offence under the Civil Aviation Act, despite the dangers that they create. Labor welcomes the amendment, as it will increase the safety of those aboard aircrafts and within airports, and we hope that it will go some way to bringing the current situation with lasers to an end.
The second change to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 is the introduction of drug and alcohol programs among staff within the industry. Many of the submissions received by the Senate committee inquiry stated that there was little evidence of an alcohol and other drugs problem within the aviation industry. Nevertheless, such a change was still acceptable to those persons. As always, prevention is better than cure and, by creating a program designed to detect and assist those who work while under the influence, we may be preventing disasters. Safety-sensitive personnel, including the flight crew, cabin crew, flight instructors and baggage handlers, will all undergo alcohol and other drug testing. The responsibility for that testing will lie with both the civil aviation industry and CASA.
The Regional Aviation Association of Australia noted that their members with alcohol and other drug programs already in place have found the programs to be of great benefit and reported:
The alcohol and other drug programs proposed by CASA will emphasise the need for responsible behaviour in relation to the use of alcohol and other drugs, legal or otherwise, by firstly putting in place an educational and support program and also by creating the potential for offenders to be found out and removed from safety sensitive activities in the short term, and for repeat offenders, from the industry altogether. For the proposed legislation to be successful, both parts of the program are essential.
Labor will support the amendments, as we see our national security as a top priority. However, I would like it noted that we are concerned by the lack of detail made available to assist senators and members, and members of the aviation industry and the public, to consider the implications of the proposed legislation. In many respects, the bill is vague in its detail and, with so much of the detail being left to regulation, it is difficult to have complete confidence in the bill. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, of which I am also a member, has made comment about the inappropriate use of regulations and delegations in this bill and has sought advice from the minister as to the committee’s concerns.
I note that Senator O’Brien has moved an amendment on behalf of the opposition, which is an attempt to get the government to consult more widely about the implications of the bill and to monitor its implementation. Hopefully, this current government does not have much of a future. However, for the future that this government does have left, we can only hope it will make a concerted effort to draft detailed legislation so that the Senate committees and those persons and organisations that make an effort to contribute to Senate committee inquiries know exactly what they are commenting on. The impact and cost of legislation cannot be given proper consideration by committees or the Australian people if they are not given all the facts.",SENATE,<title>AVIATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-13,"—I thank members for their comments and contributions, particularly the three senators who spoke: Senator O’Brien, Senator Adams and Senator McEwen, and I thank the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport for its thoughtful attention to the input on the Aviation Legislation Amendment (2007 Measures No. 1) Bill 2007, particularly in relation to the screening and clearing of dignitaries, and its consideration of a proposed new section for interference with the operations of a security controlled airport by a person outside the boundary of the airport—and we have heard about the irresponsible use of lasers. Aviation security is a high priority for this government and is under constant review to ensure that the regulatory framework is responsive to changing threats to the Australian aviation industry.
This bill makes the amendments that are necessary to aviation legislation to better manage these threats. The amendments in this bill are the result of both industry suggestion and government administrative experience. There are four significant amendments in the bill. The Aviation and Transport Security Act is amended so that regulations can be made to prohibit activities or conduct taking place outside airport boundaries that disrupt or interfere with the operations of a security controlled airport such as, as I have mentioned, shining a laser through the airport fence at an aircraft. The amendment will also provide a clearer basis for prohibiting conduct within an airport that can lead to serious disruption such as leaving baggage unattended in a public area of the airport. The new regulation-making power does not extend to disruptive activity that forms part of the normal or usual operations of the airport or airline as a place of business, such as lawful industrial action by airport or airline employees.
The amendment to aviation security screening exemptions for some dignitaries reflects a balance between Australia’s international legal obligations and security outcomes. The amendment will also provide flexibility to exempt dignitaries, most, if not all, of whom would be expected to enjoy privileges and immunities under international treaty obligations. The actual list of persons who might be exempt will be determined by government following consultation and advice from relevant agencies. It is not intended that people with celebrity status would be exempt from aviation screening.
Importantly, an airline still has the ultimate right to determine which passengers it will carry and under what conditions. Also, the Aviation Transport Security Act now contains further powers for Australian Customs officers at airports and implements one of the recommendations from the aviation security report by Sir John Wheeler. The first amendment to the Civil Aviation Act covers dangerous acts committed by a person on the ground or on board an aircraft, having particular regard to the direction of laser beams at aircraft. The second amendment to the Civil Aviation Act provides new powers to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to enable it to implement a new drug and alcohol regime for the civil aviation sector. This amendment will provide safety benefits for both aviation workers and the broader community by appropriately addressing the risks of impaired aviation personnel. Lastly, there are also amendments to the Aviation Transport Security Act that include enhancements to the transport security program regime. These amendments are consistent with the requirements contained in the maritime regime. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2007-08-13,"—The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 amends the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to provide for the testing of prospective applicants for Australian citizenship by conferral. The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 requires that applicants for citizenship (1) understand the nature of their application, (2) possess a basic knowledge of the English language and (3) have an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. The bill provides that these applicants must have successfully completed a test before making an application for citizenship to demonstrate that they meet the requirements. Labor supports the principle of formalising the testing system which is currently in place for citizenship. The issue is whether it is reasonable.
Labor’s concerns were pursued by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its inquiry into the bill, and I note the committee’s recently tabled report. Resolving the matters relating to section 23A is essential to the credibility of the legislation. Labor supports the outcomes of the committee and the amendments proposed by the government.
Australia already has a citizenship test. In 1948 the status of Australian citizenship was established. The process for obtaining citizenship was arduous. Applicants had to have lived in Australia for at least five years. They also had to have adequate English, show that they were loyal and of good character, produce three references and declare an intention to naturalise two years before the application. In addition to this, applicants had to place an advertisement in the newspapers notifying others of their intention to become an Australian citizen.
Of course, the nature and veracity of the rules for citizenship have changed over the years. Today, applicants must attend a compulsory interview and establish that they are of good character. The interviewer, who is an officer of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, does the following things: check the written application and personal documents; assess whether the applicant understands the nature of the application; assess whether the applicant has an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship; and assess whether the applicant has a basic knowledge of the English language.
Looking at the public debate that has gone on concerning the introduction of a citizenship test, it is easy for us to think that we have a bill that involves drastic change from current practice. While there were genuine expectations that significant change would be in the legislation, it is difficult to see the bill which is now before the parliament as continuing the sort of radical change from current practice which each side of the debate has implied it would see.
In the context of this debate, we have often questioned whether it is possible to have any sort of test for citizenship and whether it is possible to ever clearly identify Australian values. One of the arguments we often hear against there being any concept of Australian values is that these values are those that you will find in any one of a number of countries. In many respects that is true. But the fact that other nations may have similar values to our own does not prevent there being certain principles about which we can say, ‘Yes, that is part of being Australian.’ We can often identify Australian values more easily by what they are not. Values are not static, and the values and principles that characterise us do change over time.
In February 2000, the Citizenship Council attempted to summarise what those principles might be in an Australian compact. They referred to a commitment to the land; a commitment to the rule of law; a commitment to equality under the law, regardless of race and sex; and a commitment to the basics of a representative liberal democracy, including freedom of opinion. The council also referred to a commitment to principles of fairness, to tolerance, to the acceptance of cultural diversity, to the wellbeing of all Australians and to recognising the unique status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Those principles all fit with our discussion about what it means to be Australian. This set of values will be fluid and change from time to time, but we do not do our nation any harm by having and embracing the values debate and by associating it with full membership of our society through Australian citizenship.
The proposed citizenship test changes the current testing arrangements to a more formalised model. There have, in fact, always been tests imposed, and this is why the argument about today’s changes being radical does not really take account of what has happened since we introduced Australian citizenship in 1948. The existing test for citizenship has been quite non-controversial and there have not been any arguments about needing it to be abolished. This creates some questions as to why this legislation is said to be some sort of radical change. The more you look at the bill and at the minister’s second reading speech, the more you see that what we actually have before us is a formalising of the current system. It may involve a toughening of the current test, but not necessarily. It depends on the determinations that the minister makes. Also, those determinations can be changed at any point, with any extra number of exemptions that the minister might choose to put in place.
The bill will amend the act to require applicants for Australian citizenship under the general eligibility provisions to have successfully completed a citizenship test before making an application in order to be eligible to become Australian citizens. Successful completion of a test will demonstrate that applicants (1) understand the nature of the application, (2) possess a basic knowledge of the English language and (3) have an adequate knowledge of Australia and of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. A person sitting a test may be required to satisfy eligibility criteria to be able to sit a citizenship test. These criteria may include requirements that a person is a permanent resident and satisfies the minister of the person’s identity.
To date, test questions have not been made public and the source document from which the test questions will be drawn is not yet available. I note the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs expressed disappointment that the proposed resource booklet had not been finalised and made publicly available. This means we have been asked to vote on a bill which is entirely ‘shell’ legislation. As a result, it has proven difficult to comment on the nature and content of the proposed test. We do not expect that the government is going to put each question from a test into legislation, but the answer to the question ‘Is the test reasonable?’ will have to be determined at a later date.
This legislation deals with two questions. It deals with whether, in principle, there should be a test or not, and whether, in principle, the minister should have the discretion to create exemptions to take into account different circumstances. These issues are not outrageous. As to whether there should be a test at all, the answer is yes. Should the minister have the discretion to provide extra exemptions? The logical answer to that is yes again. That is reasonable. There is already a test and it has never been controversial. We have yet to hear anybody argue that the current test is an outrageous restriction on people’s citizenship. It would be quite open for the minister to determine that one of the options is for the current test to continue.
What really matters is that we end up with a reasonable test. We do not want this to end up being some bizarre game of trivia. We do not want this to be something which sets up people to fail. We do not want this to be a barrier to people who would make fine Australian citizens. Whether it ends up that way or not, we cannot tell from this bill. All we can tell is that the principle of having a citizenship test, which has been with us since 1949, would remain. That is a completely reasonable principle, and that is all the bill actually reveals. If, in good faith, that is what materialises, we simply have a codification of a reasonable system. Of course, it is quite within the realms of possibility and certainly within the realms of legislative options for the government to come up with something less reasonable. Given the level of community disquiet about the questions that might be included in a citizenship test, the government should make the test questions public in order to provide additional reassurance to those concerned. It would also help to ensure accountability of the proposed regime. I think that, as a matter of transparency, the government making the questions available is completely in the interests of citizenship being a process of unifying Australians. It is a logical thing to do and it is in the interests of the government to do so.
The minister has a large degree of discretion to approve more than one test and exemptions from the test, as I mentioned. These exemptions will include people under the age of 18 or over 60 and those with permanent physical or mental incapacity which prevents them from understanding the nature of their application. The main test will be computer based and consist of 20 multiple-choice questions drawn randomly from a large pool of confidential questions. Each test is expected to include three questions on the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. The pass mark is expected to be 60 per cent, including a requirement to answer the three mandatory questions correctly. A person will be able to take the test as many times as necessary in order to pass. Once an applicant has passed the test then they can apply for citizenship, at which point a fee will be paid.
At his briefing on the legislation, our shadow minister Tony Burke raised two questions for the department. The first was: ‘Will ministerial determinations— for example, of what the different exemptions are for the different tests—be made public, even if the questions are not made public?’ The second question was: ‘Will the government guarantee that it will not put exemptions on tests which then create a situation where someone who otherwise would have been eligible to sit for a citizenship test has no test available to them anymore?’ The minister’s office has responded to these two important matters in writing. Determinations of this nature will be made public and the test will be used only in such a way as to guarantee that anyone who under the act would expect to be able to sit for a test will have a test available for them. Contrary to many assumptions made in the public debate about the citizenship test, there will not be a separate English-language test. A person’s English-language skills will be assessed on their ability to successfully complete the test in English.
It was reported to me that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship mentioned in his second reading speech some of the concerns about the options for people who have difficulty with English literacy. To Labor, this is a very important part of the debate and a very important issue. The government, with the support of the opposition, has made decisions on the humanitarian program to find some of the most desperate people in the world and offer them a better life here in Australia. Labor has not always provided bipartisan support for the quality of the settlement programs subsequently offered, but there has certainly been bipartisan support for the selection of people, done in consultation with the UNHCR. Australia’s humanitarian program has seen increasing numbers of people settling permanently in Australia who not only do not have literacy in English but do not have literacy in their language of origin. To expect that, in the space of four years, someone in those circumstances would be able to sit in front of a computer reading English well enough to pass a multiple-choice test is highly unreasonable.
The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs also acknowledges concerns about the potential impact of citizenship testing on certain groups within society, especially refugee and humanitarian entrants. I am reassured by the evidence from the department that the regime will be monitored on an ongoing basis and that the minister will have discretion to approve different tests designed on the basis of identified need. However, Labor supports the Senate committee’s view that in addition to this ongoing monitoring a more formal and comprehensive review of the citizenship-testing regime should be conducted three years after the commencement of the regime. In particular, this review should examine the regime’s impact on the citizenship application and conferral rates of certain groups within society such as refugee and humanitarian entrants, women, and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. This is a recommendation that Labor fully supports, and to this end I foreshadow an amendment along these lines in the committee stage of this bill.
In his second reading speech the minister flagged that, in special cases where a person does not have the literacy skills required to complete the test, the test will be done through a conversation. It is proposed that the test administrator will read out the questions and possible answers to the person. Again, we want this test to be something that is not used in a fashion that sets people up to fail. Citizenship is the common bond that unites individuals in their mutual commitment to Australia and is a central element to integrating and including new migrants so they can fully participate in the Australian community.
Labor notes with concern a great deal of emphasis being placed on the citizenship test rather than on the support services and community initiatives that are critical to building an integrated and inclusive society. Labor believes it is essential that you do not just test but also teach. There has to be adequate funding for the Adult Migrant English Program. There has to be adequate funding for settlement services so that people who come to Australia with the least opportunity and the least advantage do not find themselves in circumstances where it will always be extremely difficult for them to take on their roles as full members of Australian society. To this end, settlement services must be flexible and take account of the specific needs of our new arrivals.
Learning English is critical to the successful settlement of new arrivals, and we see it as the key to integration in the social and economic mainstream of Australian society and becoming an Australian citizen. Because we recognise that the strength and the success of the citizenship test lie in its ability to promote community inclusion and provide opportunities for people to fully engage with life in Australia, we will ensure that citizenship is not a discouraging and daunting process for new Australians. We will support the test and, in doing so, we will recognise the importance of teaching in the development of English language skills and the acquisition of knowledge of Australian history, culture and values.
A Rudd Labor government will provide for the teaching of English and citizenship. To that end, Labor’s shadow minister Mr Burke moved a second reading amendment outlining our approach. Since the shadow minister’s second reading amendment was moved back in June, Labor has announced a new initiative to improve English language services and assist migrants to fully participate in the Australian community. Labor will improve the Adult Migrant English Program to assist migrants to achieve functional English and pass the citizenship test. A Rudd Labor government will offer a new traineeship to migrants in Australia and introduce a new-style Adult Migrant English Program to help migrants learn English and fully participate in the Australian community. I note that government figures show that in 2005 only 11 per cent of people exited the Adult Migrant English Program with the ability to speak functional English. Labor would put an end to this one-size-fits-all English-training model for migrants. We have committed a total of $49.2 million to fix the Howard government’s English training program and to assist new arrivals to find employment as soon as possible.
The government has allowed the Adult Migrant English Program to become stale and outdated. The immigration program has changed significantly over the past decade. As we have mentioned, we now have many migrants coming to Australia who have never been to school and who are not literate in their own languages. The government’s policies continue to see new arrivals who have received university education being treated the same as those who cannot even write in their own languages. This policy continues to disadvantage many people. We know from the statistics I mentioned that up to nine out of 10 people are leaving this English language tuition without basic English. It is disheartening that government policy is failing these people, who are often most in need of settlement assistance in our community. There should not be any barriers for new arrivals who want to learn English and get a job.
Labor wants people, when they come to Australia, to have the opportunity to get the job they want. That is why we have announced the new traineeship—so that new arrivals can learn. Specifically, we will assist new arrivals to make the transition to employment. Our Adult Migrant English Program will have more emphasis on vocational English to better enable new entrants to apply for a job and work in an Australian workplace. Labor’s plan to teach, not just test, English will include a traineeship in English and work readiness. This will be designed to allow new entrants to continue their English language tuition while developing knowledge, skills and experience in Australian workplace culture and practices. These traineeships will focus on English language and working in Australia, and $9.2 million of the $49.2 million has been set aside for this purpose. The key to a successful language program is also flexibility. In Labor’s new Employment Pathways Program, extra English language tuition hours will be able to be allocated to those students most in need, and $40 million has been committed to setting up this important program.
Labor supports a citizenship test but will provide for the teaching of English and citizenship. Labor will improve the Adult Migrant English Program to assist migrants to achieve functional English so they can fully participate in the Australian community and pass the citizenship test. Finally, Labor is committed to celebrating the diversity of all Australians in an inclusive society with shared values. Successful integration and Australian citizenship are, after all, central to building a stronger community.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-08-13,"—I stand today to support the government’s Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007. I particularly commend the minister for his efforts in proceeding with this legislation. Also, as Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I note that we have brought down a report, dated July 2007, on this particular bill. I will refer in part to that report during my response in the debate on the second reading today. I also want to acknowledge the minister’s response to that report and the recommendations in it and thank the minister and the government for those thoughtful responses.
I would like to commend the report to the Senate and draw it to their attention. In particular I want to thank my Senate colleagues who are part of that committee. I also specifically want to thank the secretariat—Jackie Morris, and in this instance Terry Brown, Sophie Power and Judith West—for their support and assistance in preparing that report.
The legislation was referred to the Senate committee on 13 June 2007 with report by 31 July 2007. We had two hearings, one in Canberra and one in Sydney, on 16 and 17 July this year. We received some 59 submissions. They were thoughtful and well-researched submissions. The witnesses that appeared at both the Canberra and the Sydney hearings were certainly well prepared, and we had some constructive discussion and debate and question-and-answer sessions. I want to thank all the witnesses that appeared and presented from all sides of the equation. I thank them for the assistance they have given senators in preparing the report and now allowing that information to be available to the public.
As for the background, on 11 December last year the government announced that it would introduce a test for certain applicants for Australian citizenship. The announcement followed a consultation process conducted by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, now the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. That consultation process began on 17 September last year, and I would like to share that in the context of the overall debate concerning what we are looking at today in this bill.
There has been a lot of discussion, debate and consultation on the concepts and the objectives of this bill to date. It has been extensive. In fact, in the consultation period closing on 17 November 2006, there were 1,644 written responses, with 1,486 from individuals and 158 from organisations. An assessment made by the department indicated that there was some 60 per cent support for the government’s plans to introduce such a test. As for public support, the Australian newspaper on 1 January 2007 found that 85 per cent of respondents were in favour of the knowledge of English being a requirement to become an Australian citizen, and another poll, conducted in September last year, found that 77 per cent of respondents favoured a citizenship test.
As a Senate committee we looked at some overseas experience, including that in Canada, the Netherlands, the UK, the USA and South Korea. We noted that they had similar testing regimes and formal testing arrangements for citizenship. Four of the countries we considered in detail in the discussion paper were Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. They test for knowledge of their countries and they also test for language skills. Likewise, the legislation before us has a test of knowledge of Australia and the Australian way of life and the values that we hold in this country. There is also a test for English language skills.
A formal citizenship test is a way of ensuring that migrants are fully ready to participate in the Australian community. That is a key ingredient, the foundational thesis that the government stands upon. It is also important from a broader perspective as it will support social cohesion and social integration in the community. It is designed so that applicants can demonstrate their knowledge of the English language and of Australia, including knowledge of their responsibilities and privileges, as citizenship bestows both responsibilities and privileges.
Migrants have come to Australia from more than 200 countries around the world. They include people of the Judaeo-Christian heritage and culture, like ours, and systems of government from the Western liberal democratic tradition, like Australia’s, along with people from other cultures and traditions. That is why Australia is a multicultural society. Our diversity is part of the rich tapestry of Australia today.
Migrants who come to Australia in the future, whether under a skilled, family or humanitarian program, will not be required to pass the test prior to or upon their arrival. They will only need to pass it when wishing to take up citizenship of Australia, which will usually be some four or more years later. I want to make that point: this is not something that needs to be done before arriving in Australia; it is obviously something that is done when applying for citizenship.
As for eligibility criteria, the person must be a permanent resident. They must be able to be satisfactorily identified. The person must provide a photograph of his or her face and shoulders or allow such a photograph to be taken. The government recognises that it would be unnecessary and unfair for some people to comply with these requirements. Consequently, this is the reason the legislation is designed to allow people under the age of 18 or over 60, those with a permanent physical or mental incapacity which prevents them from understanding the nature of their application, and those with a permanent loss or substantial impairment of hearing, speech or sight not to be required to sit that particular test.
The report is now on the public record. The explanatory memorandum to the legislation makes it clear that the estimated cost to implement and administer a citizenship test is $17.4 million over a five-year period. We noted in our report the second reading speech of the minister when he said:
The test will encourage prospective citizens to obtain the knowledge they need to support successful integration into Australian society. The citizenship test will provide them with the opportunity to demonstrate in an objective way that they have the required knowledge of Australia, including the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, and a basic knowledge and comprehension of English.
It is noted that citizenship confers not only certain privileges but responsibilities. I refer to the debate that we had before our committee about the importance of citizenship. Several submissions and witnesses pointed out the importance of citizenship for access to certain basic rights, including the right to vote, to apply for an Australian passport, to access certain financial assistance from the government and employment opportunities, and freedom from deportation under the Migration Act. For refugee and humanitarian entrants, the right to apply for a passport can be one of the most important practical benefits of citizenship as it can assist in reunification with family members. Last month, Michael Ferguson and I attended a citizenship ceremony in Launceston, conducted by the mayor, Ivan Dean, and I was delighted to have the honour of being with some friends from South Africa whom I had assisted. As a family, they were so proud to be standing there to become citizens of Australia, some years after their arrival in this country. They were very proud indeed, along with the many other Australians who had had citizenship conferred on them. I know that Michael Ferguson gave his encouragement and congratulations to those new citizens on that day, as he does at most of the citizenship ceremonies held in Launceston.
The committee accepted the department’s evidence that the proposed citizenship testing regime would be more objective than the current system of an informal interview. This is a key point to come out of the debate that we had before the committee—that we needed an objective test—and that is why we looked at international comparisons with the US, the UK, the Netherlands, South Korea et cetera. An objective test applies overseas, and it will now apply here in Australia, subject to the passing of this legislation. The committee considered that the proposed test would encourage prospective citizens to familiarise themselves with Australian society and would, therefore, help them to integrate and participate in Australian society.
As I indicated earlier, we are pleased that there has been considerable public support for the government’s plan to introduce this legislation. We also welcomed the department’s evidence and advice to our committee that it will monitor and evaluate the regime on an ongoing basis. We saw that as important, and we put forward a recommendation in our report that there be a review after three years to assess the impact of the test on citizenship application and conferral rates on certain groups in society, particularly the refugee and humanitarian entrants. We received a number of submissions from, and had views expressed by, humanitarian and refugee interest groups. They expressed legitimate concerns, but, on balance, we have recommended support for the bill, subject to that advice and those recommendations. We particularly appreciated the evidence of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission; theirs was a very thoughtful submission indeed.
I draw the attention of the Senate to the views of the department, and the views of the Australian Christian Lobby, which were put to us by David Yates on their behalf. There was some discussion and debate, including questions from Labor senators, as to why Australia’s Judaeo-Christian ethic is important in understanding being a citizen here in Australia. There was some discussion during the inquiry about the extent to which the Judaeo-Christian heritage should be acknowledged and reflected in the proposed test. The Centre for Human Rights Education at the Curtin University of Technology said:
The Centre is concerned of reports that the test will be focused on applicants demonstrating an understanding of “Judeo-Christian” values and British/Western traditions. Such values and traditions do not necessarily reflect the multicultural composition of Australia ...
However, the Australian Christian Lobby told the committee:
ACL strongly supports the Minister’s comments that applicants should be required to acknowledge Australia’s Judeo-Christian heritage. This does not require prospective citizens to share the Judeo-Christian faith, but it would make it clear that their new country’s historical context is Judeo-Christian, rather than of any other faith or ideology.
The committee asked the department whether it would be desirable in the test to include questions about Australia’s Judaeo-Christian heritage. In response, a departmental witness said, ‘Part of Australia and its history would go to our belief system, so I imagine that that is an area that will be covered in the resource book.’ Of course it will be, and I look forward to that. I commend the Australian Christian Lobby and Jim Wallace for his leadership of that organisation and note that, together with them, I hosted a forum here in Parliament House on the importance of Australia’s Christian heritage, highlighting its importance not only for the past history of Australia but for present-day Australians. The committee noted its disappointment that the resource book was not available at the time of the hearing, nor was it at the time of the production of the committee’s report. The minister has responded to our recommendations. We made four, including a recommendation that the bill be passed.
Before touching on that, I note that
Senator Lundy talked about the importance of appropriate English-as-a-second-language support being provided by the government for potential applicants. We agree that it is important, and that is why the Australian government has committed considerable resources to this area, as is noted in our report. The department gave evidence on this issue and recognised that the government was already devoting considerable resources, including in English language training programs such as the Adult Migrant English Program, and in settlement programs, particularly for refugee and humanitarian entrants. Considerable resources across the whole-of-government—across portfolio areas—have been put towards ensuring that there are adequate opportunities for training and for learning the English language.
In terms of the government’s response to our recommendations, I note that government amendments have been put before the Senate. Firstly, one of the amendments, relating to proposed new section 23A(1), makes it clear that a test must relate to the eligibility criteria in new paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of proposed new section 21(2) in the bill. Secondly, there is a note after proposed new section 23A(3) to make it clear that eligibility criteria for sitting a test cannot be inconsistent with the act and, in particular, with section 21(2).
The first note is in response to the concern of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that new section 23A(1) is ambiguous and that an amendment was needed to clarify that a citizenship test would relate only to the eligibility criteria in proposed new paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of section 21(2). Proposed new paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of section 21(2) require that applicants understand the nature of their application to become an Australian citizen, possess a basic knowledge of the English language and have an adequate knowledge of Australia and of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship.
The second note responds to the concerns that the determination-making power in proposed new section 23A of the bill is too broad and would allow the minister to set eligibility criteria for sitting a test that are inconsistent with the act and, in particular, inconsistent with the general eligibility criteria for citizenship in proposed new section 21(2) of the bill.
I put on the record my sincere thanks to the minister and his officers for considering the report, reviewing the recommendations and responding accordingly. I am very supportive of this legislation. I think it is foundational legislation for Australia and for its citizens.
In conclusion, I thank all of my colleagues on the legal and constitutional affairs committee for their support, efforts and deliberations on this matter. I particularly thank the secretariat, led by Jackie Morris, and I commend the legislation to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-08-13,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007. As we have heard, the bill seeks to amend the Australian Citizenship Act by requiring prospective applicants for Australian citizenship who meet the eligibility criteria to successfully complete a citizenship test before they are conferred with Australian citizenship. As Senator Barnett mentioned, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs conducted an inquiry into this legislation, held public hearings during July and tabled our report on 31 July 2007. Labor have indicated that we will support the passage of this legislation through the Senate, and Senator Lundy foreshadowed an amendment which we will be moving to the bill.
In the time that I have available today, I would like to address some of the concerns that were raised by witnesses about the bill during the Senate inquiry. In the matters canvassed during the Senate inquiry, legitimate concerns were raised about the purpose, nature and content of the citizenship test and its potential impact in operation, which, in my view, must be carefully monitored and reviewed once the test is introduced.
There is no doubt that Australian citizenship is highly valued by those who are fortunate enough to obtain it. Since the enactment of the Citizenship Act in 1949, over four million people have been conferred with Australian citizenship, and there are currently close to one million permanent residents who are eligible to obtain citizenship status. What comes with taking that final step from residency to citizenship is a person’s acknowledgement and acceptance of an extra set of privileges and responsibilities. Australian citizens may reside freely in Australia, hold an Australian passport, vote, serve in the armed forces, work in the public sector, stand for parliament and seek diplomatic assistance when overseas.
The current eligibility provisions for a citizenship applicant under the act require the applicant to have an understanding of the nature of their application for citizenship and a basic knowledge of the English language. The legislation before us today inserts an additional requirement that applicants for Australian citizenship must have an adequate knowledge of Australia and of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. The bill proposes that these criteria be fulfilled by the successful completion of the citizenship test approved by the minister. The explanatory memorandum states:
There is no other way for these criteria to be satisfied, other than by successfully completing a test.
The necessity for this requirement of the citizenship test was the main consideration at the hearings held by the Senate committee. A number of witnesses queried whether a citizenship test was a necessary addition to current citizenship arrangements. The committee received a number of submissions which questioned the need for the test and also questioned whether there was any evidence that demonstrated a need to change the current citizenship law. For example, the Centre for Human Rights Education at Curtin University of Technology submitted to the committee that the current citizenship ceremony and concomitant pledge are sufficient to indicate a person’s commitment to Australia and the community. The Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University submitted that now there is a lesser need for a formal testing arrangement, given the requirement that a permanent resident, before applying for citizenship, must have lived in the country for a period of four years.
It remains to be seen what a formal test will add to the integration of new migrants into the Australian community. It is said that one of the aims of the test is to achieve a more inclusive society. The explanatory memorandum states:
The introduction of a citizenship test is a key part of the Government’s ongoing commitment to help migrants successfully integrate into the Australian community.
However, the test, by its very nature, is a very exclusionary measure for achieving this aim. By their very nature, tests are designed to be passed or failed.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-08-13,"—My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is the minister aware that today’s statement on monetary policy by the Reserve Bank expresses serious concerns about inflation, stating that ‘inflation appears likely to be somewhat higher than earlier expected’? Doesn’t the Reserve Bank statement note that this means that ‘further monetary policy tightening could be required’? Can the minister confirm that this means that further interest rate hikes could occur in coming months, on top of the five increases that have already occurred since the Liberal government promised it would ‘keep interest rates at record lows’?

Doesn’t the Reserve Bank statement on monetary policy make it clear the government has lost control of inflation?

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-08-13,"—I thank Senator Sherry for his question, and welcome him back and hope he has fully recovered. I have not had the opportunity to read the full statement on monetary policy but the Reserve Bank, in its charter, as Senator Sherry would know, is charged with ensuring that inflation remains in the band of two to three per cent. As I said in this place last week, the Reserve Bank, in making its decision to increase rates by another quarter of a per cent, made the point that the primary cause of that is the inherent strength of the Australian economy. Demand is strong, we have had some 16 years of continuous growth and we have unemployment at record lows. We have a very strong economy, and that is why the Reserve Bank in its wisdom has decided to bump up rates by another quarter of a per cent. That is consistent with its obligation to keep inflation in that two to three per cent band, and that is where we want inflation to stay.
As I said last week, the great thing about our period in government is that inflation has averaged 2.5 per cent, in contrast with the average rate of inflation under the previous Labor government of 5.2 per cent—more than double the rate of inflation that we have experienced under our government. It is the Reserve’s charter to ensure that it stays well below the rate that we experienced under the Labor Party. Of course, all the levers under our control are set to low inflation. We have restored the health of Commonwealth finances. We are running consistently strong surpluses of one per cent of GDP. We have paid off all of Labor’s debts so that we are not paying any interest on the debt any longer. We have reformed industrial relations to ensure that we do not get the sort of wage-price inflation that we experienced under the Labor Party.
If Senator Sherry is so concerned about inflation and its impact on interest rates then he should be working inside the Labor Party to ensure that it abandons immediately the idiotic ACTU policy it has been forced to adopt with respect to industrial relations. There is no doubt whatsoever that, if we go back to pre-Keating-era arrangements with respect to industrial relations, that will have a devastating effect on inflation in this country and, therefore, flow-on effects for interest rates and consequential devastating effects for Australian small businesses and Australian families, who will as a result of such a policy see a return to high unemployment, high inflation and high interest rates.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Interest Rates</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2007-08-13,"—I do not exactly recall the 1995 statement, but I accept the veracity of Senator Hurley’s statement. It is something that, logically, a Liberal leader would say, because one of the great things about the Liberal Party is that we are very dedicated to ensuring that the maximum number of Australians are able to own their own home. That is why our policies, since we came into office in 1996, have been directed to ensuring that real wages continue to grow—and they have grown by 20.8 per cent—and to ensuring that we get unemployment low to ensure that the maximum number of Australians can have a job if they want a job. The only way you can afford to own a home is to have a job, and we have unemployment down to 4.3 per cent—levels undreamed of under the Labor Party. That is why we have been dedicated to eliminating deficits, returning the budget to surplus and getting rid of the Labor Party’s debt. All our policies are dedicated to ensuring that we create circumstances in which the maximum number of Australians are able to aspire to own their own home. The rate of home ownership in this country does remain, internationally, at very high levels. The rate of home ownership in this country is remarkably stable. About a third of people have paid off their home, about a third are paying off their home and about a third of people rent. Those levels have been remarkably stable throughout our period in office.

Senator Conroy interjecting—

—What the senator is referring to really is the fact that, despite all our good policies, or maybe partly as a consequence of the strong economic growth this country has had, there has been the interaction of demand and supply for housing which has forced housing prices up. It is a fact that the price of housing has increased. Why has the price of housing increased? Well, demand has obviously risen because we have low inflation and we have had relatively low interest rates under our period in office. We have had an extraordinarily strong economy and very high confidence at consumer and residential level which gives consumers the confidence to borrow funds to invest in their own housing. The problem with the housing market is that you do not have an adequate supply response to the obvious increase in demand. Why don’t we have a supply response? Because guess who controls the supply of land? State and local governments—we have six state Labor governments who control the supply of housing.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—Order! Senators on my left will come to order.
—For those in the opposition who are concerned about the cost of housing, all you have to do is ring the six state Labor premiers and say, ‘Hey guys, how about releasing a bit more land?’ That is the secret to ensuring that the supply of land matches the increase in the demand for housing. The fact is that urban Australia occupies 0.3 per cent of the land mass of this country. Why is it then that, in a country like ours, we have shortages of land supply? It is because, primarily, the state Labor governments are artificially restricting the supply of land to the market, and they have the appalling contradictory position of being involved financially in this. In my own state of South Australia, they have a land corporation which profits from withholding land and forcing up the price so that they can profit from it. It is the most extraordinary contradiction in terms that I have ever seen.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2007-08-13,"—I move:

That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance and Administration (Senator Minchin) to questions without notice asked today.

Over the last week, and before that of course, the Labor opposition has been focusing on the recent increase in interest rates. Last week we saw the fifth increase in interest rates since the last election. Today, yet again—although I was not here last week—I thought we saw from Senator Minchin, in the responses he gave, an example of how, after 11 years in government, this government and particularly the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, are so stale and out of touch with the Australian people. Frankly, ‘dribble’ would be the best description of the response coming from Senator Minchin’s lips in terms of argument to justify the five increases in interest rates that we have seen since the promise made by Senator Minchin and the Liberal government at the last election that they would keep interest rates at record lows. It is a quote from Liberal Party advertising at the last election that they would keep interest rates at ‘record lows’.
Senator Minchin made the amazing claim today that upward pressure on interest rates would occur as a result of Labor policy to abolish Work Choices. I would point out that since Work Choices was introduced there have been four increases in interest rates; four of the last five increases in interest rates have occurred since Work Choices was introduced. So if correlation were causation then it is Work Choices itself, the government’s very own legislative agenda and radical and unfair industrial relations changes, that have increased interest rates. We have seen four of those interest rate increases since Work Choices was introduced.
The question I pose today to Senator Minchin relates to this morning’s statement by the Reserve Bank. I think Australians cannot but be concerned about the observations made by the Reserve Bank, which expressed serious concern about inflation. It stated this morning that inflation appears likely to be somewhat higher than earlier expected. If inflation trends are going up—and they are—this very definitely places upward pressure on interest rates, despite the commitment by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, at the last election, through the advertising that was conducted by the Liberal government, that it would keep interest rates at record lows. Of course we do not have interest rates at record lows any more. It is a matter of fact that interest rates are not at record lows. When we look at the cost of purchasing a house in dollar terms today we find that families need to earn seven times the average yearly wage to purchase a house. Ten years ago, or in 1996, it required four times the average yearly wage to purchase a house. Since the last election we have seen five interest rate increases, despite the commitment by the Prime Minister and the Liberal government that they would keep interest rates at record lows.
We had another interesting reference this morning by the Prime Minister to the Liberal Party advertising that it would keep interest rates at record lows. On the radio this morning Mr Howard finally admitted that Liberal Party advertising at the last election had included that commitment of keeping interest rates at record lows. Until now the Prime Minister has claimed that what he said was different from Liberal Party advertising. He has tried to make out that the Liberal Party advertising campaign at the last election—even though it said ‘keeping interest rates at record lows’—was not Mr Howard’s commitment and that somehow they were different. That is an absurd argument. He finally fessed up this morning when he acknowledged that the TV ad did make the promise that interest rates would be kept at record lows. Rather astoundingly he went on and said, ‘Look, that did appear in an ad, which I understand disappeared after the first week.’ I have got news for the Prime Minister: that ad is still on the Liberal Party website.

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2007-08-13,"—It seems that, as we get closer to this election, the sloganeering from those opposite becomes shriller and the arguments that they use become less and less connected with the facts. The fact is that Australian home ownership is still very much within the sights and capacity of Australian families. Despite the increase in the cost of housing, other things such as increased take-home pay and the increasingly effective social safety net have retained the capacity of Australians to afford home ownership.
We need to look beyond the sloganeering to see what is actually being done by the Labor Party to people’s confidence in their capacity to purchase their own home. Australians retain an interest in purchasing a home and they retain great confidence in their ability to do so. That is why Australians are prepared to put so much more of their household disposable income each month into their mortgage repayments. They have confidence in the economy of Australia to be able to sustain the jobs that they are in and the spending power that they have to go out there and purchase a home.
The Labor Party purports to be the great saviours of Australians when it comes to home ownership. They have picked up with their polling that people are concerned about the cost of housing and of other things and so they start to parrot the lines that there is some kind of problem and that somehow these things are slipping out of people’s reach. The question needs to be asked: what would the Australian Labor Party do to keep interest rates low? Let us put aside the evidence of what actually happened when Labor was last in office. We know what happened when they were in office. We know how hard it was for Australians to afford homes when interest rates hit 17 per cent. Let us assume that they have repented of that policy somehow—
—That’s a tall order!
—It is a tall order to believe that, Senator Parry notes, but let us assume that they have changed their policy. What do they believe today? We do not know much about what Labor believes when it comes to economic management or budgeting. We had the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer telling us last week that there was not a sliver of sunlight between their budgeting policies and ours these days, that our policies are so close together, that they are complete fiscal conservatives and that you do not have to worry about any change of government as a result of that.
Again, let us put aside the evidence that, as we put in place all of the policies over the last 11 years to get to the stage where we have such a strong economy, such high employment and such low unemployment, and such relatively low interest rates, the Labor Party opposed all of those measures. They absolutely and utterly fought against every one of the measures we put in place to create the economic circumstances where Australians have confidence in their future. Let us put all of that aside and ask ourselves: what is it exactly that they would do?
We do not know what the Labor Party would do. We do not know what differences there would be in their policies. We do know that while this government has been pursuing these policies and lowering taxes at the same time state Labor governments have been doing something quite different. State Labor governments have been increasing taxes and charges on Australian families, increasing things like household rates and other pressures on Australian families. They have increased the cost of transport and they have increased all sorts of burdens that families have to meet. To a large extent it is true to say that, as the federal government has been taking that burden off Australian families with reduced taxation, state governments including local government have been putting that burden back on. So if there is pressure on Australian families we need to ask ourselves: where exactly is that coming from? I think we need to look very carefully at what contribution state governments have been making to the pressures on Australian families.
We know from evidence produced only in the last couple of days that Australians are not convinced that the Labor Party has the answers when it comes to interest rates. I note from the polling that was published only today that 31 per cent of Australians believe that there would be higher interest rates under a Labor government. I think that shows great perspicacity on their part to determine what kind of policy the Labor Party would produce. Even though they have not put any details of that policy on the table, why did Australians think that? The evidence is what Labor did only 11 short years ago. That is the indication of what would happen under Labor. That is why they cannot be believed on this question of producing lower interest rates. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2007-08-13,"—I rise to speak to the motion to take note of answers to questions by Senator Minchin relating to housing affordability. At the outset I make the observation that falling housing affordability has become one of Australia’s most pressing economic and, in due course, social problems. For most of the last 40 years access to reasonably priced housing has been taken for granted. The demand and supply sides of the equation were often, and continued to be, in balance. Those who wanted homes could generally purchase them at the appropriate price within their particular wage bracket.
Of course there were always those for whom home ownership was going to be difficult. But for those renting and saving to buy a house the equation in the last few years has changed quite dramatically. As Labor’s summit revealed here in Canberra, the principal problem is failure on the supply side. There are simply not enough houses being built in the lower price range for first buyers or for rental supply. The question is what to do by way of public intervention.
The government’s attitude has been to reduce supply by cutting funding for public housing. They have cut billions of dollars of funding during their term of government over the last 11 or 12 years. Their alternative proposition is to support the demand side. They do that through rental assistance and other forms of low-level financial support, hoping that in time the market will respond. But, of course, as we know by the extent of the crisis right around Australia, the market has not done so as yet and does not yet give any indication that it will do so.
Consistent with this new blame game, apparently it is the fault of the states for not releasing enough land but, as we really know, it is much more than that. It is also about the cost of developing that land, fully serviced. More to the point, that developed land is paid for in full and not repaid through rates into the future. The downside of user pays can have long-term unfortunate consequences and they are now being visited upon us within this housing market debate.
Labor’s position is that, given the failure of the market, it is clear the government must intervene. Labor, if elected, will add to its earlier offer to local government in encouraging cheaper land provision. Labor will also provide support to investors and superannuation funds to encourage them to invest in low-cost housing. Investments, of course—and sensibly so—are governed only by guaranteed rates of return. So the assistance provided by a future Labor government is intended to offset the lower rate of rent charged to the renter. We believe that will need to be discounted by some 20 per cent, and we say at the outset that this is quite a radical and innovative model. It recognises that low-cost housing rental to lower income people is not naturally an attractive investment. It provides an incentive for the leverage of private sector funding that can provide far greater relief than the historic public housing model. It is estimated that this initiative will provide an extra 20,000 houses per year. When made available to those most in need, it will make a serious contribution to housing need and to housing affordability. We look forward to the government’s response in due course.
This problem, though, is just another symptom of the Howard government being asleep at the wheel. It is another sign of failure to invest in infrastructure, and there is none as important as housing for thousands and thousands of Australian parents and families who, because of current government policy, are currently unable to get into the home purchase market. In that sense, there is nothing more important than housing for the long-term welfare of Australian families and nothing more important for the long-term social cohesion of this country than proper access to adequate finance for housing for Australian families.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2007-08-13,"—When I was growing up, most of my school years were spent during the life of the Hawke and Keating governments,  when we had ‘the recession we had to have’, when my fellow students at Gawler High School and young people like me everywhere wondered whether they would get a job because unemployment was so high, and we wondered whether we would be able to afford a house one day, because interest rates were so high. I am pleased to stand here today to say that, after 11 years of good economic management by the Howard government, people such as me, who went through the school system during the Hawke-Keating years, have now seen that sound economic management means that you can get a job and you can buy a house. There is, of course, one key important factor in home ownership—the most important factor—and that is having the income stream with which to buy a house. That is, having a job is the most critical factor when it comes to home ownership.
Last week we saw the release of new employment statistics saying that some 10,483,700 Australians have a job. That is more than at any time in Australia’s history, I am pleased to say. Of those jobs, 2.1 million have been created since 1996, with 1.2 million of them being full time. Indeed, more than 387,000 of those jobs have been created since the workplace relations reforms were introduced in 2005. So the first critical factor for young Australians—for any Australian—to be able to buy a house is a job, and the Howard government has provided jobs in spades. It is unquestionably our greatest single economic achievement. We have not only provided those jobs but we have done so with rising real wages. There are more people in more jobs with more money with which to buy their homes, a key and critical factor.
There is a second factor, though, which plays into this, and that is the question of availability. People can have the jobs and have the income but they need to find a place to buy. Unfortunately, this is where our state and territory counterparts have grossly mismanaged the housing market. They have failed to release appropriate land stocks, they have failed to ensure that the homes are being built in areas where people can afford to buy them and they have failed to provide adequate transport and ensure low-cost transport into new areas of development. They have failed to provide the supply side that is required to make sure that housing remains as affordable as it should be. So with the first factor we have a story where critically on the jobs front the Howard Liberal government has delivered over the past 11 years. With the second factor we have a sad and sorry tale of state and territory Labor governments failing to deliver for Australians.
There is a third factor, though, and that is financing. Alongside with having a job, there must be affordable financing. I am very pleased to say that the financing of home ownership is far more accessible again today than it was when people of my age, people who are today buying their homes for the first time, were considering doing so way back in their schooling years. Financing is far more available and far more affordable, standard variable home loan rates having fallen from 10.5 per cent when the Howard government was elected in 1996 to an average of 8.3 per cent today. Would we like them to be lower? Do we wish recent rises had not occurred? Absolutely. But are we proud of the fact that they are lower today than they were when we were elected? You bet. Are we proud of the fact that they are lower today than at any time when the Labor Party was last in government? We are very proud of that, because along with record jobs, that is the factor that is allowing Australians to borrow and get into homeownership.
In fact they are some four per cent lower today than they were on average under Labor’s reign. We have a very good story to tell, and yet we have the hypocrisy from the other side who are advancing policies in workplace relations reforms, whose history on government debt would only drive interest rates higher. Econtech have found that interest rates would be some 1.4 per cent higher under a Labor government, because their unrestrained workplace relations policies would allow union bosses into any workplace, driving up wages free of any consideration of productivity, costing the average Australian some $273 more per month.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2007-08-13,"—I do not intend to rewrite history or tell just part of the story of interest rates in this country or what John Howard did when he was Treasurer, but I am going to talk about the serious issue of housing affordability. Labor believes that all Australians have the right to secure affordable and appropriate housing. Housing affordability is now at critical levels for homeowners with mortgages and families who rent. Obviously, this is hurting working families and stretching their budgets to the limit.
Housing affordability has never been worse. Many Australians have given up on the dream of home ownership. The average Australian first home buyer now pays $2,300 per month to service a typical first home mortgage. They need a six-figure income just to meet their mortgage repayments. Rents are also increasing in many parts of Australia, making it harder to make ends meet and almost impossible to save a deposit for a home.
Dealing with the housing affordability crisis is a core challenge facing governments today. Labor believes that the federal government can take a more active role. The housing crisis needs national leadership—we need to end the blame game. Labor is committed to policies which make housing affordable by implementing economic policies designed to maintain low interest rates and a competitive housing finance sector; and secondly, policies which ensure that those on low and middle incomes can meet the cost of home ownership or rental or public housing arrangements.
A report by the Urban Development Institute of Australia released on Monday last week showed that only 39 per cent of average households can now afford to buy a house in their local area. Compare this to 96 per cent of households in 2001. This report is the most recent in a series issued by the housing industry, which is profoundly frustrated by the lack of interest and leadership by the Howard government on housing affordability. This is despite the fact that it is one of Australia’s biggest social problems.
The Commonwealth Bank-Housing Industry Association housing affordability index is at a record low, having fallen 40 per cent on Peter Costello’s watch. Households now need an income of $115,000 to keep up with mortgage repayments on the average loan for a median-priced home across our capital cities, up from $47,000 when Mr Costello became Treasurer. The average home now costs seven times the average annual wage, up from four times the annual average wage in 1996.
Data from the 2006 census paints an alarming picture of the number of households losing over 30 per cent of their income in rent payments. In my home state of Tasmania this equates to more than 11,000 households—or 38.2 per cent. Some of the Tasmanian electorates with the highest proportion of renters losing over 30 per cent of their income to rent payments include Bass, with 40 per cent of households that rent; Franklin, with 38.7 per cent; and Denison, with 38.6 per cent.
This is why I am so amazed that John Howard still believes that Australians have never been better off. Let me tell you this: the working families I have talked to in my home state disagree 100 per cent. They are hurting. If anything, this data shows just how out of touch the coalition is, especially with working families who are struggling with rising grocery prices, child care, petrol prices and, of course, interest rates.
In countless commercials in the last election, Mr Howard told you, the Australian people, that he could be trusted to keep interest rates at record lows. It was an irresponsible, undeliverable promise. In a press statement on the 16 July this year, Peter Costello claimed:
In order to keep housing affordable to young Australians we need to ... keep interest rates low.
What a joke! The fact of the matter is that there have now been nine rate rises on his watch, five of which have occurred since John Howard’s election promise in 2004 to keep rates at record lows. ‘Who do you trust?’ Remember that? Kevin Rudd’s plan for Australia is for the next 10 years, not for the next 10 weeks. Labor is committed to keeping the economy strong, but also to making sure our economy delivers for Australia’s working families. As I said at the outset, I am not rewriting history, but it is important that the community remember the 22 per cent interest rates that Australian families faced under John Howard when he was Treasurer. I remind people that this is the fifth interest rate rise since the 2004 election. This is hurting Australian families. There is also the uncertainty over industrial relations, the increased cost of child care, and the price of petrol and groceries continuing to escalate. (Time expired)

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2007-08-13,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Cambodia and to the 116th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Bali, which took place from 21 April to 4 May 2007. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:

That the Senate take note of the document.

I want to very briefly speak to the report of the 116th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I have attended these assemblies as a delegate of this parliament over the last 18 months. I will probably not be going to the next scheduled meeting of the IPU, given that we will most likely be in an election period at the time.
The work of the IPU is important. It is about parliamentarians meeting not to represent their governments but to represent their parliaments. The work of the IPU is very diverse. Some of the important work that I want to briefly talk about is its work with regard to human rights. In a world where human rights are not always as they should be, and not always to the standard that we and many other developed countries would expect in functioning democracies, it is critical that there is ongoing international scrutiny and an opportunity to exchange dialogue with parliamentarians from different sovereign states. While the assembly is concerned about human rights across the board, one of its major functions—a very important role—is to investigate allegations of human rights abuses of parliamentarians. This is not about parliamentarians simply seeking to look after one another. It follows quite logically that, if parliamentarians in working democracies cannot be afforded human rights, there is little or no chance that the general population will be afforded any level of human rights.
The IPU has a standing committee which works between assemblies. It looks at and investigates human rights abuses against politicians. People may remember recently seeing on their TV screens the leader of the main opposition party in Zimbabwe being beaten, nearly to death, by state sanctioned police violence. This is the kind of matter that the IPU attempts to investigate as best it can, but it often relies on the cooperation of the host government. There are many examples where politicians are elected to office, only to be jailed on trumped up charges, beaten, kidnapped or murdered. This is more common than we would like to think and the human rights committee works actively in this area.
I have spoken many times, for instance, about the abuse of a number of elected representatives in the Filipino government who coincidentally seem to get arrested on trumped up rebellion charges before elections are due to take place so that they are unable effectively to participate in the elections. One case I have spoken about many times here is that of Crispin Beltran, who was arrested over 18 months ago and charged with rebellion offences that were supposed to have taken place 20 years earlier. Of course, one of the problems for the state is that Crispin Beltran was actually in jail—jailed by the former and disgraced Marcos regime—at the time these rebellion offences were supposed to have taken place. Nevertheless, he spent 18 months in jail before finally working a way through the process of the law to be released after the last election.
Far too many countries are investigated by this committee. This committee currently has on hand investigations into abuse against parliamentarians in Bangladesh, Belarus, Burundi, Colombia, Ecuador, Eritrea, Honduras, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Palestine, Israel, Philippines, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Zimbabwe. This is hard work but it is very important work. Often international pressure, with the status of the IPU, leads to effective results or effective representation. The eyes of the international community being quite focused on some of these abuses leads to successful results, but unfortunately not always.
I commend this report to the committee. Many charges are detailed in the report. I commend the work of my fellow delegates: Ms Hull, Ms Moylan and Mr Jenkins from the other place, who participated actively in the debates in the assembly. They were not there to represent the government’s view but to represent the views of this parliament, which is quite different sometimes from the views of the executive. I would also like to thank Mr Neil Bessell, the delegation secretary, who does an outstanding job of organising the Australian delegation.
The IPU is a very worthwhile organisation. There are questions, from time to time, whether membership of such organisations is worth it. From my experience in serving my time—which is now coming to an end, I suspect—I can say quite strongly that this is an important organisation. Australians engage actively in it when we are there. I think this organisation, the Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, is very good value. It is good for our understanding and often it makes a real difference. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2007-08-13,"—I was speaking before question time in this second reading debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 and the citizenship test that it seeks to introduce. One of the stated aims of the bill is to achieve a more inclusive society. However, in my view, and in the view of a number of witnesses before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the test, by its very nature, is a very exclusionary measure to achieve this aim. Tests are, by their very nature, designed to be passed or failed, so it difficult to see exactly how this bill is going to promote a more inclusive society.
It is critical, I think, that this test does not act as a de facto English test or a test reminiscent of a bygone era—namely, the White Australia policy of the past. Whilst the citizenship test will attempt to measure a prospective citizen’s knowledge of Australia and its values and way of life, many average Australian citizens have a very poor understanding of Australia’s history and aspects of government. I would therefore be concerned that a number of Australian citizens may not pass the test if they were asked to sit it.
In the committee hearings, another concern that was raised about this test was that it might result in a higher threshold of knowledge for individuals who are not yet Australian citizens. Professor George Williams from the Gilbert and Tobin Centre for Public Law at the University of New South Wales said to the committee that a test of this kind is an ineffective way of instilling values. Someone who fundamentally disagreed with Australian values could pass the citizenship test by correctly identifying the answers, even if they do not have a personal commitment to the values that the answers express. There is a concern that not only will individuals be answering questions that they might not necessarily agree with, but also that they could simply rote-learn answers to questions, or answer them in accordance with what they know is the right answer rather than with what they actually believe in.
Another factor that was drawn to our attention during the course of the committee hearings is that the government has relied on a number of opinion polls to formulate this legislation and introduce a citizenship test. In my view, and in the view of a number of witnesses to the committee, it is not appropriate for an opinion poll to be the determining factor in the legislative or policy-making process. In addition, the government said that it has relied on the fact that other countries such as Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States have introduced citizenship tests, but when the department was questioned at the committee hearing about the effectiveness of these countries’ citizenship-testing arrangements, we were told that, at least in the UK and Canada, there has not been any evaluation of the citizenship test. The department was able to inform the committee only that they had not seen any evidence of it being a disincentive for people to apply for citizenship. In any event, comparing Australia’s experience with citizenship practices in other countries is not relevant. Every country has an individual history relating to citizenship and a different experience on which to base its policies. A witness from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission told the committee:
For us to adopt precedents from the UK without understanding the basic differences between our countries would be dangerous.
I move on now to some of the concerns that were expressed in relation to the content and the nature of the citizenship test. The 20-question, multiple-choice citizenship test seeks to test prospective citizens on their knowledge of Australia and of Australian values. It is not clear what exactly our identifiable Australian values are. Can they even be identified? Are they unique to Australia? Values are a very subjective concept, and some values such as freedom, democracy, respect for the rule of law, equality and non-discrimination are values which are held in countries other than Australia. Should we therefore be testing prospective citizens on the presumption that they do not already hold these values? In one submission to the committee, it was said that testing people on common values implies that there is only one set of Australian values and one type of Australian citizen and that this undermines the vital role that multiculturalism and diversity play in Australian society.
One of the most concerning features of this legislative scheme is that it is the minister who will determine what are Australia’s values and this decision will not be transparent for others to assess or even review. It remains to be seen how the minister will determine what constitutes Australian values. However, with this ambiguity about what constitutes identifiable Australian values, and the different backgrounds from which people come to take the test, there is certainly no overwhelming evidence to support the proposition that a multiple-choice test is indeed an adequate way to test and assess a person’s values and whether they are consistent with so-called Australian values.
It was concerning to us as members of the committee that members of parliament have not had, and will not have, the opportunity to review and consult on the likely content of the test questions before this legislation is passed. The entire legislative scheme that the government intends to introduce establishes the structure for citizenship testing, yet the actual test itself remains a mystery. At the time of the committee hearings—and it is still the case—no guidance as to the nature of the test had been provided, nor was the content of the supporting resource booklet from which people will learn for the test provided to the committee. The secrecy and lack of transparency or readiness—whatever it is—on the part of the government in regard to this test is quite concerning. The legislation makes the citizenship test a pivotal step in achieving an important legal status and, in these circumstances, transparency and accountability are critical.
The potential impact of this bill is also of concern, and it was raised by a number of witnesses to the committee. There are some factors which have been identified as being more problematic than others. In particular, it was raised with us that the test has the potential to deter people from applying for citizenship. We heard that it should be expected that the number of applicants for citizenship will fall after the test is introduced. The intimidating and stressful nature of the formal test could act as a deterrent, and people with a low level of ordinary literacy—not to mention computer literacy—could well be deterred from attempting the test and therefore obtaining Australian citizenship. The submission by the Human Rights Education Centre at the Curtin University of Technology raised concern that the proposed testing regime will have a disproportionately negative impact on already disadvantaged and marginalised groups within society, including refugees, women, people with disabilities, people in rural areas and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. The specific hurdles that people from these groups are likely to face include—for women, for example—the fact that family care obligations often make it very difficult for women to attend English language courses provided by the government.
In the case of humanitarian entrants a significant number of refugees, as we know, are survivors of torture and trauma. They may continue to experience the after-effects of this torture and trauma, and this can quite easily impact on their ability to learn and process new information, let alone a new language. So, there is the potential that the test will have a disproportionate impact on these persons from disadvantaged groups, particularly insofar as it is going to impact on those who do not speak English.
The legislation fails to take into account that people with limited language skills can still make an important contribution to Australian society. In light of the potentially significant impact this test will place on certain persons, it is also concerning to see that the minister has no discretion under the bill to make exceptions for individuals who are disadvantaged by testing arrangements. The only exemptions from the testing requirements are for persons over the age of 60, for those under the age of 18, for persons with a physical and/or mental disability and for people with literacy problems. It was said to us in the committee that there should be an exemption for refugee and humanitarian entrants who have a limited education and/or interrupted schooling, and I think that there certainly is some merit in that.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission argued that the bill contains no adequate safeguards to ensure that the creation of different tests does not operate to unfairly discriminate against particular categories of applicants. They also argued, as I have said, that the bill should provide a mechanism to allow the minister to make exemptions or to put into place an alternative process for applicants who are unfairly disadvantaged by having to sit the test.
One of the principal concerns that was raised at the committee hearings was the wide scope given by the bill for the exercise of ministerial discretion. The proposed legislation will include a new section, section 23A, which gives the minister alone the power to approve what will constitute the citizenship test. A number of witnesses before the committee expressed their concern that the test would not be a legislative instrument and, therefore, disallowable by the parliament. The committee heard considerable evidence in this regard, and we were certainly concerned that the test would not be subjected to parliamentary scrutiny. The suggestion made by the committee is that the test questions be tabled in the parliament as a measure at least of some reassurance that there will be the opportunity for members of parliament to scrutinise the test before it is made available and becomes part of the testing regime.
We saw that a considerable amount of funding is going to be spent on implementing the citizenship test. In the view of a number of witnesses to the committee, the funding that is going to be spent on this test would be much better spent on alternative programs to assist Australia’s new and potential citizens. There are many examples of these types of programs—programs that seek to improve settlement, orientation, and language and education programs for new migrants. In addition, there is the need for ongoing community support and integration programs such as employment skills programs. It is also very important to support new families with children by providing affordable childcare options so that parents are able to access employment and attend English language classes. Civics education classes are another way in which new citizens can be successfully integrated into Australian society, as opposed to answering a set of test questions correctly.
In conclusion, I reiterate that Labor will be supporting the passage of this legislation, but I think that the concerns of those witnesses who came before the committee ought to be placed on the record because a great deal of thought has gone into their submissions. Senator Lundy has foreshadowed that Labor will be moving an amendment that there be instituted a formal and comprehensive review of the impact of the bill after three years. I think that this is absolutely essential. A number of the matters that I have raised here today and that were put before the committee and detailed in the committee’s report need to be carefully reviewed and scrutinised as the legislation comes into effect so that we can see what the impact is upon citizenship numbers and upon the number of people who apply for citizenship and whether or not the citizenship test is acting as a disincentive or as an exclusionary tool for people who otherwise would become Australian citizens, rather than having the desired impact and making for a more inclusive Australian society.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2007-08-13,"—I was part of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 that is before the Senate. We heard that it is unnecessary—we heard a lot of evidence at the committee about the fact that our citizenship laws are working quite well—and there was not a case put forward about why there was a failure of the way in which our current citizenship laws operate. We received evidence from the Victorian Immigrant and Refugee Women’s Coalition. They wrote in their submissions that Australia has been well served by its existing, inclusive citizenship laws and that we now have a culturally diverse and socially cohesive collection of people who are proud to call Australia home. So we heard that our citizenship laws are working quite well.
The government puts forward two rationales as to what it thinks a citizenship test will achieve. The first one is about improving the English language skills of migrants here in Australia, and the second one is about improving the cohesiveness of Australian society. I will go to the first issue. I had a look at the census data over the last two census periods which look at the English language proficiency of migrants. Over the period of time that this government has been in power, the English language skills of migrants in Australia have improved so much that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship have had to change the way in which they measure English language proficiency, because the bottom two categories—that is, the two categories with migrants with really low English language proficiency—were meaningless because people’s English-language skills have improved so much.
So the idea behind the citizenship test—that we need to improve the English language skills of migrants—is not based on the government’s own evidence, which shows that the English language skills of migrants are massively improving and have massively improved over the period of time that this government has been in office. The improvement has been so great that the way in which English language proficiency is measured has had to be changed.
The other rationale the government put forward about a citizenship test is that it will improve the cohesiveness of our society. During the Senate inquiry, the government were not able to put forward any evidence about how they would improve the cohesiveness of society. In fact, when I asked them questions about this, the two things that they pointed to were that it operated in other countries and that they had carried out a consultation discussion paper and the majority of people who had responded to that discussion paper had supported it. That is not justification at all. I asked the government whether the countries that had introduced citizenship tests had done any assessment of whether or not the tests had improved the cohesiveness of their society, and their answer was, ‘No, they haven’t been in place long enough for them to evaluate it.’ I do not think that you can argue—and other witnesses appeared before the committee to say this—that the United States society or the United Kingdom society is in some way more cohesive than Australian society. We have certainly seen great friction occurring in both those societies within different cultures in a way that we do not see in Australian Society. So I do not think that pointing to the example of overseas is any evidence that introducing citizenship tests improves the cohesiveness of the society. In fact, what the committee heard is that it has the potential to do exactly the opposite. Tests, by their very nature, are exclusionary. Tests are designed to separate people into one group of individuals who pass and another group of individuals who fail. An eductor who appeared before the committee said that tests are ‘designed to gatekeep; that is what they are for’. So, in seeking to introduce a citizenship test, this piece of legislation is designed to separate people into those who are deserving citizens and those who are undeserving citizens, which will not improve the cohesiveness of our society.
We heard from a whole range of witnesses at the Senate committee about the way in which this will increase division within our society. I think that Australia can and should be proud of the cohesive nature of our society, of the way in which we have promoted multiculturalism, of the way in which we have celebrated the diversity of people who make up this country and of the immigrants who have come to Australia for over 200 years and made this great country what it is. I think we should be encouraging people to come and be citizens of this country. Therefore, I do not think it is constructive and useful to put barriers in place like this proposal for a citizenship test. As I said, we heard from the committee about the way in which a test will create division within society. We also heard about the way in which it may prevent people from deciding to put their hands up to say that they would like to become a citizen of this country. We heard from the President of the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia that the citizenship test would be likely to discourage many people from seeking citizenship. This is what she said:
Our concern is that a lot of people who would feel uncomfortable about any testing at all, particularly if they have a low level of literacy, will not apply for citizenship but will self-select out.
We do not want to see that. I am sure that nobody here wants to see that. So why put in place a test which not only will divide our society but will actively discourage people who may have a massive contribution to make to Australia from taking out citizenship?
The other thing we heard in the Senate inquiry which is worth noting is that the citizenship test will not improve the English language skills of migrants in Australia but will undermine the existing English language programs that have been put forward for migrants in Australia. We heard this from a number of educators who talked about the way in which teachers change what they teach to ensure that people can pass a test. We heard, for example, from the Australian Council of Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages. We heard from their president, who said:
As soon as there is a test, teachers feel the need to get their students to pass the test and students put pressure on to be given what it is that they need to pass the test. Suddenly, lessons become all about passing the test. Certainly from my experience overseas, where everybody is sitting English language tests to prove their English language proficiency, we have huge evidence that all good teaching practice goes out the door as people do test preparation ... It is very bad pedagogical practice because the aim is so limited. Your capacity to pass an English test is in no way an indication of your capacity to operate in the thousands of everyday communications you need to have.
What we see is that putting in place the government’s proposed citizenship test will not improve the English language skills of migrants in Australia. It will in fact undermine the existing English language programs for migrants, because those programs will then start teaching so that people will pass the test rather than having the English language skills they need in order to survive in Australian society.
We heard at the Senate inquiry into this legislation that, firstly, the legislation is unnecessary. There is no failure of our existing immigrations laws. Secondly, we heard that the two objectives the government is proposing for this legislation—improving the English language skills of migrants and improving the cohesiveness of our society—will not be achieved by this test. Far worse than that, this test will undermine the existing English language programs for migrants and contribute to increasing the divisiveness that exists within our society.
The Australian Greens cannot support this piece of legislation. We see it and the proposal by the government as a way of sending a message to those people in the community who have some very racist attitudes towards immigrants coming to Australia. That is certainly one of the things we saw in the submissions that were made to the Senate inquiry. We saw a response to the government’s call-out to racists in Australia, or that dog whistle by the government. One of the submissions the Senate committee received was from a group calling itself Australia for Australians, and in it were their suggestions, their response to the federal government’s call for a citizenship test. They said:
... the test must make clear that they understand that in everyday life they are expected to dress and act like other Australians and that their cultural and religious practises and dress must be restricted either to private, ceremonial or religious occasions.
That is not a view that we see put forward in mainstream Australian society, but this government is sending out a message with this proposal for a citizenship test to particular groups from the community who have racist attitudes, and they responded in the form of this particular submission. Another of their recommendations said:
... 90% of all immigrants allowed in must be of white European or British or North American origin.
A further recommendation said:
In view of what has happened and what is happening around the world in the last 30 years there should be a ban on allowing Muslims into Australia—from whatever country—no exceptions ...
When you send out a message, as this government has done, about a citizenship test that is excluding people from being citizens then you strike a chord with those people in the community who have quite extremist and quite racist views in relation to the value of our multicultural society. This was one group that responded to that call from the government, they responded to that dog whistle, and put forward these extremist views to the Senate committee—racist views that I hope the government does not agree with and that certainly mainstream society does not support.
—But you represent a minority party yourself.
 (Senator Moore)—Minister, do not shout across the chamber.
—Minister, I do not support racism.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—Senator Nettle, do not respond to interjections across the chamber.

Senator Brandis interjecting—

—Minister, your point can be made later in the debate.
—The point that I have been making is that the government sent out a message about excluding people from being able to be citizens. There are people with racist exclusionary views within our society who have responded to that call. They have seen this as an opportunity that the government has created for them to put forward and to gain support for their racist views. That is what we saw in their submission and that is why I have chosen to highlight that particular submission.
The Greens see this citizenship test as a step back from the support for multiculturalism that we think the government of Australia should be promoting. We have seen the government stepping back from multiculturalism. We have seen it even with the way that ‘multicultural affairs’ was dropped from the title of the department. We do not have the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs anymore, and the opposition followed suit by dropping ‘multicultural affairs’ from their senior immigration portfolio as well, replacing it with ‘integration’.
Instead, the Greens would like to see our government talking about the great value of multiculturalism in our society. We would like to see the government encouraging migrants to learn English. We agree that English language skills help you to survive in Australian society. Therefore, I will be moving a second reading amendment on behalf of the Greens that calls on the government to increase funding to and expand upon existing English language programs. In that way we will be able to encourage migrants to learn English language skills.
The Senate committee heard evidence from Ms Katie Wrigley from the Refugee Advice and Casework Services in Sydney. She talked about the limitations on the existing English language hours of study available to new migrants. She was talking about how limited that is and how it would not allow people the English language skills that they might need to pass the proposed citizenship test. She said:
The contents of the proposed test, including questions about Australian values, would be outside the vocabulary scope of basic language classes for those learning a new language with the first 510 hours of study.
And that is all that is currently provided in the existing English language programs for migrants.
If the government were really interested in improving the English language skills of migrants, it would expand these existing programs and ensure that migrants were able to get the English language skills they need. It can take a really long time to learn a language. There are people for whom English is their first language, and it still takes them an extraordinarily long time—many years—to grasp the language. If you are coming to Australia as, say, a young African refugee, you have never learnt your own language in a formal setting, let alone attempt to learn another language in a formal setting. So you would arrive in Australia without any English, without any history of having formal training in any written language, and you would be expected within 510 hours of study to be able to gain enough English to pass this kind of citizenship test. It is just not going to happen.
We have heard about the number of migrants who are not able to attend even the limited 510 hours of study that are available because they have to work, because they have to get money to survive in their new country or because they have small children and family and child-rearing responsibilities. If the government were genuine about wanting to ensure that all those people had the opportunity to learn English, they would ensure that child care was available so that migrant mothers would be able to go and learn the English language skills that are so important for them in being able to engage in Australian society.
There was another issue that was raised in the course of the Senate inquiry into this matter, and that was about the level of discretion that is given to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in this legislation whereby the minister is able to determine what shall be in the citizenship test. This is about deciding who can or cannot become a citizen. Surely we, the parliament, should have some say in what kind of test, if there is to be a test, is put in place to determine who should be able to become a citizen.
The Greens believe that parliamentary oversight of any citizenship test, if it is to be introduced, is important, and so I will be moving in the committee stage of this legislation an amendment to ensure that, where the government makes a determination about what questions are to be in a citizenship test, the parliament has some oversight into this. This was an issue raised by many of the organisations that appeared before the Senate committee.
As I said at the outset, I want to see us here in Australia celebrating the diversity of people that exist in Australia and their contribution to Australia. I note that the member for Kooyong, Petro Georgiou, spoke in the House of Representatives about his own father as an example of somebody who has made a massive contribution to Australian life, and of course we all know there are many such people who would not be able to pass the citizenship test that has been proposed. I have spoken with many members of the Greek community in my suburb in Sydney who are extraordinarily concerned about it and who would not pass the citizenship test. Most of them have been in Australia, working and contributing to the Australian community, for between 20 and 30 years—as have people at the Cyprus Club, which is just around the corner from my place. They have all been contributing, yet they would not pass the citizenship test that has been proposed.
I want to live in a country which is made up of migrants who contribute to our society. This citizenship test is not going to increase the number of migrants that can come to Australia and contribute to Australian society. I want to see the government speaking out about multiculturalism and the benefits that it brings to our society. We have seen governments in the past in Australia, right from the White Australia policy at the beginning, that have sought to limit the diversity of people in Australian society. But we have also seen, from the beginning up until now, fair-minded people in society speak up and stand up for the importance of diversity within our community and for the value that multiculturalism brings to our society. We have seen over the whole history of this country that people have spoken out about the value of multiculturalism. Now is an occasion when we as members of parliament can join with those in the community who speak out about the value of our multicultural society and who seek to prevent steps being taken that will limit that diversity within our society. This is an opportunity to stand up and take that position of supporting the diversity of people that make up our society. That is what the Greens will be doing, and we call on other senators to do likewise.
It is really disappointing that the opposition, as we heard from the previous speaker, have decided to support this legislation. I think more foresight is needed to understand the history of how governments have sought in the past to limit immigration, to be exclusionary in terms of who is able to gain citizenship, to the detriment of our society, by preventing people from various backgrounds becoming citizens. I want to see us stand up against that. It is important that other senators join the Greens in standing up to promote and to celebrate the diversity of our society and the multiculturalism that has made us a strong and safe country. I move the second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
                  “and the Senate is of the view that the Government should:
              (a)    increase the hourly funding rate for the Adult Migrant English Programme (AMEP); and
              (b)    increase the funding to expand the Adult Migrant English Programme (AMEP)”.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2007-08-13,"—The Democrats have long spoken about the importance of multiculturalism to the future of Australia and about the necessity for all of us in positions of leadership to promote the benefits of multiculturalism and to increase understanding and awareness in the Australian community of just how essential it is to our nation fully redeveloping its potential. The unfortunate aspect of this bill before us, the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007, is that it is poorly thought through. Like quite a number of other election year measures, it is based not on any evidence but simply on assertion and the creation of a perception. At best, it will be an expensive, bureaucratic waste of time. At worst, it will be divisive, destructive and discriminatory.
One of the issues identified in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the legislation is that questions that will make up the much discussed citizenship test will not be made public. We will have a large body of secret questions that will be used to test whether or not people have a supposed understanding of Australia’s values, culture, history and the like. The rationale is to prevent people from rote learning the questions, but to me that is simple sophistry on the part of the government and the minister. People will be given a resource booklet from which the questions will be drawn. It is ludicrous to suggest that having a resource booklet that people can look at, understand and identify is okay but that giving them the actual questions—200 of them, mind you, from which a selection will be randomly drawn—is not okay. It is simply an example, once again, of the excessive control and secrecy which this government likes to put over so many things.
This is disappointing because, as should be acknowledged, it was actually the Liberal Party, back in the days when it was somewhat more accurate to call it a liberal party, that played a key role in developing multiculturalism and cementing it into Australian society, making multiculturalism a reality. Indeed, it is an irreversible reality—Australia is a multicultural society. So it is particular disappointing that it is under a Liberal government that such a poorly thought through and jingoistic attack is now being made on multiculturalism and that the false idea is being promoted that a singular framework can be put forward within a citizenship test to measure people’s suitability to be Australian. To put something like that forward is using public policy and law to promote mythology. That, I would suggest, is not helpful for any nation. To me, it demonstrates an insecurity about Australia, about our nation, and a lack of awareness of who we are as a nation.
The strange thing with some of the notions that are put forward in the arguments in favour of a citizenship test is that somehow we have some sort of problem with migrants having not properly integrated into the Australian community that might somehow be fixed by a citizenship test. Firstly, whilst there are lots of insinuations made about there being some sort of problem with unnamed migrants having not integrated properly into the Australian community, it has never actually been named in any meaningful sense, certainly not by government ministers.
There is no credible argument or effort to demonstrate how testing people who are already permanent residents, having resided here for a minimum of four years, is somehow going to address that problem. If people fail this test they will still be permanent residents. Because they cannot take it, they cannot become eligible to apply for citizenship, and they cannot take the test until they are already permanent residents. So if there is any problem with them with regard to integration, they will already have been permanent residents here for four years. It is a ludicrous mechanism to use to deal with any alleged problem with regard to a particular migrant’s suitability to be part of the Australian community. They will already be part and parcel of the Australian community.
It suggests that particularly migrants from non-English-speaking backgrounds are somehow or other part of the problem. Facts demonstrate that the groups of people most ready and most eager to become Australian citizens are those who arrive here as refugees. They are the keenest to fully commit to Australia and to fully rebuild their lives as Australians. Actually, people who come from English-speaking countries are the slowest to become citizens. According to data I got from the Parliamentary Library, we have close on one million permanent residents in Australia who are non-citizens—people who would be eligible to be citizens but have not got around to it, cannot be bothered or, for some other reason, have not taken up citizenship. Over half of those come from either the UK or New Zealand. So if we have any problem with integration of migrants into the Australian community and with people fully connecting and fully committing to Australia, then we need to focus on people from the UK and New Zealand, using the criteria that the government puts forward to justify this test.
I am not making that particular allegation; it is up to people whether they wish to reside in a country permanently without becoming citizens. That is their choice. Those people still contribute in many ways to the Australian community and, if they want to pay all their taxes and do all the other things without having the right to vote, then that is their business. But if we are using the taking up of citizenship and eligibility for citizenship as some sort of test of suitability for ‘Australianness’ and the full integration of people, then there is a proof, there is the so-called problem. Half of the pool of nearly a million permanent residents who have not taken up citizenship are people from the UK and New Zealand. It just shows the shoddy thinking and the poorly thought through rationale behind the citizenship test.
These sorts of things are particularly problematic because they show a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of citizenship. They show a misunderstanding about the nature of migration, of migrants and the reality of the modern world. It has to be said in any debate on citizenship that it was only as recently as 1948 that any such thing as an Australian citizen came into being. Even though we had been a nation since 1901, there were actually no Australian citizens until 1948. Even until the 1970s we were still seen as British subjects and Australian citizens at the same time. We still have the bizarre anomaly whereby a whole range of people who are British subjects—or were British subjects in January 1984, I think it was—were eligible to be on the electoral roll at that time and are still eligible to vote. So we have a whole bunch of people in the country who are not Australian citizens but have a right to vote yet, at the same time, we have another group of people who are Australian citizens and live in the country but are refused the right to vote because of changes made to the Electoral Act last year—people in prison. We have another group of people who are Australian citizens who are overseas and, in many cases, are denied the right to vote. We have yet another group of people who are Australian citizens who, because of changes made to the Electoral Act, are much more easily knocked off the roll without their knowledge and will find it harder to get back on. They also have impediments in the way of their right to vote.
The inconsistencies in the way this debate is presented are quite considerable. Even that very basic phrase that was used in the government’s very poorly written and quite intellectually shoddy discussion paper at the end of last year—the line that is repeated all the time, the one that sounds great on the surface: ‘citizenship is a privilege not a right’—was just a ruse. They had obviously already decided what they were going to do. It was another of those sham consultation processes that gives the work ‘consultation’ a bad name. It is a privilege—there is no doubt about that, and certainly I feel very privileged to be an Australian citizen—but it is also a right for many people. It was a right that I received by virtue of being born here to Australian citizen parents, but it is also a right solely on the basis of legislation created in 1948 and updated by the new Citizenship Act passed earlier this year. But those rights that attach to citizenship are only legislated; they are not constitutionally entrenched. They can be modified, and indeed are modified as in the examples I gave with respect to the Electoral Act.
What we really need in Australia with citizenship is not some sort of jingoistic test, some sort of Trivial Pursuit quiz, to enable some of us to single out who is an Aussie and who is not. What we need is a proper, grown-up, commonsense debate about what citizenship entails and what we need to do to get full value and an increased understanding of it, which we clearly do not have from some in government who want to put forward this kind of legislation.
As I said before, there is a fair probability that this will simply turn out to be a fairly benign, bureaucratic and expensive waste of time that will not achieve any significant positive benefit nor cause great problems. There is also no doubt that this legislation is causing a lot of anxiety amongst some sections of the migrant community. People know their history—migrants often know Australian history a lot better than natural-born Australians—and a lot of people are aware of the White Australia policy and its deliberate use of administrative procedures in a premeditated, discriminatory way. We all know—or we should all know—that arbitrary language tests were used in the past as a deliberate screening mechanism to keep out people from particular regions or individuals we decided we did not want. People know about that history, and that is why they are concerned that these sorts of tests could be used in that sort of way in the future. I am not saying that that is the intent of the government here but, as always, when we pass legislation we have to look at not just how it might be used tomorrow but how it might be used in five or 10 years time. Putting forward a bunch of secret questions as a way of determining who can be a citizen and who cannot is a practice that frankly does not make me feel particularly comfortable. That reality should be linked to the other existing reality of the extreme powers given to the minister under our Migration Act.
Another thing that many migrants know, and they know it much more clearly and starkly than they did a month or so ago, is that anybody residing in this country—it does not matter if they have lived here for decades or for all but a few weeks—who is not a citizen is always at risk of having their residency right cancelled and being deported. It is a right that any country has, of course, to determine whether or not people who are not citizens—aliens, to use to old jargon—can reside. But the problem is that the Migration Act allows that right of the government of the day to be exercised in an extreme, capricious, potentially politically motivated and extraordinarily unjust way. So every one of those more than a million people who are resident in Australia—in fact, it would be close to 1½ million once you count all the temporary residents—is potentially at risk of having their visa cancelled on the most flimsy of pretexts under some of the extreme powers and the wide-ranging discretions that the migration minister has.
When you combine the potential for an unfair blockage through a secret citizenship test with extreme powers under the Migration Act, for visa cancellations without proper rights of review or appeal, then you get an increased concern and apprehension amongst some people in the wider community. Reducing people’s rights, increasing the power of government over the lives of people and reducing the opportunities for scrutiny of the mechanisms that governments use for merits review and independent appeals have a cumulative effect that reduces people’s rights and increases the risks of injustice, whether arbitrary or deliberately malicious, and is the sort of thing we need to guard against. By putting forward these things, I am not alleging a deliberate, malicious hidden agenda—I think the agenda is pretty obvious here: it is just an election year stunt. The test is not particularly aimed at trying to target particular groups in the community, at least in my view. As I said before, we have to look at how something can be used down the track rather than how it might be used tomorrow.
The other reality of this test—particularly if the questions are kept secret, but even if they are not—is a very real probability that there will be a higher benchmark for migrants who wish to become Australian citizens versus those of us who are Australian born and get citizenship as a legal right, at least as the law stands at the moment. There is a very real prospect that people who are required to pass the citizenship test will have a much better understanding and knowledge of Australian society, history, rules et cetera than many Australian-born people. That is one of the reasons why the Democrats recommend that any test that is put forward for migrants to take should first be tested on a representative sample of existing citizens and Australian-born citizens. We need to test the test to make sure that the vast majority of Australians can pass it. If you are requiring migrants to pass a test that many Australian-born people cannot pass, then it is discriminatory and unfair. Apart from anything else, it would highlight the ludicrousness of the whole concept. It is important to ensure that the test is properly tested on people to make sure that it is something that most Australians can pass. If the government is serious about ensuring that people who migrate to this country—who seek to settle here and become citizens—are able to demonstrate some understanding and ability to integrate with Australia via the taking of a test, then I do not see why it would be unreasonable to expect that the test be also tested on Australian-born people.
I note the Senate committee report into the legislation included a unanimous recommendation from the committee that the proposed citizenship test questions be tabled in the parliament, and it is one that I support. As I understand it, it was not supported by the government in the lower house. I urge the government to reconsider this recommendation when we get to the committee stage of this debate in the Senate. I also draw the attention of the Senate and of anyone else who is following this debate in the wider community to the dissenting report that I put forward to the legislation, which contains the formal response that the Democrats put forward to the government’s discussion paper, towards the end of last year, on the merits of introducing a formal citizenship test. It outlines some of the issues that we in the Democrats believe need to be given much better consideration.
If we are going to have a genuine debate about increasing the understanding and value of citizenship and the role that citizenship can play, it is time that we recognised that citizenship is not just about some sort of jingoistic loyalty such as cheering on your football club. There is nothing wrong with cheering on your football club, but citizenship is a much deeper and more complex concept than that. We in Australia live in an era in which many people are dual citizens and in some cases are citizens of more than two countries. In those sorts of circumstances, this narrow nationalistic atmospheric that some in the government like to put forward when promoting and debating these sorts of issues simply does not fit. It does not work in a modern world and it should not work in a modern world. Multiculturalism is something that we should be celebrating and promoting as a positive. The Liberal Party in a previous era played a positive role in doing that. The Democrats continue to do that today. We would urge those within the government who still recognise that history—and I know that Senator Brandis is one of them, because I have heard him speak quite eloquently on that in the past—to continue to make those efforts.

",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2007-08-13,"—Citizenship has in many ways been taken for granted in Australia in the past, and it is quite good to get some debate about what citizenship means in Australia, what its value is and how people become citizens of Australia. The current act, in subsection 21(2), sets out the general eligibility for citizenship, which is that applicants must understand the nature of application for citizenship, must possess a basic knowledge of the English language and must have an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. After many decades of accepting the current form of assessing them—which is basically by a personal interview—the current government has decided that, whereas those aims are worthy, we need to change the way in which they are assessed. The government wants to change the personal interview to a test. In my travels around the country, there has been quite a large measure of support—including by many migrants, who have a deep understanding of Australian culture and want to display that knowledge—for some perhaps more rigorous form of testing for citizenship. However, the government has not set out very clearly the reasons why it has gone to the particular form of testing that it has, what it hopes to achieve or what it regards as the criteria for citizenship.
Most of the questions that I have asked have revolved around what has been happening in testing overseas—in particular, in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands but also in the United States of America and Canada. Whether this merits support will depend on the implementation of the testing. Although there are some claims that overseas testing has been examined in detail and that the Australian testing will be modelled on it, as I see it there are some very important differences between the proposed Australian system and the overseas systems. Whereas the proposed Australian system has very limited exemptions in areas like physical and mental disability or age and some flexibility where there is a literacy problem, other countries have a much more flexible system—for example, in the United States applicants have the ability to take the knowledge component of the test in the language of their choice. Not only is that not the proposed system for the Australian test but the literature around citizenship—the resource booklets and so forth—will be printed only in English and not in any other language. Prospective citizens will thus need to have a fairly good grasp of English before they even start on the process and before they can read about what the government regards as Australian values and the Australian way of life. I have concerns about that. What it will mean in fact is that various migrant groups will spend their resources on producing booklets in different languages, and prospective citizens will probably have to pay for some training in how to do the test or pay for booklets that describe it. This is one area in which the Australian test is more rigorous than the overseas test which it is modelled on.
The other particular problem that I have is that there is no doubt that this change in the regime of citizenship will affect people who have come in as refugees and humanitarian entrants far more than it will affect other groups. The great bulk of migrants to Australia come in under a works skills program of some description or are students, and they need to pass an English language test before they even get their visa. They achieve a level of functional English before they even come into Australia, so if they get a permanent visa once they are here and decide to apply for citizenship then obviously they will have a particular level of English that will facilitate their citizenship application. However, refugees and humanitarian entrants do not necessarily have that English language facility. They also often have considerable problems with literacy or have had problems with schooling in their past and need to make up a lot of ground. Many of them also suffer from trauma. They may have difficulty in accessing English classes and in dealing with the bureaucracy involved here. They are other particular problems that I have.
This is a group which would be most anxious to take up citizenship, to get an Australian passport, to have their right to be in this country regularised in that way. That has indeed been proved in the rate of take-up of citizenship among that group of refugee and humanitarian entrants. Many of that group are very anxious to get Australian passports to be able to travel back to their country of origin to see friendas and relatives, with the security of knowing that they will be able to return to their citizenship in Australia. It aslo assists them often in getting a job or accessing the ability to bring relatives over. So this is one group that I have great concerns about. I will very closely follow what happens to their rate of uptake of citizenship, their ability to pass the test in future and whether there will be any deterrents in the new system. I hope that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will keep very good records of those results. We have heard from the department that the countries on which the test is modelled have not undertaken comprehensive reviews. If this is done in Australia, it will provide a good service not only to the multicultural community here but also, presumably, to those overseas. I hope and expect that very good records will be kept about who passes and fails, what the rates are and any changes in the take-up of citizenship.
The third area where I have concerns, and this has been expressed by many of the speakers, is with the English language training. The booklets will be produced in English and facility in English is obviously critical to passing the test. It has been mentioned by other speakers that the Adult Migrant English Program is quite limited in many ways. For most eligible people the program will only provide 510 hours of English training and slightly more for people who are assessed as being in more need because of their particular literacy or low education problems. The trouble with the AMEP course is that for many people it is not sufficiently flexible to enable them to take up even their 510 hours, and this is shown in departmental statistics. Only something like 10 or 12 per cent of participants in the program successfully complete it with the required certificate in functional English.
The very people who have the most need for the program to get their citizenship tend to be those who have the most difficulty in accessing AMEP. As I understand it, there are a couple of major reasons for that. One reason is that people tend to grab a job if they can get one. It makes it difficult for those eligible for the program—and they tend to be from the refugee and humanitarian entry group—to keep up their job, their home responsibilities and their English language training. Another major reason is that for women at home, people who are ill and people in remote areas, the program is not sufficiently flexible. For example, people have difficulty accessing child care for some programs and in remote communities there may not be enough people to form a class, so people end up not completing the course.
There are some people who will always have difficulty in acquiring another language. We saw that with the wave of immigrants who came here after World War II. Some of those people picked up English very quickly while others, often because they were women at home with little exposure to other English speakers, never really acquired the full facility of the language and to this day require help with translating from their children. I am concerned that those kinds of people will from now on be excluded from citizenship. I expect that as the department and the minister monitor this program they will tend to make adjustments to ensure that people are not unduly disadvantaged in the acquisition of citizenship. I can think of examples, such as the wife at home who might not be able to acquire the English language. While her husband and children acquire citizenship, she may be the only one left out. The Labor Party policy of improving the funding and the flexibility of AMEP is the answer in this instance. Our policy is about education and giving people the proper opportunity to study the language and really assist them to participate in that citizenship. That is something that we all want to see. We all want to see people acquire English language skills, the dominant language in our country, so that they can access in full the advantages that Australia can give.
I urge the government to review the program well and to be flexible in its implementation, and I urge them to look at the AMEP program to see whether more funding can be provided. One of the things about this proposed new test is the significant funding involved: the cost will be $123 million over a five-year period. The fee will go up from $120 to $240, so there are significant costs involved for both the government and those who need to take the citizenship test before they can apply for citizenship. That is why it is important that we make sure this test achieves its aims, and that it does so fairly and correctly. That kind of money could be well spent on providing good programs for migrants to this country—for instance, assisting youth to integrate into schools and into our society and so on. So the significant costs involved mean that we should be fairly rigorous in monitoring the outcome of the new system.
In participating in the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry I was a bit dismayed to hear that there is still no sight of the resource booklet upon which the test questions will be based and that the values statement, the booklet, to which the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship said there had been very limited departmental input, will be produced within the minister’s office. As I understand it, there has been no input from FECCA in this process. We are still waiting for some kind of indication of what will be in the booklet. But, more than that, there will not be an opportunity for FECCA or any of the other groups involved in multicultural life in this country to have any kind of say as to what is in that booklet.
I think that relying on a value judgement of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the government to decide what are Australian values and what is Australian life, without reference to groups in the wider community—not only to the multicultural groups but to other groups that might want to have a say about what Australian values are and what represents our way of life—is not a good way to proceed. I think that is particularly poor policy and practice from the government. In its haste to implement this policy, and probably because this is an election year, the government is skipping a very essential part of the process of developing a good system that it can defend with confidence.
I support the foreshadowed Labor Party amendment to this bill and the recommendation that there be a review of the operation of the new test so that we can properly assess that it is fair to all Australians, so that it will not be a blemish on our recent proud record of welcoming people from all races and cultures to our country. The Prime Minister has very often said that the Australian people are very generous in offering refugees sanctuary in our country, and I like to think that that is indeed the case: that Australians are generous and do support the principles of fairness, that they will give people a chance to settle in our country even though they may not be perfect in their English or in their understanding of our way and that they will accept the enthusiasm of migrants to be Australian and to get on with life and make a success of it at its face value. I think that should be supported by the people in this country.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2007-08-13,"—The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 has been of some controversy in the western suburbs of Adelaide, where my electorate office is, so I would like to take this opportunity to address an important matter and to attempt to assuage the concerns of people in my area who have a particular interest in migration matters.
The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 amends the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 to provide for the testing of prospective applicants for Australian citizenship. When implemented the measures included in this bill will mean that persons who wish to become Australian citizens will firstly need to successfully complete a new citizenship test before making their application. One of the stated objectives of the test is that applicants understand the responsibilities and privileges that attach to Australian citizenship. If that is achieved, that will be a good thing. Labor supports applicants for citizenship achieving that level of understanding.
When news of this bill first emerged it faced strong criticism, and sometimes ridicule, from community groups, the media, members of parliament from all sides, and many members of the public. Comments made by the government exacerbated community concerns that this legislation required the testing of people for some ill-defined concept of Australianness. There were also concerns that the testing regime itself would discourage people from applying for citizenship.
My office, which is located in an area of Adelaide where consecutive waves of migrants have settled, has received countless phone calls both from concerned constituents and from prospective constituents wanting details of the bill and of the test. One of my constituents, who voluntarily teaches English to immigrants in Adelaide, phoned, fearing for her students. She was very confident in teaching her students how to speak, read and write in English, but she did not know how she could teach people and prepare them for this mysterious test. Thankfully, since the initial floating of the bill, it has changed considerably and it is somewhat more moderate in intent and objectives than was first indicated. The motivation for those changes is unclear but, whether it is poll driven, as much government policy is these days, or whether it was an acceptance by the government that the original plan was potentially very divisive, Labor welcomes the moderation.
Of course, Australia does have—and always has had—a type of citizenship test that applicants must complete. As outlined by the Australian Council of TESOL Associations, that test is in the form of an English language interview with an immigration officer, with questions regarding Australia’s laws, responsibilities, governance and history. The majority of migrants in Australia prepare for this interview by completing a 20-hour citizenship education course run through the Adult Migrant English Program.
Given that the government has provided no evidence that the current test is ineffective, it is difficult to understand exactly why the proposed computer based written test is necessary. A number of submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into this bill expressed similar views, questioning the necessity of a new test. The current system allows an officer to speak with applicants in an interview, which is, arguably, the best way to determine someone’s character. In an interview you have to do more than simply remember answers to questions; you need to express both your desire for citizenship and an understanding of the responsibilities that come with that honour. The Refugee Council of Australia noted in their submission to the Senate inquiry:
... there remains little evidence forwarded as to the practical, positive impact that English language testing beyond that which currently exists within the citizenship process, or a quiz on “the Australian way of life”, will have on ensuring a higher “quality” of Australian citizen. The current testing is adequate in determining who should become an Australian citizen.
It is obvious that the new test will further advantage well-educated migrants who are comfortable with the English language. These applicants for citizenship will not have to overcome the language barrier, learn study techniques or learn how to become comfortable in using a computer. Therefore, it is unlikely that the new citizenship test will deter them from applying for citizenship. Unfortunately, those with little education and those for whom English is not their first language or a language that they are comfortable with could be deterred. The stated objective of this bill is not to slow the migration of those from linguistically diverse backgrounds, but that may well be the outcome as people are discouraged by the imposition of a test that is not well understood.
During a period when our country is experiencing a massive skills shortage, the last thing we should be doing is making potential citizens jump through an extra hoop. The government has invested money in schemes like the so-called baby bonus to increase our population, but that will not help us in the short term. More attention to skilling Australians through investment in training and education is urgently needed. But the government has neglected the skills crisis for a decade or more, so we cannot expect any quick fix there either. An imperfect but more immediate solution is to encourage people to migrate to Australia. We need to ensure that the test will not deter people from applying for Australian citizenship, not only because we are desperate for skilled workers but also because of what people from other nations and other cultures bring to Australian society. One of the best features of Australia is our cultural diversity. We are a multicultural nation. We have welcomed people from 200 different countries to become Australian citizens, and the effect this has had on our country has been remarkable. The rich culture of our country is now a lot more than just Vegemite, AFL and the Uluru snow domes.
One of the great privileges of being a senator is being able to attend citizenship ceremonies, where we meet people from so many nations who have decided to become citizens. Australia is a richer and better place for having had people from other countries choose to come and live here. My state of South Australia mirrors the rest of Australia in that it has a diverse population, with only 74 per cent having been born in Australia. Of South Australia’s population, 6.7 per cent were born in England and 1.5 per cent were born in Italy. In 2004-06, more than 6,000 people settled in South Australia, with the top five countries of origin being the UK, the Peoples Republic of China, Sudan, India and New Zealand.
I grew up in a neighbourhood in Adelaide which was home to a large number of migrants from Europe who came here to build a better life for themselves and to help build the infrastructure and industries that have become integral to the economy of South Australia. Those migrants faced numerous struggles, including racism, yet they managed to contribute greatly to our society, just as their children and grandchildren continue to do. They have added immeasurably to our economy and our culture. We needed them back in the 1950s and we need them now.
Labor is disappointed with the lack of detail about this bill provided to parliament and to those organisations and persons who made submissions to the Senate committee inquiring into the bill. Without knowing the content of the test, we cannot make well-informed decisions as to the impact the test will have on Australia and our prospective citizens. We can only hope that the test will not place unreasonable barriers to individuals securing citizenship and participating fully in Australian society. We do know that the test is likely to be a multiple-choice test with questions regarding so-called Australian values. Such a test, as pointed out by the St Vincent de Paul Society—a very conservative organisation, in my experience—runs the risk of promoting ‘a monoculture that destroys our multicultural heritage and ignores Indigenous Australia’. They were very salient comments from the St Vincent de Paul Society, which has a long history of assisting migrants and refugees in Australia.
By introducing a new test, it may be seen that we are sending a message to those wanting to apply for citizenship that we want them to leave their own values and culture at the door while encouraging them to have a beer and go to a footy game. If we want to ensure the bona fides of people applying for citizenship, and if we want to present Australia to the world as a nation that welcomes difference and is not racist or discriminatory, we are not going to do it by encouraging people to learn the team colours of our cricket team or the lyrics of our national anthem.
No doubt one of the government’s initial imperatives for introducing this test was to give the impression to the Australian public that we can stop undesirables from becoming Australian citizens, but no citizenship test will stop people considered to be of bad character from becoming Australian citizens. In fact, we are creating a standard test on which someone who guessed every answer would get at least 25 per cent correct. So it stands to reason that someone who has studied hard would be able to get the required 60 per cent correct. This testing will not filter out bad people. Strongly motivated bad people are likely to pass the test with flying colours. If someone wants to become an Australian citizen and commit illegal acts it is highly unlikely that they will be deterred by a multiple-choice test. Passing any test does not require a strong commitment to Australian values but simply a good memory.
I acknowledge that some exceptions to the test have been made—those younger than 18 years of age or over 60 will be exempt, as will people considered to have a physical or mental disability that prevents them from understanding the test. Those applicants with literacy difficulties will now be talked through the test. The bill also provides that further exemptions and variations can be made. Whether those exemptions and variations are workable and whether they are applied consistently remains to be seen.
National Legal Aid expressed to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs its concern that a citizenship test has the potential to impact negatively on vulnerable groups such as refugees, humanitarian visa holders, victims of domestic violence and people with mental health problems. National Legal Aid went on in its submission to discuss the reality for refugees unable to obtain citizenship, describing citizenship as providing a sense of ‘belonging to a supportive nation’. Do we really want refugees who have fled devastating circumstances in their home countries to come to a country that requires them to sit a test that is written in English and based on topics that include our national sport? How will this confronting situation assist their ability to recover from an already traumatic beginning to life in Australia? National Legal Aid explained that citizenship is ‘an essential part of the healing process for torture and trauma victims, who often experience flashbacks linked with the fear of return’.
In my experience, a group who may be distinctly disadvantaged by a test such as that proposed in this legislation are women without an English speaking background who come from countries where women typically do not engage in any formal education, except perhaps the most basic education, and may not even have literacy in their own language. As well as having little or no literacy, these women often have responsibilities to their families and commitments which prevent them from learning effective English or from getting out and about so they develop a broader understanding of the Australian culture. We need to make sure that the personal circumstances of women, particularly those with family-caring responsibilities, do not preclude them making the grade for this test, upon which citizenship is contingent.
This legislation must be teamed with a commitment to increasing the amount of quality support and education available to migrants, particularly those with no or little English literacy. The estimated cost of implementing the proposed citizenship test is more than $120 million over five years. We have to ask whether that is money that would be better spent ensuring that all migrants who need it have access to English language and literacy classes that adequately equip them for living in Australia and participating fully in our communities. There is plenty of evidence that the 510 hours of English language education currently provided to non-English migrants is woefully inadequate, particularly for people from non-literate backgrounds.
Labor will be supporting the bill, but our approach to its introduction will be very different to that of the government should we win the upcoming election. Labor will place a strong emphasis on English language education and preparation for employment. Labor will spend almost $50 million to improve and expand English language tuition. We will introduce a traineeship in English and work preparation designed to allow new entrants to develop skills, knowledge and experience in Australian workplaces as well as allowing them to continue their English language education. Our new residents will then be better equipped to apply for jobs. Working in meaningful employment or having some family members in employment is the best way for people to learn and accept all aspects of their new nation’s culture.
Labor acknowledges the concerns expressed by many that this test could be abused in the future because so much power with regard to its application lies with the minister, who will approve by written determination the content of the test and specify what grade must be earned to complete the test successfully, and who may decide that certain mandatory questions must be answered correctly. With such important elements of this legislation being left to the discretion of the minister it is possible for the test to be abused by any future government. This test has the potential to be used to stop people from particular ethnic backgrounds from becoming Australian citizens. That is a very concerning possibility and one the parliament must be vigilant to prevent.
The introduction of the new citizenship test has the potential to disadvantage or frighten off many prospective citizens; therefore, there must be great caution taken in its implementation. The test must be matched with support and resources to help new migrants become fully engaged in Australian society. We also need to monitor the implementation and outcomes of this legislation. Accordingly, I urge the Senate to agree to Labor’s very sensible amendments which go to that issue of ministerial review of the efficacy and outcomes of the new testing regime.
The concerns expressed by those who are anxious about the impact of this bill may have been laid to rest if the detail of the legislation had been provided to the Senate. The lack of detail has created uncertainty about what might well have been a less controversial bill. When this detail is provided, we will be able to make a better judgement and assessment of how reasonable the exemptions by the minister are, what questions will be included and the finalised structure of the test.
With the necessary support and resources provided, I hope that the citizenship test will achieve its stated objectives of ensuring applicants understand the nature of their application, possess a useable and useful standard literacy in English and have an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges conferred on them by Australian citizenship. I certainly hope the test achieves those objectives but I also hope it encourages our new citizens to hold onto their own cultures and to share their cultures with the rest of Australia, as has been the case for the whole of Australia’s history.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN CITIZENSHIP AMENDMENT (CITIZENSHIP TESTING) BILL 2007</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2007-08-13,"—On behalf of the minister with principal carriage of the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007, Senator Ellison, may I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the second reading debate. First, may I deal with some questions that have been raised by senators in their speeches on the second reading. Senator Nettle and Senator Hurley both raised the question of the funding of the Adult Migrant English Program. I inform honourable senators of the following matters concerning that program. The government has consistently demonstrated that it is willing to assist in settlement services to assist migrants and humanitarian entrants to settle in Australia and to learn English. In the 2007-08 budget, the government provided an additional $209 million over four years to six Australian government agencies to enhance services for humanitarian entrants. In addition, the Australian government currently spends $285 million annually delivering English language programs to new migrants and refugees.
Funding for the Adult Migrant English Program has increased from $98 million in 2003-04 to $156 million in 2006-07. The government is also considering providing further assistance to help migrants and refugees to prepare to pass the new citizenship test. Under the Adult Migrant English Program, migrants who do not have functional English are legislatively entitled to up to 510 hours of English language tuition or until they reach functional English, whichever comes first. In addition to the 510 hours, under the special preparatory program, humanitarian entrants under 25 years of age with low levels of education can access a further 400 hours. In 2006 the Prime Minister agreed to the formation of an interdepartmental committee (IDC) on English language chaired by DIAC. The IDC recently considered options for the provision of more flexible, vocationally focused and better integrated English language training to meet the needs of migrants and refugees. The government acknowledges that citizenship test preparation assistance funded by the government may need to be made available to the community.
Can I then deal with the question of the test, an issue that was raised by Senator Nettle. The bill refers to ‘a test’, the indefinite article, rather than ‘the test’, the definite article, so that it is clear that more than one test may be approved by the minister. Among other things, this approach means that we are not discriminating on the basis of the type of visa which a prospective citizenship holds. That has never been a factor of Australian citizenship policy and law.
Senator Nettle also raised the question of Senate scrutiny over the determination and test questions; that is, the determination of citizenship and the test on which that determination is based. The government does not believe that the determination, which will approve the content of the new citizenship test and include the test questions, should be subject to the disallowance provision of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 for the following reasons: in the government’s view there is likely to be uncertainty and confusion if potential applicants have sat and passed a test which is then disallowed. There may then be a question about whether such persons would need to re-sit the test in order to satisfy the general eligibility criteria. The determination does not in any event fall within the meaning of a ‘legislative instrument’ as defined by section 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act: it is not of a legislative character; it will not determine the law or alter the content of the law.  I trust those observations meet the concerns raised by individual senators on those matters.
Let me turn to summing up the bill overall. The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Testing) Bill 2007 amends the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 and provides for the introduction of formal citizenship testing for citizenship applicants. People living in Australia enjoy many rights, including equality, before the law, and freedom of religion and expression. Australian citizens also have the right to vote and participate in our democratic processes. We also have responsibilities: we must obey Australia’s laws, respect the common values, and respect the rights and freedoms of others. We are also encouraged to become involved in the community to help make Australia an even better place. The material which will form the basis of the tests will highlight the common values we share as well as our history, heritage, symbols, institutions and laws. It will give migrants to Australia the information they need to better understand what it means to be Australian, their rights as Australian citizens and what is expected of them in return.
The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 requires that applicants for citizenship, by conferral under the general eligibility provision, understand the nature of their application, possess a basic knowledge of the English language, and have an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. This bill provides that these applicants must have successfully completed a test before making an application for citizenship to demonstrate that they meet these requirements. People who are not required to have knowledge of the English language or the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship will not be required to sit the citizenship test. This includes applicants under the age of 18 or those 60 years or over, and those with a permanent physical or mental incapacity which prevents them from understanding the nature of their application. The citizenship test will provide prospective citizens with the opportunity to demonstrate in an objective way that they have knowledge of Australia, including the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship and a basic knowledge of English. The requirement to sit a test will encourage them to obtain the knowledge that will support successful integration into Australian society and enable them to maximise the opportunities Australia has to offer.
Concerns have been raised regarding the power in the bill that allows for a ministerial determination to establish eligibility criteria for sitting a test. Specifically, the concern is that a determination may establish eligibility criteria that are inappropriate and unfair, with no parliamentary scrutiny and no opportunity for disallowance. Legal advice confirms that the determination-making power in proposed section 23A does not allow for the setting of eligibility criteria for sitting the test that are inconsistent with the provisions of the act and, in particular, the general eligibility criteria in section 21(2). For example, a determination could not legally provide that only people of French-speaking background are eligible to sit a test.
The power is required for two purposes. One is to ensure that the resources available for testing are used only for prospective citizens. The second is to enable access to any special test that may be needed to be limited to those for whom the special test is intended. In this regard the bill refers to ‘a test’ rather than ‘the test’ so that it is clear that more than one test may be approved by the minister. This is the issue which I addressed earlier. The introduction of formal testing will be carefully monitored to identify those prospective citizens for whom an alternative test or tests may be appropriate. This approach will enable the development of an alternative test or tests to be designed on the basis of an identified need rather than conjecture. To help alleviate the concerns about test eligibility criteria, the government has proposed the insertion of a note to explain that the power to set eligibility criteria to sit a test cannot be inconsistent with the act and, in particular, general eligibility criteria for citizenship.
I will now address the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which recently completed an inquiry into the bill. I acknowledge, Mr Acting Deputy President Barnett, that you chair that important Senate committee. The first recommendation was that the operation of the testing regime be reviewed three years after the bill’s commencement. As has been stated publicly, the test will be monitored closely, particularly for the first six months, to determine whether any patterns emerge suggesting a particular cohort has difficulties with the test. The government agrees with the committee’s recommendation that a formal review of the testing regime should be conducted three years after commencement of testing.
The second recommendation was to table the proposed citizenship test questions in parliament. The rationale behind making the test questions confidential is to provide an incentive for people to read the citizenship test resource book, which will help them gain an understanding of the concepts contained in the book. Publicising the questions will serve to promote rote learning of the answers; for this reason the test questions will remain confidential and will not be tabled in parliament.
The third recommendation was that clause 23A(1) of the bill be amended to specifically require that the test relate to the eligibility criteria in proposed sections 21(2)(d), (e) and (f). Legal advice has confirmed there is no ambiguity with this subsection of the bill. However, to ensure no further conjecture about this issue, the government has proposed the insertion of a note that will explain that citizenship tests must be related to the general eligibility criteria in the new sections 21(2)(d), (e) and (f). These criteria require applicants to have an understanding of the nature of the application for citizenship, to possess a basic knowledge of the English language and to have an adequate knowledge of Australia, including the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship.
Concern has been raised that the content of a citizenship test, including the questions and answers, may be unreasonable. It is important to note that, with the exception of knowledge of Australia, these requirements for citizenship under the general eligibility provisions, which applicants will be required to demonstrate by successful completion of a test, are longstanding. Indeed, the requirement to have a knowledge of the English language has been a feature of Australian citizenship legislation since its commencement on 26 January 1949. It is also the case that most adult applicants for citizenship, including refugee and humanitarian entrants, have been required to satisfy those requirements. The bill will introduce an objective form of assessment as to whether an individual satisfies these requirements. As has been noted previously, the test questions will be designed to test knowledge contained in the citizenship resource book, which will be freely and widely available to all.
In summary, this bill will ensure that new citizens have the necessary knowledge of the Australian way of life to which they are required to commit. This will aid their successful integration into our society. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question negatived.
 (Senator Barnett)—The question now is that this bill be read a second time.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2007-08-13,"—Tonight I want to comment on the Tasmanian Labor government’s administration and specifically to say that, in my view, it is a frightening dress rehearsal of how a Rudd Labor government would operate if it wins this year’s election. The Tasmanian Labor government is embarking on a 10-year nearly $1 billion replacement of the Royal Hobart Hospital, which may or may not be a grandiose waste of money, while it wants to close down two very small hospitals by comparison at Ouse and Rosebery, despite their isolation. It has also recently announced a $5 million upgrade for the George Town Hospital redevelopment. In May the state Labor government announced as part of their primary health plan for Tasmania the closure from 20 September this year of sub-acute beds at the Rosebery District Hospital. Few other details were announced. The state government also announced that the hospital at Ouse would close with in-patient and aged care beds being shifted to New Norfolk, leaving the former hospital and aged care home with respite beds, a day centre, on-call facilities and a room for GP visits. The aged care beds are being removed at Ouse by truck and the rooms locked. The first bed was removed on 9 July—separating residents from their families.
I want to put on the record the Tasmanian budget figures which makes it clear that Rosebery District Hospital has a deficit of some $241,786 or just 17.14 per cent of the latest budget. Compare that with the St Helens Hospital where the deficit is 28 per cent of this financial year’s budget or with the Flinders Island multi-purpose centre which has a cost overrun of almost 43 per cent. Yet in Rosebery we have a company, whose name is Zinifex, employing many hundreds of Tasmanians that pays approximately $18 million in payroll tax and royalties to the state government. Yet the government cannot find $240,000-odd to allow the hospital at Rosebery to continue. Likewise, what are the facts with respect to the Ouse District Hospital? The Ouse hospital rates as the second-best performing district hospital and aged care facility in Tasmania with a deficit this last financial year of $106,766 or just 7.12 per cent of the 2007-08 budget. The truth is that the Rosebery and Ouse hospitals provide vital health services for their region and do not do too badly economically. But this state government is treating them with disrespect and an arrogance the like of which has not been seen before. People in remote communities do not deserve to be treated like last frontier pioneer settlers. This is the 21st century, and their taxes should have the same currency as the taxes paid by the residents of Hobart.
So, who is next on the state government hit list? While the state Minister for Health may deny any plans for further regional hospital rationalisation, it is apparent that there will be future cuts and closures, given that Ouse and Rosebery are among the top performing regional hospitals in Tasmania. Who will be next? I recently went with the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team from Sorell down to the Tasman Peninsula where I visited the Tasman Multi-Purpose Health Centre, and then later in the day I visited, with Ben Quin, the federal Liberal candidate for the Lyons electorate, the multipurpose health centre at Oatlands. I have also received anonymous calls from the Beaconsfield multipurpose centre expressing extreme concern about the fears they have with regard to future funding from the state government. Will it be the Flinders Island, King Island, Deloraine, St Helens, Beaconsfield or the Midlands multipurpose centre? Will it be New Norfolk, Campbell Town, Smithton or even St Marys? All of those have reason to be concerned. I know that the people at Oatlands and some of these other district hospitals are scared witless because they do not know who is next under the state Labor government’s administration of health services in our state of Tasmania.
Is all this necessary, especially given the $45 million a year windfall the state will enjoy after the Prime Minister’s announcement of the Mersey hospital intervention at Latrobe near Devonport? Freed-up state health funds should be diverted to keeping Ouse and Rosebery hospitals fully functional. That should be a priority. What about the angst and trauma among the elderly residents and their families specifically at Ouse? It is so unnecessary. I attended a rally firstly at Rosebery on 19 July together with the federal Liberal candidate for Lyons, Ben Quin, and the state Lyons MP, Rene Hidding, the former leader. That rally at Rosebery was well attended with over 200 people rallying to the cause to say, ‘Save our hospital.’ Workers from the Zinifex mine came out to join the rally and say, ‘We are with you.’ In fact, we had hard-core unionists at that Rosebery rally who said that Labor was dead politically on the west coast of Tasmania if state Labor downgraded the hospital.

Senator George Campbell interjecting—

— The clock is ticking because on 20 September that hospital will be downgraded—Senator George Campbell, make no mistake about that. Let us look at what happened at the Ouse public rally on 31 July that I again attended with Ben Quin, the federal Liberal candidate for the Lyons electorate, who is standing up for these isolated communities. Where is federal Labor; where is state Labor? They have a contrary view, a contrary objective.
At that meeting was the Tasmanian opposition leader, Will Hodgman, the state opposition health spokesman, Brett Whiteley, and the opposition legal spokesman, Michael Hodgman—no Labor MP, state or federal, to be seen. They did not have the guts to come and face the community and say, ‘Yes. We want to downgrade your health services right here.’ I did a letterbox drop to support those efforts at Ouse and Rosebery, and they were both supported by Ben Quin, the federal Liberal candidate. Who did we meet at Ouse? Who came to this public meeting? We had Mrs Weeding; she is 94 years old. She is a resident of the Ouse aged-care facilities. She has been married for 75 years. She was born and bred in that community and now she is being kicked out with her husband from that aged-care facility in Ouse. It stinks. It is shameful.

Senator Ellison interjecting—


Senator Kemp interjecting—

—That is right, Senator Ellison and Senator Kemp. It is a shameful display. It is a shameful disrespect to these people who have been married for 75 years. I met Mrs Weeding and looked her in the eye. She has got guts and determination, but she was very remorseful at the decisions of the state Labor government; it is very sad indeed. Mrs Bannister was also there from the aged-care facility at Ouse to show support and camaraderie for the local people. A busload of people drove down from Rosebery to support this event. The mayor of the west coast drove down through the fog, snow and ice to support the people of Ouse. Rosebery and Ouse have shown camaraderie. These communities have rallied and have joined together to say, ‘We will fight this state Labor government decision.’ I congratulate Will Hodgman for standing up that night. At that Ouse meeting he publicly confirmed that the state Liberal government in the future will restore funding and services for those two hospitals, and this was received with acclaim by the audience.
There is plenty of money in the state budget coffers for these health facilities. They have got an extra $220 million over the last five years to run their hospitals. They have got rivers of GST gold flowing into Tasmania. It comes in thick and fast, with this year $80 million extra in windfall gains and $100 million on average into the future. There is money, but what is the priority? Who is next?
I want to pay a tribute in particular to the Ouse committee: Ann Jones, Charlotte Pitt, Sue Booth, Tash Farrow, Andrew Downie, Michael Ball, mayor Deidre Flint, Ross Mace, Tracey Turale, Colleen Smith and Dr Swarz. In Rosebery are: Paul O’ Brien—a fantastic effort, Paul; Richard Spurr—thank you; Margaret and Ivan Compton, Margaret Smith, Beverly Moyle, Geoffrey Eastwood—thank you, Geoffrey, for your work and feedback, and we are sorry about the way your mother has been treated so disgracefully by this state government in her concerns at the Rosebery hospital; Anne Drake; Cris Winskall; Kerry Hay; and Chris Cannell; and there are many others. They have shown complete support for their local communities and dismay at this state government’s actions. West coast mayor Darryl Gerrity, thank you for leadership. You have displayed great determination to stop the brazen arrogance and the dereliction of duty of this state Labor government. (Time expired)

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2007-08-13,"—The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
The Federal Court ordered that Customs pay Mr Eberle’s costs at an amount agreed between the parties. The court also said that ‘the parties should reach agreement on whether any further consequential relief should be awarded, bearing in mind that the matter before me is an appeal from a decision of the AAT, rather than proceedings for judicial review.’ The outcome of the Federal Court’s decision was that Mr Eberle received the Customs duty he had paid under protest, and paid the duty liable under the fall-back method of valuation.
The court’s jurisdiction on review of an AAT decision does not extend to damages.
