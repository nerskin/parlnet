Mr STEPHEN SMITH
 (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) (09:01):  The government is committed to providing regular reports and updates on Afghanistan, including and in particular to the parliament. This year I have reported to the House on three prior occasions, in March, May and July.


I last reported to the House on 7 July, which followed my attendance at the meeting of NATO and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) defence ministers' meeting in Brussels in June, the beginning of the northern summer fighting season, United States President Obama's statement on Afghanistan on 23 June and the commencement of transition to Afghan-led security. My report on this occasion follows my visit to Afghanistan on 3 October and my attendance at last week's NATO and ISAF defence ministers' meeting in Brussels on 5 and 6 October. 




Why we are there



My visit to Afghanistan and my attendance at the NATO/ISAF defence ministers' meeting in Brussels has reinforced the government's view that it is in our national interest to be in Afghanistan, not just with our alliance partner the United States (US), but also with 47 other members of ISAF acting under a United Nations mandate.


Australia's fundamental goal is to prevent Afghanistan from again being used by terrorists to plan and train for attacks on innocent civilians, including Australians in our own region and beyond. Last month's commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks was a sober reminder that there are serious and horrifying consequences if international terrorists are allowed to operate unchecked.


It is therefore imperative that we remain focussed on our goal to help prepare the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) to take lead responsibility for providing security for the Afghan people. To do so we must continue in our efforts to stabilise the security situation and to mentor and train the Afghan security forces. To leave now would be to put at risk the gains so hard fought for and won.




ISAF campaign progress



In Afghanistan and Brussels I met senior NATO/ISAF commanders and my defence ministerial colleagues from a number of NATO/ISAF contributing countries including Afghanistan, the United States and the United Kingdom. Ministers and commanders are confident of the good progress that is being made in Afghanistan. We are now seeing results from a clear strategy, appropriate resources and a realistic transition time line. Afghan and ISAF forces have stalled, then reversed, the Taliban's momentum. This fighting season, the Taliban has been unable to retake any ground in Oruzgan, or indeed across Afghanistan. The transition to Afghan-led security commenced with the handover of seven provinces and districts to Afghan-led security in July this year. This process has not been reversed by the Taliban.


In my March update to parliament, I warned that we had to expect the Taliban to fight back through high-profile, propaganda motivated attacks. Regrettably these high-profile attacks have come to pass. While the Taliban have not been successful at the tactical or operational level, high-profile attacks have occurred with a high civilian casualty toll and the terrible loss of former Afghan President and Chairman of the High Peace Council, Professor Rabbani. These high-profile attacks are aimed at undermining confidence in Afghanistan and sapping political will in the international community:


undermining confidence in the minds of the Afghan people that the ANSF will not be able to provide them with security; and


sapping the political will of the international community in the United States, in Europe and in Australia by distracting from the real progress we are making.


Australia condemns these civilian casualties. A failed insurgent attack on Oruzgan province Governor Shirzad on 28 July resulted in the deaths of 16 civilians, including 12 children killed in a callous way. There have been more such instances across Afghanistan. As the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Steffan di Mistura, advised the NATO/ISAF defence ministers' meeting in Brussels, around 85 per cent of civilian casualties are caused by the Taliban. Afghanistan and the international community need to make clear that the change of tactics by the Taliban to mount such high-profile, propaganda motivated attacks and suicide-bomb assassinations is a sign of Taliban weakness not strength.




O
ruzgan campaign progress



During my visit to Afghanistan, I visited Australian troops serving in Oruzgan province in the south of Afghanistan. I met Australian troops at the multinational base in Tarin Kowt and Patrol Base Wali in the Mirabad Valley and again thanked them for their excellent work. I met with Australian and United States operational commanders in Oruzgan province, including the United States Commander of Combined Team Uruzgan, Colonel Robert Akam. I also met with Oruzgan Governor Shirzad and his provincial security chiefs; the Commander of the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army, Brigadier Zafar; the Provincial Chief of Police, Brigadier Mattiullah Khan; and the Provincial Chief of the National Directorate of Security, Colonel Khan Muhammed.


In Oruzgan, Australian troops are working under an International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) flag with their colleagues from the United States, Singapore and Slovakia in Combined Team Uruzgan. Their mission is to train the Afghan security forces to take on lead responsibility for security by 2014. They are well on track and making good progress to achieve that objective. ISAF, working closely with Afghan partners, has expanded its security footprint across Oruzgan to encompass over 30 operating bases and checkpoints. In turn, this has allowed the Afghan government to expand its influence and provision of basic services to the people of the province. Since 2008, Australia has increased its effort from the mentoring of a single kandak (battalion) to mentoring six kandaks plus the brigade headquarters.


At times the Australian Defence Force (ADF) has had a presence in more than a dozen different bases in Oruzgan. Due to the increasing size and effectiveness of Afghan forces in Oruzgan, ISAF is progressively transitioning control of these checkpoints and operating bases to Afghan counterparts. This has included the recent handover of three patrol bases to Afghan forces. By the first half of next year, 2012, it is anticipated that the Australian Mentoring Task Force (AMTF) will be in a position to reduce its footprint to as few as four main locations in Oruzgan, with mobile mentoring teams able to assist Afghan partners at their operating bases for periods as required.


Australian forces continue to make important progress towards training the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade so that it can take responsibility for security in Oruzgan. As part of this work, on the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force, the government has authorised a number of Mentoring Task Force personnel to continue the training and mentoring of the 6th Kandak of the 4th Brigade in northern Kandahar, south of the Oruzgan border.


The 4th Brigade has increasingly assumed the lead for the planning, preparation and execution of tactical operations, allowing Australian forces to concentrate on mentoring and partnering Afghan command and combat support functions. The 4th Brigade is also demonstrating progress towards operating independently, with a number of infantry kandaks now expected to be capable of conducting independent operations by early 2012.


On current advice and projections, the 4th Brigade, as a whole, is expected to be operationally viable and ready for provincial transition by 2014. As my predecessor and I have previously advised the House and the Senate, Australian Special Forces are authorised to operate in adjoining provinces on operations that have security benefits in Oruzgan province. This involves operations to maintain pressure on insurgent leadership in Oruzgan, and its surrounding provinces including Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul and Daykundi.


So far this year, our Special Forces have conducted around 40 out-of-province operations, directly contributing to the security of Oruzgan and facilitating our ongoing training mission. Australian Special Forces and their Afghan partners, the Provincial Response Company (PRC) and the National Interdiction Unit (NIU), also continue to disrupt the insurgency in and around Oruzgan province by taking insurgent leaders and bomb makers off the battlefield and reducing the insurgency revenue stream from narcotics. This has helped create the environment necessary for ISAF forces to finalise their training mission and to create a safer environment for the Afghan people in Oruzgan.


Weapons cache finds have increased significantly and there has been some success in interdicting the movement of Taliban forces and supplies from Pakistani tribal areas across the border into Afghanistan. Australia's support to the NIU has reduced the insurgency's ability to fund its campaign by targeting the sale of narcotics. This support, commencing at the Afghan government's request, has led to a series of successful operations in and around Oruzgan. In September, the Afghan National Security Forces, supported by Australia's Special Forces, seized and destroyed a record amount of drug products in southern Afghanistan.




Transition



My visit to Afghanistan also confirmed that the international community is on track to achieve nationwide transition of security-led responsibility to the Afghan National Security Forces by the end of 2014. In July, Afghanistan and the international community welcomed the formal start of the transition process in the first tranche of provinces and districts across Afghanistan. This marked an important step towards President Karzai's objective that Afghan authorities assume lead responsibility across Afghanistan by the end of 2014.


The first tranche of provinces and districts to have transitioned to Afghan-led security accounts for around 20 to 25 per cent of the Afghan population. President Karzai is expected to announce the second tranche of districts and provinces for transition later this month. When this second tranche of transition occurs, Afghan security forces will provide lead security for up to 50 per cent, half, of the Afghan population. Subsequent tranches will see international forces continue the process of handing over the lead security responsibility across the country. The Taliban will continue to test the transition process through more high-profile attacks and assassination attempts.


Australia is confident that the Afghan National Security Forces will continue to demonstrate their resolve and growing capability by standing up to and against such violence. In Oruzgan, as I have previously indicated, we continue to do well in training and mentoring the 4th Brigade of the ANA. We are confident that we can transition to Afghan-led responsibility in Oruzgan by 2014.




Post-
t
ransition



As the international community looks ahead, ISAF must maintain its Lisbon summit commitment to transition to Afghan-led security by 2014. Likewise, both NATO and the United States must maintain their commitment to a long-term, enduring strategic partnership with Afghanistan. NATO and the United States confirmed their long-term commitments at the defence ministers' meeting in Brussels last week. NATO and ISAF defence ministers welcomed the outline of the NATO Strategic Plan for Afghanistan which sets out the proposed approach to the NATO/ISAF presence in Afghanistan for the 2012 to 2014 period, and, most importantly, for the post 2014 period. This continuing long-term commitment and continued investment in Afghanistan's future is a key to ensuring that Afghanistan and its neighbours—including Pakistan—also invest in a peaceful future for Afghanistan.


It is important to begin work on the post 2014 period now. Not to set this out soon will undermine what we have achieved, jeopardise Afghan confidence in the international community's long-term commitments to their country and send the wrong message to regional neighbours, in particular Pakistan. Australia looks forward to continued work on the strategic plan ahead of the Chicago summit in May next year.


Australia has made clear it expects to maintain a presence in Afghanistan after our current training and mentoring mission has concluded, potentially through institutional training, a Special Forces presence, military advisers, capacity building and development assistance. Important into the future will be continued international community support for the Afghan National Security Forces. The international community must ensure the Afghan National Security Forces are provided with the resources they need to maintain security into the future.




Conclusion



Australia has lost 29 members of the Australian Defence Force in Afghanistan. Since my last update to the parliament, Private Matthew Lambert died as a result of an improvised explosive device attack on 22 August. We remember him and express our condolences to his spouse, his family and his friends.


In this period, New Zealand has also lost two fine soldiers with the tragic fatalities of Corporal Douglas Grant and Lance Corporal Leon Smith. I conveyed Australia's condolences to my New Zealand counterpart, Dr Wayne Mapp, New Zealand's Minister for Defence, at the time. I was pleased that Australia was able to assist with the initial transportation through our C130s with the repatriation of both Corporal Grant and Lance Corporal Smith to New Zealand.


New Zealand is doing excellent work and making an important contribution to the international community's efforts in Afghanistan through the provincial reconstruction team in Bamiyan province and support to the Afghanistan National Police Crisis Response Unit in Kabul. At this time of tragic loss on both sides of the Tasman, we remember our losses with our age-old refrain, so fitting for our Anzacs, 'Lest We Forget.'


With these terrible tragedies, we must continue to be clear sighted about our objective in Afghanistan. Our objective is to prevent Afghanistan, in particular the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, from again becoming a safe haven for terrorists.


We will not be in Afghanistan forever, and we are on track to transition to Afghan-led responsibility for security arrangements in Oruzgan in 2014. It is important that the international community now begin work on planning for the post-2014 commitment in Afghanistan. This will send the right signal to Afghanistan and its neighbours to invest in a peaceful future for Afghanistan.


I table a paper in conjunction with my ministerial statement, and I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Fadden to speak for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr STEPHEN SMITH:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Fadden speaking in reply to the ministerial statement for a period not exceeding 15 minutes.


Question agreed to.

"Robert, Stuart, MP",LP,2011-10-13,"



Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (09:16):  I thank the Minister for Defence for honouring his word and for continuing to keep this parliament informed on the progress of combat operations in Afghanistan. Indeed, true to the minister's word, this is his fourth update this year, building on updates in March, May, 7 July and of course today.


It is important that we in the coalition restate our very strong bipartisan support to the government in the prosecution of war against Islamic terrorism and insurgency within Afghanistan. It is also important to state that this support is not borne of necessity but of conviction. We believe, as we always have, that the maxim that 'all it takes for evil to prosper is for good men to do nothing' holds true. And good nations, Australia included, will continue to join with 47 other freedom-loving countries of the world to raise this standard high.


El Salvador's recent commitment to the fight is encouraging and demonstrates that the majority of the true democratic countries of the world are now standing shoulder to shoulder in Afghanistan. This global bipartisanship has one over-arching goal—to ensure that insurgent elements within Afghanistan can no longer use that country to extend their hate and violence across the free world. I join with the minister in acknowledging that this is indeed within our national interest. This fight in Afghanistan that we have been engaged in for so many years is in our national interest, and the coalition will not shirk our responsibility in this regard.


Australia's mission within Afghanistan remains limited and discrete. Principally, the mentoring task force—currently mentoring task force 3, based on the infantry battalion commanded by Colonel Smith—is training and mentoring the Afghan National Army, principally the 4th Brigade, in elements of the Afghan National Police. We are currently providing a substantial special operations task group—indeed, the third largest contingent of special operations currently in theatre. We provided limited rotary wing and heavy-lift support and of course a range of imbedded officers to a range of joint ISAF commands.


However, the major tasks of training and mentoring the ANA and disrupting, dismantling and destroying the insurgency through the use of the SOTG remains hard going. Be under no doubt that this enemy is tough and resilient. There is little tangible sign at present that they are ready to give in or indeed to negotiate. The minister talks of being 'confident of the good progress that is being made'. We hope and pray that his confidence is right. We certainly join him in sharing a cautious optimism but also acknowledge that there is much to do before a handover to full Afghan National Army commander control across the province in 2014. Regardless, the minister can rely on the opposition's support in this critical task.


I note recent media reports citing comments from the current Australian Commander of Joint Task Force 633, Major General Angus Campbell, that the ANA will require substantial support post 2014 to be truly ready to plan and conduct operations. Notwithstanding any comment on the veracity of those reports, it is important to note that our commander, Major General Campbell, is an experienced and respected commander, and the coalition has always held to the view that the ADF drawdown must be metrics based and command judgment led. Indeed, the minister has previously stated that a metrics based drawdown will be the order of the day.


The coalition therefore acknowledges and accepts that our nation will maintain a logistics, training and special force element in overwatch within Afghanistan post the 2014 substantial drawdown. This will include elements of the provincial reconstruction team and may include capacity-building elements in governance, electoral matters and administration. It is important that we understand that a nation such as Afghanistan, still on its knees, needs its friend's hand until that nation can firmly get on its feet. We will not abandon Afghanistan. We have expended much treasure, much toil and much blood fighting to ensure that the world can enjoy freedom from those who would seek to do it harm. So the fight ahead will be hard. The high-profile attacks against former President and Chairman of the High Peace Council, Professor Rabbani, and the increase in suicide in Kabul are a case in point. These attacks mark a tactical change in the insurgent engagement in high-value public killings. As a people in this country, as Australians, we universally and utterly condemn the suicide attacks and the numerous assaults on innocent civilians. A cowardly enemy that resorts to appalling tactics on children is an enemy that deserves to be defeated.


In my previous response to the minister in this place I remarked that of the over 30 forward-operating bases and patrol bases the vast bulk, indeed, as many as 22 or 23, are manned only by Afghan National Army soldiers. If the MTF is on track to increase this number to 26 by mid-2012, as the minister stated, and that Australian Defence Force personnel will man only four, this will be a real achievement. The ink blot approach of providing security across the population centres in Oruzgan province would appear to be linking up. The move towards mobile mentoring teams to provide assistance to the ANA kandaks is a positive step. We are cautiously optimistic.


I make the point that MTF 3 has done an outstanding job in building on the work of MTF 2. MTF 2 did a substantial amount of work in finding a range of caches and removing weapons systems and IED components from the battlefield. MTF 3 has built on this brilliantly. The Taliban has not regained any substantial initiative or indeed combat capability whilst MTF 3 has been in theatre. Indeed, all indications are that the average life expectancy of a Taliban commander who dares to enter Oruzgan is no more than five days, with the majority of commanders seeking to stay in refuge in Pakistan and to issue orders to their underlings and soldiers from the safety of that area. It does not take a rocket scientist to realise that young Taliban soldiers are not particularly impressed with their commanders hiding in Pakistan.


We certainly welcome the new deputy CTU, Colonel Ben James, a colleague of mine, and thank the previous deputy commander of CTU, Colonel Smith, for his tremendous work in being the second-in-command of ostensibly a brigade sized response within Oruzgan.


In July this year, in the third of the ministerial responses, the minister noted that the first provincial transitions in the north of Afghanistan were occurring. Something like 25 per cent of the population, by the end of July and early August, was actually being protected by full Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police control. There is every indication that President Karzai will seek to announce the second in a range of provincial handovers in the coming weeks. This may take the Afghan command and control of provinces up to 50 per of the country. It is certainly a welcome move.


It is important to note also that a coalition government will continue to reach out to Pakistan and support Pakistani counterterrorism and military efforts to improve security within that country and indeed the region. We will continue to provide the very best officer training at the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and stand ready to provide further support to Pakistan if required. Our nation's support post the floods in 2010 in Pakistan is testimony to our enduring concern for Pakistan and its people. Pakistan and Australia are not just good cricket sparring partners; we are friends. We are friends who also acknowledge the complexities of Pakistan, and we certainly join the international community in encouraging Pakistan to do whatever they can to continue to disrupt the insurgent elements within their borders.


I thank the minister for the equipment improvements that have been going into the theatre in Afghanistan since July. Moving the Giraffe, the counter rocket, artillery and mortar system, further into patrol bases is a substantial and good move that provides real and tangible benefits. The work in digger works in actually providing a colonel, in this case Colonel Blain, to oversee the equipment improvement that soldiers would seek to have is another good move, as is a range of the other equipment being put into theatre.


I acknowledge the Minister for Defence Materiel for his work in looking at greater Australian content and putting some teeth into the priority industry capability of defence apparel and ensuring that boots, clothes and hats are majority Australian content. I also call on the minister to widen that to include body armour, helmets and a range of combat clothing and accessories. A core competency of us as a manufacturing nation must be to outfit our combat soldiers on the ground with the very best of equipment.


I thank the minister for his continued updates on detainee management. Over the last three and four times we have spoken in this House on this matter I have continued to reiterate to the minister that our detainee management policy has to mirror that of our coalition partners. At present, we can only detain those within Afghanistan for four days, whereas our coalition partners can detain for periods in excess of that. It is interesting to note that under Australian domestic terror laws we can actually detain for longer than four days. I would hope that the minister would continue to look at adjusting detainee management policy to bring the amount of time that Australian forces can detain those on the battlefield in line with our coalition partners.


I join the minister in acknowledging the tragic loss of 29 soldiers in combat operations in Afghanistan. Since we both last spoke in this place on this matter, Private Matthew Lambert has been tragically killed. In August in this House we appropriately and properly paid condolences to Private Matthew Lambert, his family and his friends. I made the point that, when Private Lambert arrived in Afghanistan as part of MTF 3, his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Smith, addressed the soldiers and said to them, 'You haven't yet earned the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the soldiers of MTF 2, but you will. I am confident that we will build on their successes and that each and every one of you will work hard to emulate and expand on their achievements.'


I went on further to say that Private Lambert's unstinting service earned him the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with any in our grand military heritage, because he served in the most remote part of the province, in Patrol Base Anaconda in the Khas Oruzgan Valley. He served in the rough, in areas barely accessible by vehicle. He patrolled the valleys on foot, he manned the battlements and he mentored the Afghan soldiers he lived and fought with. He did everything asked of him in some of the most inhospitable terrain on earth, and he did it at night, in the rain, in the cold, in the heat and in the dust. Private Lambert embodied everything the 2nd Battalion is known for. Duty first. We know his deeds, and today we honour his name—a name known not only by us but known by a family who loved him, by a regiment who trained him, by the men who fought with him, by the medic who cradled him, by the pilot who flew him and by the doctors and nurses who did everything to save him. This is the great military that serves us today in our name. These are the great men and women in combat operations in Afghanistan that seek to fight for freedom where terrorism is simply a byword. They deserve our nation's absolute and enduring support.


I also acknowledge the loss of two brave soldiers from New Zealand from across the trench, and as a nation we mourn with that country.


It is important that we do not lose heart and do not lose resolve. I say to the government and echo the words of the previous joint task force commander in 2010: Minister, in government do not get the wobbles. You enjoy strong bipartisan support. You have a competent and exceptionally well-trained military. You have great commanders on the battlefield and also back here at home. You have some of the finest and most courageous soldiers, sailors and air men and women anywhere in the world. Hold the line and finish the job.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (09:32):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Today I introduce a bill which will amend the Corporations Act 2001 to better protect consumers. I am pleased to do so in the presence of so many firefighters who are members of their union and promoting the long-term interests of their members. It is great they are here. These measures which I refer to constitute a growth strategy for the financial planning and advice industry. They are fundamentally about improving consumer confidence and financial advice and, therefore, increasing the propensity of everyday Australians to seek advice. To the Gillard government these amendments are, therefore, both pro-business and pro-consumer. This bill will improve the capacity of the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), to act against unsatisfactory persons and it introduces a requirement for financial advisers to seek their clients' agreement every two years to continue to charge ongoing fees.


The initiatives in the bill implement part of the government's Future of Financial Advice reforms which is its response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' inquiry into financial products and services in Australia that was established in the wake of collapses such as Storm Financial. It was chaired by the member for Oxley. The recent TRIO collapse is also relevant. This bill represents the first part of the FOFA reform package.


Importantly, the bill includes two key measures to enhance consumer protection and instil more trust and confidence in financial planning.


Firstly, the bill sets in place arrangements which require financial advisers to obtain their retail clients' agreement every two years in order to charge them ongoing fees for financial advice (that is the opt-in requirement). Currently, there are some clients of financial advisers that pay ongoing fees for financial advice who receive little or no service. Some clients are unaware of the amount of these fees and continue paying them because they are disengaged. This scenario can arise both where the advice fee is paid via a third party product commission, and directly from the client to adviser. This is occurring despite the fact that most ongoing advice contracts allow a client to opt-out at any time.


The government's new measure promotes the active renewal by the client to ongoing fees for advice, with opportunities for them to consider whether they are receiving value for money. It also assists disengaged clients from paying ongoing fees that they should not be paying.


The current disclosure of ongoing fees at engagement in the statement of advice the first time you get advice is an insufficient safeguard, because the disclosure is not ongoing after your first meeting with the planner in some cases. A client might be paying fees that were outlined in a statement of advice they received from an adviser years ago.


The basic requirement is that advisers must obtain their clients' agreement to renew at least once every two years.


The renewal notice empowers a client to renew or end the ongoing fee arrangement. If the client does not respond to the renewal notice, they are assumed to have terminated the advice relationship and no further fees can be deducted by the adviser from the client. If an adviser breaches by overcharging after a client has not opted in, they could be subject to a civil penalty. The maximum amount of this civil penalty, which is lower than others in the Corporations Act, reflects the tailoring of the penalty to suit the nature of the offence.


There is considerable flexibility as to when and how advisers obtain the renewal notice. The bill also provides additional grace periods if a client inadvertently opts out by not responding to the renewal notice in time.


The disclosure requirement is an important supplement to the renewal requirement. It includes fee and service information about the previous and forthcoming 12 months, and assists clients to understand whether they are receiving a service from their adviser commensurate with the ongoing fee that they are paying.


The renewal obligation will apply to new arrangements after 1 July 2012, but does not apply to existing clients of financial advisers. However the annual disclosure obligation will apply to all clients of advisers.


Overall, the measure is about the focus being on the client of the financial adviser, and what is in the client's best interest. This is line with the existing practice of many advisers. Not only is this the fair thing for the client, it is also professional best practice. There has been a lot of scaremongering about the cost that this measure will impose on financial advisers, and with this a variety of estimates of that cost. It is a matter of fact that for advisers that charge on a pure fee-for-service basis (that is, per hour or per piece of advice), the renewal measure will impose no cost whatsoever.


It is true that for advisers who have no contact with particular clients for a period of more than two years, then opt-in will impose a cost on that adviser, either in chasing up the client or in losing the business. However, it is not fair to characterise this latter case—the cost of losing business—as a new cost. The cost exists in the system right now, the only difference being that it is the disengaged client—rather than the disengaged adviser—that is currently bearing the cost.


This measure remedies that situation and ensures that the client, and their retirement savings, comes first. I would also like to emphasise at this point that the government undertook a thorough, methodical and open-minded consultation process with industry, consumer advocates and financial services experts. While parties started in significantly different places, I believe that through persistence and negotiation effort we were able to arrive at a destination that has prompted widespread support from the industry, the experts and consumer groups. I would like to record the government's appreciation to key participants in these lengthy but valuable discussions—such as consumer advocate Choice and a number of the retail and industry superannuation funds and their representatives and the Financial Planning Association—who deserve recognition in this place for their professional commitment to improving trust and confidence in financial advice.


Secondly, the bill enhances the capacity of ASIC to supervise the financial services industry and protect investors.


Providers of financial services must be licensed by ASIC as part of facilitating investor confidence that those persons are competent and are of good character. Licensees also have representatives who act on their behalf. 


ASIC has powers to protect the public, including powers to apply a variety of administrative remedies against a licensee (or its representatives) that breach the law.


During the Ripoll inquiry, ASIC raised concern with its ability to protect investors by restricting or removing unscrupulous operators from the industry. A number of factors were impacting on the exercise of ASIC's powers, including decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) relating to when someone 'will' breach the law, the difficulty with removing individuals given the focus on licensees in the Corporations Act and the lack of scope for ASIC to remove representatives in certain circumstances, such as where they are not of good fame and character. 


The changes implement the Ripoll recommendations in this area and will strengthen ASIC's administrative powers as they apply to licensees and representatives to strengthen the gate-keeping function of the licensing regime and extend ASIC's powers to remove unsatisfactory persons from the industry. 


The changes to the licensing and banning thresholds include that ASIC can refuse or cancel a licence, or ban a person, where that person is likely to contravene (rather than breach) the law. ASIC may also remove representatives if they are not competent, of good fame and character or if they are involved in its licensee's breach of the law.


The changes generally align the thresholds for licensing and banning with similar provisions under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, which ASIC also administers.


As with the exercise of any administrative powers, an ASIC decision will be based on the individual circumstances of each case, but would generally take account of factors such as the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the internal controls on the licensee or the person and the previous regulatory record of the person.


Existing review rights in relation to ASIC decisions about licensing and banning continue to apply, including to the AAT.


These changes should result in ASIC exercising its administrative powers more efficiently and effectively to protect investors. The government readily acknowledges that these future financial advice reforms sit firmly beside our commitments to boost and strengthen superannuation. If we are going to encourage Australians to compulsorily to save more for their retirement, we must ensure that the wealth management system is operating in the best interests of people for whose retirement savings incomes they are administering. 


The Gillard government celebrates the demographic fact that Australians are living longer than ever before and that the goal of lifetime income security after someone has retired is a most worthy one that is part of modern Labor's DNA. We want Australians who have worked hard all their life and paid taxes to retire in dignity and comfort and we want them to have real confidence that those who are providing advice on where to invest their savings will do it well. Might I say that we do believe that most financial planners are very professional and we have high confidence in them. I am proud to support and be part of a government which has not shirked the challenge, has taken the proverbial bull by the horns when it comes to the financial planning and advice and is improving this important industry for Australia's future prosperity. But be in no doubt that this government understands that the arc of Australia's economic future will continue to bend towards our strengthened financial services. The Gillard government is a huge supporter of financial services: we believe in the opportunities of the Asian century and the rise and rise of a new middle class throughout Asia. This presents Australia's wealth management and financial services industry with enormous potential.


In summary, the measures in this bill support the key public policy objectives of Future of Financial Advice to improve consumer trust and confidence in the financial advice they receive, and improve professional standards.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (09:56):  I have a few brief remarks in closing this debate on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Amendment (Fair Protection for Firefighters) Bill 2011. Firstly, I note the significance of this House's first co-sponsored bill. The bill is sponsored not only by me but also by the member for Calwell and the member for McMillan and it is seconded by the Independent member for Kennedy. The first-ever bill proceeding through this place that enjoys support right across the chamber is testament to a number of things. It is testament to the independence of the United Firefighters Union, many members of which are here with us in the gallery today, and also the very strong science based case that they have put for this legislation.


The bill also reflects an understanding right across this chamber that many of the firefighters who will be affected by this bill do put their lives on the line for us in some very obvious ways. It is an extremely risky job to go into a burning building to rescue someone and then to extinguish the fire. But what the science shows, what the firefighters have demonstrated to us and what the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee has endorsed is that the risks do not stop there. Indeed, it is often the case that the after-effects of repeated exposure to the kinds of chemicals that are found especially in structural fires can be just as lethal as the fires themselves.


What is clear from the science put to the now concluded Senate inquiry into this bill is that, when firefighters are repeatedly exposed to the toxic cocktail of 70,000 synthetic chemicals in the average home fire because it seeps in through their uniforms, no matter how good the uniforms are, although firefighters might start the job 20 per cent healthier than the average member of the population they can find themselves after five years, for example, having up to twice the risk of leukaemia and a much greater case risk of cancers like testicular cancer.


The firefighters union, through the campaign it conducted to bring this matter to the attention of the House, has convinced all of us, no matter where we sit in this chamber, that we should be doing what we can to protect those who protect us. The Senate committee did recommend there be some amendments to the bill but did recommend that the bill be passed. It is my anticipation that the second reading of this bill will now pass through the House. We will have the opportunity Monday fortnight to consider some of the amendments. It will then come back here the following Thursday and I anticipate it will still continue to enjoy the support of everyone right across this chamber so that we can hopefully, if all proceeds well in the other place, have this legislation in place by the end of the year. I think it will be a remarkable testament to this parliament that we finish the year with a co-sponsored bill that is about protecting those in the community who protect us. So together, I know, with many others in this place—and I am sure many of those in the gallery—I commend the bill to the House.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (10:00):  by leave—My comments will be exceptionally brief. I told my staff when I saw this bill that, no, we are not going to vote for it. We are not Santa Claus here to be handing out money, pay and conditions to everyone who wants some extra pay and conditions. Jen Eliot, my chief of staff, said, 'No, you will read the scientific basis for this request,' and she forced me to read the scientific analysis and data put together by the United Firefighters Union. Having read that, there was no way that I could then shy away from backing the bill. It was an unassailable case.


In making that statement, I want to pay a very fine tribute to the firefighters union here. It is very seldom that we in this place get a case put as professionally and as scientifically as that. They fought like tigers to stay out and away from amalgamation, and that decision has served this union well. It is a very good decision today, and we thank the honourable member Mr Bandt for bringing it forward. But most of all I think that it is a tribute to good unionism. Unions seem to get criticised almost universally throughout the Australian media these days and all of us are intimidated and do not come forward and praise a union these days.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat—Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport and Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing) (10:28):  On behalf of the Minister for Health and Ageing, I move:


That, in accordance with section 10B of the Health Insurance Act 1973, the House approves the Health Insurance (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Amendment Determination 2011 (No. 3) which was made on 26 September 2011, and presented to the House on 11 October 2011.


The Health Insurance (Extended Medicare Safety Net) Amendment Determination 2011 (No. 3) makes two changes to caps on benefits under the extended Medicare safety net. It indexes all existing capped items by the June quarter consumer price index, from 1 January 2012. In addition, it places caps on the benefits payable through the extended Medicare safety net for two new Medicare items for varicose veins. These caps were recommended by the independent expert Medical Services Advisory Committee and place an upper limit on the amount of benefit that can be paid under the extended Medicare safety net. As I said, this determination has two parts. Firstly, it will index existing extended Medicare safety net benefit caps under the consumer price index effective from 1 January 2012. For items currently subject to an extended Medicare safety net benefit cap, this determination will provide an increase in the maximum Medicare rebates payable for affected services. Items that are currently capped are all obstetric services, selected pregnancy ultrasounds, assisted reproductive technology services, hair transplantation for alopecia, one type of cataract surgery, one type of varicose vein treatment, services to provide facial injections for patients with human immunodeficiency virus and two of the new telehealth items. This determination will increase the caps by the June quarter CPI of 3.6 per cent. For example, for Medicare item 16590, planning and management of a pregnancy, the extended Medicare safety net benefit cap in 2011 was $209.30. After indexation, the maximum amount of benefit that can be paid through the extended Medicare safety net in 2012 for the same item will be $216.85.


Secondly, the determination will introduce extended Medicare safety net benefit caps on two new Medicare benefits scheme items. These items are for laser therapy or ELT which provides minimally invasive treatment for varicose veins. These items will be introduced on 1 November 2011. The Medical Services Advisory Committee, which provides independent expert advice to government, recommended that the MBS funding for ELT be introduced as long as there was a limit on the amount of extended Medicare safety net benefits payable for this service. This is an important determination for the parliament and I commend it to the House.

 (Brand—Special Minister of State for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (10:31):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to parliament: Contamination Remediation works, Former Fire Training Area, RAAF Base Williams, Point Cook, Victoria.


RAAF Base Williams, Point Cook, Victoria covers an area of approximately 344 hectares, part of which borders Port Phillip Bay. It is currently an operating airfield used mostly by civilian aircraft. An area of Point Cook that was formerly used for firefighting training has been identified as a source of contamination. Firefighting training at the site required the use of a range of flammable chemicals to ignite and extinguish old aircraft. A number of known carcinogens and other contaminants toxic to humans and the environment have been identified as present in the soil and discharging via groundwater into Port Phillip Bay. Remediation is required to ensure the protection of human health, and to improve the quality of the groundwater and the Port Phillip Bay marine environment. This can only be achieved by reducing the contaminant concentrations entering the groundwater.


The estimated outturn cost of the proposed work is $27.3 million plus GST. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Defence accepts the recommendations to proceed with the works. Defence accepts in principle the recommendations to develop and maintain a publicly available website containing information regarding contamination on the Defence estate. Defence will consider the best form that information regarding contaminated sites can be made available to the wider public via the internet. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works contractor will be engaged in December 2011, with the works expected to occur between February 2012 and April 2013. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (10:34):  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's report entitled Public Works on Christmas Island.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Ms SAFFIN:
  by leave—The main objective of the committee's visit to Christmas Island was to inspect public works on the island that have been approved in the recent past or are to be referred to the committee in the near future, and to receive updates and briefings about particular projects with a view to reporting back to parliament. The committee has noted the increase in population on Christmas Island, particularly due to irregular maritime arrivals and the Commonwealth agency staff dealing with those arrivals, and sought reassurance that public infrastructure development and investment is keeping pace with need.


The Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government has established the Christmas Island new housing program which aims to provide approximately 40 dwellings to accommodate additional essential Commonwealth agency staff on Christmas Island. This will enable housing currently leased on the private rental market to be released for use by the Christmas Island community. Project 1 of the program is currently underway, with projects 2 and 3 to be referred to the committee in the near future as they come within our competence and purview. The committee is pleased with the progress of this project and appreciates the efforts of departmental officials in keeping the committee informed and updated.


The committee inspected the island's wastewater treatment plant which is currently being upgraded so that it has the capacity to meet current and future demands. The committee was satisfied that the wastewater treatment plant upgrade is necessary to meet the island's needs. However, there were two key aspects of the plant that concerned the committee. My deputy on the committee will talk more about that when he makes his contribution. The concerns were the discharge of treated water and the disposal of sludge. Both relate to the security of the island's freshwater supply. The committee seeks reassurance from all relevant authorities that treated wastewater is not entering the freshwater supply on the island. The committee seeks reassurance from all relevant authorities that adequate measures are taken to ensure that contaminants from sludge are not entering the freshwater supply on the island. The committee also inspected the three immigration detention facilities on Christmas Island, namely North-west Point, Construction Camp and Phosphate Hill. The committee recommends that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship review existing medical facilities and services at the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre at North-west Point, with a view to ensuring that all residents have full access to all medical services in an appropriate and suitable medical centre environment.


It was immediately obvious to the committee that the medical facility at the Construction Camp detention centre is far too small and not fit for purpose. The committee recommends that a fit-for-purpose medical centre be designed and constructed for the Construction Camp detention centre. Design must be completed in consultation with detention centre management, medical staff and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's Health Advisory Group.


The committee also found the existing facilities at the Australian Federal Police headquarters to be inadequate, sub-standard and not fit for purpose. The committee understands that the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government has recognised that a new AFP headquarters is a priority need. The committee recommends that the Australian government move to construct new headquarters for the AFP on Christmas Island as a most urgent priority.


After coming back from Christmas Island and preparing this report with the secretariat, the Deputy Chair of the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Mallee, and I met with the respective ministers concerning immigration and police, Ministers Bowen and O'Connor—we were not able to meet Minister Crean—and we talked to them about the issues before we presented our report. We also have had good cooperation from the department.


In closing, I would like to thank the Deputy Chair, the honourable member for Mallee, and the former Deputy Chair, Senator the Hon. Judith Troeth for their commitment to this visit and subsequent report. The deputy had previously visited Christmas Island some time ago and was very helpful to me on that visit. For their advice and assistance with our visit I especially thank the Christmas Island Administrator, the Christmas Island Shire Council, and officials from the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. I further thank the committee secretariat, particularly Anthony Overs and Thomas Gregory who accompanied the committee to Christmas Island. I commend the report to the House.

Mr FORREST
 (Mallee) (10:40):  by leave—thank you for the opportunity to support the member for Page. What the public do not see are the numerous amount of parliamentary committees that beaver away in the public interest—the Public Works Committee is one that I am immensely proud of having served on it for some time—ensuring that taxpayers' money is properly and well spent and there is good value for money.


Christmas Island over the years has seen the investment of massive amounts of Commonwealth funding with parliamentary approval via the public works process, so it was a good opportunity to visit and recap on some of those projects. I have had concerns for some time that Christmas Island was under enormous pressure in terms of its public infrastructure—that is, power supply, water supply, sewerage treatment, medical health and all those sorts of things. A lot of people do not appreciate the need for these things because latterly they think that all that happens at Christmas Island is the detention of people seeking asylum. In fact, for 100 years Christmas Island has been a major area for the production of fertiliser and that continues to be undertaken on Christmas Island although there is some uncertainty about its ongoing future.


Most of the activity and presence of Australians on Christmas Island now is to do with department of immigration activity. I was really pleased to have an opportunity to visit the island along with the chair of the committee, the member for Page. A concern that continues to worry me though is the water supply and I continue to quote Julius Caesar who always said the first thing to secure is the water supply. If you secure the water supply for the citadel, you ensure its ongoing security.


Christmas Island as a limestone island has a water supply from the tropical rainforest stored underground naturally and this is then extracted for public use. I was a little alarmed to discover that the end result of the sewerage treatment plant, which the Public Works Committee approved in the last parliament, is sludge. It is a solid waste that needs to be disposed of. The most convenient place to dispose of it is on the top of this reservoir of water storage, a limestone ridge at the peak of the landfill site on Christmas Island. So the report quite rightly asked for this matter to be reviewed. All the questions the committee asked whilst on the island received a vacant response as to whether the water supply was secure. That is something that the committee very strongly feels needs to be reviewed immediately.


I will finish my remarks by thanking the committee. I also particularly thank Anthony Overs and Thomas Gregory, who has now moved on to other committees around the parliament, and Dr Alison Clegg. I commend this report to the parliament.

"Cheeseman, Darren, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (10:44):  It is my pleasure today to speak on the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 and the Work Health and Safety (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011. I wish to commence my contribution to this debate by highlighting that the Labor Party has, for a very long time, had a very proud record of supporting people in their workplaces, to ensure that they do have a safe place to go to work and that the employers provide for them all the necessary skills and tools to work within that workplace in a safe way.


Earlier today we were dealing with a private member's piece of legislation that dealt with occupational health and safety issues around firefighters acquiring various cancers as a consequence of the work that they undertake in providing a service to the community and dealing with fires, particularly in structures, and the carcinogens that those firefighters come across.


One of the commitments that Labor took to the 2007 election was to commence a process of harmonising our occupational health and safety laws across this nation. The reason we want to do that is that, despite the fact that we come from a federation, workers are becoming far more mobile than they ever used to be and employers are working across jurisdictions. It is becoming a real problem not only for those workers but also for those employers in having different sets of occupational laws depending in which state a worker might be employed in on any particular day. There are many industries where employees consistently and constantly cross borders, often moving from one jurisdiction to another.


In 2008 we commissioned a review into what model occupational health and safety laws might look like and commenced a process. As a government we received some 242 submissions from state governments and universities, industry groups, individuals and other key stakeholders such as trade unions on what some model occupational health safety laws might look like. I would like to thank all of those who participated in that process. A model act was subsequently developed in September 2009 and was put out for a six-week period for consultation and feedback from all of the stakeholders. Since then we have been working on the necessary legislation and consulting with the states through the ministerial council in terms of those particular laws. And today we are currently debating those draft laws and what they might look like from a Commonwealth perspective.



There will be requirements from the states and territories in order for them to, as they have agreed to do, harmonise their occupational health and safety laws so that they mirror the agreement that we have reached with them. I certainly look forward to the states and territories getting on with that work so that we can develop a consistent set of occupational health and safety laws throughout this nation to provide protection and coverage for workers.


Analysis undertaken by Access Economics estimates that harmonising work health and safety laws will save some 40,000 businesses, which operate across state boundaries, around $179 million per year—providing very substantial savings to the economy, making this nation even more productive. Importantly, this not only will provide great savings for the nation but will also ensure that workers and employers understand more comprehensively the obligations of occupational health and safety and enable the opportunity for employees, particularly those who work across multiple jurisdictions, to have a comprehensive understanding and be able to take measures in accordance with the provisions of these harmonised legislative arrangements to protect their own occupational health safety in work in conjunction, of course, with employers.


In workplaces where occupational health and safety is not a priority, injuries will of course occur. Those injuries are an enormous drain on the productivity of the nation and the productivity of the workplace. It is in everyone's interest that people are protected in the workplace from injury, whether it be physical injury such as back injuries or the like, or whether it be psychological injuries such as stress and the like. It is incumbent on all jurisdictions to work to put in place those arrangements.





(Quorum formed) I might take this opportunity to point out the absolute shameless way that Tony Abbott treated Bernie Banton in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election. Bernie was dying of asbestosis—




Mr SECKER:
  Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, I rise on a point of order. Members should refer to other members of the House by their seat or title.




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition back then treated workers who were dying of asbestosis in a shameful way. It was a blight on this nation. Bernie was a worker, as I understand it, who after many years of working on the wharves had developed asbestosis. In 2007 the then Minister for Health, Tony Abbott, now the Leader of the Opposition, made an outrageous claim that Bernie Banton was only doing what he was for political reasons. The reality is that Bernie was dying of a deadly disease that he suffered because of the work that he undertook for many years, particularly, I think, in New South Wales. The reality is that the Liberal Party and Tony Abbott do not care about the rights of workers in the workplace.




Mr SECKER:
  Madam, Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Members should refer to other members of the House by their seat or title.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  I remind the member for Corangamite that he should refer to members by their correct titles.




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  Indeed, and I apologise to the House for that. The reality is, of course, that the Liberal Party have no concern for workers in the workplace. The Labor Party do. We have a very proud history of putting in place legislative protection for workers in the workplace to ensure that those workers can earn an income and go home from work free from injury—whether it be injuries such as back injuries, injuries that come from dealing with complicated and dangerous machinery or indeed stress related injuries from things such as excessive workloads or workplace bullying.


The Labor Party continue to deliver on this very proud tradition of putting in place occupational health and safety laws throughout this nation to protect the interests of working families. If the Liberal Party can bring themselves to actually support some legislation that supports workers for once, I look forward to this legislation passing this place and hopefully the Senate. Indeed, I look forward to the states and territories undertaking the necessary legislative reform in their jurisdictions to ensure that harmonisation does truly take place.


As I indicated earlier, Access Economics has indicated that there will be a very substantial saving to the nation in terms of productivity, a very substantial saving to the nation in terms of occupational health and safety costs and, I believe, a very substantial saving to the nation in terms of the costs of dealing with and treating injuries in the workplace. This is good reform. It is reform that is necessary to recognise the complexity of business and the complexity of some 40,000 enterprises now undertaking work in multiple jurisdictions across the Commonwealth.


As I said earlier, the Labor Party have a proud history of putting in place protections for workers and we do treat people like Bernie Banton with the respect that they deserve and ensure that they do have the opportunity to seek compensation, unlike the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, who treated them appallingly.

 (Kingston) (10:59):  I rise to support the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011. Workplace health and safety is incredibly important to our nation. Sadly, it does not always receive the attention it deserves. Each year, more than 300 Australians are killed at work and many more die as a result of work-related diseases. In addition to this, a staggering 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work each year. Workplace death and injury has a devastating effect on individual workers, families, workplaces and our communities. However, I think one of the greatest tragedies in all of this is that many of these incidences at work are preventable. The pain and suffering that happens for these individuals, families and our community need not occur. Between July 2010 and March 2011, 16 people lost their lives as a result of a falling object, 13 people were killed when falling from a great height, 11 were crushed by machinery and eight were electrocuted. It is likely that with the right prevention processes in place these tragedies would not have occurred. I think it is very important that we on this side of the House are actually taking steps to strengthen and harmonise our health and safety.


We have been talking about this for some time. In fact, I think that over the last 10 or 15 years we have been talking about what it would mean to ensure that we had unified health and safety protections in place for workers right around this country. However, it has taken this government to actually start the hard work of ensuring that people are protected wherever they live in the country, and I think this is incredibly important.


When we hear occupational health and safety, people in their workplaces may at times think it is not that important and their eyes may glaze over. I know that as a teenager working in the retail industry I probably did not give the consideration to health and safety that I should have. I look back now at some of the dangerous practices that were engaged in at my workplace. I would stand on the top rung of the ladder and wait for my manager to throw boxes up to me, where I would catch them and put them on top of the overhung shelves. That is just one example. I look back now and think the consequences, if I or anyone else in my workplace fell, would have been devastating, and it was really only one step away. So I think we sometimes do not give it the attention it deserves, but I believe so strongly that we do need to give it more attention and make sure that Australian workplaces are safe places—that when people go off to work they come home alive and uninjured, safe to their families.


Australian workplaces have come a long way in implementing prevention strategies to prevent injuries. A lot of things such as guards, fencing and harnessing have been implemented and we have seen the number of deaths in our workplaces decline, but there is still a lot more to be done. Certainly in my experience when I was working as a representative for retail workers, a lot of shortcuts were still made. I remember one example that was incredibly preventable. I had visited a Hungry Jack's store. There was an employee who had been seriously burnt as a result of hot oil. He was asked to carry that bucket of hot oil—it was a plastic bucket—and he was seriously injured as a result of that. The authorities did pursue that company and they were fined for that incident, but there was a toll for that shortcut that seemed easy at the time. It had serious consequences for that young person.


So I am very pleased today to be speaking on this bill—to work towards a unified workplace health and safety scheme across the whole country. It does have, as the previous speaker said, large impacts to our economy. Unfortunately figures have shown that it is estimated that $34 billion is the cost to our economy of injuries at work.


Employees should not be fatally injured and have this cost to the economy. We should be doing something to improve that. As the previous speaker said, Labor does have a very proud tradition. (Quorum formed)


I was talking about health and safety, but I am going to acknowledge my parents are in the gallery, as well as the prize-winning Dr Jane Wright, who last night won the Prime Minister's award for secondary science teachers. She is my aunt and I am very proud to have her in the gallery. She is an exceptional teacher who inspires young people about science. I want to acknowledge the great work she does at Loreto college.


But I will talk about health and safety, because Labor does have a very, very proud history in this area. This bill will take another step towards doing what the opposition when in government could not do. They could not nationalise and harmonise occupational health and safety. This bill will do a lot to realise this. It is expected that this harmonisation will commence from 1 January 2012 and make many important changes to health and safety regulation. These changes include a new statutory right for workers to cease unsafe work in certain conditions. This will empower employees to take responsibility for their safety and also motivate employers to maintain a high standard in workplace health and safety. 


The primary duty of care will now be extended to persons conducting a business or undertaking. This will produce a broader sphere of protection that applies to all workers, not just employees. Because it should be clear that everyone deserves protection—whether they are hired labour, casual workers or full-time employees—this bill will go towards protecting them. These are very important changes not only for the protection of workers—even though we think that is the paramount importance of health and safety laws—but will also simplify things for businesses. They will take away a lot of red tape, especially if the businesses work across multi-sites in multi-jurisdictions. 


This legislation has been talked about for a long time; it is something that will streamline the health and safety system and produce better outcomes for workers and for employers. We know it is the strategy of the opposition today to call quorums and it probably is because they do not see health and safety as an important thing for this House to deal with, but this side of the House does believe it is an incredibly important. 


In addition the bill will include provisions to deal with issues specific to the Commonwealth. In particular, it will extend the application of work health and safety laws to members of the Defence Force and other persons deemed to be employees for the purposes of the current OH&S Act. It will enable the Chief of the Defence Force and Director-General of Security to disregard specific matters with the minister's agreement, which has not previously been required. The bill also establishes Comcare as the sole regulator of OH&S in the Commonwealth. This change to the current situation is unique to the Commonwealth, whereby Comcare and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission have shared regulatory powers. This will simplify our health and safety system; it will ensure that responsibilities are clear; it will ensure that people, including contractors, employees of contractors, sub-contractors—I commend the bill to the House.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (11:14):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Corangamite and the lovely hardworking member for Kingston, whose parents are up in the gallery, in speaking on the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011. The interesting thing to note is that not one of the opposition members is speaking on workplace health and safety. When it comes to the crunch in caring about workers and their families, they fail Australians miserably. I am surprised we have had quorums called by the member for Gippsland, given the amount of workers in his electorate that he has left high and dry and fails to look after and support.




Mr Chester:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask for that comment to be withdrawn.




Mr MITCHELL:
  What comment—workers?




Mr Chester:
  I ask you to withdraw the comment.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Is the member claiming to be offended by the comment?




Mr Chester:
  Yes.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Are you claiming it is unparliamentary?




Mr Chester:
  Yes.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I am happy to withdraw for you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I certainly do not want to get the little precious petal upset anymore.


As members are undoubtedly aware, the regulatory impact statement for the harmonisation of health and safety regulations confirmed that the national OHS system will bring many benefits, including economic benefits delivering up to $2 billion a year in productivity gains.


Over the past three years Labor has worked in cooperation with various stakeholders such as the states and territories, business groups and the ever-valuable ACTU to achieve a new legislative framework which will replace nine separate OHS acts and over 400 pieces of occupational health and safety regulation. This is an important step because I know that in my own state of Victoria and in New South Wales there are many cross-border issues involving jurisdictions, permits and safety regulations that people face every day working in businesses along the borders between the states. Through the measures in this bill we will eliminate the confusion, complication and higher costs for small businesses along those borders and probably along all state borders across the country.


As the member for Kingston said, it has taken a Labor government to do this because it is Labor that cares about the health and safety of workers. It is Labor that understands that, by undertaking these measures, we are enhancing safety protections for all Australian workers and their families and giving greater certainty and protection for all workplace parties.


Nationally harmonising work health and safety laws was first raised by the Whitlam government back in 1974. So while the genesis for this is very old, the arguments in favour of harmonisation remain very compelling to this day. It is important because around 300 Australians are killed at work each year. It is tragic that 300 people go to work each day, and then one day they do not come home. That is an appalling thing to think of, for their families, their friends and their communities and also for the employers. I know many employers of people who have been injured or have died at work suffer greatly, both physically and mentally, as a result of the issues raised when they lost a valuable part of their team. Many more workers die as a result of workplace related diseases, as the member for Corangamite mentioned earlier, and some 135,000 Australians are seriously injured at work.


I said in my maiden speech that I thought workplace safety and bullying are two of the most abhorrent things we can see in this country. I think back to the time when I was doing my apprenticeship in a shoemaking factory. We had absolutely no workplace health and safety. We were using glues and solvents with no fumigation, no breathing protection, no nothing. We were there at 7.30 in the morning and we did not leave until 4.30; we just sat there and worked away. There were machines that did not have guards. The amount of injuries we used to see happening every day, from minor injuries right through to major ones, was absolutely terrible. That is what started me on my journey to here, thinking that we need to address these things. We need to make sure that when people go to work each and every day they are going to come home safe. It has been a belief of mine that we can never go far enough to make sure that Australians go to work and have a safe, happy and responsible workplace and, of course, that they get remunerated properly for the jobs they do.


We know that the cost of workplace related injury and illness to our economy has been estimated at nearly six per cent of our GDP. We also know, as I said, that the cost to families, friends and others is immeasurable. Therefore, I believe that this bill is necessary as it contains new and tougher provisions, which include significant penalties for those who fail to meet their obligations for work health and safety.


The Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government stated in the second reading speech that there are three categories of penalties in this bill, based on the degree of culpability and risk. Category 1 offences, involving proven recklessness, attract a maximum fine of $3 million for bodies corporate and a maximum fine of $600,000 or a maximum of five years imprisonment or both for individuals. Category 2 offences, involving breaches of health and safety duties which expose another person to risk of death or serious injury or illness, attract a maximum fine of $1.5 million for bodies corporate or $300,000 for individuals. Category 3 offences apply for any breach of a health and safety duty, with a maximum fine of $500,000 for bodies corporate and $100,000 for individuals.


As was mentioned before, those opposite did not support the workers during their 11 long years in government. But it is Labor who have come out and said we will protect Australian jobs and Australian families. This bill implements our commitment in 2008 at COAG that all jurisdictions would harmonise health and safety laws. My home state of Victoria will benefit from $50 million in reward payments if these reforms are implemented by 1 January 2012. As I said, this bill will deliver real, tangible economic benefits: $2 billion in productivity gains and around $250 million per year in additional benefits arising from reducing red tape and improving the safety standards for workers.


In 2008 the government established an independent panel to conduct the national review into model occupational health and safety laws. This review panel examined very closely work health and safety laws in each state and territory and the Commonwealth. As the minister correctly outlined in his second reading speech, this bill seeks to secure the health and safety of workers and workplaces through the elimination or minimisation of risks, fair and effective representation, consultation, cooperation and issue resolution, provision of advice, information, education and training, and effective and appropriate compliance and enforcement measures. What we have got is a government that is delivering a whole package on these things to ensure that there is no excuse for not having a safe workplace. There is no excuse for not being able to allow people to go to work, to perform their duties in a safe environment and then to come home to be with their families. The definition of 'worker' will be extended to include persons who are currently deemed to be employees of the Commonwealth such as our valued members of the ADF and holders of a Commonwealth statutory office.


Comcare, under this bill, is established as the single regulator for work, health and safety in the Commonwealth and will operate under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. The commission will play an important role in overseeing the role of Comcare, which will have responsibility for day-to-day regulatory functions. Unlike those opposite who show no genuine care about workers—and that is why they will not put on the record their support for this legislation—we are getting on with the job and delivering tougher national standards to ensure every Australian worker has the rights and safety they deserve and are entitled to in a workplace.


The harmonisation of work, health and safety laws will be continually enforced by regulators, facilitating a stronger partnership with business to minimise the risks of workplace injuries and deaths. The benefits of harmonisation are great. The analysis undertaken by Access Economics estimates that harmonising work, health and safety laws will save the 40,000 businesses that operate across state boundaries around $179 million per annum. The model WHS legislation will provide enhanced safety protection for workers which is simple and easy to understand. The same rights and protections will be afforded to workers regardless of where their work is carried out. Labour mobility will be increased by providing recognition of licences and training across all jurisdictions. This is very important in today's economy, where we have a growing number of fly-in fly-out, drive-in drive-out workers, so that when people are mobile and move from state to state they can be assured they will have the same workplace safety and that the qualifications they have will be recognised.


The duties contained in the model legislation will also ensure that all workers are provided with protections while at work, whether they are employees, contractors or labour-hire workers, outworkers—who we know in the past have been treated very poorly—apprentices, trainees, work experience students and volunteers through the expanded definition of 'worker' supported by a new compliance regime.


The bill implements the model legislation agreed to by the WRMC in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. Mirror laws are to be introduced by each state and territory to also implement these model laws. As the model legislation has been drafted in non-jurisdictional specific terms, the bill includes specific provisions to ensure that the model provisions can operate alongside other Commonwealth legislation without affecting harmonisation. The bill has also been subject to a further three-week consultation period on an exposure draft. Employers covered by the Commonwealth legislation were invited to comment, as were the ACTU and members of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. In response, some 29 submissions were received and the comments made have been taken into account in finalising the bill.


The reforms will repeal and replace the current Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991, the OHS Act. The coverage of the bill remains similar to the OHS Act insofar as it will apply only to Commonwealth public authorities and, for a transitional period, non-Commonwealth licensees. The bill contains a mechanism allowing the minister to transfer OHS coverage of non-Commonwealth licensees to state and territory jurisdictions. It is intended that this power only be exercised once harmonised laws are implemented in each jurisdiction.


By implementing the agreed model bill, there will be some important changes to OHS regulation in the Commonwealth. They are: providing a wider coverage of contemporary work relationships, including contractors; a new statutory right for workers to cease unsafe work in certain circumstances; tougher penalties for failing to meet a duty of care; a removal of Commonwealth immunity from criminal prosecution; and a wider range of enforcement options, including infringement notices, remedial orders, adverse publicity orders, training orders and orders for restoration.


In addition, the bill will include provisions to deal with issues specific to the Commonwealth. It will extend the application of work, health and safety laws to members of the Defence Force and other persons currently deemed to be employees for the purpose of the current OHS Act; enable the Chief of the Defence Force and the Director-General of Security to disapply specified provisions of the act with the agreement of the minister with responsibility for work, health and safety matters—the minister's agreement has not previously been required; and establish Comcare as the sole regulator of OHS in the Commonwealth. This is a change to the current situation whereby Comcare and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission share regulatory powers.


Since WRMC endorsement of the model act as at 24 June 2011, two jurisdictions have passed new work health and safety legislation. The Queensland WHS act received royal assent on 6 June 2011 and the New South Wales WHS act received royal assent on 7 June 2011. The South Australian WHS bill has been introduced into the South Australian parliament and the Australian Capital Territory's WHS bill has been introduced. What we need is the rest of the states, like Victoria, to stop dragging the chain, to get up and to look after worker safety right across this country. I wish this bill a very speedy passage.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:29):  Prior to my election to this place I was a lawyer and a union official. As such, I had the responsibility of representing workers who were injured at work. I had the very grave duty of having to visit grieving families who were suffering after the death or terrible injury of a loved one. I campaigned alongside the now member for Charlton and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency for justice for the victims of asbestos injury. I campaigned also alongside the late and great Bernie Banton to see justice for those who are victims of James Hardie asbestos diseases. It is for these reasons that I am very, very pleased indeed to be standing here today as part of the Gillard Labor government, talking in favour of this legislation.


It will be to their eternal and national shame that we have not seen one speaker from those opposite stand in this place and talk about the benefits of this bill and the importance of the subject matter. I thought for a moment that maybe those opposite might have been busy somewhere else, doing something else, talking on other matters of importance in this debate, but a quick scanning of parliamentary legislative lists in other places shows no such thing is constraining these members. I think that it is a national shame that we have not seen those opposite talking on this matter. Perhaps they should draw their attention to the fact that in this country it is still true that we have more than four workers each week who die at work. That is almost one every second day. We see thousands more injured at work or travelling to or from work.


Perhaps they might be interested to know that as a result of the passage of this legislation we will be reducing the administrative burden on businesses. They are always talking about the administrative burden on businesses, but when they have got the opportunity to get involved and do something, to be proactive about reducing that administrative burden on business, they are seen to be wanting. Access Economics estimate that there will be about a $179 million—that is close to $180 million—reduction in administrative costs to business as a result of this legislation and you would think that those opposite might show a bit more interest in the subject matter of the bill. But let that be upon their heads. I am very pleased to be talking about this important subject matter.


Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would know, as a former worker yourself and somebody who has taken a keen interest in this area, that all Australian health and safety around the modern regime of occupational health and safety laws is built upon the foundation set by the Robens report. (Quorum formed) Before I was interrupted by the antics of those opposite—our framework of health and safety regulation in this country is built upon the report of Lord Robens who, in 1972, chaired the committee of inquiry. In the committee's words, it can be summarised as follows:


The primary responsibility for doing something about the present levels of occupational accidents and disease lies with those who create the risks and those who work with them.


Fundamental to this framework was ensuring that workers in the workplace were empowered to ensure that they could stand up and challenge their employers when they encountered risks to their occupational health and safety in the workplace. Everything that we have done since the reporting by Lord Robens and his committee in all jurisdictions around Australia has been built upon that fundamental point: that empowering workers to take charge of their occupational health and safety in the workplace is fundamental to reducing the risks, the injuries, the disease and the fatalities that may otherwise occur in the workplace. So I am very pleased to be speaking in favour of this legislation.


It will of course provide a wider coverage of contemporary work relationships, including contractors, employees of contractors, subcontractors, labour hire workers, apprentices and volunteers. It essentially acknowledges that the workforce and the nature of employment relationships have changed over the last two decades, and that our occupational health and safety regulation needs to be modernised to encompass that. It provides a new statutory right for workers to cease unsafe work in certain circumstances. It provides tougher penalties for failing to meet a duty of care. It removes Commonwealth immunity from criminal prosecution and provides a wider range of enforcement options, including infringement notices, remedial orders, adverse publicity orders, training orders and orders for restoration.


But most importantly, it creates the framework for creating a uniform national code for occupational health and safety legislation in this country. This is your classic win-win. It provides a uniform set of rights and protections for workers and it removes the administrative overburden that is associated with creating those rights for employees. It is something that all members in this House should celebrate, get behind, and vote in favour of.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (11:37):  In summing up this debate, I would like to congratulate all members for their contributions to the debate, including those from the opposition who spoke last night. I think there is strong and important bipartisan support for this. Obviously, this is something very dear to the heart of those who sit on this side of the House. It is something we have campaigned for for a very long time. As a former general secretary of a great trade union and as President of the ACTU, this is an agenda that we have been pursuing for some considerable time. In fact, one of the very early disputes that I was involved in with the Storemen and Packers Union was with wool storemen around the weights of bales. There were far too many wool storemen injured because of excessive weights. Because of the nature of the industry, growers were seeking to increase the size of the bales. We put a limit of 204 kilos on them. If that was exceeded it was reduced to 180 kilos. That had a significant impact, not only in terms of lessening the industry. It also led significantly to important mechanisation within the industry and a much safer work environment for what is and always has been a vital industry for this nation's future.


Although the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 currently before the parliament applies largely to Commonwealth public sector employment, it does form a crucial part of the Australian government's commitment to nationally harmonise work health and safety laws. This is an agenda item that was pursued with great determination by the current Prime Minister when she was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations in our last term. Quite apart from getting rid of that dreaded Work Choices legislation, ensuring that we were moving in the direction of harmonised work health and safety laws was a key achievement of hers in the portfolio.


The bill gives effect to the national framework proposed by the Council of Australian Governments. It was developed in a tripartite way with the involvement of not just the Commonwealth but all state and territory governments, business groups and the ACTU. This is a reflection of tripartism at work. It is a commitment to address a key issue and get agreement despite difficult issues surrounding it. It also brings Australia one step closer to having a nationally harmonised system of work health and safety laws by 2012. This bill complements legislation being enacted across all Australian states and territories. It will lead to enhanced work health and safety protections for Australian workers and greater certainty for business. Make no mistake, these are landmark reforms which have been long in the making. What we have here is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to provide all Australian workers with the same protections, regardless of where they live and where they work, and to overcome the frustration and complexity faced by businesses of nine different occupational health and safety legal systems and standards.


When I introduced the legislation on behalf of the minister in this House in favour of occupational health and safety harmonisation I gave great detail on the background as to how we got to where we did. In fact, it was exhaustive detail. I will not repeat them here but they were compelling arguments. An enormous amount of work has been put into this and it is incumbent upon this House to give effect to them. Reform and harmonisation of Australian work health and safety laws was made possible because the Australian government forged that constructive working partnership with the states, business and the ACTU. Getting consensus on the content of a new legislative framework that can be adopted by all jurisdictions has been no easy task. Each of the parties came to the table with strong views about the content of the model of work health and safety laws. Amendments have been proposed and we will move to consider them in detail after the second reading. It is not that the parties did not consider the various proposals that are now reflected in the amendments. They did. I made the point before: there were areas of disagreement and tripartite negotiations always result in a level of compromise. As much as people might consider the importance of those amendments when they are moving them, in their view to strengthen the legislation, what they cannot ignore is the importance of arriving at the consensus that we have. I do not question the motives of those who put the amendments forward but simply say that they do not reflect the agreement. If they are passed by this House they risk upsetting that agreement and therefore the movement to harmonisation, given that we have to move these things not just here but through the states.


In many cases there were compromises. It is a credit to all of those involved that they persevered with the process over the past three years in particular. Each jurisdiction will face changes in current occupational health and safety arrangements in order to achieve the goal of uniform OH&S laws. What the parties have been able to agree represents the best possible outcome: a balanced and interrelated package of measures that will lead to enhanced safety protections for all Australian workers and greater certainty and protections for all workplace parties. Certain members have indicated that they will be moving amendments and I will respond to the detail of those when they are moved. I again make the point that members in the Australian government have signed up to play our part in implementing what has been long needed—a nationally harmonised OH&S system. This means having a Commonwealth work health and safety act which accords with the model work health and safety act endorsed by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council in December 2009.


The bill before the parliament honours this commitment made under a COAG intergovernmental agreement and, accordingly, we will not be supporting the amendments. I urge other members to do likewise. This bill is only the first step towards a nationally harmonised system of legislation. The harmonisation process will also include model regulations and codes of practice that are expected to be finalised at the national level later this year. The process to develop national regulations is again a collaborative one, being achieved in partnership with governments, employees and employer bodies.


It has been suggested that we should delay consideration of this bill until the model regulations have been finalised. However, I point out the task before the parliament today is to consider the model bill, not the model regulations. The parliament will have the opportunity to separately consider the regulations and the accompanying regulation impact statement for the regulations once they are before parliament. So parliament is not being denied that opportunity. This model bill should not be delayed because delaying the passage of this bill in order to simply consider the regulation impact statement is a circular argument. Those regulations cannot be made until the bill is passed.


The bill itself has been subject to a national regulation impact statement prepared by Access Economics. This analysis showed that the adoption of the model Work Health and Safety Act across Australia is expected to benefit multijurisdictional businesses as well as confer an overall net benefit to the nation in the order of $180 million. In other words, this is a win-win outcome. It is a win for workers because they have a safer environmental framework in which to work. It is a win for businesses because they save money lost in down time through workers being injured and away from work.


The content of the bill has also been subject to exhaustive consultation over the past three years and it has been endorsed not only by the other government jurisdictions but also by the industry stakeholders. Key industry groups—ACCI, AiG, the MBA—have all welcomed the introduction of this bill into the Commonwealth parliament and have strongly urged members to pass the legislation. Importantly, other jurisdictions are getting on with the job of implementing their model bills. Five out of nine jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth, have put the model laws before their parliaments. Legislation has already passed in both Queensland and New South Wales.


Against that background, I thank members for their contributions. After we move into consideration in detail I will respond to the particular amendments. This is an outcome well worth waiting for, but it should have been done a long time ago. We are proud to be associated with a government that introduces this legislation following the processes that have led to the bill. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (10:44):  It is my pleasure today to speak on the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 and the Work Health and Safety (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011. I wish to commence my contribution to this debate by highlighting that the Labor Party has, for a very long time, had a very proud record of supporting people in their workplaces, to ensure that they do have a safe place to go to work and that the employers provide for them all the necessary skills and tools to work within that workplace in a safe way.


Earlier today we were dealing with a private member's piece of legislation that dealt with occupational health and safety issues around firefighters acquiring various cancers as a consequence of the work that they undertake in providing a service to the community and dealing with fires, particularly in structures, and the carcinogens that those firefighters come across.


One of the commitments that Labor took to the 2007 election was to commence a process of harmonising our occupational health and safety laws across this nation. The reason we want to do that is that, despite the fact that we come from a federation, workers are becoming far more mobile than they ever used to be and employers are working across jurisdictions. It is becoming a real problem not only for those workers but also for those employers in having different sets of occupational laws depending in which state a worker might be employed in on any particular day. There are many industries where employees consistently and constantly cross borders, often moving from one jurisdiction to another.


In 2008 we commissioned a review into what model occupational health and safety laws might look like and commenced a process. As a government we received some 242 submissions from state governments and universities, industry groups, individuals and other key stakeholders such as trade unions on what some model occupational health safety laws might look like. I would like to thank all of those who participated in that process. A model act was subsequently developed in September 2009 and was put out for a six-week period for consultation and feedback from all of the stakeholders. Since then we have been working on the necessary legislation and consulting with the states through the ministerial council in terms of those particular laws. And today we are currently debating those draft laws and what they might look like from a Commonwealth perspective.



There will be requirements from the states and territories in order for them to, as they have agreed to do, harmonise their occupational health and safety laws so that they mirror the agreement that we have reached with them. I certainly look forward to the states and territories getting on with that work so that we can develop a consistent set of occupational health and safety laws throughout this nation to provide protection and coverage for workers.


Analysis undertaken by Access Economics estimates that harmonising work health and safety laws will save some 40,000 businesses, which operate across state boundaries, around $179 million per year—providing very substantial savings to the economy, making this nation even more productive. Importantly, this not only will provide great savings for the nation but will also ensure that workers and employers understand more comprehensively the obligations of occupational health and safety and enable the opportunity for employees, particularly those who work across multiple jurisdictions, to have a comprehensive understanding and be able to take measures in accordance with the provisions of these harmonised legislative arrangements to protect their own occupational health safety in work in conjunction, of course, with employers.


In workplaces where occupational health and safety is not a priority, injuries will of course occur. Those injuries are an enormous drain on the productivity of the nation and the productivity of the workplace. It is in everyone's interest that people are protected in the workplace from injury, whether it be physical injury such as back injuries or the like, or whether it be psychological injuries such as stress and the like. It is incumbent on all jurisdictions to work to put in place those arrangements.





(Quorum formed) I might take this opportunity to point out the absolute shameless way that Tony Abbott treated Bernie Banton in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election. Bernie was dying of asbestosis—




Mr SECKER:
  Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath, I rise on a point of order. Members should refer to other members of the House by their seat or title.




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition back then treated workers who were dying of asbestosis in a shameful way. It was a blight on this nation. Bernie was a worker, as I understand it, who after many years of working on the wharves had developed asbestosis. In 2007 the then Minister for Health, Tony Abbott, now the Leader of the Opposition, made an outrageous claim that Bernie Banton was only doing what he was for political reasons. The reality is that Bernie was dying of a deadly disease that he suffered because of the work that he undertook for many years, particularly, I think, in New South Wales. The reality is that the Liberal Party and Tony Abbott do not care about the rights of workers in the workplace.




Mr SECKER:
  Madam, Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Members should refer to other members of the House by their seat or title.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  I remind the member for Corangamite that he should refer to members by their correct titles.




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  Indeed, and I apologise to the House for that. The reality is, of course, that the Liberal Party have no concern for workers in the workplace. The Labor Party do. We have a very proud history of putting in place legislative protection for workers in the workplace to ensure that those workers can earn an income and go home from work free from injury—whether it be injuries such as back injuries, injuries that come from dealing with complicated and dangerous machinery or indeed stress related injuries from things such as excessive workloads or workplace bullying.


The Labor Party continue to deliver on this very proud tradition of putting in place occupational health and safety laws throughout this nation to protect the interests of working families. If the Liberal Party can bring themselves to actually support some legislation that supports workers for once, I look forward to this legislation passing this place and hopefully the Senate. Indeed, I look forward to the states and territories undertaking the necessary legislative reform in their jurisdictions to ensure that harmonisation does truly take place.


As I indicated earlier, Access Economics has indicated that there will be a very substantial saving to the nation in terms of productivity, a very substantial saving to the nation in terms of occupational health and safety costs and, I believe, a very substantial saving to the nation in terms of the costs of dealing with and treating injuries in the workplace. This is good reform. It is reform that is necessary to recognise the complexity of business and the complexity of some 40,000 enterprises now undertaking work in multiple jurisdictions across the Commonwealth.


As I said earlier, the Labor Party have a proud history of putting in place protections for workers and we do treat people like Bernie Banton with the respect that they deserve and ensure that they do have the opportunity to seek compensation, unlike the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, who treated them appallingly.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (10:59):  I rise to support the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011. Workplace health and safety is incredibly important to our nation. Sadly, it does not always receive the attention it deserves. Each year, more than 300 Australians are killed at work and many more die as a result of work-related diseases. In addition to this, a staggering 140,000 Australians are seriously injured at work each year. Workplace death and injury has a devastating effect on individual workers, families, workplaces and our communities. However, I think one of the greatest tragedies in all of this is that many of these incidences at work are preventable. The pain and suffering that happens for these individuals, families and our community need not occur. Between July 2010 and March 2011, 16 people lost their lives as a result of a falling object, 13 people were killed when falling from a great height, 11 were crushed by machinery and eight were electrocuted. It is likely that with the right prevention processes in place these tragedies would not have occurred. I think it is very important that we on this side of the House are actually taking steps to strengthen and harmonise our health and safety.


We have been talking about this for some time. In fact, I think that over the last 10 or 15 years we have been talking about what it would mean to ensure that we had unified health and safety protections in place for workers right around this country. However, it has taken this government to actually start the hard work of ensuring that people are protected wherever they live in the country, and I think this is incredibly important.


When we hear occupational health and safety, people in their workplaces may at times think it is not that important and their eyes may glaze over. I know that as a teenager working in the retail industry I probably did not give the consideration to health and safety that I should have. I look back now at some of the dangerous practices that were engaged in at my workplace. I would stand on the top rung of the ladder and wait for my manager to throw boxes up to me, where I would catch them and put them on top of the overhung shelves. That is just one example. I look back now and think the consequences, if I or anyone else in my workplace fell, would have been devastating, and it was really only one step away. So I think we sometimes do not give it the attention it deserves, but I believe so strongly that we do need to give it more attention and make sure that Australian workplaces are safe places—that when people go off to work they come home alive and uninjured, safe to their families.


Australian workplaces have come a long way in implementing prevention strategies to prevent injuries. A lot of things such as guards, fencing and harnessing have been implemented and we have seen the number of deaths in our workplaces decline, but there is still a lot more to be done. Certainly in my experience when I was working as a representative for retail workers, a lot of shortcuts were still made. I remember one example that was incredibly preventable. I had visited a Hungry Jack's store. There was an employee who had been seriously burnt as a result of hot oil. He was asked to carry that bucket of hot oil—it was a plastic bucket—and he was seriously injured as a result of that. The authorities did pursue that company and they were fined for that incident, but there was a toll for that shortcut that seemed easy at the time. It had serious consequences for that young person.


So I am very pleased today to be speaking on this bill—to work towards a unified workplace health and safety scheme across the whole country. It does have, as the previous speaker said, large impacts to our economy. Unfortunately figures have shown that it is estimated that $34 billion is the cost to our economy of injuries at work.


Employees should not be fatally injured and have this cost to the economy. We should be doing something to improve that. As the previous speaker said, Labor does have a very proud tradition. (Quorum formed)


I was talking about health and safety, but I am going to acknowledge my parents are in the gallery, as well as the prize-winning Dr Jane Wright, who last night won the Prime Minister's award for secondary science teachers. She is my aunt and I am very proud to have her in the gallery. She is an exceptional teacher who inspires young people about science. I want to acknowledge the great work she does at Loreto college.


But I will talk about health and safety, because Labor does have a very, very proud history in this area. This bill will take another step towards doing what the opposition when in government could not do. They could not nationalise and harmonise occupational health and safety. This bill will do a lot to realise this. It is expected that this harmonisation will commence from 1 January 2012 and make many important changes to health and safety regulation. These changes include a new statutory right for workers to cease unsafe work in certain conditions. This will empower employees to take responsibility for their safety and also motivate employers to maintain a high standard in workplace health and safety. 


The primary duty of care will now be extended to persons conducting a business or undertaking. This will produce a broader sphere of protection that applies to all workers, not just employees. Because it should be clear that everyone deserves protection—whether they are hired labour, casual workers or full-time employees—this bill will go towards protecting them. These are very important changes not only for the protection of workers—even though we think that is the paramount importance of health and safety laws—but will also simplify things for businesses. They will take away a lot of red tape, especially if the businesses work across multi-sites in multi-jurisdictions. 


This legislation has been talked about for a long time; it is something that will streamline the health and safety system and produce better outcomes for workers and for employers. We know it is the strategy of the opposition today to call quorums and it probably is because they do not see health and safety as an important thing for this House to deal with, but this side of the House does believe it is an incredibly important. 


In addition the bill will include provisions to deal with issues specific to the Commonwealth. In particular, it will extend the application of work health and safety laws to members of the Defence Force and other persons deemed to be employees for the purposes of the current OH&S Act. It will enable the Chief of the Defence Force and Director-General of Security to disregard specific matters with the minister's agreement, which has not previously been required. The bill also establishes Comcare as the sole regulator of OH&S in the Commonwealth. This change to the current situation is unique to the Commonwealth, whereby Comcare and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission have shared regulatory powers. This will simplify our health and safety system; it will ensure that responsibilities are clear; it will ensure that people, including contractors, employees of contractors, sub-contractors—I commend the bill to the House.

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (11:14):  It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Corangamite and the lovely hardworking member for Kingston, whose parents are up in the gallery, in speaking on the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011. The interesting thing to note is that not one of the opposition members is speaking on workplace health and safety. When it comes to the crunch in caring about workers and their families, they fail Australians miserably. I am surprised we have had quorums called by the member for Gippsland, given the amount of workers in his electorate that he has left high and dry and fails to look after and support.




Mr Chester:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask for that comment to be withdrawn.




Mr MITCHELL:
  What comment—workers?




Mr Chester:
  I ask you to withdraw the comment.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Is the member claiming to be offended by the comment?




Mr Chester:
  Yes.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Are you claiming it is unparliamentary?




Mr Chester:
  Yes.




Mr MITCHELL:
  I am happy to withdraw for you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I certainly do not want to get the little precious petal upset anymore.


As members are undoubtedly aware, the regulatory impact statement for the harmonisation of health and safety regulations confirmed that the national OHS system will bring many benefits, including economic benefits delivering up to $2 billion a year in productivity gains.


Over the past three years Labor has worked in cooperation with various stakeholders such as the states and territories, business groups and the ever-valuable ACTU to achieve a new legislative framework which will replace nine separate OHS acts and over 400 pieces of occupational health and safety regulation. This is an important step because I know that in my own state of Victoria and in New South Wales there are many cross-border issues involving jurisdictions, permits and safety regulations that people face every day working in businesses along the borders between the states. Through the measures in this bill we will eliminate the confusion, complication and higher costs for small businesses along those borders and probably along all state borders across the country.


As the member for Kingston said, it has taken a Labor government to do this because it is Labor that cares about the health and safety of workers. It is Labor that understands that, by undertaking these measures, we are enhancing safety protections for all Australian workers and their families and giving greater certainty and protection for all workplace parties.


Nationally harmonising work health and safety laws was first raised by the Whitlam government back in 1974. So while the genesis for this is very old, the arguments in favour of harmonisation remain very compelling to this day. It is important because around 300 Australians are killed at work each year. It is tragic that 300 people go to work each day, and then one day they do not come home. That is an appalling thing to think of, for their families, their friends and their communities and also for the employers. I know many employers of people who have been injured or have died at work suffer greatly, both physically and mentally, as a result of the issues raised when they lost a valuable part of their team. Many more workers die as a result of workplace related diseases, as the member for Corangamite mentioned earlier, and some 135,000 Australians are seriously injured at work.


I said in my maiden speech that I thought workplace safety and bullying are two of the most abhorrent things we can see in this country. I think back to the time when I was doing my apprenticeship in a shoemaking factory. We had absolutely no workplace health and safety. We were using glues and solvents with no fumigation, no breathing protection, no nothing. We were there at 7.30 in the morning and we did not leave until 4.30; we just sat there and worked away. There were machines that did not have guards. The amount of injuries we used to see happening every day, from minor injuries right through to major ones, was absolutely terrible. That is what started me on my journey to here, thinking that we need to address these things. We need to make sure that when people go to work each and every day they are going to come home safe. It has been a belief of mine that we can never go far enough to make sure that Australians go to work and have a safe, happy and responsible workplace and, of course, that they get remunerated properly for the jobs they do.


We know that the cost of workplace related injury and illness to our economy has been estimated at nearly six per cent of our GDP. We also know, as I said, that the cost to families, friends and others is immeasurable. Therefore, I believe that this bill is necessary as it contains new and tougher provisions, which include significant penalties for those who fail to meet their obligations for work health and safety.


The Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government stated in the second reading speech that there are three categories of penalties in this bill, based on the degree of culpability and risk. Category 1 offences, involving proven recklessness, attract a maximum fine of $3 million for bodies corporate and a maximum fine of $600,000 or a maximum of five years imprisonment or both for individuals. Category 2 offences, involving breaches of health and safety duties which expose another person to risk of death or serious injury or illness, attract a maximum fine of $1.5 million for bodies corporate or $300,000 for individuals. Category 3 offences apply for any breach of a health and safety duty, with a maximum fine of $500,000 for bodies corporate and $100,000 for individuals.


As was mentioned before, those opposite did not support the workers during their 11 long years in government. But it is Labor who have come out and said we will protect Australian jobs and Australian families. This bill implements our commitment in 2008 at COAG that all jurisdictions would harmonise health and safety laws. My home state of Victoria will benefit from $50 million in reward payments if these reforms are implemented by 1 January 2012. As I said, this bill will deliver real, tangible economic benefits: $2 billion in productivity gains and around $250 million per year in additional benefits arising from reducing red tape and improving the safety standards for workers.


In 2008 the government established an independent panel to conduct the national review into model occupational health and safety laws. This review panel examined very closely work health and safety laws in each state and territory and the Commonwealth. As the minister correctly outlined in his second reading speech, this bill seeks to secure the health and safety of workers and workplaces through the elimination or minimisation of risks, fair and effective representation, consultation, cooperation and issue resolution, provision of advice, information, education and training, and effective and appropriate compliance and enforcement measures. What we have got is a government that is delivering a whole package on these things to ensure that there is no excuse for not having a safe workplace. There is no excuse for not being able to allow people to go to work, to perform their duties in a safe environment and then to come home to be with their families. The definition of 'worker' will be extended to include persons who are currently deemed to be employees of the Commonwealth such as our valued members of the ADF and holders of a Commonwealth statutory office.


Comcare, under this bill, is established as the single regulator for work, health and safety in the Commonwealth and will operate under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. The commission will play an important role in overseeing the role of Comcare, which will have responsibility for day-to-day regulatory functions. Unlike those opposite who show no genuine care about workers—and that is why they will not put on the record their support for this legislation—we are getting on with the job and delivering tougher national standards to ensure every Australian worker has the rights and safety they deserve and are entitled to in a workplace.


The harmonisation of work, health and safety laws will be continually enforced by regulators, facilitating a stronger partnership with business to minimise the risks of workplace injuries and deaths. The benefits of harmonisation are great. The analysis undertaken by Access Economics estimates that harmonising work, health and safety laws will save the 40,000 businesses that operate across state boundaries around $179 million per annum. The model WHS legislation will provide enhanced safety protection for workers which is simple and easy to understand. The same rights and protections will be afforded to workers regardless of where their work is carried out. Labour mobility will be increased by providing recognition of licences and training across all jurisdictions. This is very important in today's economy, where we have a growing number of fly-in fly-out, drive-in drive-out workers, so that when people are mobile and move from state to state they can be assured they will have the same workplace safety and that the qualifications they have will be recognised.


The duties contained in the model legislation will also ensure that all workers are provided with protections while at work, whether they are employees, contractors or labour-hire workers, outworkers—who we know in the past have been treated very poorly—apprentices, trainees, work experience students and volunteers through the expanded definition of 'worker' supported by a new compliance regime.


The bill implements the model legislation agreed to by the WRMC in the Commonwealth jurisdiction. Mirror laws are to be introduced by each state and territory to also implement these model laws. As the model legislation has been drafted in non-jurisdictional specific terms, the bill includes specific provisions to ensure that the model provisions can operate alongside other Commonwealth legislation without affecting harmonisation. The bill has also been subject to a further three-week consultation period on an exposure draft. Employers covered by the Commonwealth legislation were invited to comment, as were the ACTU and members of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. In response, some 29 submissions were received and the comments made have been taken into account in finalising the bill.


The reforms will repeal and replace the current Commonwealth Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991, the OHS Act. The coverage of the bill remains similar to the OHS Act insofar as it will apply only to Commonwealth public authorities and, for a transitional period, non-Commonwealth licensees. The bill contains a mechanism allowing the minister to transfer OHS coverage of non-Commonwealth licensees to state and territory jurisdictions. It is intended that this power only be exercised once harmonised laws are implemented in each jurisdiction.


By implementing the agreed model bill, there will be some important changes to OHS regulation in the Commonwealth. They are: providing a wider coverage of contemporary work relationships, including contractors; a new statutory right for workers to cease unsafe work in certain circumstances; tougher penalties for failing to meet a duty of care; a removal of Commonwealth immunity from criminal prosecution; and a wider range of enforcement options, including infringement notices, remedial orders, adverse publicity orders, training orders and orders for restoration.


In addition, the bill will include provisions to deal with issues specific to the Commonwealth. It will extend the application of work, health and safety laws to members of the Defence Force and other persons currently deemed to be employees for the purpose of the current OHS Act; enable the Chief of the Defence Force and the Director-General of Security to disapply specified provisions of the act with the agreement of the minister with responsibility for work, health and safety matters—the minister's agreement has not previously been required; and establish Comcare as the sole regulator of OHS in the Commonwealth. This is a change to the current situation whereby Comcare and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission share regulatory powers.


Since WRMC endorsement of the model act as at 24 June 2011, two jurisdictions have passed new work health and safety legislation. The Queensland WHS act received royal assent on 6 June 2011 and the New South Wales WHS act received royal assent on 7 June 2011. The South Australian WHS bill has been introduced into the South Australian parliament and the Australian Capital Territory's WHS bill has been introduced. What we need is the rest of the states, like Victoria, to stop dragging the chain, to get up and to look after worker safety right across this country. I wish this bill a very speedy passage.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:29):  Prior to my election to this place I was a lawyer and a union official. As such, I had the responsibility of representing workers who were injured at work. I had the very grave duty of having to visit grieving families who were suffering after the death or terrible injury of a loved one. I campaigned alongside the now member for Charlton and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency for justice for the victims of asbestos injury. I campaigned also alongside the late and great Bernie Banton to see justice for those who are victims of James Hardie asbestos diseases. It is for these reasons that I am very, very pleased indeed to be standing here today as part of the Gillard Labor government, talking in favour of this legislation.


It will be to their eternal and national shame that we have not seen one speaker from those opposite stand in this place and talk about the benefits of this bill and the importance of the subject matter. I thought for a moment that maybe those opposite might have been busy somewhere else, doing something else, talking on other matters of importance in this debate, but a quick scanning of parliamentary legislative lists in other places shows no such thing is constraining these members. I think that it is a national shame that we have not seen those opposite talking on this matter. Perhaps they should draw their attention to the fact that in this country it is still true that we have more than four workers each week who die at work. That is almost one every second day. We see thousands more injured at work or travelling to or from work.


Perhaps they might be interested to know that as a result of the passage of this legislation we will be reducing the administrative burden on businesses. They are always talking about the administrative burden on businesses, but when they have got the opportunity to get involved and do something, to be proactive about reducing that administrative burden on business, they are seen to be wanting. Access Economics estimate that there will be about a $179 million—that is close to $180 million—reduction in administrative costs to business as a result of this legislation and you would think that those opposite might show a bit more interest in the subject matter of the bill. But let that be upon their heads. I am very pleased to be talking about this important subject matter.


Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would know, as a former worker yourself and somebody who has taken a keen interest in this area, that all Australian health and safety around the modern regime of occupational health and safety laws is built upon the foundation set by the Robens report. (Quorum formed) Before I was interrupted by the antics of those opposite—our framework of health and safety regulation in this country is built upon the report of Lord Robens who, in 1972, chaired the committee of inquiry. In the committee's words, it can be summarised as follows:


The primary responsibility for doing something about the present levels of occupational accidents and disease lies with those who create the risks and those who work with them.


Fundamental to this framework was ensuring that workers in the workplace were empowered to ensure that they could stand up and challenge their employers when they encountered risks to their occupational health and safety in the workplace. Everything that we have done since the reporting by Lord Robens and his committee in all jurisdictions around Australia has been built upon that fundamental point: that empowering workers to take charge of their occupational health and safety in the workplace is fundamental to reducing the risks, the injuries, the disease and the fatalities that may otherwise occur in the workplace. So I am very pleased to be speaking in favour of this legislation.


It will of course provide a wider coverage of contemporary work relationships, including contractors, employees of contractors, subcontractors, labour hire workers, apprentices and volunteers. It essentially acknowledges that the workforce and the nature of employment relationships have changed over the last two decades, and that our occupational health and safety regulation needs to be modernised to encompass that. It provides a new statutory right for workers to cease unsafe work in certain circumstances. It provides tougher penalties for failing to meet a duty of care. It removes Commonwealth immunity from criminal prosecution and provides a wider range of enforcement options, including infringement notices, remedial orders, adverse publicity orders, training orders and orders for restoration.


But most importantly, it creates the framework for creating a uniform national code for occupational health and safety legislation in this country. This is your classic win-win. It provides a uniform set of rights and protections for workers and it removes the administrative overburden that is associated with creating those rights for employees. It is something that all members in this House should celebrate, get behind, and vote in favour of.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (11:37):  In summing up this debate, I would like to congratulate all members for their contributions to the debate, including those from the opposition who spoke last night. I think there is strong and important bipartisan support for this. Obviously, this is something very dear to the heart of those who sit on this side of the House. It is something we have campaigned for for a very long time. As a former general secretary of a great trade union and as President of the ACTU, this is an agenda that we have been pursuing for some considerable time. In fact, one of the very early disputes that I was involved in with the Storemen and Packers Union was with wool storemen around the weights of bales. There were far too many wool storemen injured because of excessive weights. Because of the nature of the industry, growers were seeking to increase the size of the bales. We put a limit of 204 kilos on them. If that was exceeded it was reduced to 180 kilos. That had a significant impact, not only in terms of lessening the industry. It also led significantly to important mechanisation within the industry and a much safer work environment for what is and always has been a vital industry for this nation's future.


Although the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011 currently before the parliament applies largely to Commonwealth public sector employment, it does form a crucial part of the Australian government's commitment to nationally harmonise work health and safety laws. This is an agenda item that was pursued with great determination by the current Prime Minister when she was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations in our last term. Quite apart from getting rid of that dreaded Work Choices legislation, ensuring that we were moving in the direction of harmonised work health and safety laws was a key achievement of hers in the portfolio.


The bill gives effect to the national framework proposed by the Council of Australian Governments. It was developed in a tripartite way with the involvement of not just the Commonwealth but all state and territory governments, business groups and the ACTU. This is a reflection of tripartism at work. It is a commitment to address a key issue and get agreement despite difficult issues surrounding it. It also brings Australia one step closer to having a nationally harmonised system of work health and safety laws by 2012. This bill complements legislation being enacted across all Australian states and territories. It will lead to enhanced work health and safety protections for Australian workers and greater certainty for business. Make no mistake, these are landmark reforms which have been long in the making. What we have here is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to provide all Australian workers with the same protections, regardless of where they live and where they work, and to overcome the frustration and complexity faced by businesses of nine different occupational health and safety legal systems and standards.


When I introduced the legislation on behalf of the minister in this House in favour of occupational health and safety harmonisation I gave great detail on the background as to how we got to where we did. In fact, it was exhaustive detail. I will not repeat them here but they were compelling arguments. An enormous amount of work has been put into this and it is incumbent upon this House to give effect to them. Reform and harmonisation of Australian work health and safety laws was made possible because the Australian government forged that constructive working partnership with the states, business and the ACTU. Getting consensus on the content of a new legislative framework that can be adopted by all jurisdictions has been no easy task. Each of the parties came to the table with strong views about the content of the model of work health and safety laws. Amendments have been proposed and we will move to consider them in detail after the second reading. It is not that the parties did not consider the various proposals that are now reflected in the amendments. They did. I made the point before: there were areas of disagreement and tripartite negotiations always result in a level of compromise. As much as people might consider the importance of those amendments when they are moving them, in their view to strengthen the legislation, what they cannot ignore is the importance of arriving at the consensus that we have. I do not question the motives of those who put the amendments forward but simply say that they do not reflect the agreement. If they are passed by this House they risk upsetting that agreement and therefore the movement to harmonisation, given that we have to move these things not just here but through the states.


In many cases there were compromises. It is a credit to all of those involved that they persevered with the process over the past three years in particular. Each jurisdiction will face changes in current occupational health and safety arrangements in order to achieve the goal of uniform OH&S laws. What the parties have been able to agree represents the best possible outcome: a balanced and interrelated package of measures that will lead to enhanced safety protections for all Australian workers and greater certainty and protections for all workplace parties. Certain members have indicated that they will be moving amendments and I will respond to the detail of those when they are moved. I again make the point that members in the Australian government have signed up to play our part in implementing what has been long needed—a nationally harmonised OH&S system. This means having a Commonwealth work health and safety act which accords with the model work health and safety act endorsed by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council in December 2009.


The bill before the parliament honours this commitment made under a COAG intergovernmental agreement and, accordingly, we will not be supporting the amendments. I urge other members to do likewise. This bill is only the first step towards a nationally harmonised system of legislation. The harmonisation process will also include model regulations and codes of practice that are expected to be finalised at the national level later this year. The process to develop national regulations is again a collaborative one, being achieved in partnership with governments, employees and employer bodies.


It has been suggested that we should delay consideration of this bill until the model regulations have been finalised. However, I point out the task before the parliament today is to consider the model bill, not the model regulations. The parliament will have the opportunity to separately consider the regulations and the accompanying regulation impact statement for the regulations once they are before parliament. So parliament is not being denied that opportunity. This model bill should not be delayed because delaying the passage of this bill in order to simply consider the regulation impact statement is a circular argument. Those regulations cannot be made until the bill is passed.


The bill itself has been subject to a national regulation impact statement prepared by Access Economics. This analysis showed that the adoption of the model Work Health and Safety Act across Australia is expected to benefit multijurisdictional businesses as well as confer an overall net benefit to the nation in the order of $180 million. In other words, this is a win-win outcome. It is a win for workers because they have a safer environmental framework in which to work. It is a win for businesses because they save money lost in down time through workers being injured and away from work.


The content of the bill has also been subject to exhaustive consultation over the past three years and it has been endorsed not only by the other government jurisdictions but also by the industry stakeholders. Key industry groups—ACCI, AiG, the MBA—have all welcomed the introduction of this bill into the Commonwealth parliament and have strongly urged members to pass the legislation. Importantly, other jurisdictions are getting on with the job of implementing their model bills. Five out of nine jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth, have put the model laws before their parliaments. Legislation has already passed in both Queensland and New South Wales.


Against that background, I thank members for their contributions. After we move into consideration in detail I will respond to the particular amendments. This is an outcome well worth waiting for, but it should have been done a long time ago. We are proud to be associated with a government that introduces this legislation following the processes that have led to the bill. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (11:49):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a procedural matter rather than the bill before the House. This is the first opportunity I have had to do so and I seek your guidance. As you will be well aware, when a quorum is called in the parliament it has to be filled within four minutes of the bells beginning to ring. This morning Mr Chester called a quorum at 11:04 and a quorum was formed at 11:10, which is six minutes later. Technically, the House should have closed down at 11:08 and I seek your guidance about how that matter should be dealt with.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. DGH Adams
):  The issue that the honourable member raises should have been dealt with at the time if there was an issue. If it was not raised then by the opposition or any other member, I think the House has moved on and is considering the business before it. That would be my ruling. I will hear the honourable member again.




Mr PYNE:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, out of due deference to you and to the House, I would not mind if you would ask the Speaker for his advice about how this matter could be dealt with in the future and perhaps he could report back to the House at a later time this day.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  We have moved on. The Manager of Opposition Business could take that issue up with the Speaker in his own time and seek reference.

 (Farrer) (11:51):  by leave—I move government amendments (1) to (10) together as circulated in my name:


(1) Clause 19, page 23 (line 3), after ""undertaking insert ""who has control over the matter"". 


(2) Clause 19, page 23 (line 9), after ""undertaking"", insert ""who has control over the matter"".

(10) Clause 173, page 124 (lines 26 to 27), omit "", unless he or she was first given the warning in subsection (1)(c)"".


I wish to make these amendments to the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011. Let me emphasise that we in the coalition do support the harmonisation of OH&S laws. In fact, it was a coalition government that initiated the process, in 2006, hence the Prime Minister is claiming credit for something that the Howard government commenced and that she had not completed. Many speakers on this side have reminded the House of her remarks at the time, that she had actually delivered new occupational health and safety laws. Her words were:


… I have delivered that.


Thirty years—on the day we delivered it there were some public servants that had tears in their eyes because they spent all their working life waiting for someone to deliver that reform. Wasn't easy, but I got it done.


Public servants had tears in their eyes? Really? I wonder if they had tears in their eyes when New South Wales Labor destroyed the harmonisation of OH&S laws in that state. Remember, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that Premier Keneally defied Julia Gillard in a desperate attempt to shore up support for the unions and her own leadership by saying that she would not pass harmonised laws in New South Wales, she would be retaining third-party safety provisions and she would be maintaining the reverse onus of proof.



Mr Crean interjecting—




Ms LEY:
  The minister at the table, the member for Hotham, says that harmonisation is under threat, but the point is that the New South Wales Parliament has already changed the model laws in that state, so the amendments we move today would only apply to the Commonwealth jurisdiction. The horror that was New South Wales OH&S law has been explained many times, and I probably do not have time to repeat any of those stories, but thank goodness the O'Farrell government fixed up the mess to the extent that they could earlier this year and did legislate to implement the harmonised model. Changes were moved in the upper house. Changes should be moved here in this House today.


The development of OH&S laws by Australian governments has followed sound principles. The main one is that people are responsible for work safety according to what they 'reasonably' and 'practicably' can control. New South Wales and Queensland held employers automatically guilty under duty of care but enabled defences to be mounted according to 'reasonable and practicable control'. New South Wales, as we know, got out of control when it changed its OH&S laws in about 2000 so that guilt was applied to employers even if the employer had no control over the workplace or had acted reasonably. I am a rural member of parliament, and I remember one case where somebody got their leg, I think, caught in the augur of a grain chaser bin. The WorkCover authority sued the farmer, the employee and the manufacturer of the equipment, even though the equipment was brand new, the employee had gone through training and there was nothing the employer could have done. The employee admitted that it was his own silly fault. The cost to the New South Wales Farmers Federation, who undertook to fight this, was unbelievable and in the end I think they just gave up. That was the story of doing business in the state of New South Wales under their OH&S laws. Innocent people were convicted for incidents over which they had no control.


On the surface, it looks as though these new laws have embedded the principles of reasonable and practicable control, but the detail is quite different. The word 'control' has been removed. Instead, you will be responsible for workplace safety if you are 'a person conducting a business or undertaking'—a PCBU for short—and if you influence the activities of workers. To me, this does not make sense, because it is a new concept, it is not tested and it is confusing. As we know, any new legal concept takes years of testing before clarity is achieved. How is that going to help us get good workplace safety laws? In fact, there is a strong argument that these laws would put safety at risk. We are supposed to be legislating to improve safety in the work environment.


The other area of amendment concerns the right to remain silent and protection from self-incrimination. We are gravely concerned about the potential ramifications if the right to remain silent and protection from self-incrimination are denied to employers as a result of this legislation, given that prosecutions under current OH&S laws are criminal matters. OH&S law is criminal law, but the model harmonised law takes away basic rights of criminal justice. Under normal criminal law, everyone has the right to silence and protection from self-incrimination. It is a right we all hold and it is this protection that stops abuse of power. The passing of the bill in each jurisdiction will abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination in New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth OH&S Act is silent on the issue and, therefore, it is considered that the privilege against self-incrimination remains. The model OH&S laws take away this right to silence. We therefore propose removing those clauses pertaining to self-incrimination.


This legislation will not result in a national, harmonised system for OH&S because WA has backed delays to the rollout—they have additional concerns—and the Victorian parliament has also echoed some of those concerns, calling for a year-long delay in the implementation of this bill. I acknowledge we have come some way, but we have not come far enough. There is a very strong argument that the amendments here for the Commonwealth jurisdiction will not upset the harmonisation of laws across the states. As each state deals with its own issues, it has the potential to change its own laws. That is what I am proposing here today. (Time expired)

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (11:58):  The member for Farrer has moved 10 amendments together. Essentially, four of them relate to primary duty of care and the other six to self-incrimination. I will deal with them in those two groupings. The effect of the primary duty of care amendment in the bill is this: it amends clause 19 of the bill to limit the duty of care of 'a person conducting a business or undertaking', a PCBU, to matters of workplace premises under their control. The amendments would establish a threshold test based on whether or not the PCBU has control over a matter to determine whether or not the PCBU has a duty, rather than on what needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of the workers. That is the effect of what the member for Farrer is moving.


Let me just respond in this way: primary duty of care in the bill does require persons conducting a business or undertaking to ensure the health and safety of workers and other persons 'so far as is reasonably practical'. It is not an absolute requirement. The person conducting the business or undertaking need only do what can 'reasonably' be done in the circumstances to comply with that duty. The national review panel recommended—and workplace relations ministers agreed—that control should not be a separate element used to limit the extent of the primary duty of care. So they considered this matter. They also concluded that it should not be expressly included in the definition of what is reasonably practicable for two key reasons. First, the inclusion of control in the primary duty of care can result in the focus being on whether or not a duty applies, rather than on what needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of workers. In other words, a control test might encourage arrangements to avoid control in order to avoid the duty.


Secondly, the case law provides that control is relevant in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. An inability to control relevant matters must necessarily imply that it either is not possible for duty holders to do anything or is not reasonable to expect them to do so. That is not to say that the concept of control is not contained in the bill, because the bill includes specific duties for persons with management or control of workplaces and persons with management or control of fittings, fixtures or plant at workplaces. Further, the duties in clause 19(4), which the opposition is seeking to amend to include reference to control, only apply where the person conducting the business or undertaking has 'management or control' of the accommodation. At best, the amendments in items (3) and (4) add nothing to the provision as drafted; at worst, they would simply confuse the provision. So the government opposes those amendments.


In relation to the self-incrimination grouping of amendments, the effect of the amendments would remove clause 172, which is the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination, to preserve the common law right to refuse to answer questions on the ground that it might incriminate the person being asked. And items (1) to (3) and (5) and (6) make consequential amendments to clauses 155, 171 and 173 to remove references to clause 172 in those clauses. The reason we oppose this grouping of amendments is this. The right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination are important individual rights. However, they are individual rights that are not absolute; they must be balanced against the public interest. In the field of regulation—particularly in the regulation of workplace safety, which is a matter of major public importance—one crucial public interest is securing effective compliance or prosecutions. That is what is really important if we are to get on top of this problem in the workplace.


It is well established that the abrogation of individual rights may be justified if the information to be compelled concerns an issue of major public importance that has a significant impact on the community in general or a section of the community. We assert—and so did the ministers—that safety in the workplace is such an issue of major public importance. Abrogation of the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination may also be justified where there is an immediate need for information; where there is an immediate need to avoid risks such as danger to human life continuing; where there is serious personal injury or damage to human health; or where there is a compelling argument that the information is necessary to prevent further harm from occurring.


The Work Health and Safety Bill seeks to ensure that the strongest powers to compel the provision of information are available for securing ongoing work health and safety. This means abrogating the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination—and we acknowledge that point. However, the bill balances that loss of a person's right to silence by limiting both the direct and indirect use of forced disclosure against the person required to provide the information. This means that an individual will be compelled to provide information when asked, but that information, and any information that is obtained as a result of forced disclosure, cannot be used to prosecute the individual.


The advantage of section 172 is that all information is available to an inspector following a safety incident, thereby enabling an inspector to take timely safety and remedial action. I would just point out in conclusion that the review of the OHS laws did recommend that broad powers be given to inspectors. In their response they considered robust powers of inquiry and questioning, a consolidation of existing provision for inquiries and questions and a requirement for natural persons to answer an inspector's questions and provide information requested by an inspector. So we reject those amendments as well. We do understand the issue that has been raised by the member for Farrer, but in our view we have got the balance right, and it has been agreed by all of the states and the parties.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2011-10-13,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (12:06):  On this particular amendment we do insist that we re-introduce the issue of control into this bill. The minister talks about the national review, but there was an enormous amount of dissent in the submissions over the inclusion of the word 'control' in duties of care. Recommendation 8 called for the removal of the word 'control' from the definition of 'reasonable and practicable'. Unfortunately, that has been implemented in the national model OHS laws. The problem we have is that this is a new and untested legal concept of connecting duties of care to a person conducting a business or undertaking. If we take away the word 'control' it creates confusion over who is responsible for what in work safety. It is a major shift away from known OH&S principles in all Australian jurisdictions except New South Wales. I talked about that earlier. It also removes a key element of the ILO OH&S conventions, to which Australia is a signatory, and creates a legal vacuum due to unknown application and interpretation of duties of care under this new concept.


It is reasonable to expect that if we take away the word 'control'—the minister says the concept is there—legal uncertainty will occur and will require many years of judicial testing before clarity is achieved. For anyone who conducts a small business that ends up with an occupational health and safety matter in the courts—there are so many examples in New South Wales; as I said before, it is the worst state for this and businesses close down as a result of it—the last thing they want to hear is that this parliament is responsible for legislating a concept that has not been introduced into workplace health and safety laws anywhere. 


We have created this concept of a 'person conducting a business or operation' and the concept of 'duties of care and control' is connected to that person. I really want to emphasise that point because people understand, in a practical sense, that if they control something or if they share control of something then they are responsible. If you take away the word 'control', clarity and focus on personal responsibility for safety is diminished and becomes confused. 


Yes, we do want to get the balance right. We have moved away from the days of employers expecting unreasonable things from workers. We have an enormous amount of architecture in the workplace now. But the last thing we want is for employees to become confused and to believe that they do not have any personal responsibility. Ultimately, personal responsibility needs to be emphasised first and foremost, and that seems to be coming out of this legislation. And a new concept is to be introduced—a concept that is going to tie up the courts for years in working out what it really means. I thank the House.

Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (12:09):  Very briefly on that point, given that this has been responded to, I just make these three points. The concept of control is in the legislation. It will be relevant in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. We have not included 'control' in the primary duty of care as a result of the national review recommending against it. Whilst this was fought out, this was where the parties settled.


Our concern is that if you put it in it could lead to people or employers using arrangements to avoid control—to avoid meeting the test that the member wants to embody so categorically. They could be encouraged to avoid showing they had control in order to avoid the duty. Our focus is on ensuring that the duty is adhered to. It is for that reason that we oppose these amendments.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:21):  I move amendment (1) circulated in my name:


(1) Clause 230, page 158 (line 8), at the end of subclause (1), add:


; or (c)   if the offence concerned is a Category 3 offence—the secretary of a union any member or members of which are concerned in the matter to which the proceedings relate.


I note with interest the opposition's new-found commitment to the sanctity of the principle against self-incrimination and the right to silence. I hope, then, that when we are dealing with the bill to deal with the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and when I move in this place for the abolition of those coercive powers that deny ordinary workers, and other participants, in that industry the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence that the opposition will vote with me on that amendment.


Amendment (1) is similar to what was adopted in New South Wales when they entered the scheme, and it was adopted in that large jurisdiction for a very sensible reason: history has shown that with regard to the lesser category of offences under OH&S legislation—not the more primary and more serious ones that should, of course, remain prosecutable by the state—there is a distinct advantage in improving health and safety in a workplace by allowing a union who represents members in that workplace to bring prosecutions. Indeed, the Finance Sector Union has used a provision similar to this to great advantage to improve the health and safety of bank employees who, for example, were often facing robberies and the like. This was the kind of provision that allowed perhaps something that might not be at the top of the agenda of a perhaps under-resourced state prosecutor or regulator to be brought before the appropriate tribunal and then proper changes to be made to work practices. It is a very useful amendment. It was one, as I say, that was adopted in New South Wales when they entered the scheme. I commend the amendment to the House.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (12:23):  We oppose this amendment because it would undermine the very deliberate decision that was taken by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council only to allow public officials to bring prosecutions under harmonised work health and safety laws. The report made the point in summing up that the reason we are opposing generally all of the amendments is that we want to honour the agreement that we initiated, oversaw and facilitated, and which was a long time in the making.


This issue of who should be able to bring proceedings for offences under the model act was given careful consideration by the National Review into Model OHS Laws. The expert panel said that this issue warranted careful consideration because of the importance of enforcing the laws and the differences that currently exist across jurisdictions and the different stakeholder views about who should bring them. The review panel did note what the member for Melbourne has referred to—that unions were expressly allowed to prosecute in New South Wales. They have been able to do that for the past 60 years; the provisions in the ACT act were only introduced in 2008. The review report recommended that the right to initiate prosecutions for OH&S breaches should be limited to the Crown. It means that the resources, expertise and accountability of the Crown will always be applied to prosecution decisions and proceedings. This approach is taken in the context of legislation which provides regulators with a range of enforcement measures to allow them flexibility to decide which measures should apply for a particular case to achieve the best health and safety outcomes.


The review panel also cited academic research which indicated:


… in relation to corporate sanctions, a combination of measures will yield the best results in terms of achieving the overall goal of reducing the incidence of contraventions and hence the incidence of work-related injury and disease.


But the panel's recommendation was endorsed by all of the ministers of the council and accompanied by the following strong safeguards, and I think these are important to note: the process for deciding on prosecutions should be transparent and in line with clear, publicly available prosecution guidelines and, as a safeguard against regulator mistake or inactivity, regulators' decisions about not taking prosecution action should be reviewable by the Director of Public Prosecutions on request by any person.


The amendment proposed by the member for Melbourne would allow unions to bring prosecutions for category 3 offences in the bills. These are the least serious of three categories of offences against health and safety duties. Allowing unions to bring prosecutions in these cases will undermine the alternative enforcement measures available to the regulator under the bill. Enforceable undertakings, for example, could not be made where a third party could bring a prosecution at any time.


In any case, I make the point again: this amendment is inconsistent with harmonised laws and is consistent with neither amendments to the New South Wales Work Health and Safety Act nor any other jurisdiction which has introduced work health safety legislation based on the model laws to date—including the Queensland act, which has received assent and does not include a right of unions to prosecute.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:28):  by leave—I move amendments (2) to (7) circulated in my name together:

(7) Clause 251, page 176 (lines 19 and 20), omit ""or recklessness"", substitute "", recklessness or negligence"".


These amendments will give effect to what one of the participants in the harmonisation process, the ACTU, certainly understood as being an element of what was agreed—namely, that, as well as intentional and reckless acts of employers being able to be prosecuted, grossly negligent acts would also be able to be prosecuted. The ACTU made the point in their submission to the Senate inquiry that they understood that they had received a direct commitment that gross negligence would be something that was able to be prosecuted. Of course, in the context of health and safety, that makes perfect sense. Proving recklessness requires proving an element of intent, whereas negligence, and gross negligence in particular, is about the failure to comply with the required standard of care. In an area as important as health and safety, where steps are required to be taken and certain systems are required to be in place, it makes perfect sense to allow gross negligence to be the relevant test and not simply recklessness or intent. So on that basis I commend amendments (2) to (7) to the House.

Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (12:30):  The government opposes amendments (2) to (7) moved by the member for Melbourne. I do note that the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has also recommended a similar amendment to the bill but, again, this is not what the committee determined.


The model Work Health and Safety Bill which was approved does not include gross negligence in the category 1 offence. I use the word 'gross' because that was the context in which it was considered. I note the change in the amendment that is being proposed. But in not including it, that is consistent with its earlier decision that gross negligence offences should be dealt with outside the model act by local criminal laws and manslaughter offences.


If clause 31 were amended to include gross negligence it would overlap with local general criminal laws where death or serious injury or illness results. Moreover—and this is an important point—such an amendment would go beyond local general criminal laws in that it would apply to conduct that exposed an individual to risk of death or serious injury or illness even where the conduct did not actually result in death or serious injury or illness.


It is appropriate that there be sanctions in relation to negligent conduct that exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness. However, it is also equally appropriate that a serious offence, such as a category 1 offence that attracts a jail term, include an element of intention. Conduct that exposes an individual to whom a health and safety duty is owed to a risk of death or serious injury or illness because of the person's gross negligence would constitute a category 2 offence under clause 32 of the bill.


Amendments (4) through (7) are not necessary because they seek to amend the provisions in the bill that enable the relevant fault element for an offence to be attributed to the Commonwealth or to a Commonwealth public authority. It is not necessary in the context of proving criminal negligence, where only physical acts and omissions are relevant. And so we oppose this group of amendments.

These are important amendments from the perspective of harmonisation. These amendments will bring the protections that will apply in the amended Work and Health Safety Bill to people who might bring complaints or take steps that are available to them under OH&S laws into line with the protections that exist in the Fair Work Act. There are a number of reasons why that is important.


The general principle point of view from someone who has practised in this area for a number of years is that it is very rare, when it comes to questions of discrimination and victimisation for exercising workplace rights that are available to you, that an employer, a fellow worker or whoever it may be says: 'I am now taking this action against you for a discriminatory reason. I am doing this to you—demoting you, dismissing you—because you have put in a complaint.' For that reason the law has recognised for a number of years, under governments of both persuasions, federally, that when it comes to protecting workplace rights it makes sense for the onus to be reversed, but for that to be something that is of course rebuttable on the evidence. That allows someone who has an evidentiary basis for a claim to proceed, and then the onus is reversed.


In the Fair Work Act that we have at the moment that has continued. It also applies to complaints that are made under workplace laws, and those workplace laws can include health and safety laws. If these amendments are not passed, firstly, we will have a situation where someone under the Health and Safety Act will have a lower level of protection available to them than someone under the Fair Work Act and will find it more difficult to exercise their workplace rights. Given the importance we have heard about these provisions and the importance of the protections they provide, every protection should be made available to someone to exercise the rights that are available to them under law.


Secondly, because of the potential overlap between the Fair Work Act and the Work Health and Safety Bill we are going to have a situation where, unless they are harmonised, we are going to encourage forum shopping. We are not going to see complaints made under the Health and Safety Act and a separate system of resolution; we are going to see—and who could blame someone for doing this?—people exercising their rights under the Fair Work Act and potentially seeking to expand the definition of what counts as a workplace right under that act, knowing that there will be more favourable provisions available to them there—provisions that, as I have said, have been enacted under both coalition and Labor governments.


It is for that reason, if we are serious about harmonisation, that these amendments should be passed. I commend the amendments to the House.

Mr CREAN

 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (12:37):The government opposes these amendments too. In moving these amendments, the member for Melbourne has suggested that their purpose is to align the discrimination provisions in the Work Health and Safety Bill with those in the Fair Work Act. I note that the passage of this bill was recommended by the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee.


Whilst it is true that there is overlap between the provisions of the Work Health and Safety Bill and those of the Fair Work Act, the provisions of each operate differently. Discriminatory conduct under clause 104 of the Work Health and Safety Bill is a criminal offence; the provisions of the Fair Work Act are subject to civil penalties only. The penalty in the Work Health and Safety Bill of $100,000 is substantially greater than the civil penalty under the Fair Work Act of 60 penalty units—that is, $6,600. In fact, the penalty to be paid to Fair Work Australia under the WHS Bill is 15 times greater.


In addition, a person found guilty of an offence under the Work Health and Safety Bill will have the stigma of a criminal offence conviction, which is not the case under the Fair Work Act's civil penalty provision. The provisions of the Work Health and Safety Bill do not replace or displace the Fair Work Act provisions. Discriminatory conduct for a prohibited reason under the Work Health and Safety Bill may also breach the adverse action provisions of the Fair Work Act. Proceedings may be brought under either act; however, a person cannot bring civil proceedings under both acts.


In relation to the amendments to the criminal offence aspect, in the context of imposing criminal liability it is appropriate that a prohibited reason be a dominant or sole reason for discriminatory conduct. Whilst the test is different to the standard required by the civil remedy provisions of the Fair Work Act, the dominant reason test is necessarily reserved for the more serious offences with significant penalties attached. The bill also recognises the right of a person to be presumed innocent of a criminal offence until proven guilty, but the amendments proposed today would in effect reverse that onus of proof.


The civil penalty provisions in the Fair Work Act and the civil proceedings provisions under the Work Health and Safety Bill operate differently. The Fair Work Act provisions are part of the compliance regime of that act. Under that act, a civil penalty is provided because a person has breached the law, but under the Work Health and Safety Bill breaches of the law are dealt with as criminal rather than civil matters.


The Work Health and Safety Bill civil proceedings provisions are not intended as punishment for breaching the law but rather to provide for additional mechanisms for the person who is the subject of the discrimination to remedy the breach. The Work Health and Safety Bill enables an eligible person—that is, the person affected by the contravention or their representative—to bring civil proceedings in relation to discriminatory conduct. The court can grant a range of civil remedies, including compensation and reinstatement, but unlike under the Fair Work Act it cannot order a civil penalty. The requirement in the model bill that the discriminatory reason must be the substantial reason for the civil cause of action was an explicit decision of the Workplace Relations Ministers' Council.


They are the reasons, but in effect this too would cut against what was recommended after exhaustive consultations. We oppose this group of amendments.

I wish to make these amendments to the Work Health and Safety Bill 2011. Let me emphasise that we in the coalition do support the harmonisation of OH&S laws. In fact, it was a coalition government that initiated the process, in 2006, hence the Prime Minister is claiming credit for something that the Howard government commenced and that she had not completed. Many speakers on this side have reminded the House of her remarks at the time, that she had actually delivered new occupational health and safety laws. Her words were:


… I have delivered that.


Thirty years—on the day we delivered it there were some public servants that had tears in their eyes because they spent all their working life waiting for someone to deliver that reform. Wasn't easy, but I got it done.


Public servants had tears in their eyes? Really? I wonder if they had tears in their eyes when New South Wales Labor destroyed the harmonisation of OH&S laws in that state. Remember, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, that Premier Keneally defied Julia Gillard in a desperate attempt to shore up support for the unions and her own leadership by saying that she would not pass harmonised laws in New South Wales, she would be retaining third-party safety provisions and she would be maintaining the reverse onus of proof.



Mr Crean interjecting—




Ms LEY:
  The minister at the table, the member for Hotham, says that harmonisation is under threat, but the point is that the New South Wales Parliament has already changed the model laws in that state, so the amendments we move today would only apply to the Commonwealth jurisdiction. The horror that was New South Wales OH&S law has been explained many times, and I probably do not have time to repeat any of those stories, but thank goodness the O'Farrell government fixed up the mess to the extent that they could earlier this year and did legislate to implement the harmonised model. Changes were moved in the upper house. Changes should be moved here in this House today.


The development of OH&S laws by Australian governments has followed sound principles. The main one is that people are responsible for work safety according to what they 'reasonably' and 'practicably' can control. New South Wales and Queensland held employers automatically guilty under duty of care but enabled defences to be mounted according to 'reasonable and practicable control'. New South Wales, as we know, got out of control when it changed its OH&S laws in about 2000 so that guilt was applied to employers even if the employer had no control over the workplace or had acted reasonably. I am a rural member of parliament, and I remember one case where somebody got their leg, I think, caught in the augur of a grain chaser bin. The WorkCover authority sued the farmer, the employee and the manufacturer of the equipment, even though the equipment was brand new, the employee had gone through training and there was nothing the employer could have done. The employee admitted that it was his own silly fault. The cost to the New South Wales Farmers Federation, who undertook to fight this, was unbelievable and in the end I think they just gave up. That was the story of doing business in the state of New South Wales under their OH&S laws. Innocent people were convicted for incidents over which they had no control.


On the surface, it looks as though these new laws have embedded the principles of reasonable and practicable control, but the detail is quite different. The word 'control' has been removed. Instead, you will be responsible for workplace safety if you are 'a person conducting a business or undertaking'—a PCBU for short—and if you influence the activities of workers. To me, this does not make sense, because it is a new concept, it is not tested and it is confusing. As we know, any new legal concept takes years of testing before clarity is achieved. How is that going to help us get good workplace safety laws? In fact, there is a strong argument that these laws would put safety at risk. We are supposed to be legislating to improve safety in the work environment.


The other area of amendment concerns the right to remain silent and protection from self-incrimination. We are gravely concerned about the potential ramifications if the right to remain silent and protection from self-incrimination are denied to employers as a result of this legislation, given that prosecutions under current OH&S laws are criminal matters. OH&S law is criminal law, but the model harmonised law takes away basic rights of criminal justice. Under normal criminal law, everyone has the right to silence and protection from self-incrimination. It is a right we all hold and it is this protection that stops abuse of power. The passing of the bill in each jurisdiction will abrogate the privilege against self-incrimination in New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth OH&S Act is silent on the issue and, therefore, it is considered that the privilege against self-incrimination remains. The model OH&S laws take away this right to silence. We therefore propose removing those clauses pertaining to self-incrimination.


This legislation will not result in a national, harmonised system for OH&S because WA has backed delays to the rollout—they have additional concerns—and the Victorian parliament has also echoed some of those concerns, calling for a year-long delay in the implementation of this bill. I acknowledge we have come some way, but we have not come far enough. There is a very strong argument that the amendments here for the Commonwealth jurisdiction will not upset the harmonisation of laws across the states. As each state deals with its own issues, it has the potential to change its own laws. That is what I am proposing here today. (Time expired)

Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (11:58):  The member for Farrer has moved 10 amendments together. Essentially, four of them relate to primary duty of care and the other six to self-incrimination. I will deal with them in those two groupings. The effect of the primary duty of care amendment in the bill is this: it amends clause 19 of the bill to limit the duty of care of 'a person conducting a business or undertaking', a PCBU, to matters of workplace premises under their control. The amendments would establish a threshold test based on whether or not the PCBU has control over a matter to determine whether or not the PCBU has a duty, rather than on what needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of the workers. That is the effect of what the member for Farrer is moving.


Let me just respond in this way: primary duty of care in the bill does require persons conducting a business or undertaking to ensure the health and safety of workers and other persons 'so far as is reasonably practical'. It is not an absolute requirement. The person conducting the business or undertaking need only do what can 'reasonably' be done in the circumstances to comply with that duty. The national review panel recommended—and workplace relations ministers agreed—that control should not be a separate element used to limit the extent of the primary duty of care. So they considered this matter. They also concluded that it should not be expressly included in the definition of what is reasonably practicable for two key reasons. First, the inclusion of control in the primary duty of care can result in the focus being on whether or not a duty applies, rather than on what needs to be done to ensure the health and safety of workers. In other words, a control test might encourage arrangements to avoid control in order to avoid the duty.


Secondly, the case law provides that control is relevant in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. An inability to control relevant matters must necessarily imply that it either is not possible for duty holders to do anything or is not reasonable to expect them to do so. That is not to say that the concept of control is not contained in the bill, because the bill includes specific duties for persons with management or control of workplaces and persons with management or control of fittings, fixtures or plant at workplaces. Further, the duties in clause 19(4), which the opposition is seeking to amend to include reference to control, only apply where the person conducting the business or undertaking has 'management or control' of the accommodation. At best, the amendments in items (3) and (4) add nothing to the provision as drafted; at worst, they would simply confuse the provision. So the government opposes those amendments.


In relation to the self-incrimination grouping of amendments, the effect of the amendments would remove clause 172, which is the abrogation of the privilege against self-incrimination, to preserve the common law right to refuse to answer questions on the ground that it might incriminate the person being asked. And items (1) to (3) and (5) and (6) make consequential amendments to clauses 155, 171 and 173 to remove references to clause 172 in those clauses. The reason we oppose this grouping of amendments is this. The right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination are important individual rights. However, they are individual rights that are not absolute; they must be balanced against the public interest. In the field of regulation—particularly in the regulation of workplace safety, which is a matter of major public importance—one crucial public interest is securing effective compliance or prosecutions. That is what is really important if we are to get on top of this problem in the workplace.


It is well established that the abrogation of individual rights may be justified if the information to be compelled concerns an issue of major public importance that has a significant impact on the community in general or a section of the community. We assert—and so did the ministers—that safety in the workplace is such an issue of major public importance. Abrogation of the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination may also be justified where there is an immediate need for information; where there is an immediate need to avoid risks such as danger to human life continuing; where there is serious personal injury or damage to human health; or where there is a compelling argument that the information is necessary to prevent further harm from occurring.


The Work Health and Safety Bill seeks to ensure that the strongest powers to compel the provision of information are available for securing ongoing work health and safety. This means abrogating the right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination—and we acknowledge that point. However, the bill balances that loss of a person's right to silence by limiting both the direct and indirect use of forced disclosure against the person required to provide the information. This means that an individual will be compelled to provide information when asked, but that information, and any information that is obtained as a result of forced disclosure, cannot be used to prosecute the individual.


The advantage of section 172 is that all information is available to an inspector following a safety incident, thereby enabling an inspector to take timely safety and remedial action. I would just point out in conclusion that the review of the OHS laws did recommend that broad powers be given to inspectors. In their response they considered robust powers of inquiry and questioning, a consolidation of existing provision for inquiries and questions and a requirement for natural persons to answer an inspector's questions and provide information requested by an inspector. So we reject those amendments as well. We do understand the issue that has been raised by the member for Farrer, but in our view we have got the balance right, and it has been agreed by all of the states and the parties.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2011-10-13,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (12:06):  On this particular amendment we do insist that we re-introduce the issue of control into this bill. The minister talks about the national review, but there was an enormous amount of dissent in the submissions over the inclusion of the word 'control' in duties of care. Recommendation 8 called for the removal of the word 'control' from the definition of 'reasonable and practicable'. Unfortunately, that has been implemented in the national model OHS laws. The problem we have is that this is a new and untested legal concept of connecting duties of care to a person conducting a business or undertaking. If we take away the word 'control' it creates confusion over who is responsible for what in work safety. It is a major shift away from known OH&S principles in all Australian jurisdictions except New South Wales. I talked about that earlier. It also removes a key element of the ILO OH&S conventions, to which Australia is a signatory, and creates a legal vacuum due to unknown application and interpretation of duties of care under this new concept.


It is reasonable to expect that if we take away the word 'control'—the minister says the concept is there—legal uncertainty will occur and will require many years of judicial testing before clarity is achieved. For anyone who conducts a small business that ends up with an occupational health and safety matter in the courts—there are so many examples in New South Wales; as I said before, it is the worst state for this and businesses close down as a result of it—the last thing they want to hear is that this parliament is responsible for legislating a concept that has not been introduced into workplace health and safety laws anywhere. 


We have created this concept of a 'person conducting a business or operation' and the concept of 'duties of care and control' is connected to that person. I really want to emphasise that point because people understand, in a practical sense, that if they control something or if they share control of something then they are responsible. If you take away the word 'control', clarity and focus on personal responsibility for safety is diminished and becomes confused. 


Yes, we do want to get the balance right. We have moved away from the days of employers expecting unreasonable things from workers. We have an enormous amount of architecture in the workplace now. But the last thing we want is for employees to become confused and to believe that they do not have any personal responsibility. Ultimately, personal responsibility needs to be emphasised first and foremost, and that seems to be coming out of this legislation. And a new concept is to be introduced—a concept that is going to tie up the courts for years in working out what it really means. I thank the House.

Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (12:09):  Very briefly on that point, given that this has been responded to, I just make these three points. The concept of control is in the legislation. It will be relevant in determining what is reasonably practicable in the circumstances. We have not included 'control' in the primary duty of care as a result of the national review recommending against it. Whilst this was fought out, this was where the parties settled.


Our concern is that if you put it in it could lead to people or employers using arrangements to avoid control—to avoid meeting the test that the member wants to embody so categorically. They could be encouraged to avoid showing they had control in order to avoid the duty. Our focus is on ensuring that the duty is adhered to. It is for that reason that we oppose these amendments.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:21):  I move amendment (1) circulated in my name:


(1) Clause 230, page 158 (line 8), at the end of subclause (1), add:


; or (c)   if the offence concerned is a Category 3 offence—the secretary of a union any member or members of which are concerned in the matter to which the proceedings relate.


I note with interest the opposition's new-found commitment to the sanctity of the principle against self-incrimination and the right to silence. I hope, then, that when we are dealing with the bill to deal with the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and when I move in this place for the abolition of those coercive powers that deny ordinary workers, and other participants, in that industry the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to silence that the opposition will vote with me on that amendment.


Amendment (1) is similar to what was adopted in New South Wales when they entered the scheme, and it was adopted in that large jurisdiction for a very sensible reason: history has shown that with regard to the lesser category of offences under OH&S legislation—not the more primary and more serious ones that should, of course, remain prosecutable by the state—there is a distinct advantage in improving health and safety in a workplace by allowing a union who represents members in that workplace to bring prosecutions. Indeed, the Finance Sector Union has used a provision similar to this to great advantage to improve the health and safety of bank employees who, for example, were often facing robberies and the like. This was the kind of provision that allowed perhaps something that might not be at the top of the agenda of a perhaps under-resourced state prosecutor or regulator to be brought before the appropriate tribunal and then proper changes to be made to work practices. It is a very useful amendment. It was one, as I say, that was adopted in New South Wales when they entered the scheme. I commend the amendment to the House.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Consideration in Detail</title>,BILLS,11,2,speech
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (12:23):  We oppose this amendment because it would undermine the very deliberate decision that was taken by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council only to allow public officials to bring prosecutions under harmonised work health and safety laws. The report made the point in summing up that the reason we are opposing generally all of the amendments is that we want to honour the agreement that we initiated, oversaw and facilitated, and which was a long time in the making.


This issue of who should be able to bring proceedings for offences under the model act was given careful consideration by the National Review into Model OHS Laws. The expert panel said that this issue warranted careful consideration because of the importance of enforcing the laws and the differences that currently exist across jurisdictions and the different stakeholder views about who should bring them. The review panel did note what the member for Melbourne has referred to—that unions were expressly allowed to prosecute in New South Wales. They have been able to do that for the past 60 years; the provisions in the ACT act were only introduced in 2008. The review report recommended that the right to initiate prosecutions for OH&S breaches should be limited to the Crown. It means that the resources, expertise and accountability of the Crown will always be applied to prosecution decisions and proceedings. This approach is taken in the context of legislation which provides regulators with a range of enforcement measures to allow them flexibility to decide which measures should apply for a particular case to achieve the best health and safety outcomes.


The review panel also cited academic research which indicated:


… in relation to corporate sanctions, a combination of measures will yield the best results in terms of achieving the overall goal of reducing the incidence of contraventions and hence the incidence of work-related injury and disease.


But the panel's recommendation was endorsed by all of the ministers of the council and accompanied by the following strong safeguards, and I think these are important to note: the process for deciding on prosecutions should be transparent and in line with clear, publicly available prosecution guidelines and, as a safeguard against regulator mistake or inactivity, regulators' decisions about not taking prosecution action should be reviewable by the Director of Public Prosecutions on request by any person.


The amendment proposed by the member for Melbourne would allow unions to bring prosecutions for category 3 offences in the bills. These are the least serious of three categories of offences against health and safety duties. Allowing unions to bring prosecutions in these cases will undermine the alternative enforcement measures available to the regulator under the bill. Enforceable undertakings, for example, could not be made where a third party could bring a prosecution at any time.


In any case, I make the point again: this amendment is inconsistent with harmonised laws and is consistent with neither amendments to the New South Wales Work Health and Safety Act nor any other jurisdiction which has introduced work health safety legislation based on the model laws to date—including the Queensland act, which has received assent and does not include a right of unions to prosecute.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (12:28):  by leave—I move amendments (2) to (7) circulated in my name together:

(7) Clause 251, page 176 (lines 19 and 20), omit ""or recklessness"", substitute "", recklessness or negligence"".


These amendments will give effect to what one of the participants in the harmonisation process, the ACTU, certainly understood as being an element of what was agreed—namely, that, as well as intentional and reckless acts of employers being able to be prosecuted, grossly negligent acts would also be able to be prosecuted. The ACTU made the point in their submission to the Senate inquiry that they understood that they had received a direct commitment that gross negligence would be something that was able to be prosecuted. Of course, in the context of health and safety, that makes perfect sense. Proving recklessness requires proving an element of intent, whereas negligence, and gross negligence in particular, is about the failure to comply with the required standard of care. In an area as important as health and safety, where steps are required to be taken and certain systems are required to be in place, it makes perfect sense to allow gross negligence to be the relevant test and not simply recklessness or intent. So on that basis I commend amendments (2) to (7) to the House.

Mr CREAN
 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (12:30):  The government opposes amendments (2) to (7) moved by the member for Melbourne. I do note that the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations has also recommended a similar amendment to the bill but, again, this is not what the committee determined.


The model Work Health and Safety Bill which was approved does not include gross negligence in the category 1 offence. I use the word 'gross' because that was the context in which it was considered. I note the change in the amendment that is being proposed. But in not including it, that is consistent with its earlier decision that gross negligence offences should be dealt with outside the model act by local criminal laws and manslaughter offences.


If clause 31 were amended to include gross negligence it would overlap with local general criminal laws where death or serious injury or illness results. Moreover—and this is an important point—such an amendment would go beyond local general criminal laws in that it would apply to conduct that exposed an individual to risk of death or serious injury or illness even where the conduct did not actually result in death or serious injury or illness.


It is appropriate that there be sanctions in relation to negligent conduct that exposes an individual to a risk of death or serious injury or illness. However, it is also equally appropriate that a serious offence, such as a category 1 offence that attracts a jail term, include an element of intention. Conduct that exposes an individual to whom a health and safety duty is owed to a risk of death or serious injury or illness because of the person's gross negligence would constitute a category 2 offence under clause 32 of the bill.


Amendments (4) through (7) are not necessary because they seek to amend the provisions in the bill that enable the relevant fault element for an offence to be attributed to the Commonwealth or to a Commonwealth public authority. It is not necessary in the context of proving criminal negligence, where only physical acts and omissions are relevant. And so we oppose this group of amendments.

These are important amendments from the perspective of harmonisation. These amendments will bring the protections that will apply in the amended Work and Health Safety Bill to people who might bring complaints or take steps that are available to them under OH&S laws into line with the protections that exist in the Fair Work Act. There are a number of reasons why that is important.


The general principle point of view from someone who has practised in this area for a number of years is that it is very rare, when it comes to questions of discrimination and victimisation for exercising workplace rights that are available to you, that an employer, a fellow worker or whoever it may be says: 'I am now taking this action against you for a discriminatory reason. I am doing this to you—demoting you, dismissing you—because you have put in a complaint.' For that reason the law has recognised for a number of years, under governments of both persuasions, federally, that when it comes to protecting workplace rights it makes sense for the onus to be reversed, but for that to be something that is of course rebuttable on the evidence. That allows someone who has an evidentiary basis for a claim to proceed, and then the onus is reversed.


In the Fair Work Act that we have at the moment that has continued. It also applies to complaints that are made under workplace laws, and those workplace laws can include health and safety laws. If these amendments are not passed, firstly, we will have a situation where someone under the Health and Safety Act will have a lower level of protection available to them than someone under the Fair Work Act and will find it more difficult to exercise their workplace rights. Given the importance we have heard about these provisions and the importance of the protections they provide, every protection should be made available to someone to exercise the rights that are available to them under law.


Secondly, because of the potential overlap between the Fair Work Act and the Work Health and Safety Bill we are going to have a situation where, unless they are harmonised, we are going to encourage forum shopping. We are not going to see complaints made under the Health and Safety Act and a separate system of resolution; we are going to see—and who could blame someone for doing this?—people exercising their rights under the Fair Work Act and potentially seeking to expand the definition of what counts as a workplace right under that act, knowing that there will be more favourable provisions available to them there—provisions that, as I have said, have been enacted under both coalition and Labor governments.


It is for that reason, if we are serious about harmonisation, that these amendments should be passed. I commend the amendments to the House.

Mr CREAN

 (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (12:37):The government opposes these amendments too. In moving these amendments, the member for Melbourne has suggested that their purpose is to align the discrimination provisions in the Work Health and Safety Bill with those in the Fair Work Act. I note that the passage of this bill was recommended by the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee.


Whilst it is true that there is overlap between the provisions of the Work Health and Safety Bill and those of the Fair Work Act, the provisions of each operate differently. Discriminatory conduct under clause 104 of the Work Health and Safety Bill is a criminal offence; the provisions of the Fair Work Act are subject to civil penalties only. The penalty in the Work Health and Safety Bill of $100,000 is substantially greater than the civil penalty under the Fair Work Act of 60 penalty units—that is, $6,600. In fact, the penalty to be paid to Fair Work Australia under the WHS Bill is 15 times greater.


In addition, a person found guilty of an offence under the Work Health and Safety Bill will have the stigma of a criminal offence conviction, which is not the case under the Fair Work Act's civil penalty provision. The provisions of the Work Health and Safety Bill do not replace or displace the Fair Work Act provisions. Discriminatory conduct for a prohibited reason under the Work Health and Safety Bill may also breach the adverse action provisions of the Fair Work Act. Proceedings may be brought under either act; however, a person cannot bring civil proceedings under both acts.


In relation to the amendments to the criminal offence aspect, in the context of imposing criminal liability it is appropriate that a prohibited reason be a dominant or sole reason for discriminatory conduct. Whilst the test is different to the standard required by the civil remedy provisions of the Fair Work Act, the dominant reason test is necessarily reserved for the more serious offences with significant penalties attached. The bill also recognises the right of a person to be presumed innocent of a criminal offence until proven guilty, but the amendments proposed today would in effect reverse that onus of proof.


The civil penalty provisions in the Fair Work Act and the civil proceedings provisions under the Work Health and Safety Bill operate differently. The Fair Work Act provisions are part of the compliance regime of that act. Under that act, a civil penalty is provided because a person has breached the law, but under the Work Health and Safety Bill breaches of the law are dealt with as criminal rather than civil matters.


The Work Health and Safety Bill civil proceedings provisions are not intended as punishment for breaching the law but rather to provide for additional mechanisms for the person who is the subject of the discrimination to remedy the breach. The Work Health and Safety Bill enables an eligible person—that is, the person affected by the contravention or their representative—to bring civil proceedings in relation to discriminatory conduct. The court can grant a range of civil remedies, including compensation and reinstatement, but unlike under the Fair Work Act it cannot order a civil penalty. The requirement in the model bill that the discriminatory reason must be the substantial reason for the civil cause of action was an explicit decision of the Workplace Relations Ministers' Council.


They are the reasons, but in effect this too would cut against what was recommended after exhaustive consultations. We oppose this group of amendments.


Question negatived.

Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong) (13:49):  Last night revellers were causing havoc in the Glenferrie Road shopping strip in my electorate. Acts of violence and widespread littering are all too common. The local traders' association, local police and Boroondara Council, led by Councillor Phil Meggs, are united in their belief that something must be done. I was therefore delighted to hear the Assistant Treasurer and member for Maribyrnong say, when asked by Neil Mitchell last Friday about the mess in Glenferrie Road, 'Put in some closed circuit cameras on the Maccas because that will stop people.'


Well, Assistant Treasurer, here is your chance—show us the money! Unlike the Labor Party, the coalition had a policy at the last election to put CCTV cameras in major shopping strips across the country. In Kooyong I committed $70,000 for cameras in Burke Road. Now has come the time to put them in Glenferrie Road. It is estimated by local council that the installation of CCTV cameras will cost around $280,000 so today I have written to the Assistant Treasurer seeking a commitment for this amount. If the government are not prepared to pay for the CCTV cameras they should not be suggesting it.


But this was not the Assistant Treasurer's only faux pas in his interview with Neil Mitchell. He also claimed that the increased littering was due to the removal by council of rubbish bins: 'The other thing though is, have you ever noticed, I reckon councils are getting rid of bins.' This is simply not the case. The Boroondara Council has confirmed that there are 21 litter bins and 21 recycling bins along the shopping strip on Glenferrie Road and that this number has remained steady over time. So, Assistant Treasurer, you are wrong again. (Time expired)

The President's visit has historic resonance, as this year is the 60th anniversary of the Australia-United States alliance and the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. During his visit we will be firmly focused on the future: on our future alliance partnership, on the opportunities for our societies in the Asian century, on economic growth and on jobs.

"Gillard, Julia, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:02):  To the Leader of the Opposition I say: what an extraordinary question in a week in which one of his shadow ministers has been named for gross disorder in this House. If he is interested in questions of conduct in parliament then he might address whether or not the member for Indi should be sitting on his front bench. While he is at it, he should make a series of other decisions as well.


Yesterday the clean energy legislation went through this parliament. I think it is a good thing that this parliament has decided to cut carbon pollution. That is the right thing to do. I think it is a good thing that we have decided to reach our bipartisan target of a five per cent reduction in carbon pollution in the cheapest possible way. I think it is a good thing that we have put a price on carbon so we can unleash $100 billion of new investment in clean and renewable energy. I think it is a good thing that this parliament yesterday decided to triple the tax free threshold so that secondary income earners going out to work—often women making the choice to return to work, perhaps part time after having a child—and people making a journey from welfare to work see more of the benefits of that work straightaway, that we see a million people out of the tax system, that we make it easier for them to get to work and to enjoy the fruits of their labours in their hands through their pay packets rather than being taken away by the tax system.


I think it is a good thing that we are providing extra assistance to pensioners. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that the package has been designed so that on average pensioners will come out in front. They will have more money at their disposal than they do now. I think that is a good thing to help the pensioners of Australia. I also think it is a good thing that we are providing tax cuts to people who earn less than $80,000. Many of them will see a tax cut of $300. Some of them will see a tax cut of more than that. I think it is a good thing that we are providing those tax cuts.


I understand that the Leader of the Opposition—because he has no policies that will work, because he always says no—will come into this parliament day after day and seek to continue to prosecute his fear campaign in the Australian community. But the one thing I say about the continued prosecution of that fear campaign is: Australians will ultimately be able to judge what it is worth as carbon pricing comes into effect on 1 July next year. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: whatever his words—having lived through the election promise of a rock solid ironclad guarantee and having seen that promise smashed by the Leader of the Opposition—no-one is going to believe him about taking carbon pricing away because he is not to be believed on this question.


The Leader of the Opposition will huff and puff about carbon pricing but he knows, as I know, that around half the people who sit behind him are in favour of carbon pricing. The people who sit on his front bench have been out there publicly in favour of carbon pricing. He has been out there publicly in favour of carbon pricing. Former Prime Minister Howard has been out there publicly in favour of carbon pricing. The Leader of the Opposition will find it hard to keep covering up the fact that the Liberal Party has absolutely no real intention to ever take this carbon pricing away.

Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation) (14:13):  I would like to thank the member for Petrie for her question, because she understands, like all of the government do, that the clean energy legislation package will provide prosperity for this nation into the future. It will build our future prosperity. We on this side of the House wish to reduce carbon pollution for a clean energy future. We understand that business needs certainty and that the largest polluters should pay the price of their pollution. But, because we are a Labor government, we understand that families need a fair go and that certain industries will need help on the path of transition. That is why the package that was passed yesterday will target only the biggest polluters, while nine out of 10 households will be compensated, and it is how we will cut 160 million tonnes of carbon pollution by 2020.


In the great tradition of Labor, we understand that change in our economy is inevitable. From the 19th century of gold and farming through to the manufacturing story after World War II and now our growing and prosperous services economy, we understand that we cannot resist the future and that to turn our back on the future is selling our people short. We want to move into a low-pollution economy with good jobs, clean technologies, powerful innovation and a sustainable future. We will still be an agricultural producer with the changes we have made. We will still be a manufacturer with the changes we have made. And we will still be producing services, but we will not be a rapidly-expanding carbon producer.


The Labor government will help people through this change. Not only are we delivering reform but we will be assisting the workforces and families with reskilling and new training. We will make sure that people do not get left behind in the process of economic change. As former Prime Minister Paul Keating remarked on 11 July this year, the pricing mechanism is 'part of the Labor tradition of change, the Labor tradition of the adaptation of the economy'.


Unfortunately the opposition are stuck in the past. The Leader of the Opposition is a modern-day King Canute who would say that you can turn back the tide. There is no credible plan for the opposition to address climate change. They have the famously misnamed 'direct action plan'. Not a single economist supports it and it will rip away the significant tax cuts and pension increases which are delivered to people under our plan. Former Prime Minister Howard understood the need to be internationally competitive. He understood the importance of getting on with it now. He said at the Melbourne Press Club on 17 July 2007:


In the years to come it will provide a model for other nations to follow.


Being among the first movers on carbon trading in this region will bring new opportunities and we intend to grasp them.


The shadow Treasurer tried to rewrite this history on radio this morning, but he got caught out. We have a problem in this parliament; it is called the opposition. They are crippled by philosophical contradictions. Former Prime Minister Howard supported an ETS. Brendan Nelson supported an ETS. The member for Wentworth probably still supports an ETS. In fact, I suspect that nearly half of those opposite support an ETS, but they are not brave enough or they have been gagged from voting with their conscience. The real issue for our prosperity is you can lie to the people and say to them that you cannot change. Only the conservatives would have you believe you cannot change. We are clear: change is inevitable and we want to help our people move on with it. (Time expired)

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:27):  I thank the member for New England for his question. He has had a strong interest in this issue throughout the negotiations in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. The government is well aware of the issues raised by meat processors and landfill operators and particularly by local governments with landfill that are associated with the introduction of carbon pricing.


Recently in Melbourne I met with the Australian Meat Industry Council to discuss the meat processing sector in particular and the opportunities that do exist under the programs that the government has announced with the clean energy package. My department as well has also visited a number of sites, a number of abattoirs, including a visit to Bindaree Beef in Inverell and is going to be making a presentation to a meat industry workshop next week on these issues, so the department and the government are very well engaged.


Many meat processors have already investigated opportunities to become more energy efficient with the approaching carbon price and also to reduce emissions from their settlement ponds. There are opportunities to capture methane, in particular from the settlement ponds, to generate electricity that would then reduce the need to buy electricity off the grid and also provide the opportunity for those operators to create renewable energy certificates. Some meat processors will be able to take sufficient actions, in fact, we anticipate, to fall below the 25,000 tonne emissions threshold that the member for New England adverted to. In addition, the meat processors will be able to benefit from the $150 million that will be available under the Clean Technology Food and Foundries Investment Program which is co-contribution grant funding for food processors to reduce their emissions to improve their energy efficiency. So there are a number of opportunities in that sector to deal with this issue. In relation to local government landfills there are a number of similar issues that I could point to. In particular, one of the amendments that the government moved to the legislation two days ago in the House, and which was carried by the House, dealt with this issue and indeed means that many small landfill operators, particularly local governments, will not be liable under the carbon price mechanism certainly over the first three years of the scheme. That is something that has been welcomed by the Local Government Association.


Landfills will also be able to meet up to 100 per cent of their liability during the first three years of the scheme from credits created under the Carbon Farming Initiative—another thing that has been welcomed in recent days. In fact, the government estimates that the carbon farming credits created by landfill operators for their legacy methane will actually exceed their liability under the carbon price for their landfill emissions probably until the year 2020 and beyond. So there are some very good opportunities for local governments in the landfill area.


Yesterday, the president of the Local Government Association issued a press release welcoming all of these initiatives and had this to say:


ALGA welcomes the outcomes of the parliamentary process and the introduction of a market-based approach to carbon pricing. The amended legislation addresses local government's concerns about the impact of a carbon price on small landfills, many of which are owned by councils.


Finally, could I just say how important the contributions of ALGA, local governments and, in particular, the members on the cross benches—particularly, the member for New England—have been in bringing about this outcome.

 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (14:32):  I thank the member for Kingston for her question and for her commitment to a clean energy future. She understands, as her South Australian colleagues understand, just how important it is for Australia's future—particularly for the future of our children—that this legislation is now through the House of Representatives and will mean that we will have a price on carbon from 1 July next year.


Of course, because we are a Labor government, we will make sure that pensioners and families get the support that they need to make sure they get help to balance their household budgets. We have made sure that before 1 July next year pensioners and families receiving payments will receive a lump sum—that will happen before 1 July next year—and nine out of 10 households will get help to balance their household budgets.


As the House knows, because of the actions of this side of the parliament, 3.4 million pensioners will not only get the lump sum before 1 July next year but also get an ongoing increase in their pension. What all of these pensioners and all of the families on payments need to know is that every single one of the members of the Liberal and National parties voted no yesterday to stop these increases in payments and to stop the increases in pensions that the parliament will now deliver.


And, of course, the Leader of the Opposition has told us that he is going to roll back these changes. The reality for families and pensioners is that this will mean that this Leader of the Opposition will be increasing taxes and clawing back pension rises and clawing back payments to families. Families also know that they are going to be slugged by the Leader of the Opposition, who is going to impose on each and every family another $1,300 that he is then going to pay to polluters. That is what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do.


This has all been confirmed very loudly and very proudly by the member for North Sydney. This morning on Radio National he said: 'These are not real pension increases.' They might not be real pension increases to the member for North Sydney but they most certainly are for the more than 10,000 pensioners in North Sydney—10,000 pensioners in North Sydney who are going to have their money clawed back as a result of this Leader of the Opposition.

Mr COMBET
 (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:41):  I thank the member for Cunningham because she certainly has a very keen interest in seeing the steel transformation plan implemented. Of course, it was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday along with the other clean energy bills and it was opposed—astonishingly—by the Liberal and National Parties. As is well known, the steel industry is facing very difficult times in this country. Global markets are struggling. The high value of the dollar has made steel exports less competitive and imports cheaper, and iron ore and coking coal prices are high. The two major companies have been losing money in their steel production and we are already seeing job losses and the closure of a blast furnace in Port Kembla because of these factors.


This government is committed to steel manufacturing in this country. We are committed to the workers that it employs and we are committed to regions like Whyalla and Port Kembla that depend upon the steel industry. That is why the government has worked very closely with the steel industry in developing the $300 million steel transformation plan, which is supported by Bluescope, OneSteel and the unions representing the steel workforce. The plan itself is designed to support the industry and its workforce through these difficult times, to help reduce the emissions intensity of the industry, to support innovation and to support research and development, the application of new technology and investment in the industry. Importantly, the plan and the fact that it will be legislated will provide confidence to the financial institutions that help the industry invest.


For the last six months the Leader of the Opposition has visited Australian steel towns and workplaces to emphasise his alleged commitment to the industry. He told Whyalla that he was so concerned that Whyalla would be wiped off the map, that Whyalla risks becoming a ghost town—an economic wasteland. He told steelworkers in Port Kembla, trying to terrify them, that he was concerned that they would lose their jobs to people in China and Indonesia. He told the Australian Steel Convention:

  This gets us to an interpretation of direct relevance. I suggest to the minister that he reduces the amount of argument and reference to people in the answer. I am happy for him to discuss the policy matters, but this is a response that is bordering on those that I characterised last sitting week as what we were trying to avoid. The minister has the call.




Mr COMBET:
  Thank you. I was asked what would happen if the steel plan were not established. There has been a lot of commentary about the difficulties confronting the steel industry, and many, including the Leader of the Opposition, have made observations about the importance of the industry, its survival and its competitiveness. After all of the statements that the Leader of the Opposition has made you would think that he was a veritable man of steel; but, in fact, he is a cream puff. When the opportunity came—




The SPEAKER:
  The minister will now come to his conclusion.




Mr COMBET:
  the opposition voted against a $300 million plan to support the steel industry. It voted against the workers in the industry. It voted against the company's position in support of the plan. In addition, with the importance of this plan to investment confidence in the industry, the last thing that the industry needs is the Leader of the Opposition to be making a 'blood oath' that he will repeal the legislation. No-one believes that that will be lived up to.

  The minister will now resume his seat.

The committee that was recently formed by this parliament is working quite well. It has come to my attention that at a whips meeting on the Senate side last evening the edict was given that no committee will be given permission to meet during the sitting of the Senate whilst they deliberate on the clean energy bills.

To tie the debate on the clean energy bills to all of the sittings of joint committees of this parliament—those that occur at the same time as sittings of the Senate—would take a wrecking ball to the timetable.

We have 30 officials from Australia in place assisting our friends in New Zealand. Unfortunately, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and Australia's support staff gained some expertise with the Pacific Adventurer and Shen Neng 1 incidents.


I have been invited to go to New Zealand this weekend by the New Zealand government and I intend to have discussions with them. I have indicated on behalf of the Australian government—and I am sure it is something that is supported by both sides of the House—that any assistance that Australia can give to our friends in New Zealand in what is already its worst ever maritime disaster will be made available. Whilst we might be opponents at Eden Park on Sunday night, we are certainly good friends and always there to assist each other.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (15:32):  Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I am pleased that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and Australian officers are in New Zealand assisting with the maritime disaster that New Zealand is endeavouring to deal with. I made some comments about this issue in the Main Committee in debate on a bill earlier this week. This is the kind of situation where friends need to be able to help one another. This is already regarded as the most serious maritime environmental disaster in New Zealand's history and it sadly has the potential to get significantly worse. Some of the television pictures we have seen of the angles of some on the containers on board the vessel and of oil already on the beaches demonstrate that this has the capacity to become a marine disaster of substantial proportions. 


Australia has had experience in this field, unfortunately. An incident not dissimilar in some ways occurred near Cape Moreton not very long ago. A large number of containers went overboard from a vessel there, which damaged the ship and led to oil leaks along the beaches of the Sunshine Coast. As a representative of that area, I was very conscious of the fact that this was a blot on the local communities and that it was most unwelcome in the holiday time. New Zealand is the centre of the world's attention at the present time. For that reason, as well as for our desire to be good neighbours, it is appropriate that Australian officials are there. I wish them well and hope they will be kept safe during what is potentially a very dangerous and difficult operation.

Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (15:38):  Yesterday was a day on which the government of Australia betrayed the families of this country, and this week is a week in which the government of this country has severed the bonds of trust between it and the families of Australia. Indeed, this session of parliament is a session in which Australians have finally had revealed to them what a cowardly and dishonest government they have here in Canberra. Yesterday, this Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, at the behest of the Greens, revealed that she is more interested in her job as Prime Minister of Australia than in the jobs of ordinary Australians. Yesterday, it was revealed to everybody in this country that we have a government that is so out of touch that it came in here and applauded and congratulated itself for a measure that will increase the cost of living for every Australian, will bite and hit every business in this country and will destroy jobs for so many people right around this nation.


There are three enduring images of this government that history will mark. The first was of a Prime Minister who went on television a few days before the last election and said, as we all know—



Opposition members:  'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'




Mr ANDREWS:
  'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' That is the first enduring image of this Prime Minister. The second one is of course the political marriage of convenience that we saw consummated in the signing ceremony and the smiling photograph of the Prime Minister, Senator Bob Brown and the other Greens after the election, after she did a deal, becoming beholden to the Greens, in order to retain the keys to the Lodge. That is the second enduring image of this government. The third image was of course played out yesterday: the arrogance and hubris of this government when those on that side stood up and applauded themselves and kissed each other and patted each other on the back for implementing a measure which is going to hit the livelihood of every person in this country.


What we have seen this week is 72 members of this minority government betray Australian families, and I tell you what: we will remind the constituents of each of those 72 members from this day until whenever the next election is called that those members betrayed the interests of ordinary Australian families simply in order to preserve their own interests and preserve their positions on the treasury benches in this chamber, remaining beholden to Bob Brown and the Greens in this place. Then, to add insult to injury, we had that clapping and cheering carry-on from them yesterday—even the Judas kiss from the foreign minister to the Prime Minister. I will wait and see how that plays out in coming days!




Mr Simpkins:
  Were there 30 pieces of silver?




Mr ANDREWS:
  I am not sure whether or not there were 30 pieces of silver, but it certainly brought up images of another occasion on which a famous kiss was given.


We know that the Greens are not interested in ordinary Australian families. If you look at the whole range of measures that they put up to this parliament, you can see they are contrary, they are antithetical, to the interests of Australian families. Protecting the environment comes before protecting Australian families, as far as the Greens are concerned. The tragedy for Australians is that we have these measures because we have a minority government which is totally beholden to Bob Brown and the rest of the Greens. Was this something that was being proposed by the government prior to the last election?



Opposition members:  No!




Mr ANDREWS:
  No. It was ruled out. Then, after the election, in order to retain government, the Prime Minister signed up to this deal with Senator Bob Brown.


This carbon tax is going to hurt Australian families; there is no doubt about that. I would just like to take the chamber through some instances of real people in this country who are going to be hurt by this measure. Now, these are not my constructions; I did not create these scenarios. These are taken from the government's own material. This is what the government is saying about the effect and impact of this particular tax. These are real people, like Melbourne couple Kirsten and Julian Finger. Kirsten is a qualified paramedic and Julian is a registered nurse. They have one child who is under four years of age and they are expecting a second child. They are a pretty typical Australian family, with two people in the workforce and two kids—one under four, one on the way. We are talking about ordinary Australian families that could be in any of our electorates right around this country. And what is the impact on them? They will be approximately $200 a year worse off under the government's carbon tax, based on the government's own online carbon tax estimator. If we go to the online estimator which the government has put up on the web and put in these figures, what do we find? After all the compensation that the government talks about, this ordinary, typical Australian couple are going to be $200 a year worse off.


Let me take another example, that of a police sergeant earning $80,000 a year, married to a clinic nurse earning about $80,000 a year, with two children, one five and the other six years of age—again, what I would call a relatively typical Australian family: two parents, two incomes and two kids, who in this case are in primary school. They will face a cost-of-living impact of $859 a year but receive compensation of only $31. That is $859 worth of additional costs offset by what? A measly $31. The family will be $828 worse off because of this government's tax. Let me take a third example, that of a storeman earning $38,500 a year who is married to a part-time retail assistant earning $16,500 a year and this couple has no children. The storeman's wage is not huge by any stretch of the imagination and nor is that of the part-time retail assistant by the measure of incomes in Australia; a lot of Australians are in this situation but they are hardly wealthy. This couple will have a cost-of-living increase of $440 a year, according to the government's own calculations. What compensation will they receive? They will get just $303 in compensation. Again, this is a relatively low-income working couple who are going to be $137 a year worse off under this government's carbon tax.


Yet we have the Prime Minister day after day when asked about the impact on these sorts of Australian families just laughing it off—giggling it off is perhaps a better description. She says: 'Don't worry about that; people are going to be better off.' The reality is in the government's own calculations. Do not trust my word for it; go to the website this government has put in place and do the calculations. You will find that, in situations like these, people are going to be worse off.


Take the situation of a single mother with two children aged three and 12 and who is working as a nurse earning about $80,000 a year. She will face a cost-of-living increase of $514 a year and yet the compensation she will receive is only $445 a year. She is going to be $69 a year worse off under the carbon tax. We have the government pretending all Australians are somehow going to be better off because of these changes. The reality is, as these examples illustrate, tens of thousands of Australians are going to be worse off because of this taxation proposals. 


Let us consider an electrician earning $75,000 a year who is married to a stay-at-home mum and they have one child under five years of age. Again, this is a typical family constellation in Australia. They will face an increase of $491 a year, but they will only get compensation of $409 a year. This family with one person in the workforce and mum at home with a kid is going to be $82 worse off as a result of these proposals.


It is not just families who are affected. Consider an occupational therapist earning $80,000 a year who is single and without children. This person will face a cost-of-living increase of $441 a year, but receive just $16 by way of compensation.




Mr Robert:
  That's an insult.




Mr ANDREWS:
  That's right, an insult. That person will be $425 a year worse off as a result of this government's great big new carbon tax. We know that 52 per cent of households in Western Australia, for example, will be worse off under this carbon tax.


This is coming at the worst time of all so far as Australian families are concerned. We know that no other country in the world is doing this. We are racing ahead of the rest of the world to the great competitive disadvantage of Australia. It is coming at a time when Australians are already facing increased cost-of-living pressures so far as their lifestyles are concerned. From the December quarter of 2007, when the Labor Party was elected to government in Australia, until the March quarter of this year—so measuring their term in office—what has happened so far as the cost of living is concerned? Electricity prices have gone up by a whopping 51 per cent on average across Australia. Gas prices have increased by an average 30 per cent. Water and sewerage rates have increased by an average 46 per cent. Health costs—that is, things like hospital, optical, dental, pharmaceutical costs—have gone up by an average 20 per cent across Australia. Education costs, school fees and other incidentals related to education and schooling, have increased on average by 24 per cent since 2007.


Interest rates have increased seven times since September 2009, increasing repayments on the average mortgage by over $500 a month in a little under 18 months. On top of these, we know that the costs of all sorts of other things have gone up. The price of bread—one of the staples of life for any family or any individual, for that matter—is up by 11 per cent. The cost of food overall is up by 13 per cent. The cost of fruit has gone up by 28 per cent. The amount of rent that people are now paying has increased by 20 per cent.


I cannot think of a worse time to introduce a carbon tax in terms of the impact that it is going to have on the cost of living of Australians and their job prospects and the job prospects of their children. That is the great tragedy of it. We have an out-of-touch government hell-bent on simply continuing the deal it has done with Bob Brown and the Greens. That is going to lead to ruination of not just this country but the standards of living of so many Australian families.


Let me remind you what a carbon tax means. It means a $9 billion a year tax. It means a 10 per cent hike in electricity prices in the first year alone. It means a nine per cent increase in gas bills in the first year alone. You will see higher marginal tax rates for many low- and middle-income earners. Of course, there is a $4.3 billion hit on the budget bottom line which will see every Australian slugged over $40,000 over the coming decades. That is the equivalent of a whole year's work for many Australians who are going to be paying year after year after year for Labor's broken promise. On top of that we have a $515 a year hit on the cost of living and that is just for starters under this great big new tax which is being introduced by the Labor Party.


What we have is a Prime Minister who has lost the trust of the families of Australia. There is one thing that a government cannot lose. It can lose all sorts of things and it can be unpopular for a time, but when the bond of trust between the people of the nation and the Prime Minister, in particular, and the government is destroyed then it will not be regained. That is why people have given up listening to this Prime Minister. That is why when you go around the electorates of this nation, people explain their great frustration about what is going on in this place at the present time. Promising commitments with no intention of honouring them is the greatest measure of all of distrust and that is what we have seen from this Prime Minister. Of course, now we have the foreign minister stalking, the backbench in disarray, the government in denial and this leaves the country without any real leadership for the future at a time when we need it.


At a time when the cost of living is increasing significantly in Australia, when the international financial situation is in crisis, when Australians are concerned about their job security—for example, we have seen 54,000 jobs lost in manufacturing alone in the last year, and we know that nine out of 10 workers in the manufacturing industry are not going to be in businesses that get one cent of compensation—so far as this tax is concerned we have a complete lack of direction from this government. We have a Prime Minister who is no longer focused on the concerns of Australian families. She is focused simply on her survival and whether or not the faceless men will do what they did to her predecessor and remove her at sometime in the future. What we have is a disjointed, dysfunctional disarray that pretends to be a government in Australia—they should do the decent and honourable thing and call an election.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Social Inclusion and Minister for Human Services) (15:53):  I reckon most people listening today would be amazed by the hypocrisy and the irony of the shadow minister for families, housing and human services talking about jobs and job security. From someone who is out there carrying the spear for a reintroduction of Work Choices—and we all know what that meant for Australian families, their pay, their conditions and their job security—to be in here talking about jobs is the height of hypocrisy.


He talked about a typical Australian family on $160,000 a year. It might be typical of the people he is hanging around with but it is not typical of the two out of three households who will benefit at least to the amount that their prices are expected to go up under these changes or the nine out of 10 households who will receive some assistance because of the measures we passed yesterday. Typical, according to the shadow minister opposite is a family on $160,000 a year—how incredibly out of touch the shadow minister is.


The shadow minister talks about the jobs of Australian families at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition yesterday was encouraging his members to vote against the jobs of steelworkers right around Australia. The Leader of the Opposition, who was in here crying crocodile tears about the steelworkers of Whyalla and Whyalla being wiped off the map of Australia, was in here yesterday voting against the jobs of steelworkers around Australia. When the shadow minister talks about going out and reminding constituents about what happened in here yesterday I hope he goes out and reminds the people of Australia that the opposition yesterday voted against a clean energy future for this country. I hope that he goes out and reminds the constituents in his electorate and electorates all around Australia that yesterday the opposition in here voted against pension increases. I hope that he goes out and reminds people right around Australia that yesterday the opposition voted against tax cuts for ordinary working families. I hope that he goes out and reminds people all around Australia that yesterday the opposition voted against increases in family benefits. I hope that he goes out and reminds people all around Australia that yesterday the opposition voted against protecting our environment, our beautiful natural environment—Kakadu, the Great Barrier Reef—




Mr Christensen:
  What's a tax going to do for it?




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  the beautiful alpine areas of Victoria. You do not care about the Great Barrier Reef. Think about the jobs in your electorate that depend on the Great Barrier Reef—billions of dollars worth of tourism put at risk because of your vandalism in here yesterday.



Mr Christensen interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  The honourable member for Dawson will show a modicum of restraint.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  To be in here talking about the family budget and jobs when we saw yesterday the vandals opposite voting against jobs and voting against the family budget strikes me as the height of hypocrisy. They are talking about who is going to be worse off and the family budget under pressure. What is their plan?




Mr Stephen Jones:
  They don't have one.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  There is a bit of a plan. They also say that they want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am not sure why because half of them say—



Mr Tudge interjecting—




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  You do not want to? Are you saying that it is not your policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? There you go talking about policy on the run—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The minister will address her remarks through the chair.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  and we heard it here first. It is no longer opposition policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by five per cent. It is no longer their policy. Let's talk about what used to be their policy until you heard this announcement first today in the House of Representatives. It used to be opposition policy until about a minute ago that they would also meet the targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. How are they going to do it? They are going to do it through the tax system. They say that they are going to do it by direct investment, by picking winners. They are going to go out to industry, they are going to pick winners and they are going to pour billions of dollars of taxpayers' money into picking those winners. They cannot tell us how much it is going to cost to reach the five per cent reduction target. But you know what? We have done the numbers. We know those across the chamber cannot actually add up but we have done the numbers of how much is actually going to cost them to meet their five per cent reduction target and guess what? It will cost every household in Australia $1,300.


We had a few cameos from the shadow minister opposite and I actually wanted to share a cameo of my own with colleagues. We have a typical middle-income family—I actually do not think that $160,000 a year is a typical family income so here is a family income that I think is a little more typical—mum, dad and three children aged four, seven and nine. Dad is earning $52½ thousand a year, mum is working part time earning $17½ thousand a year which gives a total of $75,000 a year family income. They will get $332 extra in government payments and a $982 tax cut. They will receive around $1,300 in carbon price assistance under our plan. The same family will pay $1,300 to the big polluters under the opposition's plan. So this family, even after any impact of carbon pricing on their cost of living, will be more than $700 a year better off. With that $700 they could invest in more energy efficient appliances—maybe replace their heater or the hot water system—and bring their electricity costs down some more.


There is something that I want to share with you about electricity prices. The shadow minister talks about the price of electricity going up—and it is quite shocking how much the price of electricity has been going up in some of the states and territories. The carbon pricing legislation has not been introduced yet. Could it be that the state and territory governments are not running their electricity systems as well as they should be and that those price effects are affecting ordinary working Australians? Could it be that this is not a pre-emptive price increase related to the carbon tax?


I think that it is important to put on the public record the fact that our economy and jobs will continue to grow strongly under these clean energy bills. We estimate 1.6 million more jobs will be created by 2020. Treasury modelling shows that average incomes will continue to rise and they will be around $9,000 higher in 2020 and around $30,000 higher in 2050. Would you ever hear that from the opposition? No; they are in the business of going around and scaring the daylights out of people.


It is also worth having a look, I think, at the average price impact on an ordinary family. Independent Treasury modelling shows that pricing carbon pollution is expected to have a 0.7 per cent impact on the price of living. That is less than 1c for every dollar spent—not even 1c for every dollar spent. The shadow minister was here when the Howard government introduced a GST. What impact did the GST have on the price of living? The GST had a 2½ per cent impact on the price of living—more than three times the impact that pricing carbon is likely to have.


So when this 0.7 per cent impact happens after 1 July—which, mind you, is after the time that people have received their lump sums to help with the price impact—what will the price of Weet-Bix increase by? It will increase by 0.00024c per Weet-Bix. An $11 packet of mince will rise by 4c. A $3.75 fillet of ocean trout will increase by 1½c. The shadow minister was banging on about the price of a loaf of bread. Let us look at how much a loaf of bread will increase. I was going to say 'rise' but that would have been a bad joke, wouldn't it?




Mr McCormack:
  Sounds pretty crumby to me.




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  Thank you—it sounds crumby. The cost of a loaf of bread will rise 0.016c—less than one cent. Tim Tams will increase—



Government members interjecting—




Ms PLIBERSEK:
  I know some of my colleagues are very interested in this one. Tim Tams will increase by 0.012c per Tim Tam. So I think the colleagues are still going to be able to afford their Tim Tams.


I now need to turn to the impact that some of the opposition's previous policies had on ordinary working families, because this is a very serious matter. Those opposite have been crying crocodile tears—when every single day they were in government they were screwing down the wages and conditions of ordinary working families, taking money out of health care and undermining our public education system. The hypocrisy of that! Studies show that casual and part-time sales assistants lost an average of 12 per cent of earnings under Work Choices. AWAs were especially bad for women, with women working full time on AWAs taking home $87.40 per week less than workers on collective agreements. In 64 per cent of AWAs, annual leave loadings were cut; in 63 per cent, penalty rates were cut; in 52 per cent, shift work loadings were cut; in 51 per cent, overtime loadings were cut; and in 46 per cent, public holiday pay was cut. The hypocrisy of those opposite talking about how they feel about ordinary working families when everything they did in here was against their interests is astonishing.


And I remind people of their opposition now. They are opposed to pension increases that come out of the clean energy bills. They are opposed to family benefit increases coming out of these bills. They are opposed to investment in steel jobs, coal jobs and industry jobs that come out of these bills.


But, at the same time, what are they supporting? They are supporting the big mining companies against the mining communities that will benefit, against the workers who will get an increase in their superannuation and against the small businesses that will see their taxes cut because of the minerals resource rent tax. Who are they supporting when it comes to poker machines? They are supporting the big gambling interests against ordinary working families. Who are they supporting when it comes to tobacco advertising? They are supporting big, wealthy, multinational tobacco companies against the 15,000 Australians who die of smoking related illnesses every year. Do you know that the cigarette companies kill more people in Australia than they employ here every year? Guess whose side the opposition are on on that one! Every single time they are for the interests of the big guy against the little guy. What we saw yesterday continues their opposition to a clean environment and continues their opposition to investing in our clean energy future. And what will happen if they get in and reverse—as they say they will—these tax cuts? They will reverse the pension increases; they will reverse the industry assistance. They will put a million people back into the tax system who have had their tax-free threshold tripled. They will drop their tax-free threshold. We know they will not do that. We know that they will never have the courage to do what they claim they are going to do, and reverse this carbon tax. That is a good thing, because we need this clean energy future. (Time expired)

Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP
 (Mackellar) (16:08):  I think the title of the minister opposite who gave that atrocious speech is 'minister for inclusion'. She began by abusing families who are in certain sections of the community, saying that they were not considered because of her perception—and if I counted together her salary and that of her husband's I think she would be so way outside of an average family I do not think she would know what one is. But the point that I want to make here and now is that yesterday we voted against a carbon tax which was placed upon the Australian people and will penalise families.




Mr STEPHEN JONES:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on an objectionable comment by the member for Mackellar. It is the practice in this place that we do not bring ministers' or any other members' partners into the public debate. I ask that it be withdrawn.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. Peter Slipper
):  I advise the honourable member that there is no point of order. I was not aware that there was actually a disparaging comment made with respect to the minister's husband.



Ms Plibersek interjecting—



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Mackellar will remain silent. There is no point of order. I call the honourable member for Mackellar.




Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP:
  Yesterday we voted against a big, harsh, punitive, toxic tax which will implicate and impact on every family in this country. Unlike the goods and services tax, which the government likes to compare their carbon tax to, we took that tax to an election and asked the people for a mandate to implement it.


Before the election, the Prime Minister, who runs away from every censure motion like a coward, in fact said that there would be no carbon tax by any government she would lead. Six weeks after being elected, she announced we would have a carbon tax—not because she was intending to take it to the Australian people as we did with the goods and services tax, but because she had stitched up a deal where the Greens were very much part of her decision to implement this tax. She will hang onto power at any cost to the Australian people.


We have said that we will abolish that tax—and we will. The carbon tax is for the Labor Party what Work Choices was for us. The Labor Party said they would abolish Work Choices, and they did. We have said we will abolish their carbon tax, and we will. The important point to make is this: the carbon tax has no exemptions. It is a cascading and compounding tax which gets into the nook and cranny of every aspect of everybody's life.


The fact of the matter is that unlike the GST, which is a value added tax whereby with the tax that is paid on transactions between the creation of a good or service and its final consumption there is a refund of the tax paid. This carbon tax will have the tax paid at every transaction and it will be a tax paid on a tax paid on a tax paid on a tax. It compounds and it is cascading.


It will affect everybody every time they turn on a light switch, turn on air conditioning, buy ice cream at the supermarket, use the sewerage system, use the water system or get on a train. It will impact on every form of public transport. It is said that there is no carbon tax on petrol for the family car, but the tax will be the electricity that is used to run that petrol station. It is a tax on electricity because it is an artificial hike in the price in the energy source which produces electricity in this country for 90 per cent of our needs.


Coal fired power stations are the cheapest way of producing electricity. The market says so. The market has said this is the price. That is why so many other countries around the world want to buy our coal. It is because they too want to have cheap electricity. What this tax does is put an artificial domestic tariff on the cost of coal to force up its price to attempt to make other forms of energy sourcing competitive.


To call it a market based mechanism is to distort the language beyond belief, but the facts that we are seeing are that the government says that by its tax it will injure the Australian people; it will injure Australian families. It will particularly injure senior Australians because they are on fixed incomes, where the latitude for disposable income shrinks every time the cost of the essentials rises. Electricity, gas and food are all part of those essential costs.


The government, in its printed documentation, says that it will injure families to the tune of $9.90 a week. That is what their modelling shows. And then they come in with some other modelling and say, 'We will compensate you for the injury we cause you $10.10 a week.' Twenty cents is what this government, who cannot even get its projections on a budget accurate, says it can model down to for compensation to make you so-called 'better off'.


And that is on a price of $23 a tonne, but in fact it will rise to $29 a tonne and $36 a tonne. Ultimately it will go to $350 a tonne in 2050. It will require $3.5 billion to be spent overseas buying abatement certificates. That is $3.5 billion every year that will not be available in this country for manufacturing, retail or the jobs that Australians can normally expect would be created. By the time we get to 2050 it will be $57 billion annually. This is money that belongs in this country for our people. It is our obligation under our constitution to give the Australian people peace, welfare and good government. That is our responsibility—not to penalise people because the government of the day thinks that it somehow can create a tax which it says will then keep it in power.


If we look at how people are going to be affected, you heard my colleague the member for Menzies outline in his address examples—cameos—of families and how they will be impacted. They were not high fliers like the Minister for Social Inclusion. These were ordinary folks. She scoffed at them because they were a family who worked hard and could earn up to $160,000 a year. That is somehow outrageous, according to her. It could be a nurse and a policeman. It could be a teacher married to another teacher. It is ordinary families who are scoffed at as not counting by the minister for so-called 'inclusion'. If we are to be truly concerned about inclusion, which is where we come from, then everybody in our community is to be considered valuable and part of our community. Every opportunity should have the right and the opportunity to aspire to a better life, and it is our obligation to set the scene whereby through their hard work and their effort they can maximise the result of their hard work and their effort. It is not to be scoffed at by the minister for inclusion. I think she would probably be more aptly named the minister for exclusion.


But let us go back to what we did yesterday. On the vote on the second reading of the tax bills it was 74 to 73. When we went to the final vote we were missing one vote on our side because we had had somebody suspended for one day. But the fact of the matter is that, of the people who were elected in this chamber, all but the Green went to the last election saying there would be no carbon tax. The only way we can have any honesty in this place is for the government of the day to take this to an election and let the people speak. When the people came into this chamber yesterday, they were the people who the Leader of the House called 'the people of no consequence'. They were the people who came and showed their willingness to stand up for what they believe in. Let's have an election. (Time expired)

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (16:32):  As the House adjourns today, and as members from the government file out to the caucus to determine where they may now go in terms of their failed border protection policy that they did not have the courage to bring into this House today, I think we all reflect on the absolute mess that the government have created of asylum policy and border protection policy in this country. As they file away to their government room to sit there and work out where to go next, the question that they have always had before them is: where could they ever go at all?


This is the government that just over a year ago ditched its former Prime Minister and put in a new Prime Minister who said boldly that Labor had 'lost its way'. What we have seen in this place today is that not only has Labor not found its way but it has lost its compass and has no hope of finding its way at all. This is incredibly disturbing because this is a very significant issue. This is an issue that this Prime Minister staked her prime ministership upon. And after failure and failure and failure, this Prime Minister now scurries out of this House for the second time on a Thursday afternoon when the Migration Act amendments were to be considered in this place.


Last time we were in this place on a Thursday a few weeks ago, the same thing happened: the government had the opportunity to have a vote and they scurried away. On this occasion they have the same opportunity and they have scurried away. They have collapsed their tent because their policy has collapsed and now they sit huddled under a blanket in the government party room just looking at each other and going: 'What next?' And if it is anything like what has gone before, the Australian people can be very concerned because what has gone before has been an abysmal failure. It has been cost, it has been chaos and it has been tragedy under this government's failed border protection policies.


The Prime Minister wanted to take the name of every single member who sits in this House and record how they voted on the Migration Act amendments. No names will be recorded today. All the names are there to be recorded on this matter. All said they wanted to have their names recorded. They are all huddled in the government party room, just sitting around looking at one another saying, 'How did we get here?' I will tell you how they got here, Mr Speaker. They got here because when this government was elected around four years ago it was egged on to abolish the proven and successful policies of the Howard government. That is what happened. They were egged on to do that and they thought they had got themselves into a position where they could right the wrongs of the Howard government's policies. In so doing they have brought on more than their worst nightmare.


I think it is important that we understand in this place that, as culpable as the current Prime Minister is—who just over a year ago took on the mantle of solving this problem and has only made it worse—we must acknowledge that it was the former Prime Minister that set this whole ball rolling. That was a Prime Minister who likes to parade himself around this place and all around the country, trailing his coat in defiance of his own leader, as the new Lazarus of Australian politics. He is no new Lazarus of Australian politics; he is the Freddy Krueger of Australian politics. And if he returns to the prime ministership the nightmare will continue with the Freddy Krueger of Australian politics, who is the former Prime Minister—a nightmare that just rolled into another nightmare when the current Prime Minister took over the reins and was unable to get to a position of remedying any of the ills of the former Prime Minister. So it does not matter who is in charge of Labor. It does not matter how often you shuffle the Labor deck, you always pull out a Joker.


We on this side of the House are ready to vote on the Migration Act amendment bill. We are ready to have our names recorded for good policy, not bad policy; for proven policy, not failed policy. We are here to have our names recorded to ensure that the protections that existed in the Migration Act are preserved and the offshore processing that we successfully put in place as a government can be done again. We know that we will be able to do that regardless of what happens with this bill.


The government today sit in shambles, huddled together in their government party room, hiding from this chamber, hiding from the Australian people. Yesterday they were in a fit of self-congratulation. Today they are in a fit of despair because they have not only lost their way, they will never find it. (Time expired)

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (09:30):  This year the Australian Red Cross has launched its campaign to raise awareness of the horrific humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons. It is a campaign of great consequence, as we all know of the absolute destruction these weapons can cause. One of the most iconic images from history is undoubtedly the ruined Hiroshima peace dome standing alone amid the destruction of the city.


The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement have been at the heart of the issue of nuclear weapons from the outset of the debate. By continuing to raise their grave concerns, and through their role in developing international humanitarian law, the movement contributed to the creation of additional protocols to the Geneva conventions in 1977. These protocols strengthen the distinction between civilians and combatants and reaffirm a commitment to no unnecessary harm being caused to civilians during times of war. Of course the destruction caused by nuclear weapons means that they fail to meet this principle.


There is a growing global interest in nuclear disarmament, with the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom reaffirming their 'responsibility to take concrete and credible steps toward irreversible disarmament' at a United Nations conference on nuclear weapons in May last year. This is positive, and the International Committee of the Red Cross and other bodies associated with disarmament should be commended for their work in both helping to ensure increasing interest as well as capitalising on the commitment from the P5 of the United Nations Security Council.


Our world does not want to contemplate nuclear war. It must have faith that diplomacy can overcome such a threat, as it did during the Cuban missile crisis. Our leaders must focus on the devastating humanitarian costs, as the Red Cross does, and remember that a nuclear weapon does not discriminate. Its path of destruction includes civilians, hospitals, doctors, land for farming, food and water. A nuclear bomb not only wipes out a city; it also wipes out so much more. As the Vice-President of the ICRC, Christine Beerli, noted;


... the debate about nuclear weapons must be conducted not only on the basis of military doctrines and power politics but also on the basis of public health and human security.


Nuclear weapons are unique in their destructive power, in the unspeakable human suffering they cause, in the impossibility of controlling their effects in space and time, in the risks of escalation they create, and in the threat they pose to the environment, to future generations, and indeed to the survival of humanity. 


These are compelling words. We cannot have this debate without considering the humanitarian costs, but neither can we ignore the world in which we live—the instability, uncertainty and threats which lie within our anarchistic international system. Should a nuclear weapon fall into the hands of a terrorist organisation willing to use it, the consequences would be devastating. That is why the reaffirmation of the P5 last year was important and why I commend the International Committee of the Red Cross for continuing its cause. The sentiment among nations is against the threat or use of nuclear weaponry, and this has been increasing for some time. From the International Court of Justice decision in 1994, which said:


There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control


to the five-point plan on nuclear disarmament submitted to the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2007, we see the recognition and abhorrence of nuclear war. I commend the ICRC and other bodies associated with this cause and I too hope to see nuclear weapons become part of our past, not of our future. (Time expired)

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (10:02):  The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 7) Bill has nine schedules within it. As is always the case, they relate to a variety of changes to the taxation law. I can say at the outset on behalf of the opposition that we are not opposing this bill. I will very briefly run through each of those nine schedules and the changes that they will effect to the taxation law after the bill receives Royal Assent. The Assistant Treasurer on 21 September introduced this bill into the House. He outlined in great detail each of those schedules and the effect they will have. I will in brief summary give the coalition's perspective on each of them. As I said at the outset, we will be supporting this tax laws amendment bill.


Schedule 1 effects some tax changes with respect to special disability trusts. Essentially it provides some more favourable treatment by removing income tax barriers, particularly with respect to capital gains tax. The Assistant Treasurer outlined this in great detail just a few weeks ago, but the special disability trusts which were established in 2006 enable immediate family members and carers who have the financial means to do so to make private provision for the current and future care and accommodation needs of a family member with a severe disability. This schedule removes some of those capital gains tax barriers that might exist for those families. We welcome those changes. Schedule 2 relates to specific seasonal workers. The tax change that is being effected in this schedule is to change the lowest marginal tax rate for participants in the scheme from 29 per cent to 15 per cent.


Schedule 3 relates to TOFA, the Taxation of Financial Arrangements. There have been many tax law amendment bills that have dealt with these highly technical issues. You will probably be pleased to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this morning I will not reiterate every single aspect of the TOFA reforms that have occurred over many years but will just comment very briefly on schedule 3. This schedule makes some changes to the pay-as-you-go instalments and also some technical amendments with respect to them.


Schedule 4 of this bill gives the Commissioner of Taxation some discretion that will enable the extension of time for notifying transitional elections in financial arrangements. Essentially, this will provide the Commissioner of Taxation with the discretion to extend by up to three months the time in which a taxpayer may notify the commissioner of a transitional election under division 230 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 197—the TOFA provisions.


Schedule 5 relates to farm management deposits in a couple of respects, and they are positive changes. They will allow farmers affected by a natural disaster to withdraw deposits within 12 months with no tax penalty. Also, they will make provision for more information. They are positive changes to remove some unintended barriers, as I would see them.


Schedule 6 relates to superannuation. It extends temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds. As the Assistant Treasurer outlined in the House on 21 September, it will extend the end date for temporary loss relief for funds that are merging by three months from June of this year until September of this year.


Schedule 7 relates to penalty notices. It is essentially an integrity measure that will preserve the validity of penalty notices that the Commissioner of Taxation has issued. It needs to do this as a result of a recent case in the New South Wales Court of Appeal. Some 17,000 penalty notices would be in doubt without this amendment. So without it there would be a risk of litigation, and obviously revenue implications as well. This schedule seeks to rectify the intention of the law.


Schedule 8, the second last schedule, relates to public ancillary funds. It essentially makes some changes that I believe were announced by the government in last year's budget. It will rename trust funds that qualify for deductible gift status. It will give the Treasurer some powers to make guidelines and a range of other administrative changes.


Schedule 9, the last schedule, relates to film tax offsets in each respect. It will provide for more generous treatment for the producer offset, including by amending the qualifying expenditure threshold—on my reading, reducing it to $500,000—and a range of other changes. I make the point on behalf of the opposition that these changes are very similar to the arts policy commitments made by our shadow minister, Senator George Brandis, at the last election, and we offer our support for this schedule.


As I said at the outset, I on behalf of the coalition support this tax law amendment bill and each of the schedules within it. We commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:10):  In December 2009 the then head of Treasury provided to the Treasurer a copy of what is colloquially known as the Henry tax review and formally known as Australia's Future Tax System report, a comprehensive review of our tax system and its sustainability into the future. At page 11 of that report the review committee made this observation:


Australia has too many taxes and too many complicated ways of delivering multiple policy objectives through the tax system. The capacity of the legislative and operating platforms of these systems and their human users to deal with the resulting complexity has been overreached. To a large extent, this is a reflection of a compartmentalised and incremental approach to tax policy that has been weighted towards achieving finely calibrated equity and efficiency outcomes at the expense of simplicity.


It is observations such as this which have driven the Gillard Labor government to ensure tax reform is at the top of its economic reform agenda. It is what underscored the desire to hold a summit in Canberra last week, in which we brought some of the leading thinkers in the area of economic and tax reform to Canberra to discuss what we needed to do over the next decade to reform the tax system to ensure it was fit for use for the remainder of the century.


I observed in a debate yesterday that taxation has a number of objectives, including raising revenue and regulating behaviour in the public interest. We have had both of these things in mind as we have set about the task of reforming the Australian tax system to ensure it is fairer and more equitable and that we will have revenue streams to provide the essential government services that Australians expect now and into the future. We understand—and I think there is bipartisan understanding of this fact—that by the time my children, who are now very young, enter the workforce the ratio of people of working age in the workforce to those who are outside the workforce and not of working age will move from 1:5 to 1:2.7. This will place an increasing burden on those who are in the workforce and those who are paying tax to deliver the services that Australians expect. So it is incumbent on all sides of politics to ensure that we are spreading the taxation base, that it is administered in the most effective way, that it drives and incentivises the right sort of behaviour and that it creates the revenue needed to deliver much-needed services.


The amendments put forward by this bill are in part driven by those objectives. Schedule 1 to the bill is important. This morning many of us from all parties attended in this place a parliamentary breakfast for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. At the breakfast we heard from carers and people living with disabilities about the importance of government doing everything in its power to ensure that we are providing financial sustenance and other service arrangements to meet the growing needs of people in that position. Schedule 1 is not the whole game but it does some work in this area. It extends the capital gains tax main resident exemptions to special disability trusts. Removing these barriers makes it more attractive for families to provide for the long-term care of a family member through the trust system to enable them to make financial arrangements for loved ones, for a family member who has a severe disability. I commend this particular schedule to the House. Schedule 2 of the bill reduces the lowest marginal tax rate that applies to non-resident workers employed under the government's Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme. It reduces this from 29 per cent to 15 per cent. Not only is this of benefit to those working under the government's Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme but it also provides an indirect benefit to the agricultural sector, that has been crying out for many years for arrangements and assistance from the government to provide much-needed workers during the picking seasons—the peak work seasons. It provides an indirect benefit to employers at the same time as providing a direct tax benefit for those in our near region who wish to come to Australia and work under the scheme, so everyone benefits from this.


Schedule 3 amends the pay-as-you-go instalment provisions to ensure that the concept of instalment income interacts appropriately with the concepts of gain and loss in the taxation and financial arrangements provisions. In essence, the amendments ensure that the interaction does not impose a significant administrative or compliance cost whilst maintaining the objective of ensuring that the pay-as-you-go instalment provisions are made.


Schedule 5 amends the tax law and the Banking Act 1959 to make four changes to the farm management deposits, or FMD, scheme. Essentially these amendments are to the benefit of our farming community to ensure that there is more flexibility at their disposal in the case of natural disasters to access their farm management deposits within 12 months of making a deposit while still retaining concessional tax treatment for those arrangements. Again, this is an important arrangement for the benefit of our farming community.


Schedule 6 is concerned with the superannuation and taxation arrangements for superannuation schemes that are in the process of merging. This fulfils a number of objectives. It is a policy objective of this government to ensure that our superannuation schemes are of a sufficient scale and size to enable them to gain the benefits of scale and have access to a capital base that will enable them to make the right sorts of investments at the right cost and be involved in the right deals to provide a profit to the fund and a benefit to the members. The specific provision here will provide additional time for those funds when they do merge to take the benefits of loss relief. It extends that by three months. The fund is the immediate beneficiary, but obviously the account holders, the superannuation beneficiaries, are the indirect and ultimate beneficiaries of this schedule.


Schedule 7 is essentially a remedial provision that addresses the consequences of a recent court of appeal decision. In essence, it ensures that if directors, when they receive notices advising directors, do not cause their company to take certain actions with respect to debt then they will become personally liable. As I said, this is a remedial provision which clarifies the law as a consequence of a recent court of appeal decision.


Schedule 8 is the fulfilment of the Gillard government's 2010 budget commitment to provide a regulatory framework to improve the integrity of public ancillary funds similar to that which has applied to private ancillary funds since October 2009. This framework will provide the trustees of such funds with greater certainty as to their philanthropic obligations. Schedule 9 is aimed at ensuring that we are providing greater incentives to our domestic film industry. It goes to changes to the film tax offsets, and these changes affect producer offsets and the location and post-digital and visual effects offsets. They will apply from 1 July 2011 and are estimated to increase expenditure on the film tax offsets by around $8 million over the forward estimates—that is a tax expenditure, of course. These amendments to the film tax offsets are aimed at reforming and strengthening the Australian film production industry, something that I know is very dear to the hearts of all members in this place.


The schedules in this bill are an important part of the government's taxation reform agenda. The reform agenda does not end with this bill; it is far-reaching to ensure that we have a sustainable and equitable taxation system which creates the right sorts of incentives for economic activity, is administratively efficient and generates the revenue necessary now and into the future to ensure that the Australian government, whoever occupies the Treasury bench, has the revenue necessary to deliver the services that all Australians expect. I commend this bill to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-10-13,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:21):  I would like to take up two points that the member for Throsby raised. Firstly, like him, I attended the national disability insurance breakfast this morning, where we heard a most gracious speech, I have to say, by the Prime Minister in relation to the Every Australian Counts campaign. This has bipartisan support and needs to be brought forward sooner than the seven years suggested. Like the member for Throsby, I am signed up to the cause, and I am proud to say that I was the first New South Wales parliamentarian in this place to put my name to the campaign.


The member for Throsby also said that Australia has too many taxes, and again I find myself in agreement with him. But on this point I do say that his Labor government—the federal Gillard, Greens, Independent, Labor government—has not yet seen a tax it does not like. It has not yet seen a tax it will not impose on the people. Yesterday we saw the carbon tax, the misnamed 'clean energy' bills, foisted on the Australian nation. In the electorate of Throsby I am sure that people are going to be very angry with the fact that these carbon tax bills have been put through the lower house and that they will possibly pass through the upper house, where I am sure that New South Wales Nationals Senators Fiona Nash and John Williams will be doing their utmost to prosecute the case against the carbon tax. I want the member for Throsby to know that people in his electorate will be angry. I want him to remember that word 'angry' because that is what people are certainly going to be in his electorate.


The coalition has no issues with some schedules of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 7) Bill 2011. Overall we agree with the amendment, but there are some aspects which are of some concern. Looking at the amendment in its entirety, it seeks to alter the tax treatment of special disability trusts, which, as we have heard, takes into account the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It reduces the lowest marginal tax rate for Pacific seasonal workers; makes changes to the taxation financial arrangements; seeks to give the Commissioner of Taxation limited discretion to extend time for notifying transitional elections in financial arrangements; alters farm management deposits to allow for withdrawal within 12 months when affected by natural disaster; extends temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds by three months; validates directors' penalty notices invalidated by New South Wales Court of Appeals decisions; defines public ancillary funds and allows the Treasurer to make guidelines to their establishment; and makes various alterations to film tax offsets. All in all, these are some worthwhile amendments.


The coalition has no problems with schedule 1, tax changes for special disability trusts, nor with schedule 2, regarding Pacific seasonal workers. Seasonal workers such as fruit pickers, always difficult to find, will have their lowest marginal tax rate adjusted from the too high—we accept that—29 per cent to 15 per cent. We agree with schedule 3, which deals with the taxation of financial arrangements, as well as schedule 4 pertaining to the limited discretion to extend time for notifying transition elections in financial arrangements.,


Certainly the coalition is in support of schedule 5 relating to the farm management deposits. This schedule allows farmers with farm management deposits to withdraw deposits within a year when affected by natural disasters without incurring a tax penalty. The farm management deposits scheme allows individual farmers to set aside pre-tax income in good years for use in low-income years. This will greatly assist food and fibre producers in regional areas who are so prone to the vagaries of commodity prices, the weather and especially over the past four years, poor Labor government policy. Our farmers are a resilient lot. They can cope with drought, fire, flood, frost, plague locusts, mice and a whole host of other setbacks. But they find it difficult to cope with bad policy from this bad government, which has ignored agriculture and does so at its and the nation's peril. We are best placed to meet the future global food task, but Labor's policies do not, sadly, reflect this.


The government has not acted on the recommendations in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia inquiry into the impact of the Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. A year on and regional communities are still wondering if they will be able to use the water productively—if they have a future. I acknowledge today we have the Griffith mayor, Councillor Mike Neville, in this place to talk about what future his community and communities around him may well have with the water debate continuing to go on. This government has failed on the Asian bee incursion; the live cattle export trade issue; and the importation of New Zealand apples, thereby placing our sustainable industry at risk of fire blight. Yesterday they voted in the lower house, despite having no mandate to do so, a carbon tax which will hit rural and regional Australia the hardest. Then there is the scrapping of the wheat export marketing system; Labor's inability to deliver the AQIS inspection reform; the European house borer in Western Australia, myrtle rust; the exit grant fiasco; Labor's inability to manage the grasshopper and mouse plagues; its inability to deliver reforms on the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority; its slow reaction to floods, particularly in New South Wales; the scrapping of exceptional circumstances, leaving farmers in financial and emotional despair; its inability to deliver appropriate labelling for Australian produce; and the milk price debacle, turning its back on our wonderful dairy farmers. Put simply, the Gillard-Greens government, propped up by the three Independents, has failed the regions and the people who grow our food and the fibre to help clothe us.


As far as this amendment is concerned, farm management deposits provide tax benefits if retained for at least 12 months but if withdrawn before 12 months an amended tax return for the year of the deposit must be lodged. There is currently an exception to this 12-month rule for farmers in exceptional circumstances but this exception excludes those events covered by natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. This measure extends this exemption to include those areas covered by an applicable natural disaster, that is where NDRRA are declared. These measures were announced in the 2012 budget.


Schedule 6, the extension of temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds, requires this amendment to avoid capital gains tax being imposed on recent fund mergers. Industry would prefer this relief to be made permanent to remove the significant barrier to the merger of some smaller funds. But overall the coalition supports this amendment and does commend it to the House.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (10:29):  Last week I had the pleasure of attending the Australian government's two-day tax forum. When I mentioned to a couple of friends that I had been spending two days talking about tax, they rolled their eyes. To many of us, I think, the tax system is something that is too complicated, too tricky to understand, too involved with interest groups and too detailed. But every now and then we need to step back from the minutiae of the tax system and remind ourselves of the simple maxim that with taxes we build society. I was reminded of that this morning in speaking with Ken Neilson, who I am pleased to say is here in the gallery. Ken was a good friend of my paternal grandfather, Keith Leigh. Keith passed away the year before I was born. Through Ken I have had the privilege of getting a bit of an insight into what my paternal grandfather was like and into the values that drove him—of Methodism, of a fair go and of making sure that Australia was a generous country with a social safety net that befits our affluent society. I was reminded of the same values this morning while attending the Every Australian Counts morning tea in support of a national disability insurance scheme, speaking there with Estelle Baines and her daughter Scarlett about the challenges that children with disabilities, adults with disabilities and their carers face under the current system.


It is important for us all to recognise that we need a strong tax system to fund the social services that Australians demand. At the same time, that tax system should not take in more revenue than it needs to do its job. This year the tax share is expected to be 21.8 per cent of GDP, less than the 23.5 per cent we inherited. That is not a bad thing. Those of us on this side of the House do not strive to increase the tax take for its own sake. Our aim is to keep taxes as low as they need to be to fund the social services that we support.


As part of the Tax Forum there was a broad discussion of how Australia's tax system can be improved and a broad recognition that it is important to move from mobile tax bases to immobile tax bases. That is why this government is working to bring down the rate on company taxes. We recognise that, in a world of mobile capital, if we have high company tax rates our companies will not get the investment that they need to grow employment and boost wages. That is why we are putting in place a minerals resource rent tax, recognising that, by their very definition, Australia's minerals cannot travel, they will always stay here, and that Australians should get a fair share for the minerals that are their birthright.


We recognise that taxes can be used to bring about better environmental outcomes. That is why we put in place reforms to put a price on carbon pollution and reforms to change the old fringe benefits tax system, which created perverse incentives to get a bigger car and drive it further. We have recognised that complexity is a major challenge in the tax system. As part of that, we are raising the tax-free threshold, tripling it from $6,000 to $18,200. Phasing down the low-income tax offset is the right thing to do. We recognise, through that, that we should have people filing a tax return as seldom as is absolutely necessary. My constituents, I can assure you, do not enjoy filing their tax returns. They are not alone in that. I have been suffering through my own over this past weekend. Anything we can do to take complexity out of the system and ensure that fewer people have to file is a good thing.


We also use the tax system to implement important social policies, like the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and the arrangements put in place under the Hawke government for the collection of child support obligations. Our tax system is also used to collect compulsory superannuation contributions. In a week in which we have heard those opposite say that people's eyebrows will fall off when the carbon price comes in, it is important to recognise that many of those opposite said similar things when universal super was put in place by the Keating government in 1992. But of course universal superannuation was a great boon to the dignified retirement of many Australians. Universal superannuation is not something which any party now goes to an election claiming to abolish. It will be the same with putting a price on carbon pollution. Indeed, this government is now committed to raising the universal superannuation contribution rates. We are doing so within a context in which the Australian retirement savings system is recognised to be one of the best in the world. A recent report from the 2011 Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index rated Australia's retirement system as being the second best in the world, after only the Netherlands. The Mercer report noted that there is no perfect retirement system, but it said that the Australian system did particularly well, due in large part to universal superannuation. The Mercer report did, though, note that raising the level of mandatory contributions would be an important way of improving Australia's overall index value. And that is exactly what this government is doing in moving the universal superannuation contribution rate from nine per cent to 12 per cent.


The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 7) Bill 2011 puts in place a number of important amendments. The removal of income tax impediments affecting special disability trusts means that now the trustee of a special disability trust can sell the primary residence of a person with a disability without incurring CGT. As a result, that provides more money to assist in the future care of a family member with a disability.


We are reducing the marginal tax rate of Pacific seasonal workers, recognising as we do that the sensitivity to marginal tax rates is particularly high for low-wage workers. Just as we have sought to reduce effective marginal tax rates by lowering benefit withdrawals, this is a reform in the same spirit. We are dropping the marginal tax rate for participants in the Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme from 29 per cent to 15 per cent.


We are putting in place technical amendments regarding the taxation of financial arrangements and pay-as-you-go instalments. There are similarly uncontroversial amendments regarding the commissioner's discretion to extend the notification time for taxation of financial arrangements and farm management deposits.


We are extending by three months the temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds. That is being done in recognition of some of the ongoing difficulties certain funds are facing. We are also introducing a variation on penalty notices, in response to an adverse New South Wales Court of Appeal decision in the case of Deputy Commissioner v Soong. Another reform is the improvement in the integrity of public ancillary funds. Finally, we are putting in place reforms to the film tax offset, amending the location offset in such a way as to increase the incentive to invest in films in Australia.


I end where I began with an acknowledgement of Ken Neilson and my late grandfather Keith Leigh, who I believe would be proud of the work this government is doing to put in place a tax system that is efficient, equitable and simple and that raises the revenue we need in order to put in place the social programs that Australians deserve. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (10:38):  I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 7) Bill 2011. In doing so I will outline that there are nine schedules to this bill. The bill is a very significant piece of legislation and I am pleased to see that the opposition supports it. The schedule that I would like to particularly comment on is schedule 1, which relates to disability trusts. When disability trusts were established I do not think that proper mechanisms were put in place. Schedule 1 removes the income tax barriers that impede families from making financial contributions to disability trusts. These changes include extending the capital gains tax main residence exemption to SDTs and provide a CGT exemption for assets transferred into the special disability trust for no consideration. By removing these barriers, special disability trusts become more attractive for families looking to provide long-term care for family members with severe disabilities. In my electorate, I have been working with a constituent who had set up a special disability trust to care for her disabled son and who had made her other son the trustee in charge of this special disability trust. The more she looked at it the more she found that it would not work and would have enormous implications for his financial security into the future. Therefore, it was not achieving what she wanted for her son with a disability. I would like to put on record my thanks to the minister for this change that he has made to schedule 1. It will benefit a number of families throughout Australia. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:41):  I would like to thank those members who contributed to this debate and in particular the member for Shortland for her contribution. Schedule 1 amends the income tax law to make it easier for families and carers to make a financial contribution to a special disability trust in order to provide for the future care and accommodation needs of a family member with severe disability. These changes will enable families and carers to donate assets to a special disability trust without facing a CGT liability and will ensure that a special disability trust can access the CGT main residence exemption.


Schedule 2 reduces the lowest marginal tax rate for Pacific seasonal workers, improving remittance outcomes for participants in the government's Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme. It will also help alleviate the relatively high effective tax rates that these workers are currently subjected to. These changes help support the government's broader Pacific engagement strategy, which is designed to improve the economic development of our Pacific neighbours. Australian workers and other nonresidents will not be impacted by this change. Further, as nonresidents, Pacific seasonal workers do not have access to the tax-free threshold or the low-income tax offset.


Schedule 3 amends the pay-as-you-go instalment provisions to ensure that the concept of instalment income and the concepts of gain and loss in the taxation of financial arrangements, the provisions in stages 3 and 4, interact appropriately and in a way that does not impose significant compliance costs for affected taxpayers or administrative costs for the ATO.


The amendments in schedule 4 provide some administrative flexibility so that affected TOFA taxpayers are not prevented from obtaining the compliance benefits of the transitional election. Schedule 5 makes a number of changes to the farm management deposit scheme. The amendment to exempt primary producers from the 12-month rule will remove the existing situation whereby primary producers affected by drought are treated more generously than those affected by natural disasters such as floods and bushfires. This schedule gives effect to the government's 2011-12 budget announcement.


Schedule 6 amends the application provision of the temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds to extend the end date by three months to 30 September 2011. This will benefit affected funds by providing additional time for mergers to take place before the loss relief expires. The requirement that affected mergers are completed in a single income year is relaxed to permit funds to benefit from the extension. Schedule 7 ensures that certain director penalty notices remain valid. These retrospective amendments will help preserve the integrity of the tax compliance framework by clarifying that certain penalty notices remain valid and the penalties attaching to these notices will remain recoverable.


Schedule 8 honours the government's 2010-11 budget commitment to improve the integrity of public ancillary funds and to provide the trustees of such funds with greater certainty as to their philanthropic obligations. Following a thorough public consultation process, this schedule amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 to improve the integrity of public ancillary funds.


Schedule 9 makes a number of changes to the film tax offsets. The amendment to the producer offset will refine delivery of government support to screen producers, reduce the financial and administrative burden on applicants and improve operational efficiency. These amendments to the film tax offset will reduce the compliance cost for affected taxpayers and this schedule gives effect to the government's 2011-12 budget announcement.


The bill deserves the support of the parliament. I thank those members who have contributed and I commend this bill to the House.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2011-10-13,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (10:02):  The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 7) Bill has nine schedules within it. As is always the case, they relate to a variety of changes to the taxation law. I can say at the outset on behalf of the opposition that we are not opposing this bill. I will very briefly run through each of those nine schedules and the changes that they will effect to the taxation law after the bill receives Royal Assent. The Assistant Treasurer on 21 September introduced this bill into the House. He outlined in great detail each of those schedules and the effect they will have. I will in brief summary give the coalition's perspective on each of them. As I said at the outset, we will be supporting this tax laws amendment bill.


Schedule 1 effects some tax changes with respect to special disability trusts. Essentially it provides some more favourable treatment by removing income tax barriers, particularly with respect to capital gains tax. The Assistant Treasurer outlined this in great detail just a few weeks ago, but the special disability trusts which were established in 2006 enable immediate family members and carers who have the financial means to do so to make private provision for the current and future care and accommodation needs of a family member with a severe disability. This schedule removes some of those capital gains tax barriers that might exist for those families. We welcome those changes. Schedule 2 relates to specific seasonal workers. The tax change that is being effected in this schedule is to change the lowest marginal tax rate for participants in the scheme from 29 per cent to 15 per cent.


Schedule 3 relates to TOFA, the Taxation of Financial Arrangements. There have been many tax law amendment bills that have dealt with these highly technical issues. You will probably be pleased to know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this morning I will not reiterate every single aspect of the TOFA reforms that have occurred over many years but will just comment very briefly on schedule 3. This schedule makes some changes to the pay-as-you-go instalments and also some technical amendments with respect to them.


Schedule 4 of this bill gives the Commissioner of Taxation some discretion that will enable the extension of time for notifying transitional elections in financial arrangements. Essentially, this will provide the Commissioner of Taxation with the discretion to extend by up to three months the time in which a taxpayer may notify the commissioner of a transitional election under division 230 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 197—the TOFA provisions.


Schedule 5 relates to farm management deposits in a couple of respects, and they are positive changes. They will allow farmers affected by a natural disaster to withdraw deposits within 12 months with no tax penalty. Also, they will make provision for more information. They are positive changes to remove some unintended barriers, as I would see them.


Schedule 6 relates to superannuation. It extends temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds. As the Assistant Treasurer outlined in the House on 21 September, it will extend the end date for temporary loss relief for funds that are merging by three months from June of this year until September of this year.


Schedule 7 relates to penalty notices. It is essentially an integrity measure that will preserve the validity of penalty notices that the Commissioner of Taxation has issued. It needs to do this as a result of a recent case in the New South Wales Court of Appeal. Some 17,000 penalty notices would be in doubt without this amendment. So without it there would be a risk of litigation, and obviously revenue implications as well. This schedule seeks to rectify the intention of the law.


Schedule 8, the second last schedule, relates to public ancillary funds. It essentially makes some changes that I believe were announced by the government in last year's budget. It will rename trust funds that qualify for deductible gift status. It will give the Treasurer some powers to make guidelines and a range of other administrative changes.


Schedule 9, the last schedule, relates to film tax offsets in each respect. It will provide for more generous treatment for the producer offset, including by amending the qualifying expenditure threshold—on my reading, reducing it to $500,000—and a range of other changes. I make the point on behalf of the opposition that these changes are very similar to the arts policy commitments made by our shadow minister, Senator George Brandis, at the last election, and we offer our support for this schedule.


As I said at the outset, I on behalf of the coalition support this tax law amendment bill and each of the schedules within it. We commend the bill to the House.

"Jones, Stephen, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (10:10):  In December 2009 the then head of Treasury provided to the Treasurer a copy of what is colloquially known as the Henry tax review and formally known as Australia's Future Tax System report, a comprehensive review of our tax system and its sustainability into the future. At page 11 of that report the review committee made this observation:


Australia has too many taxes and too many complicated ways of delivering multiple policy objectives through the tax system. The capacity of the legislative and operating platforms of these systems and their human users to deal with the resulting complexity has been overreached. To a large extent, this is a reflection of a compartmentalised and incremental approach to tax policy that has been weighted towards achieving finely calibrated equity and efficiency outcomes at the expense of simplicity.


It is observations such as this which have driven the Gillard Labor government to ensure tax reform is at the top of its economic reform agenda. It is what underscored the desire to hold a summit in Canberra last week, in which we brought some of the leading thinkers in the area of economic and tax reform to Canberra to discuss what we needed to do over the next decade to reform the tax system to ensure it was fit for use for the remainder of the century.


I observed in a debate yesterday that taxation has a number of objectives, including raising revenue and regulating behaviour in the public interest. We have had both of these things in mind as we have set about the task of reforming the Australian tax system to ensure it is fairer and more equitable and that we will have revenue streams to provide the essential government services that Australians expect now and into the future. We understand—and I think there is bipartisan understanding of this fact—that by the time my children, who are now very young, enter the workforce the ratio of people of working age in the workforce to those who are outside the workforce and not of working age will move from 1:5 to 1:2.7. This will place an increasing burden on those who are in the workforce and those who are paying tax to deliver the services that Australians expect. So it is incumbent on all sides of politics to ensure that we are spreading the taxation base, that it is administered in the most effective way, that it drives and incentivises the right sort of behaviour and that it creates the revenue needed to deliver much-needed services.


The amendments put forward by this bill are in part driven by those objectives. Schedule 1 to the bill is important. This morning many of us from all parties attended in this place a parliamentary breakfast for the National Disability Insurance Scheme. At the breakfast we heard from carers and people living with disabilities about the importance of government doing everything in its power to ensure that we are providing financial sustenance and other service arrangements to meet the growing needs of people in that position. Schedule 1 is not the whole game but it does some work in this area. It extends the capital gains tax main resident exemptions to special disability trusts. Removing these barriers makes it more attractive for families to provide for the long-term care of a family member through the trust system to enable them to make financial arrangements for loved ones, for a family member who has a severe disability. I commend this particular schedule to the House. Schedule 2 of the bill reduces the lowest marginal tax rate that applies to non-resident workers employed under the government's Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme. It reduces this from 29 per cent to 15 per cent. Not only is this of benefit to those working under the government's Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme but it also provides an indirect benefit to the agricultural sector, that has been crying out for many years for arrangements and assistance from the government to provide much-needed workers during the picking seasons—the peak work seasons. It provides an indirect benefit to employers at the same time as providing a direct tax benefit for those in our near region who wish to come to Australia and work under the scheme, so everyone benefits from this.


Schedule 3 amends the pay-as-you-go instalment provisions to ensure that the concept of instalment income interacts appropriately with the concepts of gain and loss in the taxation and financial arrangements provisions. In essence, the amendments ensure that the interaction does not impose a significant administrative or compliance cost whilst maintaining the objective of ensuring that the pay-as-you-go instalment provisions are made.


Schedule 5 amends the tax law and the Banking Act 1959 to make four changes to the farm management deposits, or FMD, scheme. Essentially these amendments are to the benefit of our farming community to ensure that there is more flexibility at their disposal in the case of natural disasters to access their farm management deposits within 12 months of making a deposit while still retaining concessional tax treatment for those arrangements. Again, this is an important arrangement for the benefit of our farming community.


Schedule 6 is concerned with the superannuation and taxation arrangements for superannuation schemes that are in the process of merging. This fulfils a number of objectives. It is a policy objective of this government to ensure that our superannuation schemes are of a sufficient scale and size to enable them to gain the benefits of scale and have access to a capital base that will enable them to make the right sorts of investments at the right cost and be involved in the right deals to provide a profit to the fund and a benefit to the members. The specific provision here will provide additional time for those funds when they do merge to take the benefits of loss relief. It extends that by three months. The fund is the immediate beneficiary, but obviously the account holders, the superannuation beneficiaries, are the indirect and ultimate beneficiaries of this schedule.


Schedule 7 is essentially a remedial provision that addresses the consequences of a recent court of appeal decision. In essence, it ensures that if directors, when they receive notices advising directors, do not cause their company to take certain actions with respect to debt then they will become personally liable. As I said, this is a remedial provision which clarifies the law as a consequence of a recent court of appeal decision.


Schedule 8 is the fulfilment of the Gillard government's 2010 budget commitment to provide a regulatory framework to improve the integrity of public ancillary funds similar to that which has applied to private ancillary funds since October 2009. This framework will provide the trustees of such funds with greater certainty as to their philanthropic obligations. Schedule 9 is aimed at ensuring that we are providing greater incentives to our domestic film industry. It goes to changes to the film tax offsets, and these changes affect producer offsets and the location and post-digital and visual effects offsets. They will apply from 1 July 2011 and are estimated to increase expenditure on the film tax offsets by around $8 million over the forward estimates—that is a tax expenditure, of course. These amendments to the film tax offsets are aimed at reforming and strengthening the Australian film production industry, something that I know is very dear to the hearts of all members in this place.


The schedules in this bill are an important part of the government's taxation reform agenda. The reform agenda does not end with this bill; it is far-reaching to ensure that we have a sustainable and equitable taxation system which creates the right sorts of incentives for economic activity, is administratively efficient and generates the revenue necessary now and into the future to ensure that the Australian government, whoever occupies the Treasury bench, has the revenue necessary to deliver the services that all Australians expect. I commend this bill to the House.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2011-10-13,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:21):  I would like to take up two points that the member for Throsby raised. Firstly, like him, I attended the national disability insurance breakfast this morning, where we heard a most gracious speech, I have to say, by the Prime Minister in relation to the Every Australian Counts campaign. This has bipartisan support and needs to be brought forward sooner than the seven years suggested. Like the member for Throsby, I am signed up to the cause, and I am proud to say that I was the first New South Wales parliamentarian in this place to put my name to the campaign.


The member for Throsby also said that Australia has too many taxes, and again I find myself in agreement with him. But on this point I do say that his Labor government—the federal Gillard, Greens, Independent, Labor government—has not yet seen a tax it does not like. It has not yet seen a tax it will not impose on the people. Yesterday we saw the carbon tax, the misnamed 'clean energy' bills, foisted on the Australian nation. In the electorate of Throsby I am sure that people are going to be very angry with the fact that these carbon tax bills have been put through the lower house and that they will possibly pass through the upper house, where I am sure that New South Wales Nationals Senators Fiona Nash and John Williams will be doing their utmost to prosecute the case against the carbon tax. I want the member for Throsby to know that people in his electorate will be angry. I want him to remember that word 'angry' because that is what people are certainly going to be in his electorate.


The coalition has no issues with some schedules of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 7) Bill 2011. Overall we agree with the amendment, but there are some aspects which are of some concern. Looking at the amendment in its entirety, it seeks to alter the tax treatment of special disability trusts, which, as we have heard, takes into account the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It reduces the lowest marginal tax rate for Pacific seasonal workers; makes changes to the taxation financial arrangements; seeks to give the Commissioner of Taxation limited discretion to extend time for notifying transitional elections in financial arrangements; alters farm management deposits to allow for withdrawal within 12 months when affected by natural disaster; extends temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds by three months; validates directors' penalty notices invalidated by New South Wales Court of Appeals decisions; defines public ancillary funds and allows the Treasurer to make guidelines to their establishment; and makes various alterations to film tax offsets. All in all, these are some worthwhile amendments.


The coalition has no problems with schedule 1, tax changes for special disability trusts, nor with schedule 2, regarding Pacific seasonal workers. Seasonal workers such as fruit pickers, always difficult to find, will have their lowest marginal tax rate adjusted from the too high—we accept that—29 per cent to 15 per cent. We agree with schedule 3, which deals with the taxation of financial arrangements, as well as schedule 4 pertaining to the limited discretion to extend time for notifying transition elections in financial arrangements.,


Certainly the coalition is in support of schedule 5 relating to the farm management deposits. This schedule allows farmers with farm management deposits to withdraw deposits within a year when affected by natural disasters without incurring a tax penalty. The farm management deposits scheme allows individual farmers to set aside pre-tax income in good years for use in low-income years. This will greatly assist food and fibre producers in regional areas who are so prone to the vagaries of commodity prices, the weather and especially over the past four years, poor Labor government policy. Our farmers are a resilient lot. They can cope with drought, fire, flood, frost, plague locusts, mice and a whole host of other setbacks. But they find it difficult to cope with bad policy from this bad government, which has ignored agriculture and does so at its and the nation's peril. We are best placed to meet the future global food task, but Labor's policies do not, sadly, reflect this.


The government has not acted on the recommendations in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia inquiry into the impact of the Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. A year on and regional communities are still wondering if they will be able to use the water productively—if they have a future. I acknowledge today we have the Griffith mayor, Councillor Mike Neville, in this place to talk about what future his community and communities around him may well have with the water debate continuing to go on. This government has failed on the Asian bee incursion; the live cattle export trade issue; and the importation of New Zealand apples, thereby placing our sustainable industry at risk of fire blight. Yesterday they voted in the lower house, despite having no mandate to do so, a carbon tax which will hit rural and regional Australia the hardest. Then there is the scrapping of the wheat export marketing system; Labor's inability to deliver the AQIS inspection reform; the European house borer in Western Australia, myrtle rust; the exit grant fiasco; Labor's inability to manage the grasshopper and mouse plagues; its inability to deliver reforms on the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority; its slow reaction to floods, particularly in New South Wales; the scrapping of exceptional circumstances, leaving farmers in financial and emotional despair; its inability to deliver appropriate labelling for Australian produce; and the milk price debacle, turning its back on our wonderful dairy farmers. Put simply, the Gillard-Greens government, propped up by the three Independents, has failed the regions and the people who grow our food and the fibre to help clothe us.


As far as this amendment is concerned, farm management deposits provide tax benefits if retained for at least 12 months but if withdrawn before 12 months an amended tax return for the year of the deposit must be lodged. There is currently an exception to this 12-month rule for farmers in exceptional circumstances but this exception excludes those events covered by natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. This measure extends this exemption to include those areas covered by an applicable natural disaster, that is where NDRRA are declared. These measures were announced in the 2012 budget.


Schedule 6, the extension of temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds, requires this amendment to avoid capital gains tax being imposed on recent fund mergers. Industry would prefer this relief to be made permanent to remove the significant barrier to the merger of some smaller funds. But overall the coalition supports this amendment and does commend it to the House.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (10:29):  Last week I had the pleasure of attending the Australian government's two-day tax forum. When I mentioned to a couple of friends that I had been spending two days talking about tax, they rolled their eyes. To many of us, I think, the tax system is something that is too complicated, too tricky to understand, too involved with interest groups and too detailed. But every now and then we need to step back from the minutiae of the tax system and remind ourselves of the simple maxim that with taxes we build society. I was reminded of that this morning in speaking with Ken Neilson, who I am pleased to say is here in the gallery. Ken was a good friend of my paternal grandfather, Keith Leigh. Keith passed away the year before I was born. Through Ken I have had the privilege of getting a bit of an insight into what my paternal grandfather was like and into the values that drove him—of Methodism, of a fair go and of making sure that Australia was a generous country with a social safety net that befits our affluent society. I was reminded of the same values this morning while attending the Every Australian Counts morning tea in support of a national disability insurance scheme, speaking there with Estelle Baines and her daughter Scarlett about the challenges that children with disabilities, adults with disabilities and their carers face under the current system.


It is important for us all to recognise that we need a strong tax system to fund the social services that Australians demand. At the same time, that tax system should not take in more revenue than it needs to do its job. This year the tax share is expected to be 21.8 per cent of GDP, less than the 23.5 per cent we inherited. That is not a bad thing. Those of us on this side of the House do not strive to increase the tax take for its own sake. Our aim is to keep taxes as low as they need to be to fund the social services that we support.


As part of the Tax Forum there was a broad discussion of how Australia's tax system can be improved and a broad recognition that it is important to move from mobile tax bases to immobile tax bases. That is why this government is working to bring down the rate on company taxes. We recognise that, in a world of mobile capital, if we have high company tax rates our companies will not get the investment that they need to grow employment and boost wages. That is why we are putting in place a minerals resource rent tax, recognising that, by their very definition, Australia's minerals cannot travel, they will always stay here, and that Australians should get a fair share for the minerals that are their birthright.


We recognise that taxes can be used to bring about better environmental outcomes. That is why we put in place reforms to put a price on carbon pollution and reforms to change the old fringe benefits tax system, which created perverse incentives to get a bigger car and drive it further. We have recognised that complexity is a major challenge in the tax system. As part of that, we are raising the tax-free threshold, tripling it from $6,000 to $18,200. Phasing down the low-income tax offset is the right thing to do. We recognise, through that, that we should have people filing a tax return as seldom as is absolutely necessary. My constituents, I can assure you, do not enjoy filing their tax returns. They are not alone in that. I have been suffering through my own over this past weekend. Anything we can do to take complexity out of the system and ensure that fewer people have to file is a good thing.


We also use the tax system to implement important social policies, like the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and the arrangements put in place under the Hawke government for the collection of child support obligations. Our tax system is also used to collect compulsory superannuation contributions. In a week in which we have heard those opposite say that people's eyebrows will fall off when the carbon price comes in, it is important to recognise that many of those opposite said similar things when universal super was put in place by the Keating government in 1992. But of course universal superannuation was a great boon to the dignified retirement of many Australians. Universal superannuation is not something which any party now goes to an election claiming to abolish. It will be the same with putting a price on carbon pollution. Indeed, this government is now committed to raising the universal superannuation contribution rates. We are doing so within a context in which the Australian retirement savings system is recognised to be one of the best in the world. A recent report from the 2011 Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index rated Australia's retirement system as being the second best in the world, after only the Netherlands. The Mercer report noted that there is no perfect retirement system, but it said that the Australian system did particularly well, due in large part to universal superannuation. The Mercer report did, though, note that raising the level of mandatory contributions would be an important way of improving Australia's overall index value. And that is exactly what this government is doing in moving the universal superannuation contribution rate from nine per cent to 12 per cent.


The Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 7) Bill 2011 puts in place a number of important amendments. The removal of income tax impediments affecting special disability trusts means that now the trustee of a special disability trust can sell the primary residence of a person with a disability without incurring CGT. As a result, that provides more money to assist in the future care of a family member with a disability.


We are reducing the marginal tax rate of Pacific seasonal workers, recognising as we do that the sensitivity to marginal tax rates is particularly high for low-wage workers. Just as we have sought to reduce effective marginal tax rates by lowering benefit withdrawals, this is a reform in the same spirit. We are dropping the marginal tax rate for participants in the Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme from 29 per cent to 15 per cent.


We are putting in place technical amendments regarding the taxation of financial arrangements and pay-as-you-go instalments. There are similarly uncontroversial amendments regarding the commissioner's discretion to extend the notification time for taxation of financial arrangements and farm management deposits.


We are extending by three months the temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds. That is being done in recognition of some of the ongoing difficulties certain funds are facing. We are also introducing a variation on penalty notices, in response to an adverse New South Wales Court of Appeal decision in the case of Deputy Commissioner v Soong. Another reform is the improvement in the integrity of public ancillary funds. Finally, we are putting in place reforms to the film tax offset, amending the location offset in such a way as to increase the incentive to invest in films in Australia.


I end where I began with an acknowledgement of Ken Neilson and my late grandfather Keith Leigh, who I believe would be proud of the work this government is doing to put in place a tax system that is efficient, equitable and simple and that raises the revenue we need in order to put in place the social programs that Australians deserve. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (10:38):  I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 7) Bill 2011. In doing so I will outline that there are nine schedules to this bill. The bill is a very significant piece of legislation and I am pleased to see that the opposition supports it. The schedule that I would like to particularly comment on is schedule 1, which relates to disability trusts. When disability trusts were established I do not think that proper mechanisms were put in place. Schedule 1 removes the income tax barriers that impede families from making financial contributions to disability trusts. These changes include extending the capital gains tax main residence exemption to SDTs and provide a CGT exemption for assets transferred into the special disability trust for no consideration. By removing these barriers, special disability trusts become more attractive for families looking to provide long-term care for family members with severe disabilities. In my electorate, I have been working with a constituent who had set up a special disability trust to care for her disabled son and who had made her other son the trustee in charge of this special disability trust. The more she looked at it the more she found that it would not work and would have enormous implications for his financial security into the future. Therefore, it was not achieving what she wanted for her son with a disability. I would like to put on record my thanks to the minister for this change that he has made to schedule 1. It will benefit a number of families throughout Australia. I commend the legislation to the House.

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10:41):  I would like to thank those members who contributed to this debate and in particular the member for Shortland for her contribution. Schedule 1 amends the income tax law to make it easier for families and carers to make a financial contribution to a special disability trust in order to provide for the future care and accommodation needs of a family member with severe disability. These changes will enable families and carers to donate assets to a special disability trust without facing a CGT liability and will ensure that a special disability trust can access the CGT main residence exemption.


Schedule 2 reduces the lowest marginal tax rate for Pacific seasonal workers, improving remittance outcomes for participants in the government's Pacific Seasonal Worker Pilot Scheme. It will also help alleviate the relatively high effective tax rates that these workers are currently subjected to. These changes help support the government's broader Pacific engagement strategy, which is designed to improve the economic development of our Pacific neighbours. Australian workers and other nonresidents will not be impacted by this change. Further, as nonresidents, Pacific seasonal workers do not have access to the tax-free threshold or the low-income tax offset.


Schedule 3 amends the pay-as-you-go instalment provisions to ensure that the concept of instalment income and the concepts of gain and loss in the taxation of financial arrangements, the provisions in stages 3 and 4, interact appropriately and in a way that does not impose significant compliance costs for affected taxpayers or administrative costs for the ATO.


The amendments in schedule 4 provide some administrative flexibility so that affected TOFA taxpayers are not prevented from obtaining the compliance benefits of the transitional election. Schedule 5 makes a number of changes to the farm management deposit scheme. The amendment to exempt primary producers from the 12-month rule will remove the existing situation whereby primary producers affected by drought are treated more generously than those affected by natural disasters such as floods and bushfires. This schedule gives effect to the government's 2011-12 budget announcement.


Schedule 6 amends the application provision of the temporary loss relief for merging superannuation funds to extend the end date by three months to 30 September 2011. This will benefit affected funds by providing additional time for mergers to take place before the loss relief expires. The requirement that affected mergers are completed in a single income year is relaxed to permit funds to benefit from the extension. Schedule 7 ensures that certain director penalty notices remain valid. These retrospective amendments will help preserve the integrity of the tax compliance framework by clarifying that certain penalty notices remain valid and the penalties attaching to these notices will remain recoverable.


Schedule 8 honours the government's 2010-11 budget commitment to improve the integrity of public ancillary funds and to provide the trustees of such funds with greater certainty as to their philanthropic obligations. Following a thorough public consultation process, this schedule amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Taxation Administration Act 1953 and the A New Tax System (Australian Business Number) Act 1999 to improve the integrity of public ancillary funds.


Schedule 9 makes a number of changes to the film tax offsets. The amendment to the producer offset will refine delivery of government support to screen producers, reduce the financial and administrative burden on applicants and improve operational efficiency. These amendments to the film tax offset will reduce the compliance cost for affected taxpayers and this schedule gives effect to the government's 2011-12 budget announcement.


The bill deserves the support of the parliament. I thank those members who have contributed and I commend this bill to the House.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (10:46):  In the last two years I have had the opportunity to see the excellent work of Ngala, the well-known Western Australian provider of early parenting and childhood services. Ngala is known for its support and guidance for families and young children through parenting programs. On this occasion, I would like to pay tribute to them for their Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters—HIPPY. HIPPY is 'a two-year home-based parenting and early childhood enrichment program', targeting families with young children living in disadvantaged areas. Ngala runs a HIPPY program based in Girrawheen, a suburb within my electorate of Cowan. I thank them for their excellent work.


Fifty-one HIPPY sites are run around Australia through funding received in the 2007 federal budget. I understand that full federal funding is due to expire at the end of 2012, with the amount halved for next year. Ngala have recently applied for interim funding to enrol 25 new families in 2012-13 but that is 10 fewer than their usual target, and they are awaiting a response from the government.


Aligned with the National Early Childhood Development Strategy, Investing in the Early Years, HIPPY works with vulnerable families to improve outcomes for children and their parents. The HIPPY approach develops the foundations for learning in the home during children's crucial early years. HIPPY recognises the significance of children's early learning experiences and that parents are children's first and most important teachers. Families start HIPPY when their child is between 3½ and four years old and continue during the first year of formal schooling.


A key component of HIPPY is regular home visits. This emphasises the value of the home as a place of learning. The program operates within the local community, employs community members and utilises the strengths and skills that already exist within each family. Regular group meetings for parents foster a sense of belonging, reduce the sense of isolation and increase families' awareness of community services and support.


The Age 4 program is based on simple activities, while the Age 5 program also includes Parent Packs with information about child development. Delivery is tailored to meet each family's literacy level and English-speaking ability, while acknowledging other issues that may be impacting on the family. A storybook is included as a basis for some activities. These books have now been translated into several languages.


The impact of the program reaches beyond simply enhancing children's school readiness. The activities offered in the program provide opportunities for positive interactions between children and their parents around learning and literacy. In turn, this enhances parent-child connection and bonding. Overall, the program increases parents' knowledge of child development and developmentally appropriate activities as well as awareness of their child's learning style. This improved understanding and parent-child connection has a positive impact on family relationships and the self-confidence of parents. Current HIPPY Girrawheen enrolments total 69 families, with 22 from Cowan. HIPPY Girrawheen covers the suburbs of Girrawheen, Balga, Koondoola, Westminster and Mirrabooka. These five suburbs have low socioeconomic assessment scores and have a significant number of residents from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This is shown in HIPPY Girrawheen enrolments, with approximately 80 per cent born overseas, from a total of 15 different countries, with the majority of those being from Somalia, Sudan and Burma. The five target suburbs are marked by high unemployment levels, a high proportion of single-parent families and a high proportion of rentals. In Girrawheen, 24.5 per cent of households earn less than $500 per week. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of enrolled families face complex issues. These issues may include isolation, financial stress, unemployment, housing insecurity, maternal depression, low parental education levels, poor English literacy, having a large number of young children, family discord and sole parenting. All of these are known risk factors in terms of optimal early childhood development. The presence of multiple risk factors in the early years significantly reduces children's chances of healthy development, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. 


Just as multiple risk factors negatively impact on children's development, accumulative protective factors can also help change a child's developmental pathway, promoting good outcomes. In recent quantitative and qualitative research conducted on HIPPY, there is clear evidence of the positive impact of enhancing protective factors within enrolled families, particularly in building social networks, reducing social isolation and improving family relationships. Further, HIPPY has been demonstrated to be effective and appropriate for disadvantaged families in both culturally and linguistically diverse and Anglo-Celtic communities.


Although there is a chance of receiving interim funding for 2012-13, there is no commitment of federal funding for the program beyond that. I am certainly drawn to the program through a sense of providing parental responsibility and playing a role in providing leadership in children's lives. I think this program is a good thing and that it deserves federal government support. I thank the HIPPY Girrawheen team for its great work. (Time expired)

Mr Christensen
  asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 26 May 2011:


(1) Has he considered that the impact of the recent changes to the Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) on salary sacrificed company vehicles will be financially deleterious to many mine workers in Central Queensland who have to travel hundreds of kilometres to get to and from work.


(2) Can he confirm that when a mine worker renews the lease on his or her salary-sacrificed vehicle valued at $65 000, the fringe benefits tax payable will go from $4550 to $13 500 if the mine worker has to drive more than 40 000 kilometres per year; if so, can he confirm that this was intended.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2011-10-13,"



Mr Swan:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


(1) By way of background, when an employer makes a car available to an employee for private use, a car fringe benefit will generally arise and be subject to fringe benefits tax (FBT). Car fringe benefits are valued under either the 'operating cost' (or 'log book') method or the 'statutory formula' method.


Under the log book method, the taxable value of the benefit is based on the cost of owning and operating the vehicle, reduced by the portion which relates to the business use of the vehicle. Employers are required to substantiate the business use of the vehicle by maintaining a log book for a specified period.


The statutory formula method is designed to provide employers with a low compliance cost alternative to the log book method, eliminating the need to maintain a vehicle log book. The statutory formula method removes the need to explicitly distinguish between the business and private use of a vehicle. 


The Government announced on 10 May 2011 that it will reform the statutory formula method by replacing the sliding scale of statutory rates with a single rate of 20 per cent that applies regardless of the distance travelled. Previously, the taxable value of a car fringe benefit was reduced as a car travelled more kilometres, as a greater business use element was assumed.


Replacing the sliding scale of statutory rates with a flat statutory rate of 20 per cent removes the unintended incentive for people to drive their vehicle further than they need to, in order to obtain a larger tax concession.


The changes do not apply to existing contracts, and will be phased in over four years.


People who use their vehicle for a significant amount of work-related travel will still be able to use the log book method to ensure their car fringe benefit excludes any business use of the vehicle.


The reforms do not fully remove the FBT concession for cars, and the benefits from salary packaging will still be greater for employees with higher variable costs of car ownership (e.g. fuel and maintenance) as a proportion of total costs. This is because these variable costs are salary sacrificed and are therefore paid from pre-tax dollars rather than post-tax dollars, and don't affect the amount of FBT payable. 


Some types of cars, in certain circumstances, are exempt from FBT, such as where there is only limited private use of a panel van or ute. There are no changes to these exemptions.


In addition, there is an FBT exemption for the provision, by an employer, of transport to and from an employee's usual place of residence and a remote area work site, such as a mine, under what are commonly known as fly-in fly-out arrangements. The exemption applies where an employee is provided with accommodation at or near the remote area work site on working days, the transport is provided to enable the employee to return to their usual place of residence on days off, and where it would be unreasonable to expect the employee to travel to and from work on a daily basis. 


(2) The taxable value of the car fringe benefit, and the FBT payable on that car fringe benefit, depend on whether the statutory formula method or the log book method is chosen. If the statutory formula method is chosen, the FBT payable will depend on the cost of the vehicle, how far the vehicle is driven, and whether the employee makes an employee contribution. If the log book method is chosen, the FBT payable will depend on the cost of owning and operating the vehicle, how much the vehicle is driven for work, and whether the employee makes an employee contribution.


Under the statutory formula method, the taxable value of the car fringe benefit for a vehicle with a base value of $65,000, being driven further than 40,000 kilometres per annum, will increase from $4,550 to $13,000 following the changes to the taxation of car fringe benefits. However, this is not the FBT payable. The FBT payable depends on whether the employee makes an employee contribution, which can substantially reduce and even eliminate the FBT payable both before and after the reform. Whether the employee makes an employee contribution or not, the FBT liability is not equal to the taxable value of the car fringe benefit.


Under the log book method, the taxable value of the car fringe benefit depends on how much the car is driven for work, and how much the car is used for private travel. If the vehicle is driven only for work, the taxable value of the car fringe benefit, and the FBT payable, will be zero.
