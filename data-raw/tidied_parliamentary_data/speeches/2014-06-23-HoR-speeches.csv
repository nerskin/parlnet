WYATT ROY
 (Longman) (10:07):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's Report 140: Treaty tabled on 13 May 2014: Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and Implement FATCA—interim report.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




WYATT ROY:
  Today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Report 140, an interim report on the committee's inquiry into the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the United States of America to improve international tax compliance and implement the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA.


The agreement is an unusual treaty action in that it has been negotiated to assist Australian businesses in complying with a United States tax law.


FATCA comes into effect on 1 July 2014.


To ensure the agreement and its related legislation is in place by that date, the Treasurer, the Hon. Joe Hockey MP, wrote to the committee to request that the committee expedite its consideration of this agreement.


If the 1 July deadline is not met, Australian financial institutions with interests in the United States will be faced with either significant compliance costs associated with FATCA or a withholding tax of 30 per cent on income derived in the United States.


The committee, despite reservations about the agreement, appreciates that it must make the best of a less than satisfactory situation.


Accordingly, the committee resolved to support the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and Implement FATCA and recommend that binding treaty action be taken.


The committee will table a final report on its inquiry into this agreement in due course.


On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (10:11):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


There are few credible commentators left anywhere who do not regard the decision by the so-called coalition of the willing to invade Iraq as one of the most significant mistakes in modern Western foreign policy. At the time, Iraq was not threatening war. We now know too that there never were the 'weapons of mass destruction' that we were told there were. Australia committing troops to this war was wrong, not just for the credibility of those who made that flawed decision but, primarily, for those on the front line and of all parties involved in the conflict. The decision by Australia to send our troops to war in Iraq, based on an untruth, has meant that we have become complicit in the hundreds and thousands of deaths of Iraqis that resulted and in the deaths of those who continue to lose their lives. We have also become regarded by a generation of young Iraqis an occupying force. For the record, it is important to state what the casualties as a result of the war are. None of the estimates are fewer than 100,000. Some are higher than a million. And, as is now clear, this conflict has entered a terrible new phase which means that the numbers of people who continue to die in the ongoing sectarian conflicts across Iraq continue to rise. This is an unparalleled tragedy. The latest news reports suggest that ISIS has advanced closer still to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad.  


I would like to make this point about the Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2014, which I am introducing today. If this bill had become law in 2003 and parliament had the authority over troop deployments, perhaps the folly of this engagement, the true nature of the flawed decision, would have been revealed if the decision to deploy troops had been fully and publicly debated by parliament. If parliament had had the chance to debate the Iraq war and the sending of our troops into conflict, it is arguable that we would not have been complicit in this disaster. And make no mistake: the possibility that Australia commits troops again in some form or another to Iraq is now real.


Back in 2003, we were told that our involvement in Iraq would stabilise the country and bring peace and was the best way to tackle terrorism. Yet look at Iraq today. More war does not cure more war. Iraq today shows that. And yet more war is what some commentators are advocating. But the Australian parliament, seemingly the country's pre-eminent decision-making body, remains powerless over debating and deciding on sending troops to war. The need for the parliament to have the authority to deploy troops is therefore very real. Following Iraq, of course, Australia has also fought a long and costly war in Afghanistan. By 'costly', I am primarily referring to the cost of the Afghan war on Australian troops. Forty troops have lost their lives in Afghanistan, and two Australian defence personnel lost their lives in Iraq. 


It is because of the seriousness of committing troops to conflict that the Australian parliament must debate such a momentous decision. There are few more momentous decisions that a country can take than to go to war or to send its troops into conflict. More often than not, this involves young men and women putting their lives on the line. For this reason, above all else, it is to me and to the Greens inconceivable that such a momentous decision is left to the executive alone. As we saw with the parliamentary debate on Australia's involvement in Afghanistan in 2010, each elected representative that has spoken made worthwhile contributions on behalf of their constituents—constituents who, through their representatives in a democracy such as ours, should have a say in any question to deploy troops.


That the Defence Act does not currently allow for that level of decision making, scrutiny and debate on such important questions is, I believe, a failure of democracy. The Defence Amendment (Parliamentary Approval of Overseas Service) Bill 2014 inserts a new section 50C into the Defence Act to require that decisions to deploy members of the Defence Force beyond the territorial limits be made not by the executive alone but rather by parliament as a whole.


This bill was initiated by the former Australian Democrats and supported by the Australian Greens, who took carriage of the bill after 2007. It is the latest iteration of bills introduced into the Senate since 1985 that aim to increase the transparency and accountability of governments by involving parliamentary discussion and scrutiny of the decision to deploy Australian military forces to overseas conflicts. It was reintroduced by my colleague Senator Ludlam in late 2008 and referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in August 2009. The committee, while neglecting to hold a hearing, nonetheless made a useful critique of the bill without undermining its essential purpose, in its report of February 2010. Senator Ludlam's dissenting report into the bill provided the transcript of an informal 'hearing' undertaken subsequent to the majority committee decision not to take evidence directly. I am proud to be the latest in a line of parliamentarians to sponsor a bill with this purpose.


This bill seeks to address the absence of checks and balances on the power of the executive which are characteristic of, and broadly considered essential to, any functioning democracy. Under the Defence Act 1903, the Prime Minister can commit Australian troops to conflict zones without the support of the United Nations, the Australian parliament or the Australian people. The Prime Minister can exercise this power as part of the government's prerogative powers or through a cabinet decision. The absence of appropriate checks and balances on this decision-making power saw the Australian Prime Minister rapidly deploy troops to an illegal war in Iraq in 2003 without consulting the people's representatives in parliament. A lesson can and must be learned from this kind of mistake, which is more easily made when a handful of people take closed and secret decisions on behalf of a nation without due consultation or participation.


This bill would bring Australia into conformity with principles and practices utilised in other democracies like Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, where troop deployment is set down in constitutional or legislative provisions. Some form of parliamentary approval or consultation is also routinely undertaken in Austria, the Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. Even our ally the United States has a similar provision that subjects the decision to go to war to a broader forum—section 8 of the US Constitution quite clearly says, 'Congress shall have power to declare war'.


Arguments against utilising our democratic structures on the important issue of troop deployment made by governments include that it would be impractical, restrictive and inefficient. Such arguments, though, ignore the fact that parliaments can and do make complex and nuanced decisions, and rapidly when necessary. But, as we have seen, decisions about war and peace made in undue haste that do not enjoy the mandate of the population are not legitimate or acceptable, especially when they involve sending Australia's sons, daughters, fathers and mothers into battle.


There are appropriate exemptions made in this bill that do not interfere with the non-warlike overseas service with which Australian troops are engaged—and I refer the House to section 50C(11). There are also appropriate exemptions in the bill to provide for the practicalities of situations where parliament cannot immediately meet—and I refer the House to section 50C subsections 3 and 7, which provide for the Governor-General to be able to make a proclamation regarding the declaration of war, provided that parliament is then recalled within a period of two days.


The decision to deploy troops overseas into a war zone is always difficult, always dangerous and always important. Such a decision should always demand debate and scrutiny and should be one that Australian citizens can own and be engaged in. When we look at other states, and so-called security sector reform during post conflict restructuring phases, we require security forces to be retrained and, importantly, decision making to be restructured to conform to democratic principles. A core component of regaining public faith in an effective security sector is placing it under democratic control. One standard espoused by the international community is military forces coming under the general rules of parliamentary control—accountability and other procedures seen as important in establishing transparent and legitimate government.


It is time that Australia joined its closest allies and like-minded democratic states by involving the parliament in the decision to send troops into battle. Only by returning the power to deploy troops overseas to the most representative branch of government, by requiring both houses of parliament to agree, can sufficient debate and scrutiny exist for a decision to made democratically—for a decision to be as representative of the will of the Australian people as possible. I commend the bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-06-23,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (10:27):  I move:


That this House:


(1) expresses concern at the detention in Egypt of Australian citizen Peter Greste;


(2) notes that:


(a) Mr Greste is detained and currently on trial solely for conducting his role as a journalist and for peacefully expressing his opinion on events in Egypt; and


(b) the imprisonment of Peter Greste is contrary to the right to freedom of speech and expression;


(3) recognises that the Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General have all been in contact with their Egyptian counterparts seeking Peter Greste's release; and


(4) notes that the Australian Government:


(a) is offering all possible consular assistance to Peter Greste and his family;


(b) has been working with Egyptian authorities at all appropriate opportunities; and


(c) is making direct and high-level representation to a number of other governments as part of a multi-pronged strategy to raise our ongoing concerns about the case.


I commence by paying tribute to the Greste family: Lois and Juris Greste, and Peter's brothers, Andrew and Mike. In particular, my contact has been with Lois and Juris, who have been so dignified and stoic at what must be one of the worst times in any parent's life. I doubt I could be as unfaltering if I were in their place.


Peter Greste is an internationally acclaimed Australian journalist and correspondent. He has worked for Reuters, CNN, WTN and the BBC. From 1991 to 1995 he was based in London, Bosnia and South Africa. In 1995 he was based in Kabul, Afghanistan, where he was a correspondent for the BBC and Reuters, after which he was based in Belgrade, returned to London and then to Mexico, followed by Santiago. He returned to Afghanistan in 2001 to cover the start of the war. After Afghanistan he worked across the Middle East and Latin America. From 2004 he was based in Mombasa, Kenya, then Johannesburg, followed by Nairobi, where he has lived since 2009. In 2011 he won the Peabody Award for a documentary on Somalia. He is a correspondent for Al Jazeera in Africa.


So Peter truly is a citizen of the world, respected by everyone for his dedication, ability and professionalism. Communities across Australia and indeed the world who have been touched by Peter are now anxiously awaiting the verdict to be handed down later today our time. There are communities such as Indooroopilly High School, with over 50 nations represented in the student cohort and with social justice as one of their core values, so how appropriate that Peter was their school captain.


In moving this motion today, I also want to acknowledge the broad bipartisan support across the parliament—not only the seconder of the motion, the Honourable member for Berowra, Phillip Ruddock, who is also my predecessor as co-chair of Parliamentary Friends of Amnesty, but also my current fellow chairmen, the member for Scullin, Andrew Giles, the member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, and Senator Penny Wright.


It is appropriate that Parliamentary Friends of Amnesty take a keen interest in the Peter Greste trial. Amnesty International was founded in 1961 and is one of the largest and most active human rights organisations in the world. It is concerned strictly with prisoners and seeks the release of what they call 'prisoners of conscience'. Some of their guiding principles include a focus on the individual prisoner, all action being grounded on fact and the organisation being strictly impartial.


Being a journalist is not a crime. Telling the truth is not terrorism. The long-awaited verdict on Peter Greste is expected to be announced later tonight. The government remains hopeful that, when Mr Greste's trial is finalised, he will be acquitted on the charge of colluding with a terrorist organisation and released. Given the evidence presented by the prosecution, the foreign minister has stated that she would be highly concerned if Peter Greste is given a custodial sentence.


From the outset, the Australian government offered all possible assistance and Australian diplomats were allowed to be present for many of the hearings and interviews with Mr Greste. Peter was moved to Tora Prison on 1 January 2014. Conditions are basic and he was initially not allowed reading or writing material, nor to make contact with family and friends. However, consular officials visited Mr Greste on more than 22 occasions to date. Through consular representations officials obtained improvements in Mr Greste's prison conditions, including frequent consular visits, family visits, telephone calls to his parents in Australia, access to books and magazines, Arabic language textbooks, improved food rations and access to supplementary food items, and the installation of a fan in his cell.


Very shortly after his arrest, I met with his parents Lois and Juris, who had by that stage been in telephone contact with him. His parents had also been in direct contact with the foreign minister's office by that stage and were aware that Minister Bishop was offering all support and assistance that she and the government could provide. The government as a whole, and specifically the work of the foreign minister, the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, has consistently made clear its deep concern at the charges against Mr Greste. We are all aware that he was doing nothing more than performing journalistic activities at the time of his arrest on 29 December 2013.


With the inauguration of President el-Sisi on June 8, the government continued its program of high-level representation to the Egyptian government, urging that Mr Greste's trial be concluded promptly and that he be enabled to return home. The Prime Minister spoke to the then interim Egyptian President Mansour, and foreign minister Bishop and the Attorney-General have also had discussions with their Egyptian counterparts.


Mr Greste was charged with collaborating with the outlawed group, known as the Muslim Brotherhood, by:


1. their agreement and assistance to supply members of that group with funds, equipment, tools and information, in full knowledge of that group's aims;


2. possession of publication and recordings that include promoting their goals in order to inform others about them, in full knowledge of that group's aims;


3. broadcasting data, news, false rumours and untrue images, and presenting them to the public, inside and outside the country, with the aim of creating an impression amongst public opinion that the country is witnessing a civil war in order to weaken the state's image and standing, to harm the country's national interest, disrupt public security, spread panic among the populous and inflict damage on the public interest; and


4. possession of telecommunications, photographic and broadcasting equipment, and equipment to transmit sound and images, without a permit from the competent authority.


Anyone who knows Peter Greste is confident that he is innocent of all these charges. There have to date been 12 hearings in Mr Greste's trial, in the Cairo Criminal Court. Mr Greste has been denied bail at all hearings.


There have been many and continuing instances where our government has made representations to the Egyptian authorities. Prime Minister Abbott spoke by telephone to then interim President Mansour and he expressed appreciation for the President's letter to Mr Greste's parents and sought assistance from the President to bring about an early resolution of the case and Mr Greste's release. Minister Bishop has spoken with Egyptian ministers on many occasions. She has met with Egypt's Ambassador to Australia and raised Mr Greste's case. The Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, also telephoned the Egyptian justice minister about the case in April. Australia's Ambassador to Egypt, Dr Ralph King, met the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutor-General in January to seek advice on the basis of the investigation into the activities of Mr Greste. Dr King also met the Assistant Minister for Prison Affairs to seek improved prison conditions and he also met the President of the Court of Appeal to press for the ongoing provision of a translator for Mr Greste during court proceedings. As well as other high-level meetings, Lois and Juris, Peter's parents, wrote an open letter, to which the then-interim President and Chief Justice of Egypt, Mr Adly Mansour, replied that he would 'spare no effort to work towards the speedy resolution of the case'.


The case of Peter Greste is incredibly concerning. Free press is in every person's and every country's interests. As Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated:


A free press will help every country, including Egypt, to be better in the months and years ahead and obviously a free press is not compatible with harassing journalists going about their ordinary business.


The trial of Peter Greste has received notable international reaction. In January, US Secretary of State John Kerry said:


We have consistently expressed our serious concern about the limits on freedom of peaceful assembly and expression in Egypt, including leading up to the referendum, just as we expressed our concerns about the dangerous path Egypt's elected government has chosen in the year that led to 2013's turbulence. The United States again urges all sides to condemn and prevent violence and to move towards an inclusive political process based on the rule of law and respect for the fundamental freedoms of all Egyptians.


The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has also called for the release of Mr Greste. A spokesperson for the high commissioner said that the arrest was based on vague charges and was of great concern and had increased fears among the general media. In a White House press briefing in February, spokesman Jay Carney said that the detention was 'of deep concern to the administration,' and went on to say, 'We have strongly urged the Egyptian government to drop these charges.'


With the verdict being handed down today, I think I can speak for all Australians when I say that we are hopeful for a positive outcome and our hearts go out to his family during this tough time. Being a journalist is not a crime. Telling the truth is not terrorism. I commend the motion to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10:36):  Of course, the opposition strongly supports this motion. Peter Greste, an experienced Australian journalist, was arrested in Egypt, along with his two colleagues, in December last year charged with spreading false news and supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. Today, Peter Greste's family, his journalistic colleagues in Australia and around the world and many Australians are waiting anxiously for the verdict, which is expected this evening Australian time.


We support Peter Greste because he was simply doing his job, and his job is a job that is vital in a free society and in a democracy. Journalism is one of the most basic foundations of our democracy, and it is especially important at a time of turmoil and transition, such as Egypt has experienced in recent years. We greatly admire the strong support Peter Greste has been given by his family. His two brothers, Andrew and Mike, will be in court today, and his parents, Juris and Lois, have been giving amazing support to Peter. Other family members have been engaged in campaigning to make sure that Peter's case is before the public, and his friends have been very active on his behalf. At times like this, times of adversity, we know how important family can be. I am sure that Peter is immensely proud of the role that his parents and his brothers have played in stepping up to the challenge and campaigning so tirelessly on his behalf.


We applaud the support that Mr Greste and his colleagues from around the world have received from, for example, US Secretary of State, John Kerry, who has raised the importance of press freedom with President el-Sisi. Journalist organisations have also been very vocal in their support, and the member for Ryan has spoken about the role that Amnesty International have played. We commend the government, too, for its advocacy with the Egyptian government. I note that the Prime Minister has spoken recently, in the last 24 hours, to the newly elected Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and that the foreign minister has spoken in recent days to her counterpart. Of course, the foreign minister has spoken in the past to the foreign minister as well. We are very pleased to see that the level of consular support provided to Mr Greste in jail has been consistent and of a very high quality, and I congratulate the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who have been offering that consular support.


Peter Greste has been a journalist for 25 years. He says that he was inspired by Australian cameraman Neil Davis, who died while reporting a coup in Thailand in 1985. Mr Greste said it was Davis's biography that inspired him to become a foreign correspondent. I remember reading that biography as a young woman—a biography by Tim Bowden called One Crowded Hour. It took its title from a poem by Thomas Osbert Mordaunt. Davis loved that poem and he wrote it on the flyleaf of all of his work diaries: 'One crowded hour of glorious life is worth an age without a name.' Neil Davis displayed extraordinary courage during his life as a cameraman, and the biography goes with Davis through some of the war zones that he served in as a cameraman.


Davis—from memory—started his life in regional Tasmania, and Mr Greste began his career in regional Victoria before working in Adelaide and Darwin. His career as a foreign correspondent began in 1991. He has worked as a freelance reporter for Reuters TV, for CNN, for WTN and for the BBC. Peter Greste joined Al Jazeera English in 2005 to report on north Africa. He won a Peabody Award in 2011, as the member for Ryan said, for a documentary on Somalia, the focus of much of his work since he moved to Africa nine years ago. You get a strong sense of his commitment from the places that he has worked. As well as Africa, he has covered Afghanistan and Central Asia, the Balkans, Iraq and Latin America—certainly not the career choices you make if you are after an easy life.


Peter Greste is no stranger to danger. While working for the BBC in Somalia in 2005, he witnessed the death of his producer, Kate Peyton. Ms Peyton was shot in the back while they were both standing outside a hotel in Mogadishu. In an interview with the ABC, Mr Greste recalled the incident. He said:


… we both knew what we were getting into.


It was a risk we both judged to be worth taking, if only because so few reporters have been into Somalia in the past decade, and nobody can hope to make a considered judgment of either Africa or Islamic extremism without understanding why that country has remained so anarchic.


It was the same commitment to his job, to helping the world better understand important events, that took him to Egypt late last year. Ironically, Mr Greste thought that his assignment to Cairo had been quite routine. Again, that reminded me of Neil Davis's story. Neil Davis considered the coup that he went to cover in Thailand as quite a routine assignment. It was that assignment that saw him lose his life.


Peter Greste said in a blog he wrote from his prison cell that he had gone to Egypt to take the 'opportunity to get to know Egyptian politics a little better'. He wrote that his search for 'accuracy, fairness and balance' had led him to the banned Muslim Brotherhood. I quote him again:


How do you accurately and fairly report on Egypt's ongoing political struggle without talking to everyone involved?


He went on to say:


We had been doing exactly as any responsible, professional journalist would—recording and trying to make sense of the unfolding events with all the accuracy, fairness and balance that our imperfect trade demands.


The Peter Greste case is a reminder of the important role that journalists play in bringing news of conflict to the nation and to the world. And, sadly, it is also a reminder of the phenomenal risks that our foreign correspondents take in undertaking their work, just going about their day-to-day lives.


You can go back as far as Charles Bean, who was the official correspondent of World War I. He was the correspondent with the Australian Imperial Force troops. He beat Keith Murdoch to that job. He landed at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, a few hours after the first troops had landed. He stayed there for most of the campaign, and he lived in the same difficult conditions as our soldiers. You also do not have to go that far back in history to think of the Balibo five and Roger East, Australian-based journalists who died in East Timor in 1975, reporting on the Indonesian invasion.


Today we have correspondents in most of the most dangerous places on the world. Samantha Hawley has been covering the troubles in Bangkok recently. There is Terry Moran, in Kirkuk, and Matt Brown, a Middle East correspondent, who seems to fly into danger as other people fly out of it. There are so many examples of Australian journalists who have taken great risks for their craft, including Sally Sara in Iraq, Michael Weir and Paul McGeough. There is a group of Australian correspondents who risk their lives because they are chasing the story and because, I guess, journalism is in their blood, but much more importantly because they understand that for Australians to have a true sense of our place in the world, for us to truly understand both the risks and the opportunities that exist in the world, we have to have Australian voices with an Australian perspective of how we fit into the great events that are shaping history today. Peter Greste's work is in the same fine tradition.


We are fervently hoping for a good ending to this difficult chapter in Peter Greste's life and career. Our thoughts are with his family and friends, and his colleagues in Australia and around the world, who are today waiting with almost unbearable anticipation for the results of his legal proceedings. Our best wishes go to his parents and family.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2014-06-23,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra—Chief Government Whip) (10:46):  It is a privilege to be able to second this motion. I will not say it is an honour and I will not say it is a pleasure, but I commend the member for Ryan for proposing this motion and I commend the member for Ryan for her willingness to assume the leadership of the parliamentary Amnesty group. In moving this motion she spoke of the interest of that organisation and the members of it in supporting this resolution today.


I take the opportunity of saying that this is one of the finer moments of the parliament. That is because it is a measure in which there is a unanimity of view expressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I am sure it will be reflected in the further comments and observations that are made during the course of this debate. It is not always the case that we have that degree of unanimity of view, but when it does occur it says a great deal about our parliament, the institution and our willingness to put aside differences of view to try and achieve a worthwhile outcome on a matter of moment. This motion seeks to do just that.


It notes that Mr Peter Greste has been detained and is currently on trial. We know it is a very sensitive time in relation to that trial right now. Let me say a few matters about Egypt. I recognise that Egypt has faced very considerable challenges. I recognise that it is a country that has people of different religions and different cultures, and sometimes they do present management issues. I understand that. But I think those sorts of differences do need to be managed. We are a country that respects the rule of law and we do not seek to interfere in the exercise of judicial power. We want to see the rule of law operate in Egypt. We do not want to interfere with their justice system, but we want their justice system to be just and one that produces just outcomes.


We have been active, noting that we believe that Mr Greste has not been seeking to undermine Egypt and the rule of law in that country. We do think that there is an entitlement for people to be able to report on what is happening around the world. So I think it is important that the parliament notes that in this very sensitive matter—and it is a sensitive matter—the Australian government has been offering all possible consular assistance to Peter Greste and his family. The government has been working with Egyptian authorities and it is making direct and high-level representation.


The member for Ryan detailed those matters in very considerable detail. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been active in ensuring that our interest in one of our countrymen, who is being detained and dealt with within Egypt's judicial system, is a matter of concern to this nation and the people of this nation.


We do understand that terrorism is a difficult issue. We do understand that the law sometimes has to deal with those who seek to undermine institutions and important values that we see as being fundamental. But our response needs to be proportionate and appropriate in dealing with those threats. In speaking to this matter, I speak to encourage Egypt not only to protect its sovereignty and its people but to do so in a just way and to respect certain fundamental human rights and values, as it moves forward.

Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (10:51):  In congratulating the member for Ryan in initiating this motion, I do so not from the perspective of the normal niceties that are renowned in these debates but out of a genuine appreciation of her efforts. They are characterised not only by this particular instance but by her leadership within the Amnesty International Group and broader human rights issues in other nations. I do congratulate her. I recognise the efforts of Australia's public servants in pushing home this issue on behalf of the Greste family and on behalf of the Australian people in their concern about Peter Greste and his current predicament.


This matter has dragged on since December. Abdullah Al-Shamy, one of the other people detained from Al Jazeera, has been involved for a very long time in a hunger strike. I understand that that has finished in recent days and I am very glad. 


We have heard other speakers enunciate the role of this journalist, Peter Greste, around the world in so many difficult areas during conflict and in areas where human rights are suppressed. We know that he has received international awards, which indicate his professionalism. He has been employed by a significant number of first-rate international media outlets. The joint statement of the editors of the BBC, Reuters, ITN, Sky, NBC and ABC News—which can probably agree on very little else—of 21 February this year, noted:


… Peter Greste to be a fine, upstanding correspondent who has proved his impartiality over many years …


He writes—


that is, Peter, that when the Muslim Brotherhood was listed as a terrorist group:


… ""it knocked the middle ground out of the discourse. When the other side, political or otherwise, is a 'terrorist', there is no neutral way… So, even talking to them becomes an act of treason, let alone broadcasting their news, however benign.""


That was a predicament that he was in, as a professional journalist, in trying to convey to the rest of the world an understanding of what was occurring in Egypt.


I, along with the member for Berowra, have had the opportunity to attend many rallies in Sydney around concerns about the suppression of rights during the hegemony of the Morsi Muslim Brotherhood regime. We naively thought that we would never be involved in resolutions such as this, if they were to be replaced. But that is not the case. Obviously, there are also significant measures in the constitution of Egypt which would lead one to expect that these resolutions would not be necessary. Article 70 of the constitution affirms:


… freedom of the press, printing and paper, visual, audio and electronic publication is guaranteed.


Furthermore, article 71 notes:


It is prohibited to censor, confiscate, suspend or shut down Egyptian newspapers and media outlets in any way …


And further:


… no freedom-restricting penalty shall be imposed for publication or publicity crimes.


Given our belief that this Australian journalist has displayed commendable neutrality and impartiality and that his career has indicated that, it is of concern that he would face a sentence in this case of 15 to 25 years. This presents an unfortunate view to the world about what is prevailing in that country. It has been noted by the shadow foreign minister that Neil Davis was an inspiration to him. We know that he typifies the problems confronted by journalists; ironically, if he was in Thailand today Davis might be facing the same situation. 


I very much want to join with the other members of parliament who see the need for the world to recognise that there are proper judicial practices and people are given a fair trial. It was disturbing that at an early stage Mr Greste was given no writing materials and no visits from his family. Clearly, the world needs journalists out there to interact with different forces within any regime, to understand what is going on and appreciate the full nuances of problems and understand the culture. I am pleased to be part of this significant cross-parliamentary reaction in calling for his release.

Mr LAUNDY
 (Reid) (10:56):  I rise today to speak to this motion and to add my concern about the ongoing detention in Egypt of Australian citizen Peter Greste. Following on from the member for Werriwa, the member for Berowra and the member for Sydney, I too would like to commend the member for Ryan for putting this motion before the House. The member for Ryan and I share a love for human rights, as does everyone who has spoken on this motion—it is bipartisan, as the member for Werriwa said. I also note that I did not put my name down to talk on this motion, the member for Ryan did, and I wear that as a badge of honour. She rang me to tell me she had done that and I am absolutely thrilled to have the opportunity to talk on this issue today.


As we meet today, almost six months have passed since Mr Greste was arrested in Egypt on a range of charges stemming from his work as a journalist. I join with the foreign minister and others in expressing the hope that we will soon see a verdict handed down in Mr Greste's case that will acquit him of all charges and that, hopefully, he will be home soon. I note the sensitivity of this matter as the verdict is due today. I would like to commend the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the trade minister and the Attorney-General, who have been working tirelessly in expressing their concerns to the Egyptian government about the charges labelled against Mr Greste.


I am also aware that there have been a large number of diplomats, both Australian and otherwise, who have met to speak on this case and are working hard to provide assistance to Mr Greste and his family. It is my understanding and that of the Australian government that the charges against Mr Greste cover activities that would very much fall under the normal journalistic activity of a respected and award-winning foreign correspondent, which he is.


In my electorate of Reid we have a significant community of people from Middle Eastern and African backgrounds. I have followed closely, along with my constituents, the political unrest and turmoil across the region in recent years arising from the Arab Spring and the push for free and democratic societies in many countries, including in Egypt. It is obvious that there is a push, especially amongst the young people of the Middle East, for more open and free societies. The elections in Egypt last month were noted by the European Union observers as being held in a democratic and free environment. That is encouraging to hear and I congratulate President el-Sisi for his success. It is my hope that the recent elections will lead to a more stable environment in Egypt and a continued acceptance of the democratic values that the people of Egypt have been working towards in recent years.


It should be noted, however, that a core tenet of a free and democratic society has been and will always be freedom of the press—a free press that reports the facts independently and without fear or favour. As I am sure most of my colleagues in this parliament will agree, a free and independent press definitely works to keep members from all sides of politics accountable to the people they are elected to represent. But it also provides an essential service in a modern democratic country such as Australia, ensuring that the people are informed of all sides of the debate, no matter how politically inconvenient it may be. A free press is in everyone's interest, most notably the citizens of a country, but the benefits also extend to a country's regional and global partners, ensuring open and accountable political processes. As the Prime Minister stated this morning, independent media is 'good for democracy, good for stability, and good for security'.


Once again, I commend everyone who has been working to secure Peter's release. I note that as recently as this weekend the Prime Minister was speaking with President el-Sisi, and the foreign affairs minister spoke with her counterpart in Egypt to discuss the case. I would also like to mention the efforts of Peter's family, who have been working tirelessly over the last six months to support Peter as much as they can. It is written in my notes, 'I can only imagine,' but I cannot imagine the strength it has taken for the family to work through this period, and I hope their efforts are rewarded in today's verdict and that we have Peter Greste home as soon as possible. As the father of a 16-year-old who is currently in New York on a two-week trip and who is determined to become a journalist at some stage in his life, I reiterate: I cannot begin to imagine what Peter's family have gone through and continue to go through. I know that all my colleagues in this House will join with me when I say that they are in our thoughts and prayers. I hope things go well today.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (11:01):  I would first like to thank the member for Ryan for moving this important motion. I know that she has a personal connection with the Greste family and has followed this case very closely. Today, after nearly six months of imprisonment and 12 hearings, the Egyptian courts will hand down a verdict in the case of detained Australian journalist Peter Greste and his Al Jazeera English colleagues. For Peter, his family, his colleagues, his friends and his supporters, this has been six months of uncertainty and anxiety. Indeed, I think it has been six months of concern for all Australians.


Peter Greste and his two colleagues were detained by Egyptian authorities last December, charged with 'airing misleading news' about Egypt's political situation. If convicted, the three face between three years and life in prison, and the prosecution has been asking for a sentence of 15 years. This is obviously a very difficult time and also a very sensitive time. I hope, as many others do, that today Peter Greste and his colleagues are freed.


Peter Greste left Australia in 1991 to pursue his dream of becoming a foreign correspondent. Since then, he has covered Afghanistan and Central Asia, the Balkans, Iraq, Latin America and now Africa, where he has lived for the past nine years. In 2011, he won a prestigious Peabody Award for a documentary on Somalia, a place that has become a major focus of his work since moving to East Africa. His work highlights the important work that many of our foreign correspondents do, bringing the news around the world to us here in Australia. It is also an important reminder of how critical the freedom of the press is and, here in Australia, how lucky we actually are.


In the last 48 hours, I am aware that the Abbott government has stepped up its diplomatic efforts to have Peter released, with foreign affairs minister Bishop speaking directly to Egypt's newly elected foreign minister to convey Australia's desire for Peter to be allowed to return home as soon as possible. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General have all been in contact with their Egyptian counterparts seeking Peter Greste's release and I commend them on this. They are making representations at every level within the Egyptian government to ensure that Peter Greste is home as soon as possible. This matter has bipartisan support from both sides of the House. Certainly, the shadow minister for foreign affairs and Deputy Leader of the Opposition has also been making her comments in a very bipartisan manner, with one goal in mind. I am pleased that the Australian government is doing everything it can to support Peter and his family. I hope its efforts prove successful.


This, I can only imagine, would be an extremely difficult time for Peter and his family. Peter's brothers have been in Egypt for much of the last six months, following the trial and providing whatever support they can to Peter. I have great admiration for Peter's family, their strength and their perseverance.


This case has highlighted how important consular assistance is for Australians who find themselves in difficulty overseas. Many Australians seek help from the government each year, and consular assistance is so important and so vital in supporting Australians and their families when they are caught up in disasters or political turmoil abroad. The cases handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are often extremely complex and they do incredible work. Peter and his family have been in regular contact with the Australian consular officials, and our Australian officials in Cairo have been doing the very best they can. It is a good opportunity to commend our diplomats overseas on the work that they have done on this case and the support they have provided.


Today, my thoughts are with Peter and his family, and with his two Al Jazeera colleagues and their families. I know that everyone in the House—and, indeed, around Australia—is hoping for news this afternoon of Peter's release and his safe return home to his family. I commend this motion. I commend the member for Ryan for bringing it to the House. I have so much hope for good news later on this afternoon.

"Tehan, Dan, MP",LP,2014-06-23,"



Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (11:06):  It is indeed a privilege to get up here, support this motion and follow on from all the previous speakers, who have also spoken so eloquently on this private member's business. It is worth reminding the House what this motion is about. It asks:


That this House:


(1) expresses concern at the detention in Egypt of Australian citizen Peter Greste;


(2) notes that:


(a) Mr Greste is detained and currently on trial solely for conducting his role as a journalist and for peacefully expressing his opinion on events in Egypt; and


(b) the imprisonment of Peter Greste is contrary to the right to freedom of speech and expression;


(3) recognises that the Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney-General have all been in contact with their Egyptian counterparts seeking Peter Greste's release; and


(4) notes that the Australian Government:


(a) is offering all possible consular assistance to Peter Greste and his family;


(b) has been working with Egyptian authorities at all appropriate opportunities; and


(c) is making direct and high-level representation to a number of other governments as part of a multi-pronged strategy to raise our ongoing concerns about the case.


Representations have been made by the Australian government on behalf of Peter Greste, and I commend the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, for the job that she has done in advocating for the release of Peter Greste. She has obviously made contact with the new Egyptian foreign minister, but she was also very active in making contact with the previous interim administration. The Prime Minister also has, obviously, over the weekend spoken with Egypt's new President. In a very good development over the weekend, we also saw the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, make a special trip to Cairo. In a very important move, I thought, from a US Secretary of State, he highlighted to the Egyptians in a press conference the need for the Egyptians to uphold press freedom.


This motion here today goes to that very fundamental principle: the importance of upholding press freedom. Our Prime Minister has led the way in highlighting this importance when he said:



… I do want to make this point and make it very strongly: a free press is in everyone's interests.


The Prime Minister also went on to say, this morning or yesterday in a press conference on this matter, that, in his view—and this is a point that he made to the Egyptians—Peter Greste was reporting on, not supporting, the Muslim Brotherhood when he did his reporting. We in the House should always remember the importance of the press in the job that we do. As Thomas Jefferson, the third US President, put it so succinctly:


Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.


I think that sums up this debate extremely well.


Freedom of the press is integral to democratic government. It goes to the core of having a proper functioning democracy. It is the surest way of maintaining trust between a government and its people. Without a strong press, no government can be adequately scrutinised or held to account, and if a government cannot be scrutinised or held to account, the people that put it there will never have true confidence in that government.


This motion here today, which I support, calls for the release of Peter Greste. It is an important motion because it not only highlights what is happening to an Australian citizen in Egypt at the moment but reminds us all of the broader principle here—the fundamental role that the press plays in ensuring that we can have proper, functioning democracies.

Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (11:11):  I also rise in a spirit of bipartisanship to speak in support of the motion moved by the member for Ryan, and join in her expression of deep concern over the detention of Australian Peter Greste in Egypt. I would also like to join the member for Ryan in noting the work done by this government and the continued consular support offered to Mr Greste in seeking his release. I hope that all of the work done will, indeed, secure Mr Greste's freedom.


After six long months in detention and over 12 court hearings, Australian Peter Greste, along with his colleagues, will later today know of their fate when a verdict is handed down by an Egyptian court. Today I join with other members in suggesting that nothing but Greste's being released and returned home safely will be acceptable.


Al Jazeera journalist Peter Greste was arrested on 29 December 2013 with his two colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed when their Cairo hotel room was raided. Egyptian prosecutors have demanded the maximum penalty—ranging from 15 to 25 years in jail—for all 20 defendants in the trial of Al Jazeera journalists accused of aiding the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood. The prosecution has charged the 16 Egyptian defendants with joining the Muslim Brotherhood, designated as a terrorist group. The four foreign defendants in the case, including Greste, are charged with spreading false news, collaborating and assisting the Egyptian defendants in their crimes by providing media material, editing it and publishing it on the internet at Al Jazeera. In light of the looming verdict to be handed down by the court at some point today, I join other members in calling for Greste and his colleagues to be released.


Peter Greste has had an amazing career in journalism which we can all be proud of. We all hope for his speedy release from detention into freedom so that he can continue the work that he has excelled in for so long. Greste launched his journalism career in regional Victoria before gaining further experience in Adelaide in Darwin. He left Australia in 1991 to pursue his dream of becoming a foreign correspondent, working as a freelancer for Reuters TV, CNN, WTN and the BBC.


Peter Greste has shown much courage in working in some of the world's most dangerous places to ensure the rest of the world can have insight into the hardship of some of the world's most vulnerable people. Greste worked for the BBC as Kabul correspondent in 1995, covering the emergence of the Taliban. After the 11 September attacks in 2001, he returned to Afghanistan to cover the war before continuing his work across the Middle East, Central Asia and Latin America. In 2004 Greste relocated to Mombasa in Kenya, where he worked as a freelance journalist and photographer.


On assignment for the BBC in 2005, Greste witnessed the death of his producer, Kate Peyton, who was shot in the back while they were both standing outside a hotel in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.


He returned to Somalia in 2011 to film a BBC documentary about life in the war ravaged nation, which won a prestigious Peabody Award. For the past nine years he has worked as a correspondent for Al Jazeera in Africa. As you have heard, he is an internationally renowned and respected journalist. The outpouring of support that has occurred on his behalf from respected media outlets throughout the world has been there for all to see.


There is no doubt that Egypt faces a number of challenges at the moment in terms of its move into democracy. And there is no doubt that those challenges are for the Egyptian people and the Egyptian authorities to deal with. There is also no doubt that respect for the rule of law in our dealings with countries other than our own is paramount. But, as other speakers have also mentioned, freedom of the press is an essential part of a society that is free. And freedom of the press produces, within itself, difficulties for the societies in which it is pursued.


There are plenty of times when I have criticised journalists in this country and, sometimes, overseas. There have been plenty of times when I have wondered about the way individual journalists and, sometimes, media organisations have undertaken their journalism. However, there is no doubt that the principles underlying freedom of the press are essential. And there is no doubt that trying to report the truth—and ensuring that it is widely reported—in environments such as those in the Middle East, is extremely difficult. I join with others in this chamber, in this community, within the government and throughout the world, to call on the Egyptian authorities to consider these issues with mercy and compassion and to ensure that journalists such as Peter Greste get a fair trial. I hope that Peter Greste and his colleagues will soon be released and I show great respect to their families for the suffering and pressure that they are currently facing.

That this bill be now read a second time.


The Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) Amendment (Carbon Tax Repeal) Bill 2013 is one of two bills to repeal the equivalent carbon tax on synthetic greenhouse gases.


These bills are part of the broader legislative package to abolish the carbon tax. This bill amends the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas (Import Levy) Act 1995 so that importers of synthetic greenhouse gases and products containing those gases will not incur a liability to pay the equivalent carbon tax for synthetic greenhouse gas and equipment imported after 1 July 2014. This will reduce costs for businesses using these gases, including for refrigeration and air conditioning.

  The difference is that under this government it will be sustainable. Under members opposite it was not sustainable. Just to give you a couple of examples, a single-income household with a child with $30,000 in private income will continue to receive some $18,000 from the taxpayer under this government if the child is under six. A similar household earning $90,000 will continue to receive some $6,000 from the taxpayer. This is a government which appreciates that families are doing it tough and, if members opposite are fair dinkum about doing the right thing by the families of Australia, repeal the carbon tax and do it now.

The SPEAKER:  The member for Charlton is warned!




Mr ABBOTT:
  and for workers in businesses right around Australia is to try to ensure that those businesses remain profitable, because if you cannot make a profit you cannot survive and if you do not survive there is no employment and there are no workers. This government gets it in a way that members opposite never did. You cannot have strong communities without a strong economy to sustain them and you cannot have a strong economy without profitable private businesses. We get that; members opposite do not. That is why they loaded up private businesses with the carbon tax, with the mining tax, with endless regulations—




Mr Shorten:
  Madam Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. I just ask the Prime Minister: you're happy to use workers for your hi-vis photo props—



The SPEAKER:  There is no point of order.




Mr Shorten:
  why don't you tell them the truth?



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition it is not a point of order merely to try and repeat a question. The Prime Minister has the call. 




Mr ABBOTT:
  The point I am making is that the best thing that we can do for the workers of Australia is to try to ensure that their businesses can flourish, because if the businesses can flourish the workers can continue to be employed and can enjoy the higher wages that everyone wants to see workers in this country earn. More profitable businesses are more productive businesses; more productive businesses have higher paid workers. We get that; members opposite do not. That is why they loaded up the businesses of Australia with the mining tax, with the carbon tax, with more regulation and green tape. We want to see all of those go.


The Leader of the Opposition asked me about workers earning $50,000. Let me explain for the Leader of the Opposition's benefit that, under the budget that this government has brought down, if you are a sole parent, with one child aged under six, earning $50,000 in 2016-17 you will receive $11,705 in social security support.


The difference between this government and members opposite is that we support the businesses employing the workers and we want the social security system to be sustainable for the long run. We understand, in a way that members opposite do not, that you cannot continue to pay money that you haven't got. You cannot continue to saddle up future generations with ever-expanding debt to pay for today's consumption. You cannot do that. Members opposite should really wake up to themselves. We have explained how we will sort out Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Members opposite need to do the same.

 (Isaacs—Deputy Manager of Opposition Business) (15:25):  As I as saying before question time, there is a need to cut through this government's empty rhetoric about supposed red tape and deregulation and to look always at what is actually proposed. In that regard, the inaugural Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, the eminent Australian lawyer Bret Walker QC in his final report, tabled last week, cut through the government's rhetoric with a few pithy statements about the proposal to abolish his office and the legislation which created his office. He said there was no prior consultation with the INSLM before it was announced that repeal of the INSLM Act would be sought by the government as part of the reduction of red tape. Mr Walker went on to say:


The proposed repeal of the INSLM Act has been explained as ""designed to reduce bureaucracy and streamline government"" by removing ""duplication of responsibilities and between different levels of Government"".


Mr Walker said:


The INSLM is not aware of any other officer, agency or ""level"" of government doing what Parliament required to be done by the INSLM Act enacted in 2010.


To finish: in case it were not clear, the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor as almost his last act in office had this to say about the government's supposed 'bonfire of red tape':


Given the enacted purposes of the office of INSLM, I dissent from its description as red tape.


It is important to distinguish between the kind of pretence and charade that this government has been engaging in with its supposed bonfire of regulation and real regulatory reform. Unlike the government's false bonfire of regulations, unlike the government's proposal to abolish the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, this Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Bill 2014 is real regulatory reform. It is almost identical to the bill which the Labor government introduced in 2012, and the present federal opposition supports it.

 (McPherson) (18:52):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present report 4 of 2014, Referrals made March 2014, AIR 9000 Phase 5C Replacement Chinook Facilities Project, Townsville, Queensland; and Defence Terrestrial Communications Network Facilities and Infrastructure Project. I seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.


Leave granted. 




Mrs ANDREWS:
  On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the committee's fourth report of 2014, addressing referrals made in March 2014. This report deals with two referrals, both from the Department of Defence, with a total estimated cost of $185.9 million. 


The first referral was for the AIR 9000 Phase 5C Replacement Chinook Facilities Project in Townsville, Queensland. The project cost is $54.8 million. The Replacement Chinook Facilities Project proposes to provide new and upgraded facilities for the 5th Aviation Regiment RAAF Base Townsville to support the introduction and operations of the new helicopters and associated integration systems. 


The facilities proposed include those directly associated with the storage, security and maintenance of the new helicopters as well as facilities for the indirect capability requirements, such as working accommodation, training needs and infrastructure engineering services works. The project will enhance the Army's Land Force and Aviation capability by improving efficiencies in the delivery of the capability through the position of either new or expanded and modified facilities. The committee conducted an inspection, public hearing and in camera hearing, on the project, in Townsville. Consequently, it is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that the project proceed.


The second inquiry in this report is Defence's Joint Project 2047 Phase 3 Defence Terrestrial Communications Network Facilities and Infrastructure project, referred to as JP2047. The project cost is $131.1 million. The purpose of JP2047 is to upgrade, replace, standardise and rationalise the information and communications technology facilities and communications infrastructure. Work will be carried out at 282 geographically dispersed Defence owned and leased sites within Australia, in all states and territories. The project will transform the Defence Terrestrial Communications Network, once completed in June 2016.


The committee received a private briefing, followed by a public and a private hearing on the project, from representatives of the Department of Defence, Point Project Management and Telstra Corporation, in Canberra. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit, in terms of need, scope and cost, and recommends that the project proceed. I would like to thank members and senators for their work in relation to these inquiries and I also thank the secretariat for their ongoing support to the public works committee. I commend the report to the House.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (18:55):  I rise today to strongly support this legislation. It delivers on our election commitment to provide interest-free loans of up to $20,000 to young Australians completing apprenticeships. This is a common-sense measure that will help more young people complete their apprenticeships and, along with other measures our government is introducing, will begin to address Australia's skills shortage.


Vocational education and training is important to building Australia. The prosperity of this nation and our communities does not rest just in the hands of university graduates and office workers but also in the hands of the craftsmen, labourers, builders and artisans of our country. We want young people to have confidence so that when they start to learn the tools of trade they can see those skills put into use through a long career. 


This is our ambition, yet we are up against worrying trends. About 20 per cent of apprentices drop out of their first year, with 30 per cent not making it to the end of their second year. Only about 50 per cent of apprentices make it to the end of their training. This is a lost opportunity for industry and a lost opportunity for individuals. The obvious solution, for stopping this trend and skills shortage, is to make it easier for Australian apprentices to train and get skilled up. This bill today provides that first step in creating a VET system that supports apprentices and trainees on the road to a great career. 


The Trade Support Loans provide loans of up to $20,000 for apprentices to help them complete their training, which will be paid monthly in arrears and repaid by the apprentices in a similar fashion to HELP. With the passage of this legislation, apprentices will be able to opt into the loan from 1 July 2014, in line with the year of their apprenticeship. For instance, a second-year apprentice will be eligible for the second-, third- and fourth-year payments, if they wish to receive them. The value of the concessional no-interest nature of the loan is expected to be worth between $8½ thousand and $10,000 on average during the life of a loan, which is substantially more than apprentices received under the previous government's $5½ thousand Tools For Your Trade handout.


Others in this debate have spoken about the anecdotal evidence that the money from the previous Tools For Your Trade handout was spent on a variety of personal things rather than on equipment or costs associated with study. I have heard those opposite say that there is no evidence to support the misuse of Tools For Your Trade. That is not true. We in the government understand the VET sector, and we understand its current limitations. The minister has been very proactive and has actively sought the views of the sector on a wide range of issues.


I have been involved in several of the VET reform workshops held around this country and have had first-hand advice, from those in the sector, about the way Tools For Your Trade has been used. The common view is that the cash is not just used for tools but is used for other lifestyle type purchases, if I can call them that—such as surfboards, PlayStations and holidays. This anecdotal evidence also comes directly from the Apprenticeships Centres. So the misuse of the Tools For Your Trade handouts should be seen as a fault of the system. It is effectively a system that has been set up for use by apprentices to support whatever it is they want, not necessarily for use to support the tools they need for their trades. Many employers were having to buy tools for their apprentices to use, while the Tools For Your Trade handouts were being used on anything the apprentices wanted.


We see this as a fault of the system, and it is one we are fixing. While the new trade support loans will not come with any provision on how the money is spent, the fact that it is repayable ought to ensure that young people who choose to take part in this scheme take the support more seriously than they were likely to when the money was just a cash bonus given to them. 


Further, the apprentices must opt in to the loan every six months, so the debt does not just accrue without notice. Under this scheme, loan recipients are not just given a blank cheque with no accountability. They must take charge of this decision, and, hopefully, the added responsibility that comes with accepting this payment will give apprentices the incentive to place the funds towards costs associated with their training. This six month opt-in period means that, if their needs change, they can then opt out of their loan whenever they wish and will only have to pay back what they have borrowed—and only when their income reaches around $50,000. However, the loan will be reduced by 20 per cent—which is possibly up to $4,000—when the apprenticeship is completed, providing a massive incentive for apprentices to stick with their training.


The eligibility criteria to receive a trade support loan will be the same as under the Tools For Your Trade loan scheme, meaning that any apprenticeship or traineeship for an occupation on the National Skills Needs List or in the agriculture and horticulture sectors will provide eligibility for the loan. This is a timely change, especially following the Fair Work Commission's decision to increase apprentice wages, with some employers providing tools for their apprentices and most awards including a tool allowance.


I am very pleased to support this legislation. As I conclude, I want to let the almost 2,500 apprentices currently training in my electorate know that this government is serious about fixing the skills shortage, reforming the VET sector and providing them the opportunity to get ahead in their career of choice. This bill is merely one step down the road and I look forward to great reforms still to come. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (19:01):  Doesn't the Abbott government love debt! Here we have another case of it: providing access to debt to young people. We have seen it for university students—raising fees massively and then increasing interest rates, creating debt as far as the eye can see for people graduating from university—and now we see it with these training loans of up to $20,000 for people as young as 16 who are still at high school.


A country's resilience depends on the household balance sheets as much as it depends on the government's, and we see here a government that is prepared to see our young people start their lives with rising debt levels. It is an extraordinary contribution to the future of this nation by a government that claims that debt is bad, but not if they can give it to someone else. It is also worth commenting on the decision by this government to go down this path. The excuse they used in raising fees for universities and introducing these $20,000 loans for trade apprentices is that they need to address the country's deficit. Yet, if you compare the budget outlook through the forward estimates to PEFO—the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook—that is prepared under the Charter of Budget Honesty which Peter Costello introduced, you can see that they have not managed to reduce the debt at all. In fact, the deficit is slightly larger, and we come back to surplus, on their projections, some two years later. So on the one hand they have actually increased the debt relative to the pre-election fiscal outlook, and on the other hand they are also raising debt levels for young people who are starting out in their first years as adults.


One has to wonder how much consulting they did on this to come to the conclusion that providing a $20,000 loan rather than an upfront payment to provide tools would increase the completion rates. We hear from members opposite that one of the problems is that one in two apprentices are not finishing their apprenticeship, and this providing of a loan rather than the Tools For Your Trade payment will somehow increase that completion rate. I wonder, though, how it would have any impact at all if an apprentice is actually put off by their employer—if the employer stands them down and they are no longer in their apprenticeship. How does having a loan help that apprentice complete their apprenticeship?


They say that one of the reasons they are doing this is that apprentices have been out buying mag wheels and going on holidays with their Tools For Your Trade Payment. Where is the evidence that providing a loan will not have that result? Assuming that young apprentices do actually buy mag wheels—and I know many who do not do that—how does providing a loan change the behaviour at all? I would love to see the research for that. If, even in the first few months, an apprentice decides that the apprenticeship is simply not for them—if maybe they cannot physically do it, or they thought it was one thing and it is not—how will providing loans keep that person in the apprenticeship? And should it keep that person in the apprenticeship?


I always love this government's maths, and their maths tends to bring them down every time. One of the claims that they make on the government's side is that, by providing a 20 per cent discount on that $20,000 loan at the end of the apprenticeship, apprentices will be incentivised to complete the apprenticeship. But, again, if you look at the figures—and I doubt that the government actually has—43.9 per cent of apprentices in the trade area actually drop out in the first two years, and another five per cent drop out in the third year. In the fourth year, the percentage is very small. But 43.9 per cent drop out in the first and second years, and, by my very quick calculations, if you are taking out the loan at the rate that you are allowed—which is $8,000 in the first year and $6,000 in the second year—it is actually cheaper to drop out at the end of your second year than it is to complete the apprenticeship and get your 20 per cent discount. So if you decide that the apprenticeship is not for you, not only would you need to waste another two years to get your 20 per cent discount, but also your loan would be bigger at the end of that time, not smaller. The financially sensible thing to do under this arrangement is to drop out in those first two years if that is what you choose to do. It simply does not make sense.


In the construction sector, the figures are even more stark. Forty-eight per cent of apprentices drop out by the end of the second year and 51.8 per cent drop out at the end of the third year, and that is pretty much where it sits by the end of the fourth year. So, again, for that 48 per cent of people who drop out by the end of the second year, their cheapest option is to do exactly what they are doing. If they finish their apprenticeship and stay there for another two or 2½ years, their debt will be bigger even with the 20 per cent discount than it would be if they drop out. On the figures alone, this is not a rational decision and certainly will not achieve what the government expects it to achieve. What it will do is leave a large number of young people who decide that the apprenticeship is not for them, who lose their apprenticeship because the employer puts them off or who find that physically they just cannot do it with debt which will hinder their ability to start their lives on a firm financial basis.


One of the other issues that we raise a lot on this side of the House is the misinformation that the now government gave out when in opposition. Prior to the 2013 election Tony Abbott announced the trade support loans but did not announce that they were going to scrap Labor's $1 billion Tools For Your Trade apprentice program, which gave $5½ thousand per apprentice to help with buying tools. This now means that, as of 1 July, apprentices who enter their apprenticeship on one basis, who were planning on using a payment later on this year to pay for tools and who may already have entered into a payment plan to do that, will suddenly find that payment not forthcoming. It is usual when governments make changes like this to recognise that people have quite often made decisions based on one policy and to ease the change so that those rational decisions that people made can be followed through to their logical conclusion. But again, before the election, Tony Abbott did not tell apprentices that as of 1 July they would lose up to $3,700 for a first-year apprentice, and first-year apprentices are expecting that payment very shortly. Being young people, they may already be depending on that.


The new program—the trade support loans—are not lump sum payments. They are not payments that are designed to help young apprentices with those lumpy payments they have to make when they buy their tools. They are not designed for an apprentice who, for example, may need to buy a second-hand ute to get to a site. They are not the lumpy payments that an apprentice chef would have to make when they buy their knives. Those knives, by the way, if you have never bought a chef's knife, are incredibly expensive. They are in the hundreds of dollars per knife—incredibly expensive gear. You will find the same for carpenters if they are buying good tools. You will find the same for many apprentices. There can be very expensive, lumpy payments that come along in the early years of an apprenticeship because they have to buy tools.


These payments are actually designed as if they are income support payments: paid monthly in arrears. Again we hear members of the opposition saying that young people can save up those payments to buy their tools, but again we are talking about very young people here—people as young as 16, still in school, 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds—with not a lot of life experience or experience in managing income. In fact, this might be their first income, and they are being asked to manage saving up payments in order to buy quite expensive tools. It is really quite challenging for many young people who may be entering the workforce for the first time and receiving the first payments and who will find themselves in quite severe financial difficulties because of the low payments, particularly in the first and second year. These are young people whose wages will be very low in the first and second years—particularly the first year—because their skills are not of great use to the business employing them, and so their wages are very low in the first year. Asking a young person to manage saving up these monthly payments when they are in really quite serious financial difficulty in order to buy tools is a very big ask. It is difficult to see how this system of monthly payments will stop apprentices from spending their money on things other than tools. It may not make it easier for the odd apprentice who, as the opposition keeps saying, wants to go off and buy mag wheels, but we will probably see apprentices spending it on rent, food and all the other things they need and still not being able to buy their tools at the end of the day.


We on this side of the House will not oppose the bill. An optional loan is the government's policy and was the policy before the election—one of the few policies that they are actually following through on—but we do not believe it should be at the expense of the Tools For Your Trade scheme. We also believe that, if a loans scheme is in place, there should be appropriate advice requirements in place to ensure informed and voluntary decisions by apprentices, some of whom, as I have said, are school based apprentices as young as 16 years of age. One could come to the conclusion, for example, that a 16-year-old perhaps should have their parents' permission before entering into a loan of $8,000 in the first year. A 16-year-old is very young to be making that decision.


The bill has been referred to the Senate Economics Committee to examine the payment mechanisms, the payment of monthly instalments of the loan amount and the loan terms and conditions into the future and to consider what protection young people, particularly those under the age of 18, should have in terms of general loan advice and parental approval. These are incredibly important aspects that should really have been considered prior to this policy announcement. The level of consultation on this has been quite poor, and it shows in the poor design of the program.


Another issue of real concern to this side of the House is the government's confirmation that they are looking to outsource debt management for trade support loans. Again, placing young people who have entered into debt of up to $20,000 at a time in their lives when they are not high income earners and may not be for quite some time in the hands of private debt collectors is a worry. We do not think it is a good idea at all, but we are waiting to see what the conditions of such a thing would be. We are waiting to see how a government would regulate to ensure protection of 16-year-olds from private debt collectors.


Again, these are not people who have experience in earning a living, they are not people who have experience in handling their own money—they are learning their way through that. By the time they graduate as an apprentice they would have been through four years at least on very, very low wages. They will have, on this program, at least $20,000 in debt and they will then be, of course, going through the process of trying to find the best place to work in a sector that is increasingly contracted out and really quite volatile. We all know that construction, for example, is one of the first areas in the economy that starts to slow down. If things get bad we will probably find apprentices with their $20,000 of loan who have managed to pass the income threshold and are beginning to pay off those debts who find themselves in and out of the workforce quite frequently in their early lives and eventually have to work as contractors in order to make a living—again, with volatile incomes which make it even harder to manage regular loan payments and potentially with private debt managers on their backs.


There are a lot of aspects of this bill that are very worrying. I go back to the initial point: this is a government that claims that debt is bad but is very, very happy to saddle very young people with debt at this level at the very early stages of their adult life. I would ask government members to seriously consult on this and see if they can find ways around some of the issues that I have raised.

Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (19:16):  I rise today to speak on a piece of legislation that will provide the framework for the delivery of new jobs for Australian workers and for Australia's investment in the highly skilled future workforce. To do this, the Abbott government is implementing key policy measures, including the Trades Support Loans Bill 2014, which is before the House today. This is a program that directly invests in our apprentices by providing the support they need to complete their training.


One of Australia's key focuses is on ensuring our future generations are provided with a highly competitive and internationally recognised education. However, not all forms of education and training are facilitated in the classroom or at a university level. The Abbott government recognises this distinction and the need to invest in education not just for university students but for those whose employment future lies in a trade, such as carpentry or as a diesel motor mechanic—two trades that are currently listed on Australia's National Skills Needs List.


The establishment of the Trade Support Loans program was a key election commitment by the Abbott government. The Trade Support Loans program is a $1.9 billion investment by this government to support our apprentices financially, with the overall aim being to help increase training completion rates, which are currently a serious concern for Australia's future workforce, particularly in regional Australia. In fact, 20 per cent of trade apprentices drop out by the end of their first year and around 30 per cent by the end of the second year. Research has highlighted that a key reason for this high rate of dropouts is the associated wage in the early years of an apprenticeship. 


The Trade Support Loans program is one measure that this government is introducing to help ease this financial burden, increase the rate of trade completions and to ensure that Australia has a highly skilled workforce in the future. From 1 July, apprentices will have the opportunity to apply for loans of up to $20,000, which will be repayable once apprentices are earning a sustainable income. Let us be clear: in the first year an apprentice can have $8,000 to support themselves, $6,000 in their second year, $4,000 in their third year, and $2,000 in their fourth year. Repayments will function in the same manner as Australia's FEE-HELP loans, which are received by university students. They will be repaid through our taxation system at the same income thresholds as higher education loans. Loans will be indexed annually in line with CPI and, as we know, when a loan is subject to CPI this simply means that it is adjusted based on the cost of living.


The program has also been set up with a significant incentive for apprentices to complete their trade, with a 20 per cent reduction in the amount of the loan they have accumulated throughout their apprenticeship once they complete their training. This program will effectively replace Labor's Tools For Your Trade payment, which had become an unaccountable handout under the former government.


In Durack, one group who make a significant contribution to the electorate by helping to increase the amount of people who complete their traineeships in industries such as engineering, mining, automotive, tourism and agriculture and horticulture is Kimberley Group Training. KGT achieves this by helping to establish career pathways through training, sustainable employment opportunities and support services under the stewardship of CEO John Gummery and board chair Peter Stubbs. I was very pleased to recently join with the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Nigel Scullion, in announcing funding of $187,000 for this organisation under the government's Indigenous Employment Program to support Indigenous job seekers in the Kimberley to gain trade and traineeship qualifications. Despite organisations like KGT, in Western Australia there was an overall decrease in the number of apprenticeship completions in 2012-13 of approximately six per cent, while there was also a decrease in the number of apprenticeship commencements across all regions of WA of approximately 12 per cent. However, completions in building and construction in rural WA did increase by approximately 28 per cent in 2012-13. But the same cannot be said for most other trade sectors, which saw stagnant or lower completion rates during this same period. The Trade Support Loans program is a key policy initiative by the Abbott government that focuses on improving these completion rates.


If we want a strong, highly skilled workforce for the future, especially in Durack, then we need to act now to create it. Supporting our apprentices when they need it most is how this will be achieved and should be supported by all. I commend this bill to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (19:21):  I rise to speak on the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014 and the Trade Support Loans (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2014. This bill establishes the Trade Support Loans program for Australian apprentices. These loans will be concessional and income contingent, with a lifetime limit of $20,000 indexed from 2017. The loans are repayable when the person's income reaches the Higher Education Loan Program—that is, HELP—repayment threshold. The bill allows for a 20 per cent discount to be applied for the loan incurred when an Australian apprentice completes their apprenticeship.


The opposition will be supporting this legislation, but there still remain a number of concerns in relation to its position as far as apprentices are concerned. This government has a record of saying one thing before an election and another thing after the election. Prior to the 2013 election, Tony Abbott announced the Trade Support Loans. He did not tell apprentices that the government was going to scrap Labor's $1 billion Tools For Your Trade Payment, which is $5,500 per apprentice. I think this was a mean and tricky trick. This is the government only telling part of the truth: 'Yes, we'll give you a loan, but, no, we're not going to pay for the tools of trade.' It is an absolute disgrace that this government says one thing before an election and another thing after the election and tries to trick the Australian people by using words with double meanings and framing all of its comments in a way that can mislead people.


I am really appalled at what this government has done in so many areas. Like many members in this parliament, I have been contacted by a number of apprentices, and even by employers who are committed to employing apprentices. They can see that this legislation is going to cause some hardship and leave young people with debts into the future. I think about one of the employers not far from my electorate, Heather, who has a hairdressing salon, Feathers. She has been employing apprentices for well over 20 years. She is totally committed to employing apprentices. She has two apprentices at the moment. One is a school-based apprentice. With no access to Tools For Your Trade Payments, this legislation forces school based apprentices—and the apprentices that Heather employs—to borrow money to buy the scissors, hair dryers and all the other equipment that hairdressers need. It forces young people into a situation where they will incur debt. I want to put on the record my thanks to Heather from Feathers for the great job that she has done and the commitment that she has made to apprentices. She is a model for employers throughout this country for the fact that she understands that, at one time, there was a hairdresser employer that gave her the opportunity to undertake her apprenticeship. She took that opportunity and is now providing that opportunity to young people in the electorate I represent. I encourage more employers throughout Australia to do what Heather does and to take on apprentices.


In doing so, I have to say that I am very disappointed with the government—particularly with the minister, when he said that young people were using the money that they received from the Tools For Your Trade Payments to buy mag wheels for their cars and to get tattoos. I was listening to the debate a little earlier today and heard one of the previous speakers in the debate saying that apprentices can borrow the money that will be available through the Trade Support Loans Bill to buy a car. On one hand, you had a situation where apprentices were getting money to purchase their tools of trade, and now they are going to be forced into a situation where they must borrow the money to access those tools of trade. To be quite frank, I do not think it is good to force young people into a position where they need to access loans to be able to purchase tools and equipment. It really puts them in a position where they are incurring a huge cost right at the beginning of their working life.


The provision of the optional loan is not opposed by us on this side of the House, but it should not have come at the expense of the tools of trade scheme. The two schemes should run together. Unfortunately, the Abbott government is showing its real commitment to apprentices by axing the tools of trade scheme, the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program, and another scheme that I am particularly supportive of, and have been over a number of years: the Australian Apprenticeships Mentoring Program. That program works to help those young people who are undertaking an apprenticeship and who may be struggling, for either financial or social reasons. They might be struggling with one aspect of their apprenticeship, and that mentoring service program allows them to get the support that they need to get through their apprenticeship. I have spoken to apprenticeship organisations, and they have told me just how important that scheme is and how so many of their apprentices have benefited from the scheme. This government is cutting those programs that have helped so many young people when they have been undertaking their apprenticeships. There are a number of issues that I don't think are very clear at this stage: the government hasn't been very clear about the financial considerations, which are a major barrier for apprentices taking up training or completing it; and the measures will have little impact on the skills shortage.


In Australia we have had a chronic skills shortage for a number of years. When Labor was in power, we addressed this shortage by putting in place a number of programs that helped young people take up apprenticeships and by targeting areas where we needed apprentices. Unfortunately, this legislation will do very little to attract young people to undertake apprenticeships. 


In the Hunter and Newcastle, many young people have undertaken apprenticeships over the years. I remember years ago when I was working in the employment area young school leavers or final-year students would come in and I would ask them what they wanted to do. A very high percentage of those young people said they wanted to be hairdressers—that tended to be the girls—boilermakers or fitters. I truly believe that young people who express a desire to undertake apprenticeships in the future will struggle to access them with this legislation.


A person taking out one of the loans will not completely repay it until they have paid back any HELP debt they have. That is pretty hard for a young person, and it has the potential to extend the time taken to repay the loan considerably. The relatively low income of many tradespeople, particularly when they first start out, is going to lead to this period being drawn out and to the possibility of there being a high default rate. This could mean that the program is going to cost the taxpayer a lot of money. The program is available to cert III and cert IV courses, and the loan must be paid to the apprentice at the completion of each instalment period.


In the shadow minister's contribution to the debate, she said that the government did not advise the Australian people before the last election that they were going to abolish the Tools For Your Trade program. Also they have not adequately explained this legislation, the interest rate or the full liability of the loans in plain English. They haven't offered adequate protection for school based apprentices under the age of 18, and that raises a question: is this government asking young people under the age of 18 to sign a contract? If not, they will need to involve their parents or guardians. They need to explain to the Australian people how this will work and make sure that career counsellors—who no longer have access to the Job Guide or myfuture, because this government is defunding those fantastic tools—in schools know how this program will operate so that they can give the right advice to the young people who are leaving school.


The shadow minister also raised the issue of fair and reasonable transition arrangements for current apprentices. This legislation is pulling the rug out from under the feet of young apprentices—those who have made decisions based on the programs that were in place. There is no grandfathering of the previous program and it is not allowing young people who have made a commitment to undertake an apprenticeship to finish their apprenticeship under the rules that were in place when they started. It is changing the rules and shifting the goalposts in the middle of a game, and that isn't good enough. The government needs to rethink that aspect of it, make sure that there is adequate privacy protection—that is, point 5 of the amendment that was moved by the shadow minister—and offer apprentices the option of lump sum payments in order to purchase expensive items.


There are a number of very short-sighted moves accompanying this program. The apprentice mentoring program and Tools For Your Trade program are ending, and this undermines the legislation. As I said at the commencement of my contribution to this debate, we, on this side of the House, will not be opposing this legislation but we certainly have a number of concerns. I hope I have outlined fully the concerns that I have for those apprentices and the employers who have made the commitment to offer young people apprenticeships. While supporting this legislation, I have some serious concerns.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (19:36):  Few issues can be more important for the future of this country and certainly the future of my electorate than the twin problems of chronic youth unemployment and chronic skill gaps. To understand the situation we have and the trade support loans bills that are before the House, it is worth going back over some of the problems created by the last government. From 2004 to towards the end of 2007, under the previous Howard government we saw 13 per cent increases in youth employment rates but between 2008 and last year we saw an eight per cent reduction in youth employment rates, whilst the overall employment market increased by eight per cent, and we saw the participation rates for people under the age of 25 falling from 71 per cent to 66 per cent, having climbed in the previous five years. We are at the point now where we have youth unemployment rates of 12.4 per cent, compared to just under six per cent for the overall economy. We are now at the point where one in three unemployed people are aged under 25 and we have hot spots of youth unemployment in places like Burnie and Devonport of over 20 per cent. So this is a very serious problem that the previous government failed to address.


Let us take a deeper look at apprenticeships and training. In the final quarter of 2013 commencements in apprenticeships dropped 19.6 per cent when compared to the previous year and completions decreased by 24 per cent relative to the previous year. These numbers are worrying but the numbers are even bleaker for trades and technical training in particular. We see—and we have heard this from previous speakers—that fewer than 50 per cent of people are finishing their courses. We are consistently seeing that now.


The Department of Employment has done some notable research in the area. In a 2013 report it demonstrated that shortages exist for a number of occupations, particularly amongst the trades. The concentration of skill shortages within trades is demonstrated by the fact that six professions were in shortage in 2013 and 18 technicians and trade worker occupations were in shortage. Some of the specific areas, which are of great concern to my electorate, include: food trades, where only slightly over 50 per cent of the positions are filled; construction trades; and resource related trades, where again slightly over 50 per cent of the positions are filled. Further, that report said, with regard to food trades:


Recruitment of food trades workers remained difficult in 2013, with around half of surveyed vacancies filled … and 1.5 suitable applicants per vacancy (compared with 1.8 in 2012). 


In addition to that research, the Australian Industry Group employer survey from 2012 shows that technicians and trade workers represent the most significant areas of skill shortage. It is a much larger number than for any other occupational group, with 33.3 per cent of survey respondents noting shortages in this area. The AiG report summarises:


Completion rates for Australian Apprenticeships are unacceptably low at approximately 55.4%. This represents a significant economic cost—


and it is a great problem for the economy. Our policy, which is in the legislation in front of the House, is aimed at addressing this. I will not repeat the details of the policy. In contrast to what we heard from the member for Shortland, it is worthwhile looking at what the experts have to say about this legislation. Again the AiG, the Australian Industry Group, said:


The Trade Support Loans Scheme is a positive step, enabling apprentices to access financial support over the course of their apprenticeship. We particularly commend the completion incentive built into the loan structure. 


That is a very important part of the structure of this policy because it is designed to get people to finish their courses. We know that is as big a problem as getting them to start. Finally, we heard from the NGO by the name of BUSY, whose CEO is Paul Miles:


The Trade Support Loans are a fantastic solution to ease the financial burden by providing apprentices with real support while they complete their skills training


I commend this legislation to the House.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (19:42):  It is quite amazing that the program before us is being hailed as something that is going to encourage more people to enter the trades. The primary argument appears to be that it will encourage them to continue and complete their trade training. If we look at the package in the trade support loans bills that the Abbott government is delivering, we will see results very different to that. It almost beggars belief that they could claim that a government that is cutting $5,500 from each apprentice—without any electoral mandate whatsoever—is somehow adopting a stance that is likely to encourage more apprentices into training and encourage those apprentices who are training to stay in training. It is absolute nonsense.


We are supporting the legislation here tonight because this trade support loans program is really now all that is going to be on offer for apprentices and to stimulate trade training, but we have to say it is a vastly inferior package to that that was available under Labor. Labor positively encouraged apprenticeships. We had a meeting the other day in Perth of a group of young apprentices from a whole range of trades. There were about 15 young guys there from the Princess Margaret worksite. They were appalled by the statements that had been made by ministers of this government. The Minister for Industry said that the problem with the Tools For Your Trade program that had been offered under Labor was that they all raced off and got tattooed and were not spending it on their trade training. That is completely contemptuous of these young people who have embraced trade training. Indeed, it is treating these apprentices in a way that no government would ever deal with any business. The idea that these young people have signed up to apprenticeships understanding that they were going to get, over the course of their trade training, a tax-free benefit of $5,500—having signed up and committed themselves to take on jobs that are, it would be fair to say, very modestly paid—to then find the ground rules have changed is, I believe, unacceptable. It is a bad policy. To introduce this in such a way that those people who have already made a commitment to an apprenticeship—who have started their training and entered into financial commitments—then find the ground rules have changed is particularly unacceptable.


What we are seeing happen is apprentices are now being hit twice. Not only are they losing the Tools For Your Trade scheme, they are also facing the actions of state governments. In Western Australia, in particular, I know that with the deregulation of TAFE fees the cost of doing an apprenticeship has increased very dramatically, particularly for those young people who are working for smaller employers and have to cover their own fees. This is a huge liability. We have lots of people now in their second or third year of apprenticeship and suddenly all the ground rules have changed. Not only are they losing their Tools For Your Trade assistance scheme for the life of their apprenticeship, they are also being required to pay much higher apprenticeship fees.


I will quote a few people. Mercey contacted us. He is a young apprentice carpenter from Perth in his 20s. He has two jobs: he is an apprentice during the week and he works at the local supermarket each weekend to make ends meet. In total, working that seven days a week earns him the princely sum of $870. He works for a very small employer and has to cover the cost of his own fees which are now, he tells us, some $12,000 over three years. He is absolutely stunned that the government could unilaterally take away Tools For Your Trade, which had been very much a part of his decision-making on going into his apprenticeship. To suggest that taking out a loan for $20,000, that will have to be paid back, is in any way a better deal for him is just a complete and utter fantasy.


Danielle has contacted us. She is very concerned. Her partner has finished all the coursework for his adult apprenticeship in light vehicle mechanics and was due for his final payment not long after the cut-off date. Danielle and her partner have two children and the Tools For Your Trade payment was used to purchase all the extra tools he needs to do the job that an already tight budget could not stretch to. Here you have a young man, with a young family, seeking to obtain skills. Obviously, it is hard to manage with a family on the very modest pay of an apprentice. Now the Tools For Your Trade payments have been cut it will be so much more of a struggle. How is this going to encourage more people into apprenticeships? It is absurd.


We had Erica contact us. Erica is a hairdressing principal. She said:


I have just heard from my hard-working, low paid young hairdressing apprentices that the Tools For Your Trade payment has been cancelled from July. This is a great disadvantage to them, considering they pay their own TAFE fees and have to purchase all their tools while earning under $11 an hour for their first year. A set of straighteners for a professional can cost at least $2,000.


A whole $8.30 a week! We should be supporting apprentices.




Mr Nikolic:
  Luckily the trade support loans will cover it!




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  They now need to, on their very low income, enter into a loan! Obviously this makes this a much more unattractive proposition. I find it extraordinary that you cannot see that. Of course, they can go and take out a loan!


I do not know whether you expect that hairdressers, once graduated, will be earning anything like doctors and lawyers. I suspect not. This whole proposal is predicated on treating trade training like university education because people who have university educations, the argument goes, make 75 per cent above the average earnings, so they can afford to pay these higher contributions. That is why we are asking them to repay more money more quickly.




Mr Nikolic:
  You don't have to borrow the full amount!




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  That is just for one item. 'Just borrow it!'


If we go back to the basics, we see there is a decline in the take-up of trade training in this country. We are going to go out and stimulate that. How are we going to stimulate that? We are going to remove a tax free grant, structured over the life of the training; we are going to take that away and give them a loan. That is really going to get people fired up; that is a much better deal!


Not only that, it does not actually deal with some of the real issues around the attrition rate of apprentices. The member for Parramatta set out some very good economic arguments as to why this structure certainly will not be conducive to encouraging people to continue with their apprenticeship. One of the key things we have to do is expose young people to trades earlier. The development of trade training centres in schools was very much part of that. While they were still at school, young people in year 9 and year 10 on had the opportunity to try out different trades—to get an understanding of what it is like to work with metal, what it is like to work with machines or what it is like to work with wood—and acquire some of those cert I and cert II qualifications while they were in a structured environment.


School based, technical trade training has two real advantages. One is it gives kids an opportunity while they are still at school to get an idea of what those trade skills are like and whether or not it is something they like doing, even more so where schools have relationships with industry so kids can go out from school into structured workplace learning environments. The second thing is it allows young people of 15 and 16 to operate in the more structured environment of school, where there is a higher level of supervision and pastoral care. We had some very interesting evidence from Morley Senior High School, which is in my electorate and has been a registered training organisation for 10 years. Their trainees who do cert I and cert II through the school have a really high rate of success. They compared the environment that is offered at their school to the environment that is offered at institutes such as Polytechnic West, which is more suited to adult learners and perhaps people who do not have the same lack of development of the executive function that one might find with a normal 15- and 16-year-old. They said that introducing trade skills and doing the early certificates in the more structured school environment had been very successful, so that when their apprentices go out at the age of 17 or 18 they are much better placed and equipped to operate within an adult workplace.


I think it is highly unfortunate that we cut the trade training centres. If we were truly concerned about the lack of people going into trades and the very high attrition levels, we would have looked very closely at that model of VET being delivered in schools in those early years and seen how that can indeed augment the quality of young people taking up apprenticeships. But, no, instead of doing that we cut the trade training centres. And not only have we done that—and this is apropos a discussion I had in this place earlier in the day—we have been taking all the brakes off 457 visas, which is undercutting a requirement to have a culture of training our own people. There are many easy solutions available that involve just bringing people in, rather than training our own. As I said, we are supporting this loans scheme, but anyone that thinks that this is a superior option that will see us reverse the very unfortunate decline in the take-up of trades is greatly deluded.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (19:55):  As someone who comes from a family of tradesmen and who continues to interact in a tradesmen-rich environment in Launceston, I rise to speak in support of the government's $1.9 billion trades support loans. There is strong support for this scheme across my electorate of Bass. Since the budget I have given a number of speeches across my electorate. In my roles as the patron of cycling in Tassie and the patron of Northern Tasmanian Netball, I have interacted with young people at schools and talked to them about how we are expanding opportunities across our country when it comes to earning—opportunities both in pre-degree courses and, importantly, in vocational education and training.


The response that I get is very similar to the one that I got when I arrived at the Army Recruit Training Centre as the Commandant. They used to fundraise each year and fund a scholarship for a young person studying at the local university. But it became very clear that we were only touching part of our constituency in the Riverina environment, that there were a whole bunch of people undertaking vocational education and training who never had that opportunity. So we came up with a separate scholarship which we would award each year for a three-year period for someone doing an apprenticeship. It was a very welcome initiative. The comments I got related to fairness and acknowledging that there was more than just one pathway in our society, through university, and that there were other important pathways.


The tradesmen that I have discussed this with in my electorate of Bass are similarly positive about the scheme and the fact that it will target occupations on the National Skills Needs List such as plumbers, diesel mechanics, electricians and fitters. I have a friend in Launceston who has been a plumbing contractor of 37 years. His name is Andrew Foley. He says:


It's a long time coming, and anything we can do to help kids into a trade, as we do for young people into university, is a good thing.


He acknowledges that expansion of opportunity, not just for the 80,000 young people who will get an opportunity to do a pre-degree course under the HELP scheme with the additional opportunities that provides, but for apprentices as well. Another plumber friend, John Oldenhof, who is now in his 70s but is still putting in a full day's work and a whole lot of volunteering in my Lions Club, is another fan. John sees this also as an overdue measure that acknowledges the realities in our society. John says:


It doesn't matter where they start, providing they start, and this scheme has a very powerful incentive.


What Andrew and John and many other people in northern Tasmania like best about this scheme is that it has choice at its heart.


Apprentices can choose to access the full amount or part of it. And it does contain an important incentive: upon completion of training, the loan amount will be cut by 20 per cent, up to a value of $4,000. It is called reinforcing success and encouraging our young people to start something and to finish it. All too often, young apprentices do not complete their training because they cannot afford the costs associated with undertaking an apprenticeship, so this is about providing a hand-up early in the careers of our young people to ease their financial burden by front loading that financial assistance during the initial years when they need it most. That means support of up to $8,000 in the first year of the apprenticeship, $6,000 in the second, $4,000 in the third and $2,000 in the fourth. It is a clearly superior incentive to the $4,000 tool kit grant under those opposite which had become an unaccountable handout that did little to help apprentices complete their training.


So let's put the negativity away and acknowledge that young people are over $6,000 better off in their first year with this scheme compared to the previous one. Our hope is that they will complete their training, be rewarded with the $4,000 incentive deduction, go on and have productive careers, earn good wages and raise a family, pay their taxes and contribute to a healthy, prosperous society. The trade support loans will be repayable at the same income thresholds as university HELP loans when an apprentice starts earning a sustainable wage of above $50,000. Importantly, the loans are the best sorts of loans: they are interest free and constitute an early investment in the potential of the individual.


With that, I know a lot of other speakers are keen to have a say this evening, so I will cut my remarks short. I commend this bill to the House and I look forward to its commencement on 1 July.

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen—Second Deputy Speaker) (20:00):  I rise to speak on the amendment to the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014 second reading motion. Firstly, I, like most Australians, am furious but, sadly, not surprised by yet another Abbott government broken promise. This is a government that is built on lies. Prior to the election, the Liberal Party was spruiking the introduction of the trade support loans, telling apprentices that the coalition would 'provide better support for Australian apprentices'. There was absolutely no mention whatsoever that the government was planning to scrap the Tools For Your Trade program.


The Tools For Your Trade program was vital to and heavily relied upon by Australian apprentices. The $5,500 provided was used to buy the necessary tools and equipment for apprentices to be able to complete their training. Depending on their field, the money would be used to purchase important safety gear, drills, uniforms, knives, scissors or hair dryers—all the items required to complete their apprenticeship. But now our apprentices have been slapped in the face, yet again, with an Abbott budget of broken promises. In fact, before the election, the coalition went on record to confirm that they were keeping the Tools For Your Trade program. For the benefit of the member for Paterson, who earlier in the chamber was unaware of this, in The Sydney Morning Herald on 26 August 2013 it was stated:


The coalition loans will be made available in addition to the commonwealth Tools For Your Trade incentive scheme …


As we know—it is the reason we are here today—this is just another in a long line of broken promises by the Abbott government.


In my electorate of McEwen, we have a large number of young people entering into trades and apprenticeships. Recently I received an email from a registered training organisation in the printing industry, explaining how the Tools For Your Trade cuts are already affecting the writer's apprentices. He said:


Some of our apprentices have purchased tools and now they will be left out of pocket. The printing trade already has a skills shortage and this just makes it harder, especially in our regional areas.


By cutting the Tools For Your Trade program so suddenly, with no grandfathering system in place, our apprentices are now out of pocket. It has become quite clear those opposite do not understand apprenticeships. They do not understand that apprentices get a lower wage than other workers during their time as an apprentice. This means they are behind the eight ball from day one.


The sting of this funding cut is made even more painful with the Abbott government cutting other essential and important apprentice programs. For example, the apprentice mentoring program provided experienced tradies as mentors in the relevant field the apprentice had enrolled in. This program meant the apprentice would be able to ask questions and seek advice on their training from someone who knew the ropes. This program meant a higher success rate in apprentice programs because apprentices had someone to talk to about their issues—a sounding board, if you like—but the Prime Minister has scrapped this program as well. This comes at a time when an apprentice probably needs more help than ever since the government is openly turning its back on apprentices and those undertaking vocational training. Mr Abbott's Treasury spokesman is on the record saying the coalition would 'abolish' trade training centres in schools, while Labor promised all secondary schoolkids will have access to trade training centres by 2018. Right across the electorate of McEwen, these trade training centres have been delivering opportunities for kids who may drop out of school early and not take those opportunities. Mr Abbott failed to release a skills and training policy in 2010, and the so-called 'Real Solutions' pamphlet made no reference to this area, but now he is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of apprentices.


In contrast, the Labor government was already providing apprentices with the tools they need for their trade, via the Tools For Your Trade payment scheme. We also introduced a HECS style loan for VET course fees in 2009. That helped some 55,000 students in 2012. Labor has helped 70,000 Australians into an apprenticeship through Apprentice Kickstart. We announced the $35 million Step into Skills program, which would deliver foundation skills to 8,900 disadvantaged young people to boost their chances of securing a job or further training, although this has since been cut by the Abbott government. Ours is the party that is committed to skills. It was the Labor government which invested more than $19 billion in skills and training over the last five years. Those last five years have delivered more opportunities than ever before for many young people, particularly those in rural and regional areas, where job chances are slim and opportunities are not that great.


In this latest budget, almost $2 billion has been cut from support and training for Australia's apprentices and workers, including the National Workforce Development Fund, the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program, the Accelerated Australian Apprenticeships program, the Alternative Pathways Program, the Apprentice to Business Owner Program and the Step into Skills program. These are just a precious few of the programs cut by this government. If the Prime Minister really does believe he will 'provide better support for Australia's apprentices', then he has a twisted way of showing it. These loans are not a hand up; they are just a hand in your pocket.


The Trade Support Loans scheme will be supported on this side of the House in light of no other assistance programs being made available to our apprentices. However, let it be known that the amendments we would like made to the bill are essential in ensuring our apprentices are supported and not disadvantaged in any way. These amendments ensure apprentices are aware of how and when the funding and training cuts will affect them. They ensure apprentices, especially school age apprentices, are fully aware of the financial implications involved in a trade support loan. They ensure that the privacy and legal arrangements involved in a trade support loan are maintained to the highest standard.


If Australia is to go forth and improve manufacturing, improve skills, improve trades and not rely on a flood of 457 visa workers, we need to support young people and give them every opportunity through different pathways to make a career for themselves and to give them a future. It is important that we do this due to the globalisation of our economy and the need we face particularly in areas like McEwen, where you have massive housing growth and business opportunities. We need to ensure that we have tradespeople available to service those needs, to build those homes, to build those roads and to do the things that we need to do. I know, having been an apprentice in the shoe industry, which is long gone from our shores, that it is an important thing to have an apprenticeship. It was an important job opportunity to fall back on should anything go wrong. I think that it is important that we make sure kids get every opportunity, to make sure that this country can grow and develop and be the best that we can be. In supporting this bill, we want to make sure that the government knows that we will be here and watching, and making sure that we support apprentices and young people in their future.

"Sukkar, Michael, MP",LP,2014-06-23,"



Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (20:08):  It gives me great pleasure to speak in support of the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014. A lot of speakers on the other side of the chamber have spoken begrudgingly about the benefits of the Trade Support Loans program. I must say that offering apprentices $20,000 over the life of a four-year apprenticeship, heavily front-ended for the first and second years of their apprenticeship, is, in my view, overwhelmingly positive. I have a lot of apprentices in my electorate. Indeed, since the budget I have visited a number of training facilities and spoken to those apprentices. The $5,500 that was provided under the Tools For Your Trade program just was not enough over a four-year period. In contrast, the $20,000 that will be provided under the Trade Support Loans program will offer for those people who need it more access to greater funding. And those that do not want to take it up do not have to. The beauty of the Trade Support Loans program will be that if you are in a trade that does not require the sort of additional support, or you do not need the additional income supplement, that the Trade Support Loans program offers, you do not need to take it up.


I think members opposite, in a sense, want the status quo. Fifty per cent of the people who commence an apprenticeship not finishing—they think that is acceptable. Increasing youth unemployment—they obviously think that is acceptable because they are offering no changes to the system that has not provided the sort of solutions that we need. But business-as-usual just was not an option in our view.


The Trade Support Loans program offers incentives for apprentices to ensure that they are provided a discount when they do complete their apprenticeship: a 20 per cent discount on the face value of the loan taken out through the trade support loan—a maximum of $4,000. Offering that kind of incentive I think is going to ensure that we head in the right direction in completion rates for apprentices. But the main point—and I think this is one of the big reasons we find apprentices unable to continue and, indeed, finish their apprenticeship—is that often you are working ridiculously long hours and you are getting up at the crack of dawn but you have peers and friends who might be working at McDonald's or Red Rooster getting paid more than you. So it is very, very demotivating. It is very hard to continue working that hard for four years. I think that is one of the big reasons why our completion rates for apprentices have been getting worse.


The $20,000 Trade Support Loans program goes a long way to improving that situation. There is great flexibility for what the apprentices can put the $20,000 towards—$8,000 in year 1, $6,000 in year 2, $4,000 in year 3 and $2,000 in the final year. So it is heavily front-ended to the years where the wages in the apprenticeship are the lowest. We think that is going to assist apprentices to hang on in those first couple of years. We know that apprentices disproportionally drop out in those first and second years. So if we can help them get through that initial period and into years 3 and 4, we think that we can increase the completion rates for apprentices. That is what this program is all about.


The status quo is not working. Members opposite talk about the requirement to attract apprentices. Fifty per cent of people dropping out is not going to achieve that goal. It is hard enough to attract apprentices to start with. Once we get them in the door, we have to do everything we possibly can to ensure that they complete their apprenticeship. That is why I am very proud of the Trade Support Loans program. There is nothing that Trade Support Loans do not offer that Tools For Your Trade did. The net present value of $20,000 loan with the $4,000 discount is a hell of a lot more than the $5,500 from Tools For Your Trade. If it is simply a comparison between the two programs—which it should not be, but if it is—then this is a good news story and this is something that I think the parliament should be agreeing to, not in a begrudging way but actually happily telling our apprentices: 'We value you and we want to support you as much as we support those people entering tertiary study.'


The days of having apprentices as second-class citizens are over. People who have undertaken tertiary study have been able to access concessional loans only repayable once they earned over $50,000, or thereabouts. We are offering that same opportunity to apprentices now. So this is a fantastic good news story, and I am very pleased to support it. I understand that, given that it is such good news for apprentices, many of my coalition colleagues would like to speak on this bill, so I will end my comments there.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (20:13):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014. Since the federal budget there has been a lot of attention given to the plight of university students under this government—and deservedly so, given the Prime Minister's insistence on breaking yet another election promise in order to massively increase both university fees and the cost of student debt. But it is not only university students who are suffering under the Abbott government.


Australians undertaking apprenticeships and vocational education will also suffer from cost-shifting and buck-passing under this government. This bill establishes the Trade Support Loans program for Australian apprentices. The Trade Support Loans program was announced by the then opposition prior to the 2013 election. But what then then opposition leader, now Prime Minister, did not tell apprentices before the last election was that he also intended to scrap the $1 billion Tools For Your Trade program, established by the previous Labor government.


On this point, I note that the member for Paterson indicated, during his contribution to this debate, that the opposition had been upfront with the Australian people about their intent to axe the Tools For Your Trade program before the last election. But when challenged on this point by the member for Hunter, the member for Paterson declined to provide evidence for this claim. Given the recent penchant of those opposite to tell fibs about the fictions they told voters at the last election, to offer furphies about the fabrications they offered to voters, and to provide falsehoods today to justify the fraud they perpetuated at the last election, it would assist the House greatly if Minister Macfarlane could table evidence for the member for Paterson's claim during his summing up of this debate. I call on him to do so.


The Tools For Your Trade program provided up to $5,500 per apprentice in tax-exempt cash payments to support apprentices with the costs of their training, buying tools needed for their apprenticeship, and other costs associated with their apprenticeship. In its place, the optional loan scheme that was originally intended to be made available in addition to the Tools For Your Trade payment, as a supplement for these cash payments, now remains as the only specific financial support offered by the government to apprentices.


Anyone who has had an apprentice in the family knows that many apprenticeships carry very high costs for the tools and equipment needed on the job. The financial reality for these apprentices is that as a result of the policies of the Abbott government, instead of being able to utilise government support to meet these costs, these costs will now be covered by a loan that must be repaid to the Commonwealth.


For many apprentices who have already commenced their trades under the previous government, this could mean up to $3,700 lost in future payments for a first-year apprentice. Providing loan based support for apprentices is not opposed by those on this side of the chamber. It is a useful method for providing additional support for people taking the initiative to improve their skills. But it should not have come at the expense of the Tools For Your Trade scheme that provides an appropriate level of support for people making the decision to make a long-term commitment to improving their skills and education.


Unfortunately, the Tools For Your Trade program is just one area where the Abbott government is cutting support for apprentices and shifting the costs of these apprentices to state and family budgets. Also suffering the effects of Tony Abbott's apprenticeships axe are the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program, the Australian Apprenticeships Mentoring Program and the Apprentice to Business Owner program. These programs have all been axed by a government that is telling young Australians they ought to be learning or earning, while at the same time attacking the very programs that assist them to do so.


This bill provides for the introduction of trade support loans of up to $20,000 to be repaid on an income-contingent basis. Loans of this kind may well be a worthy supplement to other forms of government support for apprentices. But given that these loans will be available to school based apprentices aged 16 to 18, measures need to be put in place to protect children from the consequences of what are major financial decisions. This need is further heightened by the fact that the government intends to outsource debt management for trade support loans to the private sector, potentially leaving $20,000 debts incurred by 16-year-olds in the hands of private debt collectors. It is a worrying prospect, and these bills should include provisions to ensure that apprentices—particularly school based apprentices—receive appropriate advice to ensure that they make informed decisions about loans incurred under this program.


Issues like this have driven Labor to seek an inquiry into the bill through the Senate Economics Committee. This inquiry will examine the payment, by monthly instalments, of the loan amount; loan terms and conditions into the future; future outsourcing of debt management by the government; the protection of 16- to 18-year-old apprentices; and general loan advice to all apprentices.


However, as Tools For Your Trade participants have already been notified of the program closure, Labor is minded to support this bill. Of course, all the financial support in the world for apprentices will be for naught if the learning institutions that support apprentices are not themselves funded. In this respect, the record of the Liberal Party, particularly at the state level, is extremely poor. 


As I have previously informed the House, the impact of the state Victorian Liberal government's swingeing cuts to TAFE and VET funding in Melbourne's west have been particularly severe. In Melbourne's west, less than 50 per cent of the population have completed high school, and less than 10 per cent have completed a bachelor degree. We also have a very large migrant and culturally and linguistically diverse community, with over half of the resident population in Melbourne's west speaking a language other than English at home. I am talking of families like my own.


In this context, TAFEs are particularly important to Melbourne's west as providers of tailored employment training—often addressing skills gaps or deficits in basic education. The Victorian Liberal government's cut of $170 million in funding allocated to TAFEs to meet their community obligations, promote social inclusion and provide support to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, has particularly hurt Melbourne's west. One result of these cuts has been the retrenchment of more than 13 full-time youth and education support workers at Victoria University. These student support roles are particularly important for institutions like Victoria University, which support large numbers of students who are either the first members of their immediate families to engage in tertiary education or who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. These students often require a little more holistic support early on in their studies to ensure that they are able to make the challenging transition to tertiary study. These students often do not have the experienced support networks enjoyed by more privileged students and, as such, are at risk of dropping out of tertiary education early in their degrees.


More broadly, Victoria University, the primary provider of higher education in Melbourne's west, has been substantially impacted by the cuts in VET program subsidies by the Victorian Liberal government. Cuts to VU's program-subsidy funding constitute over 25 per cent of the total revenue of VU's TAFE. As a result, VU has been forced to undertake major retrenchments of its TAFE teachers and support staff. As VU is a major employer in Melbourne's west, this has also had obvious flow-on effects for the broader economy of the region. Cuts in VET fees in Melbourne's west have also had an impact on the fees faced by prospective students. When coupled with the Liberal government's decision to remove caps on VET student fees, the cuts in VET funding have had the inevitable consequence of pushing student fees higher.


TAFE providers are forced to increase fees to compensate for lost government funding in order to remain viable, with consequences for the accessibility of education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.


A further consequence of the Victorian Liberal government's cuts to VET funding is the knock-on effect that these cuts have on the accessibility of university study in Melbourne's west. As students from Melbourne's west are statistically more likely to come from lower socio-economic status backgrounds, they rely heavily on alternative pathways to university study—including VET programs, in particular.


Of particular concern is the state Liberal government's decision to dramatically reduce funding for VET Certificate I and II courses. These courses are generally not vocational in nature, but instead are used by disadvantaged students as bridging courses to further study. Limiting access to VET programs in Melbourne's west therefore has a pipeline effect of limiting access to university study for students in the region. The cumulative effect of these changes is to further entrench educational disadvantage in Melbourne's west.


The Abbott government tells us that the age of entitlement is over and that our young people must earn, learn or starve.




Mr Whiteley:
  Hear, hear!




Mr WATTS:
 I take that interjection from the government! Bills like this reveal the true unfairness of this prescription. The hard truth for young people in this country is that they are being asked to learn or earn, by this government, at the same time as they—the government, and their state Liberal colleagues—are making doing so that much harder.


If the government were serious about helping young Australians learn or earn, it would keep programs like the Tools For Your Trade scheme, the Australian Apprentices Access Program, the Australian Apprenticeships Mentoring Program and the Apprentice to Business Owner Program. The fact that they are pulling down the ladders at the same time as ripping away the safety net tells you all you need to know about their aspirations for the young people of this country.

Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (20:23):  It is a pleasure tonight to speak in support of the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014. This is one of the many exciting initiatives in this year's budget with an eye to the future, with an eye to ensuring that our economy is sustainable and that every person in this nation has an opportunity to get ahead. The announcement by the Treasurer, on budget night, to introduce a new student loan scheme to assist young people with the costs associated in undertaking and completing an apprenticeship represents one of the most important shifts in a generation in the way the government and the community treats young people considering apprenticeships.


These reforms will have a significant positive impact on many young people in Braddon and Tasmania. For too long, some within previous governments and the wider community have viewed those who have chosen to undertake an apprenticeship as being of less value to the economy—that those who choose to go to university hold some sort of superior status. An apprenticeship is too readily viewed as the easier, inferior option for a young person and that they only do it if they are not smart enough to go to university. This bill goes an awful long way to dispelling that myth. 


Unfortunately for many young people in the past, undertaking an apprenticeship was made all the more difficult by this attitude. This attitude resulted in young apprentices not having access to deferred low-interest loans and financial arrangements similar to university students. The Trade Support Loans Bill puts an end to this act of social discrimination. This bill will reverse this damaging attitude and place apprentices on level pegging with university students—as does another great reform of this year's budget, to place more courses under the FEE-HELP scheme, in line with most university undergraduate degrees. As part of this reform, apprentices may be eligible for concessional income-contingent loans, in a similar fashion to FEE-HELP loans or the old HECS loan scheme. 


Under this new arrangement, apprentices in a priority occupation can receive up to $20,000 over four years, to be repaid at the same income thresholds as university students, which are currently set at about $53,000 per annum. Under the trade support loans payments will be made in arrears, with $8,000 available in the first year, $6,000 in the second, $4,000 in the third and $2,000 in the final year. In addition to providing many apprentices access to these loans, the government will also provide a 20 per cent discount on the loans—meaning apprentices will only pay $16,000 as a maximum, of the loan, when and if they complete the training.


I find it hard to accept the basis on which many of the speakers opposite have contributed tonight—that is, that there is something obviously wrong with a loan-scheme system when, in fact, the university-loan system has been working like this for years. I see this as a hypocritical approach to this particular bill and it has a slight reek of elitism. 


In addition to providing many apprentices access to these loans, it is really important to understand that there is currently a 30 per cent dropout rate in the first two years of an apprenticeship and about half of all apprentices who begin an apprenticeship fail to complete it. This is another reason that makes this Trade Support Loans Bill so important. It provides increased support to apprentices in the earlier stages of their apprenticeship, when their wages are lowest and when they need it most.


Furthermore, this money can be used to assist apprentices purchase tools, attend training in other towns and help with living expenses, under those circumstances, while earning lower wages, particularly in the first and second years.


In my state of Tasmania and particularly in the electorate of Braddon, these loans will have a significant impact on the ability of the region to recover from the dearth of skills needed to meet labour-market needs. One of the common issues facing many small and medium businesses in Braddon is simply that there are not the young apprentices undertaking training in skills-shortage areas. There is a mismatch between what businesses need and what the apprentices are taking up. Often this is not their fault. In fact, this is one of the many reasons the Gillard trade training centres were such a dismal failure. They set some young people up with skills and trades that were not in demand in the area where they lived. It was a lose-lose situation for both the student and the industry.


This issue was highlighted recently in a joint report by the Devonport Chamber of Commerce and Regional Development Australia—Tasmania. A key theme in the report is the need for more collaboration between the job seeker, industry and educational providers to ensure young people are undertaking skills development that is needed in the region. 


Trade support loans will achieve this by encouraging people to undertake training in skills-shortage areas, without the need to then move interstate because the trade training centre did not offer the training that local industry required. Under this program, an apprentice will be eligible for loan support if they are undertaking any trade on the skills shortage list. This may sound overprescriptive, but the list has over 60 trades, including fitters, turners, electricians, hairdressers, sheet metal workers, gasfitters, welders and mechanics—and the list goes on.


In addition to traditional trades, I am pleased to note that those undertaking a certificate II, III or IV in agriculture and horticulture will be eligible for these loans. This is hugely important for Braddon as the local dairying industry embarks on a massive expansion in coming years. There is also an expansion coming when it comes to horticulture, particularly in the area of berries. I hope that this scheme will encourage more young people to consider a life in the agricultural industry and that more of the jobs can be filled by qualified Tasmanians rather than mainlanders and workers from overseas.


In the six weeks since the budget, I have been overwhelmed by the support for this Trade Support Loans scheme from apprentices and parents, particularly parents of young people who are coming to that stage of life where they are considering what to do following school. Not only are current apprentices, future apprentices and their parents welcoming of this scheme for the financial support it provides to buy tools and to cover the cost of travelling to training courses, clothes and living expenses, but, just as importantly, it gives young people the confidence that they are making the right decision by going into an apprenticeship. They are contributing to the economy and they will be acknowledged by the government and the community for the contribution they make to the community. I thank the House.


Debate adjourned.

"Andrews, Karen, MP",LP,2014-06-23,"



Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (18:55):  I rise today to strongly support this legislation. It delivers on our election commitment to provide interest-free loans of up to $20,000 to young Australians completing apprenticeships. This is a common-sense measure that will help more young people complete their apprenticeships and, along with other measures our government is introducing, will begin to address Australia's skills shortage.


Vocational education and training is important to building Australia. The prosperity of this nation and our communities does not rest just in the hands of university graduates and office workers but also in the hands of the craftsmen, labourers, builders and artisans of our country. We want young people to have confidence so that when they start to learn the tools of trade they can see those skills put into use through a long career. 


This is our ambition, yet we are up against worrying trends. About 20 per cent of apprentices drop out of their first year, with 30 per cent not making it to the end of their second year. Only about 50 per cent of apprentices make it to the end of their training. This is a lost opportunity for industry and a lost opportunity for individuals. The obvious solution, for stopping this trend and skills shortage, is to make it easier for Australian apprentices to train and get skilled up. This bill today provides that first step in creating a VET system that supports apprentices and trainees on the road to a great career. 


The Trade Support Loans provide loans of up to $20,000 for apprentices to help them complete their training, which will be paid monthly in arrears and repaid by the apprentices in a similar fashion to HELP. With the passage of this legislation, apprentices will be able to opt into the loan from 1 July 2014, in line with the year of their apprenticeship. For instance, a second-year apprentice will be eligible for the second-, third- and fourth-year payments, if they wish to receive them. The value of the concessional no-interest nature of the loan is expected to be worth between $8½ thousand and $10,000 on average during the life of a loan, which is substantially more than apprentices received under the previous government's $5½ thousand Tools For Your Trade handout.


Others in this debate have spoken about the anecdotal evidence that the money from the previous Tools For Your Trade handout was spent on a variety of personal things rather than on equipment or costs associated with study. I have heard those opposite say that there is no evidence to support the misuse of Tools For Your Trade. That is not true. We in the government understand the VET sector, and we understand its current limitations. The minister has been very proactive and has actively sought the views of the sector on a wide range of issues.


I have been involved in several of the VET reform workshops held around this country and have had first-hand advice, from those in the sector, about the way Tools For Your Trade has been used. The common view is that the cash is not just used for tools but is used for other lifestyle type purchases, if I can call them that—such as surfboards, PlayStations and holidays. This anecdotal evidence also comes directly from the Apprenticeships Centres. So the misuse of the Tools For Your Trade handouts should be seen as a fault of the system. It is effectively a system that has been set up for use by apprentices to support whatever it is they want, not necessarily for use to support the tools they need for their trades. Many employers were having to buy tools for their apprentices to use, while the Tools For Your Trade handouts were being used on anything the apprentices wanted.


We see this as a fault of the system, and it is one we are fixing. While the new trade support loans will not come with any provision on how the money is spent, the fact that it is repayable ought to ensure that young people who choose to take part in this scheme take the support more seriously than they were likely to when the money was just a cash bonus given to them. 


Further, the apprentices must opt in to the loan every six months, so the debt does not just accrue without notice. Under this scheme, loan recipients are not just given a blank cheque with no accountability. They must take charge of this decision, and, hopefully, the added responsibility that comes with accepting this payment will give apprentices the incentive to place the funds towards costs associated with their training. This six month opt-in period means that, if their needs change, they can then opt out of their loan whenever they wish and will only have to pay back what they have borrowed—and only when their income reaches around $50,000. However, the loan will be reduced by 20 per cent—which is possibly up to $4,000—when the apprenticeship is completed, providing a massive incentive for apprentices to stick with their training.


The eligibility criteria to receive a trade support loan will be the same as under the Tools For Your Trade loan scheme, meaning that any apprenticeship or traineeship for an occupation on the National Skills Needs List or in the agriculture and horticulture sectors will provide eligibility for the loan. This is a timely change, especially following the Fair Work Commission's decision to increase apprentice wages, with some employers providing tools for their apprentices and most awards including a tool allowance.


I am very pleased to support this legislation. As I conclude, I want to let the almost 2,500 apprentices currently training in my electorate know that this government is serious about fixing the skills shortage, reforming the VET sector and providing them the opportunity to get ahead in their career of choice. This bill is merely one step down the road and I look forward to great reforms still to come. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (19:01):  Doesn't the Abbott government love debt! Here we have another case of it: providing access to debt to young people. We have seen it for university students—raising fees massively and then increasing interest rates, creating debt as far as the eye can see for people graduating from university—and now we see it with these training loans of up to $20,000 for people as young as 16 who are still at high school.


A country's resilience depends on the household balance sheets as much as it depends on the government's, and we see here a government that is prepared to see our young people start their lives with rising debt levels. It is an extraordinary contribution to the future of this nation by a government that claims that debt is bad, but not if they can give it to someone else. It is also worth commenting on the decision by this government to go down this path. The excuse they used in raising fees for universities and introducing these $20,000 loans for trade apprentices is that they need to address the country's deficit. Yet, if you compare the budget outlook through the forward estimates to PEFO—the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook—that is prepared under the Charter of Budget Honesty which Peter Costello introduced, you can see that they have not managed to reduce the debt at all. In fact, the deficit is slightly larger, and we come back to surplus, on their projections, some two years later. So on the one hand they have actually increased the debt relative to the pre-election fiscal outlook, and on the other hand they are also raising debt levels for young people who are starting out in their first years as adults.


One has to wonder how much consulting they did on this to come to the conclusion that providing a $20,000 loan rather than an upfront payment to provide tools would increase the completion rates. We hear from members opposite that one of the problems is that one in two apprentices are not finishing their apprenticeship, and this providing of a loan rather than the Tools For Your Trade payment will somehow increase that completion rate. I wonder, though, how it would have any impact at all if an apprentice is actually put off by their employer—if the employer stands them down and they are no longer in their apprenticeship. How does having a loan help that apprentice complete their apprenticeship?


They say that one of the reasons they are doing this is that apprentices have been out buying mag wheels and going on holidays with their Tools For Your Trade Payment. Where is the evidence that providing a loan will not have that result? Assuming that young apprentices do actually buy mag wheels—and I know many who do not do that—how does providing a loan change the behaviour at all? I would love to see the research for that. If, even in the first few months, an apprentice decides that the apprenticeship is simply not for them—if maybe they cannot physically do it, or they thought it was one thing and it is not—how will providing loans keep that person in the apprenticeship? And should it keep that person in the apprenticeship?


I always love this government's maths, and their maths tends to bring them down every time. One of the claims that they make on the government's side is that, by providing a 20 per cent discount on that $20,000 loan at the end of the apprenticeship, apprentices will be incentivised to complete the apprenticeship. But, again, if you look at the figures—and I doubt that the government actually has—43.9 per cent of apprentices in the trade area actually drop out in the first two years, and another five per cent drop out in the third year. In the fourth year, the percentage is very small. But 43.9 per cent drop out in the first and second years, and, by my very quick calculations, if you are taking out the loan at the rate that you are allowed—which is $8,000 in the first year and $6,000 in the second year—it is actually cheaper to drop out at the end of your second year than it is to complete the apprenticeship and get your 20 per cent discount. So if you decide that the apprenticeship is not for you, not only would you need to waste another two years to get your 20 per cent discount, but also your loan would be bigger at the end of that time, not smaller. The financially sensible thing to do under this arrangement is to drop out in those first two years if that is what you choose to do. It simply does not make sense.


In the construction sector, the figures are even more stark. Forty-eight per cent of apprentices drop out by the end of the second year and 51.8 per cent drop out at the end of the third year, and that is pretty much where it sits by the end of the fourth year. So, again, for that 48 per cent of people who drop out by the end of the second year, their cheapest option is to do exactly what they are doing. If they finish their apprenticeship and stay there for another two or 2½ years, their debt will be bigger even with the 20 per cent discount than it would be if they drop out. On the figures alone, this is not a rational decision and certainly will not achieve what the government expects it to achieve. What it will do is leave a large number of young people who decide that the apprenticeship is not for them, who lose their apprenticeship because the employer puts them off or who find that physically they just cannot do it with debt which will hinder their ability to start their lives on a firm financial basis.


One of the other issues that we raise a lot on this side of the House is the misinformation that the now government gave out when in opposition. Prior to the 2013 election Tony Abbott announced the trade support loans but did not announce that they were going to scrap Labor's $1 billion Tools For Your Trade apprentice program, which gave $5½ thousand per apprentice to help with buying tools. This now means that, as of 1 July, apprentices who enter their apprenticeship on one basis, who were planning on using a payment later on this year to pay for tools and who may already have entered into a payment plan to do that, will suddenly find that payment not forthcoming. It is usual when governments make changes like this to recognise that people have quite often made decisions based on one policy and to ease the change so that those rational decisions that people made can be followed through to their logical conclusion. But again, before the election, Tony Abbott did not tell apprentices that as of 1 July they would lose up to $3,700 for a first-year apprentice, and first-year apprentices are expecting that payment very shortly. Being young people, they may already be depending on that.


The new program—the trade support loans—are not lump sum payments. They are not payments that are designed to help young apprentices with those lumpy payments they have to make when they buy their tools. They are not designed for an apprentice who, for example, may need to buy a second-hand ute to get to a site. They are not the lumpy payments that an apprentice chef would have to make when they buy their knives. Those knives, by the way, if you have never bought a chef's knife, are incredibly expensive. They are in the hundreds of dollars per knife—incredibly expensive gear. You will find the same for carpenters if they are buying good tools. You will find the same for many apprentices. There can be very expensive, lumpy payments that come along in the early years of an apprenticeship because they have to buy tools.


These payments are actually designed as if they are income support payments: paid monthly in arrears. Again we hear members of the opposition saying that young people can save up those payments to buy their tools, but again we are talking about very young people here—people as young as 16, still in school, 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds—with not a lot of life experience or experience in managing income. In fact, this might be their first income, and they are being asked to manage saving up payments in order to buy quite expensive tools. It is really quite challenging for many young people who may be entering the workforce for the first time and receiving the first payments and who will find themselves in quite severe financial difficulties because of the low payments, particularly in the first and second year. These are young people whose wages will be very low in the first and second years—particularly the first year—because their skills are not of great use to the business employing them, and so their wages are very low in the first year. Asking a young person to manage saving up these monthly payments when they are in really quite serious financial difficulty in order to buy tools is a very big ask. It is difficult to see how this system of monthly payments will stop apprentices from spending their money on things other than tools. It may not make it easier for the odd apprentice who, as the opposition keeps saying, wants to go off and buy mag wheels, but we will probably see apprentices spending it on rent, food and all the other things they need and still not being able to buy their tools at the end of the day.


We on this side of the House will not oppose the bill. An optional loan is the government's policy and was the policy before the election—one of the few policies that they are actually following through on—but we do not believe it should be at the expense of the Tools For Your Trade scheme. We also believe that, if a loans scheme is in place, there should be appropriate advice requirements in place to ensure informed and voluntary decisions by apprentices, some of whom, as I have said, are school based apprentices as young as 16 years of age. One could come to the conclusion, for example, that a 16-year-old perhaps should have their parents' permission before entering into a loan of $8,000 in the first year. A 16-year-old is very young to be making that decision.


The bill has been referred to the Senate Economics Committee to examine the payment mechanisms, the payment of monthly instalments of the loan amount and the loan terms and conditions into the future and to consider what protection young people, particularly those under the age of 18, should have in terms of general loan advice and parental approval. These are incredibly important aspects that should really have been considered prior to this policy announcement. The level of consultation on this has been quite poor, and it shows in the poor design of the program.


Another issue of real concern to this side of the House is the government's confirmation that they are looking to outsource debt management for trade support loans. Again, placing young people who have entered into debt of up to $20,000 at a time in their lives when they are not high income earners and may not be for quite some time in the hands of private debt collectors is a worry. We do not think it is a good idea at all, but we are waiting to see what the conditions of such a thing would be. We are waiting to see how a government would regulate to ensure protection of 16-year-olds from private debt collectors.


Again, these are not people who have experience in earning a living, they are not people who have experience in handling their own money—they are learning their way through that. By the time they graduate as an apprentice they would have been through four years at least on very, very low wages. They will have, on this program, at least $20,000 in debt and they will then be, of course, going through the process of trying to find the best place to work in a sector that is increasingly contracted out and really quite volatile. We all know that construction, for example, is one of the first areas in the economy that starts to slow down. If things get bad we will probably find apprentices with their $20,000 of loan who have managed to pass the income threshold and are beginning to pay off those debts who find themselves in and out of the workforce quite frequently in their early lives and eventually have to work as contractors in order to make a living—again, with volatile incomes which make it even harder to manage regular loan payments and potentially with private debt managers on their backs.


There are a lot of aspects of this bill that are very worrying. I go back to the initial point: this is a government that claims that debt is bad but is very, very happy to saddle very young people with debt at this level at the very early stages of their adult life. I would ask government members to seriously consult on this and see if they can find ways around some of the issues that I have raised.

Ms PRICE
 (Durack) (19:16):  I rise today to speak on a piece of legislation that will provide the framework for the delivery of new jobs for Australian workers and for Australia's investment in the highly skilled future workforce. To do this, the Abbott government is implementing key policy measures, including the Trades Support Loans Bill 2014, which is before the House today. This is a program that directly invests in our apprentices by providing the support they need to complete their training.


One of Australia's key focuses is on ensuring our future generations are provided with a highly competitive and internationally recognised education. However, not all forms of education and training are facilitated in the classroom or at a university level. The Abbott government recognises this distinction and the need to invest in education not just for university students but for those whose employment future lies in a trade, such as carpentry or as a diesel motor mechanic—two trades that are currently listed on Australia's National Skills Needs List.


The establishment of the Trade Support Loans program was a key election commitment by the Abbott government. The Trade Support Loans program is a $1.9 billion investment by this government to support our apprentices financially, with the overall aim being to help increase training completion rates, which are currently a serious concern for Australia's future workforce, particularly in regional Australia. In fact, 20 per cent of trade apprentices drop out by the end of their first year and around 30 per cent by the end of the second year. Research has highlighted that a key reason for this high rate of dropouts is the associated wage in the early years of an apprenticeship. 


The Trade Support Loans program is one measure that this government is introducing to help ease this financial burden, increase the rate of trade completions and to ensure that Australia has a highly skilled workforce in the future. From 1 July, apprentices will have the opportunity to apply for loans of up to $20,000, which will be repayable once apprentices are earning a sustainable income. Let us be clear: in the first year an apprentice can have $8,000 to support themselves, $6,000 in their second year, $4,000 in their third year, and $2,000 in their fourth year. Repayments will function in the same manner as Australia's FEE-HELP loans, which are received by university students. They will be repaid through our taxation system at the same income thresholds as higher education loans. Loans will be indexed annually in line with CPI and, as we know, when a loan is subject to CPI this simply means that it is adjusted based on the cost of living.


The program has also been set up with a significant incentive for apprentices to complete their trade, with a 20 per cent reduction in the amount of the loan they have accumulated throughout their apprenticeship once they complete their training. This program will effectively replace Labor's Tools For Your Trade payment, which had become an unaccountable handout under the former government.


In Durack, one group who make a significant contribution to the electorate by helping to increase the amount of people who complete their traineeships in industries such as engineering, mining, automotive, tourism and agriculture and horticulture is Kimberley Group Training. KGT achieves this by helping to establish career pathways through training, sustainable employment opportunities and support services under the stewardship of CEO John Gummery and board chair Peter Stubbs. I was very pleased to recently join with the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Nigel Scullion, in announcing funding of $187,000 for this organisation under the government's Indigenous Employment Program to support Indigenous job seekers in the Kimberley to gain trade and traineeship qualifications. Despite organisations like KGT, in Western Australia there was an overall decrease in the number of apprenticeship completions in 2012-13 of approximately six per cent, while there was also a decrease in the number of apprenticeship commencements across all regions of WA of approximately 12 per cent. However, completions in building and construction in rural WA did increase by approximately 28 per cent in 2012-13. But the same cannot be said for most other trade sectors, which saw stagnant or lower completion rates during this same period. The Trade Support Loans program is a key policy initiative by the Abbott government that focuses on improving these completion rates.


If we want a strong, highly skilled workforce for the future, especially in Durack, then we need to act now to create it. Supporting our apprentices when they need it most is how this will be achieved and should be supported by all. I commend this bill to the House.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (19:21):  I rise to speak on the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014 and the Trade Support Loans (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2014. This bill establishes the Trade Support Loans program for Australian apprentices. These loans will be concessional and income contingent, with a lifetime limit of $20,000 indexed from 2017. The loans are repayable when the person's income reaches the Higher Education Loan Program—that is, HELP—repayment threshold. The bill allows for a 20 per cent discount to be applied for the loan incurred when an Australian apprentice completes their apprenticeship.


The opposition will be supporting this legislation, but there still remain a number of concerns in relation to its position as far as apprentices are concerned. This government has a record of saying one thing before an election and another thing after the election. Prior to the 2013 election, Tony Abbott announced the Trade Support Loans. He did not tell apprentices that the government was going to scrap Labor's $1 billion Tools For Your Trade Payment, which is $5,500 per apprentice. I think this was a mean and tricky trick. This is the government only telling part of the truth: 'Yes, we'll give you a loan, but, no, we're not going to pay for the tools of trade.' It is an absolute disgrace that this government says one thing before an election and another thing after the election and tries to trick the Australian people by using words with double meanings and framing all of its comments in a way that can mislead people.


I am really appalled at what this government has done in so many areas. Like many members in this parliament, I have been contacted by a number of apprentices, and even by employers who are committed to employing apprentices. They can see that this legislation is going to cause some hardship and leave young people with debts into the future. I think about one of the employers not far from my electorate, Heather, who has a hairdressing salon, Feathers. She has been employing apprentices for well over 20 years. She is totally committed to employing apprentices. She has two apprentices at the moment. One is a school-based apprentice. With no access to Tools For Your Trade Payments, this legislation forces school based apprentices—and the apprentices that Heather employs—to borrow money to buy the scissors, hair dryers and all the other equipment that hairdressers need. It forces young people into a situation where they will incur debt. I want to put on the record my thanks to Heather from Feathers for the great job that she has done and the commitment that she has made to apprentices. She is a model for employers throughout this country for the fact that she understands that, at one time, there was a hairdresser employer that gave her the opportunity to undertake her apprenticeship. She took that opportunity and is now providing that opportunity to young people in the electorate I represent. I encourage more employers throughout Australia to do what Heather does and to take on apprentices.


In doing so, I have to say that I am very disappointed with the government—particularly with the minister, when he said that young people were using the money that they received from the Tools For Your Trade Payments to buy mag wheels for their cars and to get tattoos. I was listening to the debate a little earlier today and heard one of the previous speakers in the debate saying that apprentices can borrow the money that will be available through the Trade Support Loans Bill to buy a car. On one hand, you had a situation where apprentices were getting money to purchase their tools of trade, and now they are going to be forced into a situation where they must borrow the money to access those tools of trade. To be quite frank, I do not think it is good to force young people into a position where they need to access loans to be able to purchase tools and equipment. It really puts them in a position where they are incurring a huge cost right at the beginning of their working life.


The provision of the optional loan is not opposed by us on this side of the House, but it should not have come at the expense of the tools of trade scheme. The two schemes should run together. Unfortunately, the Abbott government is showing its real commitment to apprentices by axing the tools of trade scheme, the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program, and another scheme that I am particularly supportive of, and have been over a number of years: the Australian Apprenticeships Mentoring Program. That program works to help those young people who are undertaking an apprenticeship and who may be struggling, for either financial or social reasons. They might be struggling with one aspect of their apprenticeship, and that mentoring service program allows them to get the support that they need to get through their apprenticeship. I have spoken to apprenticeship organisations, and they have told me just how important that scheme is and how so many of their apprentices have benefited from the scheme. This government is cutting those programs that have helped so many young people when they have been undertaking their apprenticeships. There are a number of issues that I don't think are very clear at this stage: the government hasn't been very clear about the financial considerations, which are a major barrier for apprentices taking up training or completing it; and the measures will have little impact on the skills shortage.


In Australia we have had a chronic skills shortage for a number of years. When Labor was in power, we addressed this shortage by putting in place a number of programs that helped young people take up apprenticeships and by targeting areas where we needed apprentices. Unfortunately, this legislation will do very little to attract young people to undertake apprenticeships. 


In the Hunter and Newcastle, many young people have undertaken apprenticeships over the years. I remember years ago when I was working in the employment area young school leavers or final-year students would come in and I would ask them what they wanted to do. A very high percentage of those young people said they wanted to be hairdressers—that tended to be the girls—boilermakers or fitters. I truly believe that young people who express a desire to undertake apprenticeships in the future will struggle to access them with this legislation.


A person taking out one of the loans will not completely repay it until they have paid back any HELP debt they have. That is pretty hard for a young person, and it has the potential to extend the time taken to repay the loan considerably. The relatively low income of many tradespeople, particularly when they first start out, is going to lead to this period being drawn out and to the possibility of there being a high default rate. This could mean that the program is going to cost the taxpayer a lot of money. The program is available to cert III and cert IV courses, and the loan must be paid to the apprentice at the completion of each instalment period.


In the shadow minister's contribution to the debate, she said that the government did not advise the Australian people before the last election that they were going to abolish the Tools For Your Trade program. Also they have not adequately explained this legislation, the interest rate or the full liability of the loans in plain English. They haven't offered adequate protection for school based apprentices under the age of 18, and that raises a question: is this government asking young people under the age of 18 to sign a contract? If not, they will need to involve their parents or guardians. They need to explain to the Australian people how this will work and make sure that career counsellors—who no longer have access to the Job Guide or myfuture, because this government is defunding those fantastic tools—in schools know how this program will operate so that they can give the right advice to the young people who are leaving school.


The shadow minister also raised the issue of fair and reasonable transition arrangements for current apprentices. This legislation is pulling the rug out from under the feet of young apprentices—those who have made decisions based on the programs that were in place. There is no grandfathering of the previous program and it is not allowing young people who have made a commitment to undertake an apprenticeship to finish their apprenticeship under the rules that were in place when they started. It is changing the rules and shifting the goalposts in the middle of a game, and that isn't good enough. The government needs to rethink that aspect of it, make sure that there is adequate privacy protection—that is, point 5 of the amendment that was moved by the shadow minister—and offer apprentices the option of lump sum payments in order to purchase expensive items.


There are a number of very short-sighted moves accompanying this program. The apprentice mentoring program and Tools For Your Trade program are ending, and this undermines the legislation. As I said at the commencement of my contribution to this debate, we, on this side of the House, will not be opposing this legislation but we certainly have a number of concerns. I hope I have outlined fully the concerns that I have for those apprentices and the employers who have made the commitment to offer young people apprenticeships. While supporting this legislation, I have some serious concerns.

"Taylor, Angus, MP",LP,2014-06-23,"



Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume) (19:36):  Few issues can be more important for the future of this country and certainly the future of my electorate than the twin problems of chronic youth unemployment and chronic skill gaps. To understand the situation we have and the trade support loans bills that are before the House, it is worth going back over some of the problems created by the last government. From 2004 to towards the end of 2007, under the previous Howard government we saw 13 per cent increases in youth employment rates but between 2008 and last year we saw an eight per cent reduction in youth employment rates, whilst the overall employment market increased by eight per cent, and we saw the participation rates for people under the age of 25 falling from 71 per cent to 66 per cent, having climbed in the previous five years. We are at the point now where we have youth unemployment rates of 12.4 per cent, compared to just under six per cent for the overall economy. We are now at the point where one in three unemployed people are aged under 25 and we have hot spots of youth unemployment in places like Burnie and Devonport of over 20 per cent. So this is a very serious problem that the previous government failed to address.


Let us take a deeper look at apprenticeships and training. In the final quarter of 2013 commencements in apprenticeships dropped 19.6 per cent when compared to the previous year and completions decreased by 24 per cent relative to the previous year. These numbers are worrying but the numbers are even bleaker for trades and technical training in particular. We see—and we have heard this from previous speakers—that fewer than 50 per cent of people are finishing their courses. We are consistently seeing that now.


The Department of Employment has done some notable research in the area. In a 2013 report it demonstrated that shortages exist for a number of occupations, particularly amongst the trades. The concentration of skill shortages within trades is demonstrated by the fact that six professions were in shortage in 2013 and 18 technicians and trade worker occupations were in shortage. Some of the specific areas, which are of great concern to my electorate, include: food trades, where only slightly over 50 per cent of the positions are filled; construction trades; and resource related trades, where again slightly over 50 per cent of the positions are filled. Further, that report said, with regard to food trades:


Recruitment of food trades workers remained difficult in 2013, with around half of surveyed vacancies filled … and 1.5 suitable applicants per vacancy (compared with 1.8 in 2012). 


In addition to that research, the Australian Industry Group employer survey from 2012 shows that technicians and trade workers represent the most significant areas of skill shortage. It is a much larger number than for any other occupational group, with 33.3 per cent of survey respondents noting shortages in this area. The AiG report summarises:


Completion rates for Australian Apprenticeships are unacceptably low at approximately 55.4%. This represents a significant economic cost—


and it is a great problem for the economy. Our policy, which is in the legislation in front of the House, is aimed at addressing this. I will not repeat the details of the policy. In contrast to what we heard from the member for Shortland, it is worthwhile looking at what the experts have to say about this legislation. Again the AiG, the Australian Industry Group, said:


The Trade Support Loans Scheme is a positive step, enabling apprentices to access financial support over the course of their apprenticeship. We particularly commend the completion incentive built into the loan structure. 


That is a very important part of the structure of this policy because it is designed to get people to finish their courses. We know that is as big a problem as getting them to start. Finally, we heard from the NGO by the name of BUSY, whose CEO is Paul Miles:


The Trade Support Loans are a fantastic solution to ease the financial burden by providing apprentices with real support while they complete their skills training


I commend this legislation to the House.

"MacTiernan, Alannah, MP",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (19:42):  It is quite amazing that the program before us is being hailed as something that is going to encourage more people to enter the trades. The primary argument appears to be that it will encourage them to continue and complete their trade training. If we look at the package in the trade support loans bills that the Abbott government is delivering, we will see results very different to that. It almost beggars belief that they could claim that a government that is cutting $5,500 from each apprentice—without any electoral mandate whatsoever—is somehow adopting a stance that is likely to encourage more apprentices into training and encourage those apprentices who are training to stay in training. It is absolute nonsense.


We are supporting the legislation here tonight because this trade support loans program is really now all that is going to be on offer for apprentices and to stimulate trade training, but we have to say it is a vastly inferior package to that that was available under Labor. Labor positively encouraged apprenticeships. We had a meeting the other day in Perth of a group of young apprentices from a whole range of trades. There were about 15 young guys there from the Princess Margaret worksite. They were appalled by the statements that had been made by ministers of this government. The Minister for Industry said that the problem with the Tools For Your Trade program that had been offered under Labor was that they all raced off and got tattooed and were not spending it on their trade training. That is completely contemptuous of these young people who have embraced trade training. Indeed, it is treating these apprentices in a way that no government would ever deal with any business. The idea that these young people have signed up to apprenticeships understanding that they were going to get, over the course of their trade training, a tax-free benefit of $5,500—having signed up and committed themselves to take on jobs that are, it would be fair to say, very modestly paid—to then find the ground rules have changed is, I believe, unacceptable. It is a bad policy. To introduce this in such a way that those people who have already made a commitment to an apprenticeship—who have started their training and entered into financial commitments—then find the ground rules have changed is particularly unacceptable.


What we are seeing happen is apprentices are now being hit twice. Not only are they losing the Tools For Your Trade scheme, they are also facing the actions of state governments. In Western Australia, in particular, I know that with the deregulation of TAFE fees the cost of doing an apprenticeship has increased very dramatically, particularly for those young people who are working for smaller employers and have to cover their own fees. This is a huge liability. We have lots of people now in their second or third year of apprenticeship and suddenly all the ground rules have changed. Not only are they losing their Tools For Your Trade assistance scheme for the life of their apprenticeship, they are also being required to pay much higher apprenticeship fees.


I will quote a few people. Mercey contacted us. He is a young apprentice carpenter from Perth in his 20s. He has two jobs: he is an apprentice during the week and he works at the local supermarket each weekend to make ends meet. In total, working that seven days a week earns him the princely sum of $870. He works for a very small employer and has to cover the cost of his own fees which are now, he tells us, some $12,000 over three years. He is absolutely stunned that the government could unilaterally take away Tools For Your Trade, which had been very much a part of his decision-making on going into his apprenticeship. To suggest that taking out a loan for $20,000, that will have to be paid back, is in any way a better deal for him is just a complete and utter fantasy.


Danielle has contacted us. She is very concerned. Her partner has finished all the coursework for his adult apprenticeship in light vehicle mechanics and was due for his final payment not long after the cut-off date. Danielle and her partner have two children and the Tools For Your Trade payment was used to purchase all the extra tools he needs to do the job that an already tight budget could not stretch to. Here you have a young man, with a young family, seeking to obtain skills. Obviously, it is hard to manage with a family on the very modest pay of an apprentice. Now the Tools For Your Trade payments have been cut it will be so much more of a struggle. How is this going to encourage more people into apprenticeships? It is absurd.


We had Erica contact us. Erica is a hairdressing principal. She said:


I have just heard from my hard-working, low paid young hairdressing apprentices that the Tools For Your Trade payment has been cancelled from July. This is a great disadvantage to them, considering they pay their own TAFE fees and have to purchase all their tools while earning under $11 an hour for their first year. A set of straighteners for a professional can cost at least $2,000.


A whole $8.30 a week! We should be supporting apprentices.




Mr Nikolic:
  Luckily the trade support loans will cover it!




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  They now need to, on their very low income, enter into a loan! Obviously this makes this a much more unattractive proposition. I find it extraordinary that you cannot see that. Of course, they can go and take out a loan!


I do not know whether you expect that hairdressers, once graduated, will be earning anything like doctors and lawyers. I suspect not. This whole proposal is predicated on treating trade training like university education because people who have university educations, the argument goes, make 75 per cent above the average earnings, so they can afford to pay these higher contributions. That is why we are asking them to repay more money more quickly.




Mr Nikolic:
  You don't have to borrow the full amount!




Ms MacTIERNAN:
  That is just for one item. 'Just borrow it!'


If we go back to the basics, we see there is a decline in the take-up of trade training in this country. We are going to go out and stimulate that. How are we going to stimulate that? We are going to remove a tax free grant, structured over the life of the training; we are going to take that away and give them a loan. That is really going to get people fired up; that is a much better deal!


Not only that, it does not actually deal with some of the real issues around the attrition rate of apprentices. The member for Parramatta set out some very good economic arguments as to why this structure certainly will not be conducive to encouraging people to continue with their apprenticeship. One of the key things we have to do is expose young people to trades earlier. The development of trade training centres in schools was very much part of that. While they were still at school, young people in year 9 and year 10 on had the opportunity to try out different trades—to get an understanding of what it is like to work with metal, what it is like to work with machines or what it is like to work with wood—and acquire some of those cert I and cert II qualifications while they were in a structured environment.


School based, technical trade training has two real advantages. One is it gives kids an opportunity while they are still at school to get an idea of what those trade skills are like and whether or not it is something they like doing, even more so where schools have relationships with industry so kids can go out from school into structured workplace learning environments. The second thing is it allows young people of 15 and 16 to operate in the more structured environment of school, where there is a higher level of supervision and pastoral care. We had some very interesting evidence from Morley Senior High School, which is in my electorate and has been a registered training organisation for 10 years. Their trainees who do cert I and cert II through the school have a really high rate of success. They compared the environment that is offered at their school to the environment that is offered at institutes such as Polytechnic West, which is more suited to adult learners and perhaps people who do not have the same lack of development of the executive function that one might find with a normal 15- and 16-year-old. They said that introducing trade skills and doing the early certificates in the more structured school environment had been very successful, so that when their apprentices go out at the age of 17 or 18 they are much better placed and equipped to operate within an adult workplace.


I think it is highly unfortunate that we cut the trade training centres. If we were truly concerned about the lack of people going into trades and the very high attrition levels, we would have looked very closely at that model of VET being delivered in schools in those early years and seen how that can indeed augment the quality of young people taking up apprenticeships. But, no, instead of doing that we cut the trade training centres. And not only have we done that—and this is apropos a discussion I had in this place earlier in the day—we have been taking all the brakes off 457 visas, which is undercutting a requirement to have a culture of training our own people. There are many easy solutions available that involve just bringing people in, rather than training our own. As I said, we are supporting this loans scheme, but anyone that thinks that this is a superior option that will see us reverse the very unfortunate decline in the take-up of trades is greatly deluded.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (19:55):  As someone who comes from a family of tradesmen and who continues to interact in a tradesmen-rich environment in Launceston, I rise to speak in support of the government's $1.9 billion trades support loans. There is strong support for this scheme across my electorate of Bass. Since the budget I have given a number of speeches across my electorate. In my roles as the patron of cycling in Tassie and the patron of Northern Tasmanian Netball, I have interacted with young people at schools and talked to them about how we are expanding opportunities across our country when it comes to earning—opportunities both in pre-degree courses and, importantly, in vocational education and training.


The response that I get is very similar to the one that I got when I arrived at the Army Recruit Training Centre as the Commandant. They used to fundraise each year and fund a scholarship for a young person studying at the local university. But it became very clear that we were only touching part of our constituency in the Riverina environment, that there were a whole bunch of people undertaking vocational education and training who never had that opportunity. So we came up with a separate scholarship which we would award each year for a three-year period for someone doing an apprenticeship. It was a very welcome initiative. The comments I got related to fairness and acknowledging that there was more than just one pathway in our society, through university, and that there were other important pathways.


The tradesmen that I have discussed this with in my electorate of Bass are similarly positive about the scheme and the fact that it will target occupations on the National Skills Needs List such as plumbers, diesel mechanics, electricians and fitters. I have a friend in Launceston who has been a plumbing contractor of 37 years. His name is Andrew Foley. He says:


It's a long time coming, and anything we can do to help kids into a trade, as we do for young people into university, is a good thing.


He acknowledges that expansion of opportunity, not just for the 80,000 young people who will get an opportunity to do a pre-degree course under the HELP scheme with the additional opportunities that provides, but for apprentices as well. Another plumber friend, John Oldenhof, who is now in his 70s but is still putting in a full day's work and a whole lot of volunteering in my Lions Club, is another fan. John sees this also as an overdue measure that acknowledges the realities in our society. John says:


It doesn't matter where they start, providing they start, and this scheme has a very powerful incentive.


What Andrew and John and many other people in northern Tasmania like best about this scheme is that it has choice at its heart.


Apprentices can choose to access the full amount or part of it. And it does contain an important incentive: upon completion of training, the loan amount will be cut by 20 per cent, up to a value of $4,000. It is called reinforcing success and encouraging our young people to start something and to finish it. All too often, young apprentices do not complete their training because they cannot afford the costs associated with undertaking an apprenticeship, so this is about providing a hand-up early in the careers of our young people to ease their financial burden by front loading that financial assistance during the initial years when they need it most. That means support of up to $8,000 in the first year of the apprenticeship, $6,000 in the second, $4,000 in the third and $2,000 in the fourth. It is a clearly superior incentive to the $4,000 tool kit grant under those opposite which had become an unaccountable handout that did little to help apprentices complete their training.


So let's put the negativity away and acknowledge that young people are over $6,000 better off in their first year with this scheme compared to the previous one. Our hope is that they will complete their training, be rewarded with the $4,000 incentive deduction, go on and have productive careers, earn good wages and raise a family, pay their taxes and contribute to a healthy, prosperous society. The trade support loans will be repayable at the same income thresholds as university HELP loans when an apprentice starts earning a sustainable wage of above $50,000. Importantly, the loans are the best sorts of loans: they are interest free and constitute an early investment in the potential of the individual.


With that, I know a lot of other speakers are keen to have a say this evening, so I will cut my remarks short. I commend this bill to the House and I look forward to its commencement on 1 July.

"Mitchell, Rob, MP",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen—Second Deputy Speaker) (20:00):  I rise to speak on the amendment to the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014 second reading motion. Firstly, I, like most Australians, am furious but, sadly, not surprised by yet another Abbott government broken promise. This is a government that is built on lies. Prior to the election, the Liberal Party was spruiking the introduction of the trade support loans, telling apprentices that the coalition would 'provide better support for Australian apprentices'. There was absolutely no mention whatsoever that the government was planning to scrap the Tools For Your Trade program.


The Tools For Your Trade program was vital to and heavily relied upon by Australian apprentices. The $5,500 provided was used to buy the necessary tools and equipment for apprentices to be able to complete their training. Depending on their field, the money would be used to purchase important safety gear, drills, uniforms, knives, scissors or hair dryers—all the items required to complete their apprenticeship. But now our apprentices have been slapped in the face, yet again, with an Abbott budget of broken promises. In fact, before the election, the coalition went on record to confirm that they were keeping the Tools For Your Trade program. For the benefit of the member for Paterson, who earlier in the chamber was unaware of this, in The Sydney Morning Herald on 26 August 2013 it was stated:


The coalition loans will be made available in addition to the commonwealth Tools For Your Trade incentive scheme …


As we know—it is the reason we are here today—this is just another in a long line of broken promises by the Abbott government.


In my electorate of McEwen, we have a large number of young people entering into trades and apprenticeships. Recently I received an email from a registered training organisation in the printing industry, explaining how the Tools For Your Trade cuts are already affecting the writer's apprentices. He said:


Some of our apprentices have purchased tools and now they will be left out of pocket. The printing trade already has a skills shortage and this just makes it harder, especially in our regional areas.


By cutting the Tools For Your Trade program so suddenly, with no grandfathering system in place, our apprentices are now out of pocket. It has become quite clear those opposite do not understand apprenticeships. They do not understand that apprentices get a lower wage than other workers during their time as an apprentice. This means they are behind the eight ball from day one.


The sting of this funding cut is made even more painful with the Abbott government cutting other essential and important apprentice programs. For example, the apprentice mentoring program provided experienced tradies as mentors in the relevant field the apprentice had enrolled in. This program meant the apprentice would be able to ask questions and seek advice on their training from someone who knew the ropes. This program meant a higher success rate in apprentice programs because apprentices had someone to talk to about their issues—a sounding board, if you like—but the Prime Minister has scrapped this program as well. This comes at a time when an apprentice probably needs more help than ever since the government is openly turning its back on apprentices and those undertaking vocational training. Mr Abbott's Treasury spokesman is on the record saying the coalition would 'abolish' trade training centres in schools, while Labor promised all secondary schoolkids will have access to trade training centres by 2018. Right across the electorate of McEwen, these trade training centres have been delivering opportunities for kids who may drop out of school early and not take those opportunities. Mr Abbott failed to release a skills and training policy in 2010, and the so-called 'Real Solutions' pamphlet made no reference to this area, but now he is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of apprentices.


In contrast, the Labor government was already providing apprentices with the tools they need for their trade, via the Tools For Your Trade payment scheme. We also introduced a HECS style loan for VET course fees in 2009. That helped some 55,000 students in 2012. Labor has helped 70,000 Australians into an apprenticeship through Apprentice Kickstart. We announced the $35 million Step into Skills program, which would deliver foundation skills to 8,900 disadvantaged young people to boost their chances of securing a job or further training, although this has since been cut by the Abbott government. Ours is the party that is committed to skills. It was the Labor government which invested more than $19 billion in skills and training over the last five years. Those last five years have delivered more opportunities than ever before for many young people, particularly those in rural and regional areas, where job chances are slim and opportunities are not that great.


In this latest budget, almost $2 billion has been cut from support and training for Australia's apprentices and workers, including the National Workforce Development Fund, the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program, the Accelerated Australian Apprenticeships program, the Alternative Pathways Program, the Apprentice to Business Owner Program and the Step into Skills program. These are just a precious few of the programs cut by this government. If the Prime Minister really does believe he will 'provide better support for Australia's apprentices', then he has a twisted way of showing it. These loans are not a hand up; they are just a hand in your pocket.


The Trade Support Loans scheme will be supported on this side of the House in light of no other assistance programs being made available to our apprentices. However, let it be known that the amendments we would like made to the bill are essential in ensuring our apprentices are supported and not disadvantaged in any way. These amendments ensure apprentices are aware of how and when the funding and training cuts will affect them. They ensure apprentices, especially school age apprentices, are fully aware of the financial implications involved in a trade support loan. They ensure that the privacy and legal arrangements involved in a trade support loan are maintained to the highest standard.


If Australia is to go forth and improve manufacturing, improve skills, improve trades and not rely on a flood of 457 visa workers, we need to support young people and give them every opportunity through different pathways to make a career for themselves and to give them a future. It is important that we do this due to the globalisation of our economy and the need we face particularly in areas like McEwen, where you have massive housing growth and business opportunities. We need to ensure that we have tradespeople available to service those needs, to build those homes, to build those roads and to do the things that we need to do. I know, having been an apprentice in the shoe industry, which is long gone from our shores, that it is an important thing to have an apprenticeship. It was an important job opportunity to fall back on should anything go wrong. I think that it is important that we make sure kids get every opportunity, to make sure that this country can grow and develop and be the best that we can be. In supporting this bill, we want to make sure that the government knows that we will be here and watching, and making sure that we support apprentices and young people in their future.

Mr SUKKAR
 (Deakin) (20:08):  It gives me great pleasure to speak in support of the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014. A lot of speakers on the other side of the chamber have spoken begrudgingly about the benefits of the Trade Support Loans program. I must say that offering apprentices $20,000 over the life of a four-year apprenticeship, heavily front-ended for the first and second years of their apprenticeship, is, in my view, overwhelmingly positive. I have a lot of apprentices in my electorate. Indeed, since the budget I have visited a number of training facilities and spoken to those apprentices. The $5,500 that was provided under the Tools For Your Trade program just was not enough over a four-year period. In contrast, the $20,000 that will be provided under the Trade Support Loans program will offer for those people who need it more access to greater funding. And those that do not want to take it up do not have to. The beauty of the Trade Support Loans program will be that if you are in a trade that does not require the sort of additional support, or you do not need the additional income supplement, that the Trade Support Loans program offers, you do not need to take it up.


I think members opposite, in a sense, want the status quo. Fifty per cent of the people who commence an apprenticeship not finishing—they think that is acceptable. Increasing youth unemployment—they obviously think that is acceptable because they are offering no changes to the system that has not provided the sort of solutions that we need. But business-as-usual just was not an option in our view.


The Trade Support Loans program offers incentives for apprentices to ensure that they are provided a discount when they do complete their apprenticeship: a 20 per cent discount on the face value of the loan taken out through the trade support loan—a maximum of $4,000. Offering that kind of incentive I think is going to ensure that we head in the right direction in completion rates for apprentices. But the main point—and I think this is one of the big reasons we find apprentices unable to continue and, indeed, finish their apprenticeship—is that often you are working ridiculously long hours and you are getting up at the crack of dawn but you have peers and friends who might be working at McDonald's or Red Rooster getting paid more than you. So it is very, very demotivating. It is very hard to continue working that hard for four years. I think that is one of the big reasons why our completion rates for apprentices have been getting worse.


The $20,000 Trade Support Loans program goes a long way to improving that situation. There is great flexibility for what the apprentices can put the $20,000 towards—$8,000 in year 1, $6,000 in year 2, $4,000 in year 3 and $2,000 in the final year. So it is heavily front-ended to the years where the wages in the apprenticeship are the lowest. We think that is going to assist apprentices to hang on in those first couple of years. We know that apprentices disproportionally drop out in those first and second years. So if we can help them get through that initial period and into years 3 and 4, we think that we can increase the completion rates for apprentices. That is what this program is all about.


The status quo is not working. Members opposite talk about the requirement to attract apprentices. Fifty per cent of people dropping out is not going to achieve that goal. It is hard enough to attract apprentices to start with. Once we get them in the door, we have to do everything we possibly can to ensure that they complete their apprenticeship. That is why I am very proud of the Trade Support Loans program. There is nothing that Trade Support Loans do not offer that Tools For Your Trade did. The net present value of $20,000 loan with the $4,000 discount is a hell of a lot more than the $5,500 from Tools For Your Trade. If it is simply a comparison between the two programs—which it should not be, but if it is—then this is a good news story and this is something that I think the parliament should be agreeing to, not in a begrudging way but actually happily telling our apprentices: 'We value you and we want to support you as much as we support those people entering tertiary study.'


The days of having apprentices as second-class citizens are over. People who have undertaken tertiary study have been able to access concessional loans only repayable once they earned over $50,000, or thereabouts. We are offering that same opportunity to apprentices now. So this is a fantastic good news story, and I am very pleased to support it. I understand that, given that it is such good news for apprentices, many of my coalition colleagues would like to speak on this bill, so I will end my comments there.

"Watts, Tim, MP",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (20:13):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014. Since the federal budget there has been a lot of attention given to the plight of university students under this government—and deservedly so, given the Prime Minister's insistence on breaking yet another election promise in order to massively increase both university fees and the cost of student debt. But it is not only university students who are suffering under the Abbott government.


Australians undertaking apprenticeships and vocational education will also suffer from cost-shifting and buck-passing under this government. This bill establishes the Trade Support Loans program for Australian apprentices. The Trade Support Loans program was announced by the then opposition prior to the 2013 election. But what then then opposition leader, now Prime Minister, did not tell apprentices before the last election was that he also intended to scrap the $1 billion Tools For Your Trade program, established by the previous Labor government.


On this point, I note that the member for Paterson indicated, during his contribution to this debate, that the opposition had been upfront with the Australian people about their intent to axe the Tools For Your Trade program before the last election. But when challenged on this point by the member for Hunter, the member for Paterson declined to provide evidence for this claim. Given the recent penchant of those opposite to tell fibs about the fictions they told voters at the last election, to offer furphies about the fabrications they offered to voters, and to provide falsehoods today to justify the fraud they perpetuated at the last election, it would assist the House greatly if Minister Macfarlane could table evidence for the member for Paterson's claim during his summing up of this debate. I call on him to do so.


The Tools For Your Trade program provided up to $5,500 per apprentice in tax-exempt cash payments to support apprentices with the costs of their training, buying tools needed for their apprenticeship, and other costs associated with their apprenticeship. In its place, the optional loan scheme that was originally intended to be made available in addition to the Tools For Your Trade payment, as a supplement for these cash payments, now remains as the only specific financial support offered by the government to apprentices.


Anyone who has had an apprentice in the family knows that many apprenticeships carry very high costs for the tools and equipment needed on the job. The financial reality for these apprentices is that as a result of the policies of the Abbott government, instead of being able to utilise government support to meet these costs, these costs will now be covered by a loan that must be repaid to the Commonwealth.


For many apprentices who have already commenced their trades under the previous government, this could mean up to $3,700 lost in future payments for a first-year apprentice. Providing loan based support for apprentices is not opposed by those on this side of the chamber. It is a useful method for providing additional support for people taking the initiative to improve their skills. But it should not have come at the expense of the Tools For Your Trade scheme that provides an appropriate level of support for people making the decision to make a long-term commitment to improving their skills and education.


Unfortunately, the Tools For Your Trade program is just one area where the Abbott government is cutting support for apprentices and shifting the costs of these apprentices to state and family budgets. Also suffering the effects of Tony Abbott's apprenticeships axe are the Australian Apprenticeships Access Program, the Australian Apprenticeships Mentoring Program and the Apprentice to Business Owner program. These programs have all been axed by a government that is telling young Australians they ought to be learning or earning, while at the same time attacking the very programs that assist them to do so.


This bill provides for the introduction of trade support loans of up to $20,000 to be repaid on an income-contingent basis. Loans of this kind may well be a worthy supplement to other forms of government support for apprentices. But given that these loans will be available to school based apprentices aged 16 to 18, measures need to be put in place to protect children from the consequences of what are major financial decisions. This need is further heightened by the fact that the government intends to outsource debt management for trade support loans to the private sector, potentially leaving $20,000 debts incurred by 16-year-olds in the hands of private debt collectors. It is a worrying prospect, and these bills should include provisions to ensure that apprentices—particularly school based apprentices—receive appropriate advice to ensure that they make informed decisions about loans incurred under this program.


Issues like this have driven Labor to seek an inquiry into the bill through the Senate Economics Committee. This inquiry will examine the payment, by monthly instalments, of the loan amount; loan terms and conditions into the future; future outsourcing of debt management by the government; the protection of 16- to 18-year-old apprentices; and general loan advice to all apprentices.


However, as Tools For Your Trade participants have already been notified of the program closure, Labor is minded to support this bill. Of course, all the financial support in the world for apprentices will be for naught if the learning institutions that support apprentices are not themselves funded. In this respect, the record of the Liberal Party, particularly at the state level, is extremely poor. 


As I have previously informed the House, the impact of the state Victorian Liberal government's swingeing cuts to TAFE and VET funding in Melbourne's west have been particularly severe. In Melbourne's west, less than 50 per cent of the population have completed high school, and less than 10 per cent have completed a bachelor degree. We also have a very large migrant and culturally and linguistically diverse community, with over half of the resident population in Melbourne's west speaking a language other than English at home. I am talking of families like my own.


In this context, TAFEs are particularly important to Melbourne's west as providers of tailored employment training—often addressing skills gaps or deficits in basic education. The Victorian Liberal government's cut of $170 million in funding allocated to TAFEs to meet their community obligations, promote social inclusion and provide support to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, has particularly hurt Melbourne's west. One result of these cuts has been the retrenchment of more than 13 full-time youth and education support workers at Victoria University. These student support roles are particularly important for institutions like Victoria University, which support large numbers of students who are either the first members of their immediate families to engage in tertiary education or who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. These students often require a little more holistic support early on in their studies to ensure that they are able to make the challenging transition to tertiary study. These students often do not have the experienced support networks enjoyed by more privileged students and, as such, are at risk of dropping out of tertiary education early in their degrees.


More broadly, Victoria University, the primary provider of higher education in Melbourne's west, has been substantially impacted by the cuts in VET program subsidies by the Victorian Liberal government. Cuts to VU's program-subsidy funding constitute over 25 per cent of the total revenue of VU's TAFE. As a result, VU has been forced to undertake major retrenchments of its TAFE teachers and support staff. As VU is a major employer in Melbourne's west, this has also had obvious flow-on effects for the broader economy of the region. Cuts in VET fees in Melbourne's west have also had an impact on the fees faced by prospective students. When coupled with the Liberal government's decision to remove caps on VET student fees, the cuts in VET funding have had the inevitable consequence of pushing student fees higher.


TAFE providers are forced to increase fees to compensate for lost government funding in order to remain viable, with consequences for the accessibility of education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.


A further consequence of the Victorian Liberal government's cuts to VET funding is the knock-on effect that these cuts have on the accessibility of university study in Melbourne's west. As students from Melbourne's west are statistically more likely to come from lower socio-economic status backgrounds, they rely heavily on alternative pathways to university study—including VET programs, in particular.


Of particular concern is the state Liberal government's decision to dramatically reduce funding for VET Certificate I and II courses. These courses are generally not vocational in nature, but instead are used by disadvantaged students as bridging courses to further study. Limiting access to VET programs in Melbourne's west therefore has a pipeline effect of limiting access to university study for students in the region. The cumulative effect of these changes is to further entrench educational disadvantage in Melbourne's west.


The Abbott government tells us that the age of entitlement is over and that our young people must earn, learn or starve.




Mr Whiteley:
  Hear, hear!




Mr WATTS:
 I take that interjection from the government! Bills like this reveal the true unfairness of this prescription. The hard truth for young people in this country is that they are being asked to learn or earn, by this government, at the same time as they—the government, and their state Liberal colleagues—are making doing so that much harder.


If the government were serious about helping young Australians learn or earn, it would keep programs like the Tools For Your Trade scheme, the Australian Apprentices Access Program, the Australian Apprenticeships Mentoring Program and the Apprentice to Business Owner Program. The fact that they are pulling down the ladders at the same time as ripping away the safety net tells you all you need to know about their aspirations for the young people of this country.

Mr WHITELEY
 (Braddon) (20:23):  It is a pleasure tonight to speak in support of the Trade Support Loans Bill 2014. This is one of the many exciting initiatives in this year's budget with an eye to the future, with an eye to ensuring that our economy is sustainable and that every person in this nation has an opportunity to get ahead. The announcement by the Treasurer, on budget night, to introduce a new student loan scheme to assist young people with the costs associated in undertaking and completing an apprenticeship represents one of the most important shifts in a generation in the way the government and the community treats young people considering apprenticeships.


These reforms will have a significant positive impact on many young people in Braddon and Tasmania. For too long, some within previous governments and the wider community have viewed those who have chosen to undertake an apprenticeship as being of less value to the economy—that those who choose to go to university hold some sort of superior status. An apprenticeship is too readily viewed as the easier, inferior option for a young person and that they only do it if they are not smart enough to go to university. This bill goes an awful long way to dispelling that myth. 


Unfortunately for many young people in the past, undertaking an apprenticeship was made all the more difficult by this attitude. This attitude resulted in young apprentices not having access to deferred low-interest loans and financial arrangements similar to university students. The Trade Support Loans Bill puts an end to this act of social discrimination. This bill will reverse this damaging attitude and place apprentices on level pegging with university students—as does another great reform of this year's budget, to place more courses under the FEE-HELP scheme, in line with most university undergraduate degrees. As part of this reform, apprentices may be eligible for concessional income-contingent loans, in a similar fashion to FEE-HELP loans or the old HECS loan scheme. 


Under this new arrangement, apprentices in a priority occupation can receive up to $20,000 over four years, to be repaid at the same income thresholds as university students, which are currently set at about $53,000 per annum. Under the trade support loans payments will be made in arrears, with $8,000 available in the first year, $6,000 in the second, $4,000 in the third and $2,000 in the final year. In addition to providing many apprentices access to these loans, the government will also provide a 20 per cent discount on the loans—meaning apprentices will only pay $16,000 as a maximum, of the loan, when and if they complete the training.


I find it hard to accept the basis on which many of the speakers opposite have contributed tonight—that is, that there is something obviously wrong with a loan-scheme system when, in fact, the university-loan system has been working like this for years. I see this as a hypocritical approach to this particular bill and it has a slight reek of elitism. 


In addition to providing many apprentices access to these loans, it is really important to understand that there is currently a 30 per cent dropout rate in the first two years of an apprenticeship and about half of all apprentices who begin an apprenticeship fail to complete it. This is another reason that makes this Trade Support Loans Bill so important. It provides increased support to apprentices in the earlier stages of their apprenticeship, when their wages are lowest and when they need it most.


Furthermore, this money can be used to assist apprentices purchase tools, attend training in other towns and help with living expenses, under those circumstances, while earning lower wages, particularly in the first and second years.


In my state of Tasmania and particularly in the electorate of Braddon, these loans will have a significant impact on the ability of the region to recover from the dearth of skills needed to meet labour-market needs. One of the common issues facing many small and medium businesses in Braddon is simply that there are not the young apprentices undertaking training in skills-shortage areas. There is a mismatch between what businesses need and what the apprentices are taking up. Often this is not their fault. In fact, this is one of the many reasons the Gillard trade training centres were such a dismal failure. They set some young people up with skills and trades that were not in demand in the area where they lived. It was a lose-lose situation for both the student and the industry.


This issue was highlighted recently in a joint report by the Devonport Chamber of Commerce and Regional Development Australia—Tasmania. A key theme in the report is the need for more collaboration between the job seeker, industry and educational providers to ensure young people are undertaking skills development that is needed in the region. 


Trade support loans will achieve this by encouraging people to undertake training in skills-shortage areas, without the need to then move interstate because the trade training centre did not offer the training that local industry required. Under this program, an apprentice will be eligible for loan support if they are undertaking any trade on the skills shortage list. This may sound overprescriptive, but the list has over 60 trades, including fitters, turners, electricians, hairdressers, sheet metal workers, gasfitters, welders and mechanics—and the list goes on.


In addition to traditional trades, I am pleased to note that those undertaking a certificate II, III or IV in agriculture and horticulture will be eligible for these loans. This is hugely important for Braddon as the local dairying industry embarks on a massive expansion in coming years. There is also an expansion coming when it comes to horticulture, particularly in the area of berries. I hope that this scheme will encourage more young people to consider a life in the agricultural industry and that more of the jobs can be filled by qualified Tasmanians rather than mainlanders and workers from overseas.


In the six weeks since the budget, I have been overwhelmed by the support for this Trade Support Loans scheme from apprentices and parents, particularly parents of young people who are coming to that stage of life where they are considering what to do following school. Not only are current apprentices, future apprentices and their parents welcoming of this scheme for the financial support it provides to buy tools and to cover the cost of travelling to training courses, clothes and living expenses, but, just as importantly, it gives young people the confidence that they are making the right decision by going into an apprenticeship. They are contributing to the economy and they will be acknowledged by the government and the community for the contribution they make to the community. I thank the House.

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (21:00):  This year, 2014, marks the centenary of the Australian Red Cross. The Australian Red Cross was established at a momentous time in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia on 13 August 1914, just nine days after the start of World War I. It was Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, wife of Australia's sixth Governor-General, whose drive and determination was responsible for the formation of the ARC. By all accounts, Lady Ferguson was a dynamic and inspirational leader. In fact, she wrote to the mayor of every shire and municipality in Australia encouraging formation of a local branch of the fledgling ARC. Her letters were published in local papers across the country calling for public meetings, and it worked. Within four months, hundreds of branches were formed across the country, including a branch in Ipswich in my electorate. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers, mostly women, volunteered for the ARC during World War I. Between August 1914 and the signing of the armistice, the Australian Red Cross dispatched nearly 396,000 food parcels and around 40,000 clothing parcels—a tremendous effort.


By World War II, the ARC had become the largest charitable organisation in Australia and it was estimated that nearly half a million of Australia's seven million population volunteered for the ARC during the war. Following World War II, the ARC focused on social welfare, national emergencies, natural disasters, the blood bank and first aid programs—all sustained by an extensive branch network and thousands of volunteers. When Australians face natural disaster or tragedy, they know that the Red Cross will be at their side. We remember their efforts following the Bali bombings. Every Australian community has its own story of when the Red Cross came to help. For some communities it is a drought or a terrible bushfire. For my community, it was the floods of early 2011.


The ARC began their assistance on 27 December 2010 when the first evacuation centre was opened. I witnessed firsthand the wonderful work, care and professionalism of the Red Cross workers in flood evacuation and recovery centres across my electorate in South-East Queensland. Red Cross assisted some 14,600 people in these centres as flooding peaked across Queensland. In the year that followed, the Red Cross had more than 1,400 staff and trained volunteers working in flood-affected communities. In fact, so trusted was the ARC that they led the committee established by the Queensland Premier, known as the Queensland Premier's relief committee, which was chaired by Australian Red Cross Blood Service Chair, Dr David Hamill, the former Queensland Treasurer and member for Ipswich.


The ARC has played a vital role in the recovery of my community. It continues to play an active daily role in the electorate of Blair, with branches in Ipswich, Toogoolawah, and Red Cross charity shops in Ipswich, Toogoolawah and Kilcoy which support the everyday work of the Red Cross, including the Trauma Teddies, which are being handed out by volunteers and donated to any child or adult suffering, trauma, illness or chronic disease. They do tremendous work through the Homelessness Early Intervention Service based in Ipswich, the Red Cross Bridges program in Esk in the Somerset region, and helping people all over the place. 


Unfortunately, a cloud has been cast over the celebrations of the Red Cross's centenary year. The Red Cross was tremendously disappointed to learn that the government would not provide the $5 million general purpose grant this year. This grant has been provided by governments, both Coalition and Labor, since 2006. The loss of this funding will have a significant impact on the Red Cross, which has indicated that it will need to make budget savings that will have an impact on services, programs, staff, volunteers and support functions. The Red Cross is also dealing with the impact of other federal budget cuts by the Abbott government which will cause some of its programs to cease on 30 June this year with uncertainty of funding for ongoing programs. I encourage the government to restore this grant to the Red Cross.


Through 100 years, the Australian Red Cross, through word and action, has remained steadfastly dedicated to its motto, and I urge the government to change their current budget decision. The Red Cross motto is:


To be a leading humanitarian organisation in Australia, improving the lives of vulnerable people through services delivered and promotion of humanitarian laws and values.


The Red Cross has helped shape 100 years of Australia's social history. I congratulate the Red Cross on their centenary and I encourage local residents in Ipswich and the Somerset region to become a part of this year's celebration of Red Cross in Australia. I urge the government to reconsider their unnecessary, unwise and unjust budget cut of $5 million to the Red Cross.

Ms MacTIERNAN
 (Perth) (10:30):  Today I want to call upon the parliament to once and for all finalise the issue of voluntary euthanasia. I think it is fair to say that over the last 30 years we as a political class have failed to grapple with something that I believe is a very significant issue—that is, giving people in their final stages of life, particularly those suffering terminal illness, the capacity to be assisted in their process of dying. 


I think we have, as a political group, been far too timid to accept what is overwhelmingly supported by the Australian people; we should have a choice in those final stages of our lives as to whether we die with dignity or we are required to continue to suffer in pain and agony. 


Currently supporters of this within the Australian community outnumber the opponents six to one. I think it is time for us to act. I do not believe this is something that we can leave up to the state and territory governments. We have seen this attempted unsuccessfully in a number of jurisdictions. I believe there is clearly a head of power in section 51 that enables us to legislate medically based assistance for dying. I call upon us to think of these revolting cases we so often hear about, where people are required to suffer an immense indignity because we have been too fearful of legislating in this regard. 


In Western Australia we have seen some absolutely appalling cases. Herbert Erickson did not want to be a torchbearer for euthanasia, but this 81-year-old gentleman was found drowned in the ocean. He had cared for his wife for many years. They had a suicide pact. He smothered his wife and then attempted to kill himself. But his attempt failed. He was then charged with her murder and subsequently found guilty. He was forced, in his view, to take his own life in a more dramatic way. There was the case of Christian Rossiter, a paraplegic living in a nursing home, his health failing— (Time expired)

 (Blair) (11:00):  I move:


That this House notes:


(1) notes that:


(a) the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples (Congress) is the national representative body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and


(b) Congress:


   (i) was established with a view to creating a new relationship with governments to reset the relationship based on partnership and genuine engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; and


   (ii) is owned and controlled by its membership and independent of government;


(2) recognises:


(a) the important role of Congress as a leader and advocate for recognising the status and rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders as First Nations Peoples in Australia; and


(b) that the existence of an effective national body is essential to the Government's ability to fulfil its Closing the Gap targets;


(3) acknowledges that:


(a) Congress received Deductible Gift Recipient status in July 2013, allowing it to begin to pursue income opportunities with corporate Australia and the wider community;


(b) the previous government committed:


   (i) $29.2 million over four years to establish Congress; and


   (ii) $15 million over three years in the 2013 budget to support Congress to continue to develop income opportunities to sustain the organisation; and


(c) ongoing Commonwealth funding beyond 2013 is essential to support the continued sustainability of an independent national voice for First Nation Peoples;


(4) notes with concern that the Government plans to cut the $15 million funding and abandon the commitment to the sustainability of Congress as the national representative body for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples; and


(5) calls on the Government to commit to the sustainability of a strong Congress by honouring the $15 million funding commitment.


The Prime Minister's budget of broken promises and betrayal gutted more than $500 million from programs that support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. More than five weeks on, the government is yet to explain where most of the $500 million in cuts will fall. But the government had no trouble in deciding where to cut the first $15 million. Despite the government's rhetoric about a new engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the first cut this government made was to the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. The then opposition leader, now Prime Minister, in a speech to the Sydney Institute, on 15 March last year, said:


I want a new engagement with Aboriginal people to be one of the hallmarks of an incoming coalition government—and this will start from day one …


Well, the Prime Minister honoured this commitment by cutting $15 million from congress, the national representative body, owned and operated by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Labor are committed to genuine engagement and partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Central to Labor's efforts to strengthen relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples has been our continuing support for the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. 


The congress was established to represent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples across Australia and to provide a national voice in policy development and evaluation, independent of government. Today, congress has a growing membership of over 7,500 individuals, as well as hundreds of organisational members.


We acknowledge the valuable role of congress as leaders and advocates for the recognition and status and rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples as Australia's first nation peoples. The Kimberley Language Resource Centre, which I had the honour and privilege about a year or so ago of attending, is an organisation affiliated with and is a member of congress, as is the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women's Legal Service North Queensland Inc, in my home state of Queensland, is also a member of the organisation.


Congress engage a youth forum, which started in 2012, a representative body, and continue to make valuable contributions to parliament and the public debate in terms of policies in relation to our Indigenous people. As a member of various committees, I have personally witnessed contributions that congress has made to inquiries into FASD, constitutional recognition, the Gonski funding model and of course into the early education of Indigenous people. They released an education policy after extensive consultation, addressing issues including early childhood education, employment transition from school, bilingual education, ATSIA content and curriculum teacher education courses. 


They also partnered with the former federal Labor government and the member for Lingiari, when he was the Minister for Indigenous Health, in relation to the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan. They had been holding governments of both persuasions to account in relation to closing the gap. Co-chairs Les Malezer and Kirstie Parker have said of policy in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples:


Nothing about us without us.


Closing the gap will not work as an exercise in paternalism. There is and must remain a partnership based on mutual respect, trust and acknowledgement. That is why Labor committed a further $15 million over three years in the 2013 budget to ensure the continuation of this national voice, providing the views of Indigenous people to governments and community on issues and policy that affect them. 


Of course we committed, as I said in the motion, $29.2 million over four years to establish the Indigenous congress. Kirstie Parker has been very critical of the current government in relation to the discontinuation of the $15 million. She said:


Discontinuation of $15 million set aside in the Budget Forward Estimates for Congress from 2014-17 amounted to censorship of independent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices by stealth …


The tragedy in all of this is that the coalition government has adopted a paternalistic approach in relation to this issue, not consulting the peak body and not taking forward Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy in a good way. This funding should be restored.

Can I say from the beginning that there are many large and vibrant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the electorate of Leichhardt. We rate sixth-highest in Australia for Indigenous residents. Issues of effective advocacy come up fairly regularly in my office, and that is how I became aware of the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. I welcome the opportunity to clarify a few of the misconceptions around this organisation and what they do, and to explain why we should not be honouring Labor's $15 million funding commitment.


Unfortunately, this is another example of the previous government splashing the cash without requiring accountability or real outcomes for Indigenous Australians. Here are a few points to consider. On its website Indigenous congress describes itself as 'a company limited by guarantee'. It is owned and controlled by its membership and its directors. In 2009-10 the congress received $29.3 million from the previous government to support its setup and operations. Labor also committed another $15 million over three years for the 2013-14 budget. That would have totalled united government funding of $44 million, for an advocacy body of less than 8,000 members. That is a huge amount for an organisation that sees itself as fiercely independent of government and provides no advisory services whatsoever for government. Late last year, as a courtesy, Minister Scullion told the congress that they were unlikely to get the $15 million that Labor had promised them. We did, however, extend their funding agreement until 30 June 2017 to enable congress to use its substantial cash reserves, some $7 million, to support its operations and achieve financial independence, which was part of its commitment and charter. I find it somewhat hypocritical that congress is using some of its government provided financial resources to carry out a campaign against the government when we are effectively helping them become what they have always wanted to be: independent.


At the same time Indigenous people are questioning whether the national congress is truly representative and the extent of its community engagement. The Indigenous Times on 19 February 2014 reported that some members of congress were disappointed with the organisation. In the letter to the editor it stated: 


Does congress truly represent us? Membership is so low, voting numbers even lower.  … They have taken their eye off the bigger, strategic picture. They should have been lobbying on issues, making the organisation relevant and bringing about change for our mob … Instead they focussed on lobbying about themselves … 


I note that in early 2014 the congress held public meetings in a range of cities and regional centres to discuss the impact of the so-called funding crisis. Attendance ranged between 20 people and 40 people. At the same time, the congress started a letter-writing campaign asking members to email their local members and senators. They were aiming for 1,000 emails, but I am told that there was limited take-up from the communities or the media and the campaign appears to have fizzled out. As somebody who has the sixth-largest Indigenous population in my electorate, I received almost none. In fact, I do not recall receiving any letters or emails whatsoever. A further indication is that, at the latest election, when congress's co-chairs were elected, only 800 members voted. This is out of a membership of 7,500 individual members and 172 member organisations. To me, these factors raise serious concerns as to whether congress is a true voice of Indigenous Australia.


Over the past 12 months, this government has sought to go where no other government has gone before in terms of Indigenous engagement and driving policy that will better the lives of First Australians. In the 2014-15 budget, we are investing $4.8 billion to support priorities of getting kids back to school, adults to work and community safety. We are consolidating more than 150 individual programs and services into five new streams, under an Indigenous Advancement Strategy. By targeting funding towards the key outcomes, organisations will be able to focus their time and effort on delivering services on the ground. We are also continuing to work on recognising Indigenous Australians in the Constitution and will release a draft proposal this year.


It is absolutely vital that the government stay attuned to the range of voices within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. We will continue to engage with Indigenous stakeholders from right across the spectrum, including the national congress, when designing policies and implementing services that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. For the reasons I have outlined, I certainly do not commend this motion to the House.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (11:11):  When a government changes, the country changes. So said Paul Keating in his famous dictum. I agree with that totally. But some national projects have to survive the political baton change. It often falls to a government and a parliament to continue the good work of the previous government and the previous parliament. So it is with the project of national reconciliation, recognition and removing the gap that exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I thank the member for Blair, the shadow spokesperson, for bringing this matter before the parliament. I acknowledge the traditional owners of the land, the Ngambri and Ngunawal people, and pay my respects to elders past and present.


Deputy Speaker, you would remember that, on 13 February 2008, the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd delivered the apology to the stolen generation. This was another step in the process of reconciliation, another step in acknowledging that it falls to the government to remove the burden of disadvantage and discrimination. He had this to say:


… we harness the determination of all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, to close the gap that lies between us in life expectancy, educational achievement and economic opportunity.


We on this side of the House believe that it is critical that, in fulfilling these objectives, you have representative bodies of Indigenous Australians to enable us to consult and enable them to have an organised voice so that they can speak to government effectively, with power and dignity. The National Congress of Australia's First Peoples is a critical body, as the peak body representing Indigenous organisations and individuals, as the member for Blair said in his contribution on this motion. It is an important body in doing that. The congress's strength comes from the fact that it has direct membership, with 171 member organisations and close to 6,000 individual members, growing week by week. Collectively, tens of thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people now make up one of the largest Indigenous networks ever created in Australia. It is a critical body.


In his contribution, the member for Leichhardt was critical of the fact that the congress spent some of its resources contradicting and criticising the government of the day. There are some countries where the government of the day seeks to close down dissent, seeks to shut off voices that disagree with it, through totalitarian means or through more subtle means such as withdrawing funding and support. Thankfully Australia has not traditionally been one of those countries. Labor recognises that it is important to have contrary voices in civil society. That is why, to support the work of the congress, we gave the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples $29 million in establishment funding over four years and $15 million over three years in the 2013 budget. I disagree with the member for Leichhardt. I agree with him on many things—this is not a partisan point—but I disagree with him on his observation that the congress has not been providing either advice or service to, or on behalf of, government. They most certainly have. The member for Blair went through a great number of instances where they were doing this.


I want to focus on one area in particular: the importance of having an advocacy and an advisory body to government in the area of Indigenous health. If we are going to address the issue of disadvantage, then we have to address the disadvantage and the gap that exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people when it comes to life expectancy and health outcomes. With this in mind, we are very disappointed that there have been significant cuts to Aboriginal health programs in the recent budget across a raft of areas. The general cuts and changes will also fall heavily upon those Australians who have a significant problem. But the one that I want to point out is the cut to the antitobacco and the antismoking campaigns. The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission identified tobacco smoking as the biggest cause of health disadvantage and differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. If we address this, we will go a long way to addressing the gaps between Australians of different backgrounds. (Time expired)

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (11:16):  This is one of the sadder moments in the parliament in my parliamentary career—I do not have many but this is one: to see a group of white blokes chatting about black issues all over again; our children in the room and listening across Australia to this debate; hearing this use of Indigenous issues to kick the government's can. All that has happened is that we spend over $2 billion on Indigenous affairs in this country. We try to do it well. The efficiency dividend that is cast across the whole of government comes to more than the $500 million cut that you are talking about. What we have actually done, as was pointed out by the member for Leichhardt, is bring 150 programs down to five key areas so that there is reasonable understanding by the Indigenous communities where the government is headed. 


The previous speaker talked about power and dignity. If that was the case, if it was all about power, dignity and advocacy—Jenny Macklin gave this group $29.4 million so that they would be apart from government and self-funding. They chose to be apart from government and self-funding on the interest of the $29 million. If it were about advocacy and about the work of the organisation, then why do they need another $15 million to do the work that the $29 million was given for, to do the work of advocacy. Why?



An honourable member:  It does not make sense.




Mr BROADBENT:
  It does not make sense. So it is only a reasonable statement by a new government to question the former government and say: 'We understand that $29 million. You have given the first peoples of Australia and their congress $29 million'—a lot of money—



An honourable member:  Absolutely.




Mr BROADBENT:
  It is a lot of money for advocacy only. They do not deliver a program. It is for advocacy only, and in recognition. That being given, they come along and then say, 'Now we are going to give you $15 million to do—'




An honourable member:  They have no idea what the organisation does—




Mr BROADBENT:
  I know exactly what the organisation does. I have read exactly the motion today. I understand the motion, exactly. And all you are doing is using your portfolio standing to kick the can on the government, when something like this should be reasonably approached. The whole nation has to look to how we spend our money. We do not set one group apart from anybody else, like Labor chooses to do.



Honourable members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Randall
):  Order! The member for McMillan has the call.




Mr BROADBENT:
  Let them go, Deputy Speaker, I am enjoying it. The more they talk about this issue, the more they show their colours in regard to this. Under Jenny Macklin—she set up this organisation and gave them excellent funding to do their job—there was a plan. The plan has been broken. All this government has done is recognise that, if you have been given an amount of money to do a job and to manage that, you claim independence. You take a step back in government. They can, if they need to, criticise the new government—I have no problem with that. If there is criticism to be had, we will have that criticism. But what I will not have is the shadow minister coming into this place and putting up a motion like this just because, 'I've found a cut, I'm going to run the cut, I'm going to play myself into this organisation, this could be my future.' Let me say this—



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BROADBENT:
  And they can write that. Let me say this, and I want to say it with clarity. When the previous government gave this money, they gave it for a specific reason: so that this organisation could exist apart from government. That is in the charter. You know that is in the charter. Now they are separate from government, they can write pieces like that in the Indigenous paper. But for heaven's sake, give our government the opportunity to manage Indigenous affairs in a much better way than the previous government did.

Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (11:51):  This bill amends the Australian Education Act 2013 to require that the minister be satisfied that a state or territory will not reduce or has not reduced its education budget before making a determination of Commonwealth school funding to that state or territory. In simple terms, what this means is: the states and territories cannot take funding out the back door as the Commonwealth increases funding in the front door.


Before the election, Tony Abbott promised a unity ticket with Labor on schools funding, but we see now another broken promise. What we see here is legislation designed to ensure that states are not decreasing education funding. Before the election, the Labor government did a lot of work to come up with a fair funding model for Australian schools. Along with that fair funding model for Australian schools, we made a commitment to substantial extra investment in schools, $14.65 billion over six years. That $14.65 billion included Commonwealth funding, and it also included state funding. For every $2 that we were putting in, we expected the states to put in an extra $1.


Before the election, first of all we had Christopher Pyne—the opposition spokesperson at the time—saying: 'Absolutely not. Over my dead body. No Gonski. No way are we supporting this funding model'. What became apparent as the election campaign progressed was how terribly unpopular that position was. Australian parents of both public and private school kids understand that the quality of our education system depends on every child in every community in every family in every school having an opportunity to get the best possible education. 


Parents want their kids to get the very best education but they know that, for the cohesion of our society and the strength of our economy, all kids need to get a decent education. So there is very strong support for the Gonski school education funding reforms. The coalition was dragged kicking and screaming to say that they were on a unity ticket with Labor. But then what happens afterwards? 


Under this government, Commonwealth funding drops to just $2.8 billion over four years—instead of the $14.65 billion combined Commonwealth state funding over six years I mentioned earlier—and the states do not need to put in a single extra dollar. In fact they can cut funding from their own education budgets and still get the small amount of extra Commonwealth funding in comparison to what was previously on offer. 


The reason that we went into the complexity of our school education funding system is: every child in Australia deserves a decent education. But, just as importantly, our national prosperity depends on every Australian child getting a top quality education. So it was not just $14.65 billion of extra funding for our schools that was important; it was also better quality teaching; higher standards; better training, support and development for teachers; better student outcomes, focussing on more individual attention for every student; more flexibility for principals, engaging with parents in the community. I am a particularly strong supporter for more flexibility for principals. I think principals know their school communities and what their kids need in their schools, and they are dedicated to achieving that.


I am a big supporter of more flexibility for principals; a needs based funding system where every child in every school gets a good education; and transparency and accountability. Transparency and accountability were controversial measures. We were criticised, including by some teachers, for the demand we instituted for greater transparency and accountability for national testing like NAPLAN and for the transparency of the MySchool website, but I make no apology for those measures either. We saw on the weekend a list of most-improved schools that included some very surprising names. We only know that because we have NAPLAN and the school transparency measures.


In the end, I have to say that this bill should not be necessary. It should not be necessary to have to hold the states to accounts, but we have seen terrible cuts at state and territory levels, teachers sacked and schools closed and sold off. If the Liberals were truly on a unity ticket with Labor on funding, this bill would not be necessary. It is necessary because, instead of $14.65 billion, we get about one-third of that under this government.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:56):  I rise today to speak on this private member's bill—a bill which is based on false assumptions and scaremongering from an opposition that has not quite come to terms with the total chaos that was their previous government. What cuts? Do those opposite mean their own $1.2 billion worth of cuts that they made to education before the 2013 election to hide some of their black hole of debt—the very same $1.2 billion that the coalition then reinvested in education after Labor took it away? What cuts?


Those opposite are in denial. They refuse to accept that, because of the debt of $123 thousand million they created, we simply cannot afford the blue-sky promises Labor made but never wrote down in any budget papers. Those opposite still believe in their alternate universe filled with their delusions of false accomplishments.


The previous Gillard-Rudd governments took the 'deal at any cost' approach to education in order to desperately cling on to power instead of acting in the best interests of students. The school funding model Labor promised to some states was by no means equal, let alone realistic. Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory had not reached funding agreements with the Rudd-Gillard government, so Labor impatiently then ripped $1.2 thousand million out of the total funding package. However, this $1.2 billion was then reinvested by the coalition government in the December MYEFO. As these jurisdictions had not reached any agreement with the previous government, the funding they are getting under the coalition government is much better than what they would have received otherwise.


If you look at the projected expenditure of Labor's education funding, it is hard to tell if it is simply an economic joke or a malicious time bomb planted by reckless politicians who knew they would never have to face reality and pay up. Quite simply, a vast majority of the so-called 'promised funding' comes well after the forward estimates, so Labor never had to write it into a budget paper. Yes, they may have written it on pretty fliers with grandiose slogans like 'The Education Revolution' or 'Gillard Youth' along with their infamous 'We Have Delivered a Surplus' brochures; but, quite simply, the funding behind these promises was about as genuine as the former member for Griffith's selfies. What does surprise me, however, is that, for all the boasting those opposite do about how they are the party of education, not once did they stop to think about how best to spend the Commonwealth's education funds, how to actually take action against the steadily falling national school scores.


I would like to point out that in this federation that is Australia school education is a responsibility of the state governments, and the federal government, which really has no responsibility over schools, contributes approximately 15 per cent of the total schooling budget for states and territories. Fifteen per cent, not 50. The way those opposite are talking, you would think that the federal government was the sole funder of states' schools.


Additionally, it may come as a shock, but for the last two decades Commonwealth spending on schools has been increasing. Yet still results have dropped. If you look at a graph from the Productivity Commission's Report on government services 2014, it shows that as funding has increased the Program for International Student Assessment scores have decreased in both literacy and numeracy. This is because governments should not just be recklessly throwing money at our education system and hoping for the best, as the previous Labor government did. Instead, as the coalition government is doing through our Students First plan, we should be focusing on the four key areas that evidence shows will make a real difference to students. Those key areas are teacher quality, school autonomy, engaging parents and strengthening the curriculum. 


In summary, we have a coalition government which is committing $1.2 billion more to schools than Labor. We have a coalition government which is being honest with states, territories, school students and their parents, showing that funding will continue to increase beyond the forward estimates while still being open to negotiations with the states. The coalition government, instead of just throwing money at a problem and hoping it will go away, is putting students first and investing in teacher quality for a stronger education system and a brighter future for all students. This bill is as much a circus act as the previous government.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (12:01):  If you want to see the difference between the two major parties writ large, look at education. Look at high school retention rates, for example. During the 12 years of the Hawke-Keating government they rose from around 40 per cent to close to 80 per cent. Then in the next 12 years, under the Howard government, they essentially stagnated. For 12 years children started school and finished school in 12 years. In the biggest global boom in modern memory, at a time when you really could make a difference, they did not. Retention rates stagnated.


We were elected in 2007 and once again began the hard process of increasing retention rates through the Gonski reform, trade training in schools and a number of other reforms. But now the conservatives are back and it is back to the bad old days. We once again have a government with a laissez faire attitude to education, which simply will not do the hard work when it comes to educating our children.


You can tell by the contempt they showed for parents and schools in the lead-up to the election, the deliberate deception in the statements they made that there was a unity ticket on education, that there would be no cuts to education and that there was not a sliver of light between the two parties. They said that, whatever your school would get under Labor, it would get the same under the Liberals. This was all deliberate deception, done because they knew parents cared about the education of their children. It was done in order to get elected and it is a demonstration of absolute contempt for Australian families. You can tell that by the reality of their approach, the total lack of concern about how federal education dollars are spent or not spent once they leave the federal coffers and go to the states.


The Australian Education Amendment (School Funding Guarantee) Bill 2014 addresses a peculiarity of our state-federal system and one that was addressed in Labor's Gonski agreements with the states—the practice of federal governments giving money to the states and the states saying, 'Thank you very much,' and taking money out of the same area. The federal government puts money into the bucket for education and state governments punch holes in the bottom and siphon money out for other purposes.


That is why when Labor negotiated the Gonski agreements we made extra federal funding conditional on states putting in more money as well. Gonski was about lifting every boat, creating greater transparency in funding between state and federal governments, removing the potential for the blame game, increasing contributions from both levels of government and creating certainty for schools and certainty for states in planning appropriate resources, including teacher numbers and infrastructure.


Now this Abbott government has ripped away all that certainty by removing the obligation of state governments to increase their funding or even to not decrease it. We have already seen the results. We have seen cuts to education budgets in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory, there have been $47 million worth of cuts and 130 teachers gone. In Western Australia, already there have been $183 million worth of cuts, with 700 educational professionals gone.


This bill attempts to reinstate the certainty for parents, schools and state governments. It requires the minister to be satisfied that a state or territory will not reduce or has not reduced its education budget before federal school funding is provided to states and territories. This is a no-brainer. Without this safeguard, the federal government simply does not have the power to influence the quality of education.


Labor created the Gonski reforms, for school funding based on need, and we have drafted this bill in the wake of the Liberals' broken promises. Before the election, they said they were on a unity ticket with Labor, that no school would be worse off under their proposals. After the election we saw this Liberal government failing to keep its promises to students, to parents, to teachers and to school communities.


It has been encouraging to see in recent weeks that some states still recognise the Gonski agreement, that it delivered the best opportunity for their children, and we have seen the New South Wales, Victorian, South Australian and ACT governments honour their funding commitments for the fifth year of the Gonski agreement in their budgets. These states have called on Tony Abbott to honour his pre-election promise not to cut education funding. They have called on Tony Abbott to keep his word, and so do we. Passing this bill will go part of the way to meeting those promises.

Retention rates stagnated.


We were elected in 2007 and once again began the hard process of increasing retention rates through the Gonski reform, trade training in schools and a number of other reforms. But now the conservatives are back and it is back to the bad old days. We once again have a government with a laissez faire attitude to education, which simply will not do the hard work when it comes to educating our children.


You can tell by the contempt they showed for parents and schools in the lead-up to the election, the deliberate deception in the statements they made that there was a unity ticket on education, that there would be no cuts to education and that there was not a sliver of light between the two parties. They said that, whatever your school would get under Labor, it would get the same under the Liberals. This was all deliberate deception, done because they knew parents cared about the education of their children. It was done in order to get elected and it is a demonstration of absolute contempt for Australian families. You can tell that by the reality of their approach, the total lack of concern about how federal education dollars are spent or not spent once they leave the federal coffers and go to the states.


The Australian Education Amendment (School Funding Guarantee) Bill 2014 addresses a peculiarity of our state-federal system and one that was addressed in Labor's Gonski agreements with the states—the practice of federal governments giving money to the states and the states saying, 'Thank you very much,' and taking money out of the same area. The federal government puts money into the bucket for education and state governments punch holes in the bottom and siphon money out for other purposes.


That is why when Labor negotiated the Gonski agreements we made extra federal funding conditional on states putting in more money as well. Gonski was about lifting every boat, creating greater transparency in funding between state and federal governments, removing the potential for the blame game, increasing contributions from both levels of government and creating certainty for schools and certainty for states in planning appropriate resources, including teacher numbers and infrastructure.


Now this Abbott government has ripped away all that certainty by removing the obligation of state governments to increase their funding or even to not decrease it. We have already seen the results. We have seen cuts to education budgets in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. In the Northern Territory, there have been $47 million worth of cuts and 130 teachers gone. In Western Australia, already there have been $183 million worth of cuts, with 700 educational professionals gone.


This bill attempts to reinstate the certainty for parents, schools and state governments. It requires the minister to be satisfied that a state or territory will not reduce or has not reduced its education budget before federal school funding is provided to states and territories. This is a no-brainer. Without this safeguard, the federal government simply does not have the power to influence the quality of education.


Labor created the Gonski reforms, for school funding based on need, and we have drafted this bill in the wake of the Liberals' broken promises. Before the election, they said they were on a unity ticket with Labor, that no school would be worse off under their proposals. After the election we saw this Liberal government failing to keep its promises to students, to parents, to teachers and to school communities.


It has been encouraging to see in recent weeks that some states still recognise the Gonski agreement, that it delivered the best opportunity for their children, and we have seen the New South Wales, Victorian, South Australian and ACT governments honour their funding commitments for the fifth year of the Gonski agreement in their budgets. These states have called on Tony Abbott to honour his pre-election promise not to cut education funding. They have called on Tony Abbott to keep his word, and so do we. Passing this bill will go part of the way to meeting those promises.


Debate adjourned.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2014-06-23,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (12:05):  I move:


That this House notes:


(1) that the spirit of ANZAC is one of special significance to all Australians as it showcases the attributes of courage, mateship and sacrifice which were demonstrated at the Gallipoli landing;


(2) that the ANZACs helped define us as a people and as a nation, they were ordinary Australians who performed extraordinary deeds and were drawn from the smallest towns and biggest cities;


(3) that the Government is enabling Australians to honour the service and sacrifice that epitomises the ANZAC spirit by increasing the funding allocated to each federal electorate across Australia to $125,000 via the ANZAC Centenary Local Grants Program; and


(4) the Government's commitment to community-based commemoration, as promised at the last election.


I rise today to move this motion of national significance. The spirit of Anzac is one that defines our nation. It exemplifies all that is great about Australia: courage, bravery, mateship, determination and sacrifice. This year is especially significant, as it represents the 100th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli.


Gallipoli is a moment in our history that we memorialise and commemorate for its magnitude and the impact it has had on our nation. The Australian troops at that time showed their heroism when they stormed the beaches, against all odds. Tragically, our nation lost 8,709 young men on the beaches of Gallipoli between the first landing on 25 April 1915 until the battle's end on 8 January 2016. We must also pay tribute to the 2,701 New Zealanders who also perished. It is moments like this that have brought our nations together. 


Having only recently taken part in the Anzac Day ceremonies, it is clear the importance that this historic moment plays in the Australian psyche. Anzac Day is a day on which every Australian reflects on the First World War and its impact, both on the lives of so many Australians and their families and on our nation's identity. To mark the occasion of the 100th anniversary, the government is implementing the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. 


The grants will go towards the holding of commemorative ceremonies and the preservation of the historic and socially valuable monuments and artefacts that relate to this period. The government supports the Centenary of Anzac commemorations and gives this grants program due recognition of the extraordinary world events, where so many lives were lost and destinies irrevocably altered in the defence of freedom. The grants program will also facilitate a reflection by this generation and ensure that the magnitude of that sacrifice will continue to be acknowledged by future generations.


Under the program each electorate receives up to $125,000 as part of the grants process, and applications have come from local RSLs, schools, nursing homes, community organisations and individuals, to name just a few. In my electorate of Higgins, a Centenary of Anzac grants committee was established to review and recommend the applications. I would like to show my gratitude and appreciation to those on the committee who worked so incredibly hard: Chairman Lt Col. (Retd) David Blackwell, Rev. Bradly Billings, Adrianne Fleming, Garry Thompson, Sharon Werka and Robert Millis. Each of them brought their expertise and each of them gave generously of their time to this most worthy cause.


The committee's work has been vital in seeking the community views on how best to commemorate the centenary and assist me in reviewing all applications for funding prior to their submission to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. To date, there have been 33 applications for grants in Higgins. They range from memorial stones, plaque restoration, commemorative services and digital archiving. 


I am pleased to announce that submissions from Villa Maria, St John's Anglican Church, Toorak RSL have all been approved by the department, with submissions from Armadale Primary School, Melbourne High School, South Yarra Primary, St George's Anglican Church, St Kevins Boys School, Ashburton Primary School, De La Salle College, Glen Huntly Primary School, Malvern Valley Primary School, Murrumbeena Primary School, Oakley Grammar, St Michael's School, King David School, Solway Primary School, St Cecilia's Primary School, East Malvern RSL, Prahran RSL, Stonnington City Council and Yarra Trams still pending approval.


There is no doubt that the centenary of Anzac 2014 to 2018 will be one of the most significant national periods of commemoration in Australia's history. It is therefore vital that we work together as a community to ensure we pay appropriate tribute to the thousands who answered the call to serve Australia during the First World War and the many who gave their lives in defence of our liberty.


In Higgins we will be taking part in a very special commemoration ceremony. My committee has organised a special commemoration march, a special map has been drawn up of all of the sites of significance in my electorate, and there will also be a service held by all of the churches and the synagogues in my electorate to commemorate this occasion. I would like to thank the minister and the government for their foresight in putting together this special program. It is something that all Australians will be able to recognise together.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2014-06-23,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (12:11):  Over the next 18 months or so, we will be commemorating the 100th anniversary of Anzac Day. In a community like mine, where some 60 per cent of people were born overseas, it is worth reflecting on the fact that there are probably relatively few people in my community whose families were not touched by the horrific war known as World War I. There are probably some whose ancestors fought with Australians and New Zealanders at Gallipoli.


At the time of World War I, around 25 per cent of Australians were born overseas. An estimated 30 per cent of ANZAC soldiers were drawn from that population. Unsurprisingly, most of those were British born, as enlistment in the Australian Imperial Force was at first confined to those of European descent. The rules were relaxed as the war went on and people enlisted from countries as varied as the Philippines and Malaysia to Germany and France, as well as our own Indigenous Australians.


While it is unknown how many Australian soldiers were of Chinese background, two were very well known at the time. One was Billy Sing, whose father migrated to Australia from Shanghai. He ended up being the most outstanding sniper on Gallipoli before going on to the Western Front. Another Chinese-Australian was Caleb Shang, known as Charlie, a message runner and a very brave signaller and sniper on the Western Front. He served in a number of battles and became the most highly decorated Chinese soldier that we have any record of and, in fact, one of the most highly decorated Australian soldiers, being awarded the distinguished conduct medal not once but twice.


Greeks also played a large role in World War I on behalf of Australia, although again their contribution is not as well known, as most Greek-Australian stories arise from the post-World War II migration. But 57 ANZACs across the whole war were born in Greece, and eight of those fought at Gallipoli. The most well known is Georgios Papas, from Queensland, who received a distinguished conduct medal for gallantry, awarded because he was wounded while retrieving other wounded under heavy gunfire.


For people in my community of Vietnamese descent, their relatives may well have fought alongside Australians at Salonika in Greece. My Senegalese and African families may have ancestors who fought with the French forces at Gallipoli, who fought alongside ANZACS. Then, of course, there were the Maltese—six immigrants from Malta and one second generation Australian-Maltese from Melbourne. Four were killed in action in France, two in Belgium and one at Gallipoli, and their remains are buried there. Another 30 Maltese-Australians were engaged in combat in Gallipoli and they survived and returned to Australia as ANZAC survivors.


Of course, the spirit of Anzac Day has a deep Sikh connection. Being subjects of the Crown under British rule in India, Sikhs and other Indians had no choice but to participate in World War I because they were recruits in the British Army. A million Indian troops fought in the First World War. Of them, 700,000 were pitted against the Ottoman Empire. In Gallipoli, they formed part of the New Zealand and Australian Division. Of 5,010 Indians who served in Anzac, 1,926 died and 3,863 were wounded, some more than once. The number of dead, although horrific, paled in comparison to the number that died in France and Belgium. The 371 Sikhs who died fighting at Gallipoli on 3 and 4 June 1915 were from the battalion of the 14th Sikh Regiment. The troop's commander, General Sir Ian Hamilton, wrote:


In spite of the tremendous losses there was not a sign of wavering all day. Not an inch of ground was given up and not a single straggler came back.


The ends of the enemy's trenches were found to be blocked with the bodies of Sikhs and … the glacis slope was thickly dotted with the bodies of these fine soldiers all lying on their faces as they fell in their steady advance on the enemy.


The Indian Army was represented on Gallipoli by the 7th Indian Mountain Artillery Brigade, the Indian Mule Corps, a medical establishment and the 29th Indian Infantry Brigade. The artillery brigade arrived at Ari Burnu with ANZAC troops and was there from the first day until the final evacuation. It consisted of the 21st Kohat and the 26th Jacobs Mountain Battery, manned by Sikh and Punjabi Muslim gunners, a complete brigade, which served with a day's relief and prided itself on being the first in and last out among the artillery units on Gallipoli. Fourteen Indian soldiers earned the Victoria Cross. The number of Indigenous soldiers who fought at Gallipoli is largely unknown because they were recruited not under the Indigenous badge. In fact, they could not enlist as members of the Indigenous community, but they were there in numbers and should also be remembered.

Mr NIKOLIC
 (Bass) (12:16):  It gives me much pleasure to support the motion moved by the member for Higgins. I do so with an element of reminiscence because a generation ago some social pundits were reasonably predicting the end of the Anzac Day era. By the end of the 20th century, the 1915 Gallipoli campaign and, indeed, the wider Great War had continued to cast an influential shadow across the Australian social landscape. Predictions of declining interest became louder when the final Australian survivor of the Gallipoli campaign, Alec Campbell, passed away in May 2002. Yet, Australia has not seen the end of Anzac commemoration. In fact, quite the opposite is true. More and more Australians enthusiastically join the growing crowds, replete with every multicultural flavour, heritage and cultural taking part in solemn and respectful services every chilly April. 


Last Anzac Day in northern Tasmania I joined a big gathering of veterans, families and supporters at the Georgetown dawn service and then at the mid-morning march and ceremony in Launceston. In Launceston, crowds line the streets two and three deep on both sides of the route as veterans young and old moved between them. Far from declining, the expression 'Anzac' and that for which it stands has been nationally embraced and even revitalised. Despite the fact that Australians are busier now than ever before, I doubt that this vital interest will change in the future. By why has the Anzac legend wrong-footed the pundits? Australians are a hard bunch to label or characterise but above all they are a pragmatic, perceptive, generous and gracious people. They are pragmatic enough to recognise the unfortunate need to fight some wars, perceptive enough to understand the futility and wastefulness of most wars but equally generous and gracious to recognise and honour the sacrifice of those who participate in them and who do not come back or, if they do, are changed by the experience. Most importantly, Australians recognise that such sacrifice is made voluntarily in their name and Australians consciously choose to keep and remain faithful to this recognition. Like the US Marine Corps, they are semper fidelis, always faithful, every loyal. Though they may not say it publicly, the pithy expression 'Lest we forget' has been embraced by Australians as few nations on earth and they continue to demonstrate that they have not forgotten, through their actions by publicly and respectfully commemorating the fallen every year. 


It is fitting, too, that Gallipoli and Anzac have come to be the collective catch-all expressions under which Australia's multiple wars, conflicts, police actions, peacekeeping and peacemaking missions have been warmly acknowledged by a grateful nation. This phenomenon recognises that Gallipoli was just the start of 100 years of Anzac sacrifice. 


That said, a small minority in our community engage in unfortunate revisionist history. Earlier this year, I wrote an article in response to our national broadcaster, the ABC, giving prominence to those who claim that the story of Gallipoli is 'a myth blown out of all proportion'. A story aired on the ABC on 27 January this year containing commentary from a small group that asserts we should focus on the misogyny, racism, discrimination and exploitation at Gallipoli. Instead of honouring more than a century of service and sacrifice by almost one million men and women in uniform, the ABC on that occasion honoured instead the opinions of those who trawl through the history of 1915 Cairo brothels. The wearing of black armbands started in ancient Egypt, but there are clearly those in the ABC still wearing them, intent on nudging the historical pendulum from pride to guilt. 


Australia has a new and younger community of veterans, some 72,000 of them during the last decade—and my daughter amongst them. The fact that many of them have been harmed physically or psychologically by recent war makes the lead-up to the Gallipoli centenary next year even more poignant and relevant. With this in mind, I applaud the Anzac Centenary Local Grants program, which will ensure some wonderful commemorative events in my electorate of Bass and across our nation. I again commend the member for Higgins for her motion which maintains this most worthy Australian commemorative tradition and practice. Lest we forget.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (12:21):   I rise today to note the bipartisan support for the centennial Anzac commemoration announced by the honourable Julia Gillard on the centenary of Anzac 24 April 2012. The Australian government's Anzac Centenary Local Grants program is assisting and encouraging communities across Australia to undertake their own Anzac Centenary projects that commemorate the service and sacrifice of Australian servicemen and service-women in the First World War.


I want to take a moment to thank the independent panel members in Lalor who have assessed and made recommendations on 10 projects from the community: the honourable Tim Pallas, state member for Tarneit; Ms Margaret Campbell, a respected local historian and author; and Ms Judith Gilbert, a longtime history teacher and now secretary of the B24 Liberator restoration in Werribee. Only one has at this time received approval and it is creating much excitement. This was promptly submitted by the Little River Historical Society on the day the applications opened. It is for a World War I nurse memorial for Sister Catherine Kit McNaughton and Sister Sarah Sadie McIntosh. They were cousins, both born and raised in Little River. The memorial is to honour the role and the contribution made by local serving women during the Great War. It will be unveiled to coincide with the centenary of the departure of Sister McNaughton from Station Pier in Port Melbourne to her wartime duties on 17 July 1915. 


Kit McNaughton's story will also be shared with the broader Australian public this year through Screen Australia's miniseries The Other Anzacs, launched at Parliament House last week, and the ABC documentary series, The War That Made Us, which will be launched at Parliament House tomorrow evening. On behalf of my community, I would like to thank Dr Janet Butler for her curiosity about the nurses from our region and her pursuit of family history for her research. Through that research, she found the diaries kept by Kit during her war service and wrote Kitty's War:The Remarkable Wartime Experiences of Kit McNaughton, published in 2013. Janet was awarded the New South Wales Premier's History Award for 2013 for this work. 


I and many from my community attended the launch of Janet's book in 2013 at the shrine in Melbourne. This event brought together people from all over Australia, many of whom were descendants of nurses and servicemen who knew Kit from the war. Janet's research took her all over the country, talking to families about their mothers, grandmothers, aunts and great-aunts. From the diaries of Kit McNaughton, Janet traced many of the nurses who served with her and heard their stories. Through letters and diaries and stories, Janet was able to trace not just their service but their relationships and their lives after the war. Janet's work has informed the ABC documentary to be launched as part of a series tomorrow night. I also acknowledge the work of Clare Wright, our most recent recipient of the Stella Award, for her work on the documentary.


It is important to note the belated acknowledgment of the nurses of the Great War by our country. Kit McNaughton's service was mentioned in dispatches by Winston Churchill. After the war, she was awarded the Royal Red Cross First Class, a British award presented by the then Prince of Wales—who became King Edward VII—on his visit to Australia in 1920.


However, she did not receive an Australia award. In fact, she had to fight for a part-veterans pension in the later years of her life when the trials of her service tolled heavily on her health. Sadie, who never married, had to apply to the Edith Cavell fund for financial assistance in 1950. Therefore, I think it is fitting that modern Australia now looks back and acknowledges the sacrifices made by our serving nurses, the way their service changed the way they saw themselves and others and, in time, the way Australia saw itself. I look forward to Kit and Sadie having a permanent memorial in the town they grew up in, and in the region they returned to, where Kit married and raised her family. I would also note that Kit McNaughton is my grandmother.

Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (12:25):  I commend the member for Higgins for bringing this motion forward. I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of it. Anzac Day is very important to my family in so many ways. I am the mother of a serving soldier in the Australian Army; the daughter of a fighter pilot from World War II and subsequently a prisoner of war; and the great granddaughter of Sir George Pearce, Australia's longest serving defence minister. It was also TJ Ryan, Premier of Queensland and chairman of the first Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland after whom my seat of Ryan was named. Also of interest is that Canon David Garland, 'the architect of Anzac Day' as he is known, is buried in the Toowong Cemetery along with 300 soldiers from the First World War. Anzac Day has been observed each year since the memorable landing on Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. 


In no way does the commemoration of Anzac Day glorify war. Rather, it recognises the sacrifice that our servicemen and servicewomen have made. It is in this tradition that, as we stand for a minute's silence each year, we remember that we are standing in the presence of the dead and their living friends and relatives. It is an occasion for humility and reverence, for silence and thought. Sir George Pearce, as Acting Prime Minister, formally decreed Anzac Day. In his recent book, Anzac and Empire, John Connor, one of Australia's leading military historians, details that 'Pearce was almost single-handedly responsible for creating the key institutions of Australia's modern defence organisation: the Royal Australian Navy, the Royal Military College, Duntroon and the Royal Australian Air Force.' Connor goes on to say that 'to understand Australia in the Great War, you must understand the man behind it.'


To say that our fighting men were drawn from the smallest towns and biggest cities is evidenced by the following statistics. From 1914 to 1918, Australia was a country of a mere four million people. Yet, 416,000 enlisted for service, representing 38.7 per cent of the total male population aged between 18 and 44. Of those, 57,705 were Queenslanders. By the end of the war, nearly 59,000 of our men were dead, 166,811 wounded and 4,000 were missing or prisoners of war. At almost 65 per cent, the Australian casualty rate was the highest of the war. Of the 63 Victoria Crosses that were awarded, five were from Queensland. The ANZACs helped to define us as a people and as a nation. They were ordinary Australians who performed extraordinary deeds and who were drawn from the smallest towns and the biggest cities. 


Recently I attended the opening of the Kenmore-Moggill RSL sub-branch where I had the opportunity to discuss with Kenmore State High School's deputy principal, Mr Andrew Blight, the research project being undertaken by the school, in conjunction with the RSL. Students are tasked with researching a local soldier killed in action during the First World War. This creates the opportunity for the next generation to understand and remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice so that we may live in freedom. Students are uncovering the stories of our local heroes as part of the broader community's centenary commemoration of Anzac. St Joseph's school at Bardon has also undertaken a similar project with their grade 7 students. It was an honour to join them last week at the Australian War Memorial. 


In my electorate of Ryan, we have taken advantage of the coalition's commitment of a further $25,000 to the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program, totalling $125,000. My electorate community committee recently approved a list of very high quality projects, which will see our community understanding, respect and commemoration grow for the spirit of the ANZACs and for those who paid the ultimate price for our freedom. 


Pending ministerial approval, I look forward to seeing the positive outcome of these grants and the benefit that the projects will have on the wider community and on the broader centenary of Anzac commemorations. 


I wish to close by paraphrasing the sermon of the secretary of the original Anzac committee at St John's Cathedral, marking Anzac Day 1924. Quoting from John 15:13, he said:


Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.


Canon Garland went on to say that there was no room for anything other than a solemn observance of Anzac Day and to expand on his often expressed belief that Anzac Day was the All Souls Day of Australia and that it was therefore inappropriate to wear vestments or play joyous music of triumph but rather be penitent and filled with sorry for a world which caused the sacrifice of bright young lives, our dearest and our best. Lest we forget.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (12:30):  It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Higgins—a motion that acknowledges the spirit of Anzac and how Anzac has helped define us as a people and as a nation. The landing at Gallipoli—when Australia had barely been a nation for 14 years; a nation in its infancy; a nation which still saw itself as a British colony—by Australian soldiers on that rugged peninsula was really the birth of Australia as a nation. The Gallipoli campaign was a major campaign. Australian and New Zealand troops fought under their own flags for the first time and under their own commanders. They were fighting as Australians for Australia. It is because of that that Anzac Day and that landing at Gallipoli is so special. We can only imagine the despair and marvel at the determination of spirit of those brave men who refused to take a backward step against almost impossible odds.


This is a very appropriate motion that we have before us today. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Shortland electorate Anzac committee and acknowledge the people involved in the committee: Allan Bargwanna, the chair of this committee; the Mayor of Lake Macquarie, Jodie Harrison; Councillor Chad Griffith from Lake Macquarie Council; Councillor Doug Vincent from Wyong Shire Council; the principal of Belmont High School, Geoff Robinson; Peter Stephenson OAM, the RSL state councillor for the Newcastle and Northern Region; Warren Welham, the deputy principal of North Lakes High; Darren McManus-Smith, RSL state councillor for the Central Coast and metropolitan area; and my dear friend Colonel Jim Hodgson, retired, who is 90 years of age and who has made an enormous contribution to the considerations of the committee.


I was pleased when the government increased the Anzac commemorative local grants by $25,000 to $125,000 but I was extremely pleased when the Labor government put in place this program. It is a good initiative and one that will ensure that the memory of Anzac continues on in the history of our nation—although I think that that would happen regardless. In the Shortland electorate the committee has come up with a number of fantastic grants, and I would like to thank everybody who has submitted proposals. I would like to particular thank my staff member, Lisa McDermott, who has overseen this process.


The Redhead Sustainable Neighbourhood have put forward a proposal for three murals and plaques at Redhead Public School. Redhead is one of the communities within the Shortland electorate that has a very strong history relating to involvement in both the First World War and the Second World War. Kahibah Public School has a proposal for an Anzac garden at the school. The East Lake Macquarie Historical Society is putting together the publication of a local Anzac history book for Shortland. St Brendan's Catholic school, on the Central Coast, proposed a remembrance garden and student booklets. Swansea RSL put forward a fantastic proposal for a new rising sun memorial on the foreshore of Lake Macquarie, and that will connect with a similar memorial in Western Australia. The Pelican RSL subbranch put forward a proposal for commemorative medallions for all of Shortland electorate's students.


I would like to add that the Doyalson RSL did put in a proposal for a medallion, but they did it outside the guidelines. I really appreciate their contribution, but unfortunately the minister could not support the proposal. I thank them for going ahead and doing that, regardless of the fact that the proposal could not be supported.

(

Ms SCOTT:
  He is a comedian as well!



An honourable member interjecting—




Ms SCOTT:
  He is a Tasmanian. Deputy Speaker, I would also like to acknowledge today in the chamber the presence of my good friend the brigadier, the member for Bass. He has served our great nation in Afghanistan, Syria, South Lebanon and Iraq.


Today we rise to speak in a bipartisan manner on a dignified motion put forward by the member for Higgins. The legend of Anzac embodies the spirit of our country, rising out of the Boer War diggers and enshrined on the bloodstained shores of Gallipoli. Together with our brothers and sisters across the Tasman, we joined forces and service, and far, far too many of our young men made the supreme sacrifice. Through our united toils and tribulations, the unique qualities of the ANZACS stand clear. In the words of Charles Bean:


… Anzac stood, and still stands, for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship, and endurance that will never own defeat.


I would like to add to that list courage, sacrifice, ingenuity, good humour, larrikinism and, of course, mateship. Gallipoli's coming just 14 years after the Federation of our country marked a defining moment in the formation of our nation's identity.


I would like to acknowledge the men and women from the Lindsay community who served. According to the AIF project database, around 352 Australian Imperial Force personnel enlisted with an address in the Lindsay electorate at the time of enlistment, including 246 from Penrith, three from Castlereagh, three from Llandilo, 20 from Emu Plains, seven from Mulgoa, three from Colyton, 64 from St Marys and six from Werrington.


It is true when they say that men were drawn from the smallest of towns and the biggest of cities. In a small town to the south of my electorate, a village called Luddenham, we saw Arthur Booth, Sid Willmington, Jim Roots and many of their mates go off to war. Even to this day, there is a picture of these men, who formed the Luddenham light horse brigade. When Arthur Booth was in Australia, he graded both Mulgoa Road and the Northern Road. He was my great-grandfather. Jim Roots was a legend that lived for over 100 years. He was a local butcher and from 1911 had a butcher's run. And Sid Willmington? He worked at the Luddenham post office. They were truly men of small towns.


I would also like to acknowledge today the $125,000 grant that will go towards our community to acknowledge the service of so many ANZACs who gave their life and their time, leaving from outer western Sydney. I also thank for their work the committee who have served to ensure that we make a good tribute and that the tribute that we provide from our region will appropriately mark the 100th anniversary of Anzac. They include Neville Barnier, Tony Fryer, Faye Lopo, Gary Rumble, Marilyn Stacey, Alan Travers and Erik Weller. I would like to thank them for their service. The ANZAC soldiers have helped define us as a people and as a nation. In doing so, I would like to finish with a poem, We're all Australians now by Banjo Paterson. Banjo Paterson's war poetry so often—I am possibly biased—tells us of the visions and form so much of our nation's past and future. The poem reads:


So now we'll toast the Third Brigade,


That led Australia's van,


For never shall their glory fade


In minds Australian.


Fight on, fight on, unflinchingly,


Till right and justice reign.


Fight on, fight on, till Victory


Shall send you home again.


And with Australia's flag shall fly


A spray of wattle bough,


To symbolise our unity,


We're all Australians now.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (12:40):  I too would like to thank the member for Higgins for bringing forward this important motion regarding the upcoming Anzac Centenary commemoration. The initiative to commemorate the Anzac Centenary, and World War I to that extent, across Australia is very much a bipartisan effort. I am glad that the current government has decided to continue the funding under the Anzac Centenary local grant initiative, which was brought forward by the former government.


World War I and, in particular, what occurred at Anzac Cove nearly 100 years ago has greatly contributed to building Australia's national identity and shaping the country that we have today. This grant will allow communities across Australia to participate in commemorating a vital time in world history and in shaping Australia as a nation. I am proud to say that my local community has been working hard to develop unique and highly thoughtful ways of participating in this project. The Anzac Centenary Committee, which I established in my electorate last year, has been meeting regularly. It consists of representatives from local clubs, ex-serviceman's associations and schools. It has been working particularly hard to involve the community and young people in very much a collective effort.


I would particularly like to thank Elizabeth Godwin, Principal, Cabramatta High School; Michael Foulkes, Group General Manager, Cabra-Vale Diggers; George Taylor, Jim Thompson and John Dillon from Cabra-Vale Diggers; Barry Brooks from the Fairfield RSL Sub-branch; John Baron from the City of Liverpool RSL; Reg Bonney from the National Servicemen's Association; Taffy Pritchard from Canley Heights RSL; Bill Lottey from St Johns Park Bowling Club; and Geoff Lewsam, committee chair of the St Johns Park Bowling Club. The committee has met regularly and has worked in a very cooperative way to ensure what we regard as a truly unique and exciting way of placing the younger generation at the forefront of these commemorative activities.


The primary project in my local community that will commemorate Australia's involvement in World War I will involve more than 20,000 students from 41 local schools participating in an art competition. The students will have the opportunity to express their understanding of Australia's involvement in World War I and its effect in shaping modern-day Australia in a reasonably unique but certainly very artistic way. The opportunities for learning are immense, not only for the students taking part in the art competition but for the entire community. The winning works will be displayed during a large commemorative event on commemorative Sunday in 2015. The winning pieces will form part of a travelling exhibition and will be turned into a permanent print and electronic resource to be distributed throughout the electorate and particularly throughout schools. The overall theme of the project is 'The importance of not taking peace for granted'. It is a poignant theme. It is a lesson that is important to pass on to younger generations. To optimise the learning opportunities an educational calendar, highlighting daily events from 28 June 1914 to Remembrance Day 11 November 1918, will be created and disseminated using social media. I will be participating in the launch of this actual calendar later on this week.


Between 2015 and 2018, we will be planting a tree at each school in my electorate, a tree which is a descendant from the actual Lone Pine itself.


The Anzac Centenary project that will be carried out across my electorate of Fowler, and similar projects across Australia, provide a great opportunity for the whole community to embrace and recognise the importance of maintaining peace and of paying respect to those who gave their lives to ensure that Australia remains a democratic and free country. I commend this motion and I commend all members of parliament taking part in these commemoratives celebrations.


Debate adjourned.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:03):  In the late 1970s I lived in Indonesia for three years, in Jakarta and Banda Aceh. I stay in contact with my friend Niko, although my Indonesian has not advanced much beyond the schoolboy Indonesian of Terima kasih and Baik-baik saja. 


It was my pleasure recently to attend the 25th anniversary of the Australia-Indonesia Institute. Established in April 1989, the Australia-Indonesia Institute has put in place a number of important programs, including the Youth Exchange Program and the Muslim Exchange Program. They have a School Exchange Small Grants Program and work with the Myer Foundation on issues of cultural dialogue. 


The Indonesian relationship is a vital one for Australia. We have had past giants in Herb Feith and Jamie Mackie, who worked hard to improve the relationship, and I also pay tribute to Hal Hill and Chris Manning and many others at the Australian National University who do research on Indonesian issues. 


Next month Indonesia will go to a presidential election with Joko Widodo and Prabowo Subianto as the main candidates. It is of deep concern to me that the government's tow-back policy is at risk of jeopardising our relationship with Indonesia, following the election. I call upon the government to stabilise relationships and settle a code of conduct prior to the election taking place.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (18:55):  I rise to speak about a significant community group in my electorate of Moreton, which has connections with Australia's 10th biggest export source. We are their 15th biggest trading partner; I am obviously talking about Taiwan. I note that recently, whilst there has been an increase in visitor arrivals to Brisbane—in fact, a seven per cent jump in May, compared to the year before—of that increase in visitor markets, the overall growth saw Taiwanese at 46.7 per cent. That reflects the increasing significance of the Taiwanese community not only in my electorate of Moreton where so many people with Taiwanese links and connections live but also in Queensland, Sydney and Melbourne, and all around Australia. The Taiwanese community have been arriving in increasing numbers. 


Many of them are working in the agricultural sector and many of them are studying in Australia. We currently have a significant number of Taiwanese students living in Brisbane and in other capitals as well. Taiwanese students are adventurous. They come here with a great spirit and are interested in ensuring that they have a good time in Australia. Sadly, some Taiwanese students are being exploited by employers who are not considering the employment law in Australia and are taking advantage of them. I have spoken to the Taiwanese community as much as I can and to the Queensland and other state governments about ensuring that they understand employment law. I saw reports on the 7.30 report last week about Taiwanese employees who were spending the entire day in a field picking fruit and then, because of the arrangements with the shared accommodation where they were paying $120, $130 a week, they ended up only receiving $5, $10, $15 for a day's worth of picking in a field. There will always be people who are prepared to take advantage of travellers and, sadly, some Taiwanese students and travellers have been taken advantage of.


I particularly want to mention the director-general of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Brisbane, Mr Wen-cheng Sung, who has served the community of Brisbane, Queensland and Australia for nigh on five years. Mr Sung previously spent time in Poland. He has spent five years in Brisbane and has been an incredibly hardworking, loyal servant of the Taiwanese community and the Taiwanese travellers who have arrived in Queensland.  He is an incredibly quietly spoken gentleman but a great intellect and a great servant of the Taiwanese community. In that job he has worked closely with the Taiwan Friendship Association of Queensland, ably chaired by the president, Koda Chen. I also mention the former president, Anthony Lin, with whom I have had a close relationship; the president of the Taiwanese Women's League of Queensland, Alice Shen, and Jane Yu and Monica Hsu. I could give you a long list of the people who have loyally served the Taiwanese Women's League—people who step up every day but who particularly stepped up during the disastrous floods of 2011 where they were able to serve the broader Queensland community, particularly those people who volunteered to help clean up after the disastrous Brisbane floods.


I would also like to mention some other good friends of mine: Henry Chen and Wayne Ko, the commissioners of the Overseas Compatriots Affairs for the Republic of China, Taiwan. Henry and Wayne have been longstanding, hardworking, well-known, well-respected members of the Taiwanese community. Wayne is also the secretary-general of the Queensland Federation of Taiwanese Associations that do such great work in ensuring that the Taiwanese community is well connected with the people of Queensland. The local Taiwan centre, which is just near the Macgregor Primary School in one of the shopping centres, is owned by a very well-known Taiwanese family, the Fu family. They own approximately 20 shopping centres throughout Queensland. I think they might have even ventured into New South Wales. The Taiwan centre services the local community, not just the Taiwanese community.


I would also mention the big team at the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce in Australia, who do so much to make sure that Australia's trade with Taiwan continues to improve. Trade was at $11.346 billion in the last financial year, even though Taiwan is only a small country of 36,000 square kilometres. Under President Ma they have done so much to make sure that they have strong connections in the region so that there are strong employment opportunities and strong tourism opportunities, both with mainland China and the rest of Asia, and Queensland and Australia. Obviously there are great opportunities there, not just for Queensland coal, the resources that come out of Queensland and Queensland tourism, but also those that were articulated in the Labor government's Asian century white paper. That showed we need to have closer connections with the Asian community that surrounds us, especially as challenges arise in the next few years, as we have a remilitarisation in Japan. There are challenges that will come with that, for Australia with our connections with Japan, and also for China, which looks back 70 and 80 years ago to the horrors that were visited upon that nation. In fact, if you go back to Taiwan you can see 100 years or so of problems that come with colonisation of any island, any nation.


I particularly note and comment upon Australia's trade in services with Taiwan in 2013. We exported $704 million in services to Taiwan. There are some great opportunities there, in dealing directly with the nation of Taiwan but also with their neighbour of China. It is a great way to do business with China, in terms of going through Taipei and Taiwan, because of the connections that are there and their understanding of China. Obviously we have a smaller population, but Taiwan has 24 million people who appreciate democracy and have those great connections, not just in the Mandarin language but also culturally because of those historical connections with Beijing and beyond. At the recent Taiwanese elections, from memory, one million people arrived in Taiwan from China to vote, which is an interesting statement in and of itself in terms of the connections across the Taiwan Strait.


I have enjoyed my visits to Taiwan during my time as the member for Moreton. Three times I have visited that tiny, beautiful island in the Pacific Ocean. I have been close to China. I have seen the battlements where once upon a time shells rained over the island of Kinmen. I have knives in my house made from steel provided by Mao Zedong, because the shells that landed in Taiwan had then been forged into knives, which I have at my home—not to mention the Kinmen liquor. I know the people that come from that island are stout of heart, strong and independent.


As I mentioned earlier, I would particularly like to thank again the Director General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Brisbane, Mr Wen-chen Sung, for his service and to wish him well in his endeavours when he returns to Taipei.

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2014-06-23,"



Mr Turnbull:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


Labor failed New South Wales in rolling out the NBN. Prior to the time of the last election, as at 2 September 2014 NBN Co had connected just 8,232 active brownfields users in New South Wales. In the following 8 months the Coalition Government has increased active NBN brownfields users in NSW by 3.5 times what Labor achieved in 6 years.


The Strategic review found that the fastest and most affordable way to deliver the NBN is to apply a mix of technologies based on their best fit with the infrastructure already in place. NBN Co is now making preparations to implement the Government's directions. NBN Co's review into the wireless and satellite programs has been completed and is available on its website.


The outcomes of these reviews will feed into the process of determining which areas of Australia will be serviced by which technology. Meanwhile, the Fibre to the Premises (FTTP) build is continuing and the areas where build has commenced or where services are available are listed on the NBN Co website.


Once these processes have been completed and NBN Co has stabilised the FTTP rollout, the company will be in a position to provide further details. NBN Co is working on a new rollout schedule which will indicate when different parts of Australia will be connected to the NBN and which technology will be used in those locations. We expect this information to be released in the second half of this year.


Importantly, areas with no or limited access to broadband will be prioritised and will receive upgrades on average 2 years sooner than they would have under Labor.
