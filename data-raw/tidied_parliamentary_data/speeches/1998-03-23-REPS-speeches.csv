"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1998-03-23,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, I present the interim report of the committee entitled Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 1996-97 , together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—This is the fifth report of the committee in this parliament and, yet again, I am pleased to say that it is a unanimous report. This interim report addresses aspects of monetary policy and prudential supervision discussed between the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and the committee at a public hearing on 6 November last year.
The committee's work on the Reserve Bank is one of its most important tasks and one which generates considerable public interest. The appearances of the Reserve Bank before 
 the committee are an important mechanism of accountability and transparency of the bank's conduct of monetary policy. That policy is operating well, with many of the economic problems that were previously of concern having been eliminated or brought under some reasonable control.
The RBA considers the major outstanding problem to be the level of unemployment—a matter of great concern to us all. It predicted some further slow progress in reducing unemployment over the next year and reiterated that, while monetary policy would play a part in achieving that reduction, in the long run its part would be only minor. Structural changes will also be important.
The bank reported, like all central banks, that it remained sensitive to wage settings. The committee recommends that the bank evaluate its expectations of safety net wage decisions against actual living wage claim outcomes. The committee also recommends that the RBA and the Australian Bureau of Statistics assess the changing significance of the contribution of the executive salaries component to the average weekly ordinary time earnings.
The committee's November hearing with the bank was very timely, coming just after the onset of the currency crisis in Asia. The hearing provided valuable insights into the bank's thinking on those crucial issues at that time. The committee also looked at the potential impact of the Asian monetary crisis. The governor gave a big tick to the government, stating:
We are in a much better position to handle this financial instability than we have been at any stage, I think, in the last quarter of a century.
Much more will be said about that matter at our May hearing with the Reserve Bank, particularly with respect to the impact on unemployment. On the prudential side, the deputy governor reported that the RBA has detected some early warning signs of declining bank lending practices. While the RBA is more positive about improvements in bank lending to small business than it has been in the past, the committee is not quite so optimistic, and we will be looking closely at this issue again.
Other important matters addressed by the committee were the bank's gold sales last year, perceptions of conflict of interest of RBA board members, cheque clearance procedures, the real time gross settlement system, the `year 2000 problem', the new Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and central bank cooperation.
The regional impact of competition reform within the various sectors, including the financial sector, was addressed in several of the committee's recent reports. In the recent response of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) to the committee's report last year on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the government agreed to a study of the economic impact on, and the benefits to, rural and regional Australia resulting from competition reforms. The Productivity Commission is to undertake that study. The financial sector will no doubt be addressed and I will be looking for the RBA's views on this matter at our May hearing.
In undertaking this review, the committee appreciates the assistance provided by the Reserve Bank; our adviser, Phil Hanratty; and the secretariat staff, Chris Paterson, Bev Forbes and Belynda Zolotto. I would also like to thank all members of the committee for their hard work at the public hearing and for their contributions to this interim report. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Anthony, Larry, MP",NP,1998-03-23,"—I rise to endorse the report given by the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), and to make some comments on the report of the committee on the Reserve Bank. First of all I would like to highlight some of the areas that the Reserve Bank focused on, particularly the crisis in Asia. There was certainly a great deal of discussion on the impact that it would have on Australia and, more importantly, what the impact would be on the Australian economy regarding north Asia. One of the critical concerns of the Reserve Bank was to see what type of slowdown there might be in South Korea and in Japan because they are major customers of our raw primary produce. In the report the Reserve Bank also highlighted the 
 effect the fiscal policies have had in the last couple of years, suggesting that they have laid a very good foundation for Australia to buffer some of the effects of what is happening in Asia and particularly in South-East Asia.
I would like to focus, though, on some of the measures because the report was done last year and there have been a number of changes, particularly for our most northern neighbour, Indonesia. It is important to note that since that report was handed down the currency has been in a free-fall in Indonesia. This time last year Indonesia had an economy with a 240 billion GDP and with foreign debt of 140 billion. Since the fall in the rupiah, whilst the foreign debt has stayed at 140 billion, the actual size of the Indonesian economy has shrunk to around 33 to 40 billion from 240 billion. So the currency crisis has precipitated an economic crisis.
The Reserve Bank was mindful of the actions taken by the IMF with the package not just to Indonesia but also to countries like Thailand and South Korea. But in the case of Indonesia I note the Reserve Bank has been a lot more moderate than the IMF. I think it is the opinion of this government and, I would conclude, of the opposition that Indonesia is a slightly unique case and that a great amount of caution needs to be exercised with the IMF in order to preserve some of the social fabric in that country.
I am also very glad to see that, in Indonesia, President Suharto has ruled out pegging the rupiah and instead has come up with a five per cent currency band, which I think will give a lot more comfort to the international community and particularly to the IMF, the World Bank and the Reserve Bank. Australia has committed funds to that package, for which there are two tranches. There is $20 billion from Indonesia's own international reserves; there is another $23 billion which is from the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank; and our $1 billion with several other countries.
It is considered to be particularly important that the Indonesian economy does not suffer unduly because in Australia we could see massive dumping, particularly of primary produce, onto our local market, which would 
 destabilise it. Also, it is important to maintain a fair degree of flexibility with the IMF because there are over 200 million Muslims living in that country and the last thing we want to see are food shortages or, potentially greater, social problems, particularly in a lot of those islands outside Java itself.
I note that the Reserve Bank explained to the committee the role of the Australian government in our packages to Thailand and to South Korea. It is important that the public know that those packages go hand in hand with those of other OECD member countries, particularly the United States and Japan. With Thailand and South Korea, the funds we are giving are not gifts or grants—they are actually loans. They are currency swaps, backed in US dollars, and those currency reserves will be banked in New York and some other central banks.
I would also like to highlight that, along with the statement that the Reserve Bank made, there have been a number of positive changes in Australia subsequent to Wallis. As the Reserve Bank articulated, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is now coming into place, together with the Australian Securities Investment Commission and the Financial Sector Advisory Council, which should place Australia in a very good position in relation to our financial markets. To capitalise on the crisis that is happening in Asia, perhaps we can emulate what is happening in London now in relation to financial markets where, in the financial sector alone, 25 per cent of the British GDP is now coming from the finance sector. Australia has a very good opportunity with these new regulatory regimes, with good fiscal policy and with sovereign security in Australia to maybe prosper from some of this Asian crisis. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Wilton, Greg, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I too rise to endorse the comments of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), and to add also that this report is a very important avenue of accountability and transparency for the Reserve Bank of Australia. It does provide the parliament, the financial sector and the com 
 munity at large with some valuable insights into the way in which the RBA conducts its monetary policy activities and the basis for those decisions.
While I am pleased with the report, I would like to bring to the attention of the House one particular issue which I believe may require further scrutiny. That goes to the RBA's comments on the matter of wage settings, about which they said:
Wages are always going to be the biggest structural difficulty for Australia because . . . we are trying to return to a low inflation growth economy like we had in the fifties and sixties, after two decades of high inflation, and at the same time as trying to do it, we are actually going through a once in a century change to the wage setting structure in Australia.
The RBA expressed disappointment:
. . . that earlier signs of slowing in growth of Australian labour costs do not appear to have continued, judging from the most recent data . . . 
There are a couple of interesting points about labour costs that do deserve scrutiny. While average weekly ordinary time earnings increased by 1.6 per cent in the quarter to August, aggregate wages have continued to rise about one per cent per quarter.
The RBA suggested that the trend decline in private sector wage growth had come to an end, despite underlying consumer price inflation running at 1.5 per cent, producer price increases at a similar rate and a flat demand for labour. In its February 1998 RBA bulletin, the RBA states:
Executive salaries, according to the Cullen Egan Dell survey, recorded their largest quarterly rise for more than seven years in the December quarter, returning the annual rate of growth to over 6 per cent.
It is good to see that the RBA recognises that growth in executive salaries is an issue of concern. It states that it remains `stubbornly high' and that it is `increasingly unrelated to trends in business conditions'.
This is significant because we have seen a great deal of negative comment in the media by this government about wage claims by the ACTU for the lowest paid workers. The public needs to be informed that, while they are expected to show significant wage restraint even if they are on very low wages, 
 there has been much less criticism by this government about the massive increases in executive wage rises.
The RBA made some fairly controversial comments in early 1997 about the effect of the safety net decision on low paid workers and in light of this the committee recommended that the bank evaluate its expectations against actual living wage claim outcomes. Recommendation 1 was:
That the Reserve Bank of Australia measure the actual impact of living wage claim outcomes against the Bank's expectations of what it would be in terms of the comments the Bank made at the time.
Recommendation 2 was:
That the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Bureau of Statistics assess how significant a component executive salaries is of average weekly ordinary-time earnings.
The bank stressed the link between wage increases and employment, noting that:
. . . Management says, `The thing that worries us is not the wage rate per person but the wage bill,' and that they can keep the wage bill down by reducing the size of their work force. That sort of environment is not conducive to employment growth . . .
I am confident that this committee recognises the significant impact on the wages bill of highly paid executives who do gain significant increases in their wages. A couple of per cent wage increase on the average weekly earnings of $560 a week comes to a lot less money than a couple of per cent on maybe $3,000 a week that many executives are paid. The bank owes it to the community to take a broad approach to the cost of labour. I would hope that it does fulfil the recommendations of the committee and that it is able to provide both the committee and the community with further information about proposed wage increases.
I would like to endorse the sentiments of the chairman in thanking all those active on the committee secretariat in preparing this report and, once again, thanking the members of the committee who typically acted in a most diligent and forthright manner in coming to what is once again another unanimous report produced by this committee.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee</title>,Committees,1,1
"Martin, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—The report of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration, Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 1996-97 , that we are debating this afternoon is a very significant one because it focuses on a number of issues involving the Reserve Bank of Australia and examines its annual report for 1996-97. In my brief contribution I wish to dwell on two particular matters: firstly, the Asian economic crisis and the comments made by the Reserve Bank and the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) and, secondly, small business lending.
I cannot but help suggest to the member for Richmond that I am not as optimistic as he is that perhaps Australia will not feel the full brunt of the Asian economic crisis in a much more deleterious way than has been experienced to date. One only has to look in the Australian press today, the Sydney Morning Herald, for example, to see the suggestion that something like 5,000 jobs in Australian tourism in New South Wales alone are in jeopardy because of the downturn being caused directly by the Asian economic crisis. The flow-on effect that that is going to have on small businesses should not be underestimated.
In my travels throughout Australia as the shadow minister I have seen that the Asian economic crisis is impacting. It is having a major effect on small business and tourism operations. The concerns the Reserve Bank of Australia is bringing to our attention should not be treated with anything other than great sympathy. In a short period of time—over the next several months—as a result of the economic crisis there will be some real implications and ramifications—for our near neighbours, in particular—which will be felt in Australia.
On the matter of small business, I draw the attention of the House to the section on bank lending and bank margins on pages 16 and 17 of the report. I cannot agree with the comments contained there from members of the Reserve Bank's Small Business Advisory Panel. They say:
. . . they are generally content with both the availability of bank lending and the current levels of interest rates . . .
Table 2.1 on page 16 shows that in March 1995 the small  business variable rate loans, that is the margin over the cash rate, was 5.1 per cent. In September 1997 it is 5.1 per cent. How can any small business advisory committee say that they are satisfied with the actual rate of the margin over the cash rate for small business when it has not changed? In fact, between March 1995 and 1997 it started to trend down in the course of the last government's tenure in this place and started to trend up with the change in government. Yet the government constantly says that it is looking after small business and will put pressure on the banking industry to do  something about it. The evidence that we have seen as a committee does not lead one to the same conclusion.
In the coming hearings that the committee is going to have in May, which the chairman referred to a little earlier, it is important that this is one issue that we pursue fairly carefully. There is no doubt that if small business wish to seek finance—funding at the lowest possible margin or a loan where they do not have to mortgage everything that they own—then we have to try to provide the economic wherewithal and the broader economic settings in Australia to enable that to happen.
I know that many of the larger banks in this country have been particularly concerned about getting into business lending, particularly for small business. Housing lending has been a priority although there has been some competition in that area from Aussie Home Loans and RAMS. We saw the Treasurer (Mr Costello) stand up in this place last year promoting Aussie Home loans, which had said that they were going to get into small business lending. But it has not eventuated—certainly not to the extent that it was being promoted by the Treasurer of this country. It is the four majors and the regional banks that are still responsibility for the majority of lending to small businesses. They are still charging way above the margins that are being charged on housing loans. There is a huge risk weighting applied to those loans and in many cases it means that the livelihood 
 of people who are in small business or who would like to enter small business is being challenged.
The issue on lending and bank margins for small business is one that needs to be carefully reviewed. As is pointed out on page 17 of our report the Reserve Bank noted that:
. . . the 5.1 percentage point Australian margin over the cash rate that applies to small business loans in Australia, is higher than figures in the United States and the United Kingdom.
If we are going to be genuinely competitive and provide an environment that sustains small business then we have to look at issues like bank lending rates and margins charged to small business. I simply ask the banks themselves to look at that and not require so much tight security on small business. If small business is going to create jobs in Australia, give them the freedom to do so.

The issue on lending and bank margins for small business is one that needs to be carefully reviewed. As is pointed out on page 17 of our report the Reserve Bank noted that:
. . . the 5.1 percentage point Australian margin over the cash rate that applies to small business loans in Australia, is higher than figures in the United States and the United Kingdom.
If we are going to be genuinely competitive and provide an environment that sustains small business then we have to look at issues like bank lending rates and margins charged to small business. I simply ask the banks themselves to look at that and not require so much tight security on small business. If small business is going to create jobs in Australia, give them the freedom to do so.

"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I present the Employee Protection (Wage Guarantee) Bill 1998 . I first spoke on the need for legislation to protect workers' entitlements during a private members' debate in this chamber almost two years ago. I did so after Exicom, a telecommunications company located in my electorate, had collapsed into insolvency, owing $17 million to its 680 employees. Many of the people affected by Exicom's demise lived in my community. In an area where unemployment runs at almost double the national average, to have such a large number of people added to the job queue was one thing; to have them robbed of the money which they were legally owed was a social disaster. I know many members in this House have similar stories to tell.
Today as I introduce the  Employee Protection (Wage Guarantee) Bill 1998 —a bill which once passed would stop such a fate as befell Exicom's workers from ever occurring again—we have the misfortune of witnessing the same sorry story repeating itself. It is a moment of sad coincidence.
As I introduce this bill, 160 workers from the insolvent Woodlawn zinc and copper mine in Goulburn are owed roughly $6 million in entitlements—many of them are here in the capital today; 270 miners from the failed CSA mine in Cobar are also owed $6 million in entitlements; 250 meatworkers in Grafton are owed more than $3 million; 157 nurses in Rockhampton and Yeppoon are owed $1.4 million; 2,000 workers formerly employed by the Sizzler chain of restaurants across Australia are owed $2 million. As a consequence of these dire circumstances, regional centres and towns are having their hearts and souls ripped out. As a consequence, mortgage repayments cannot be met and bills cannot be paid.
Unfortunately, the bill before the House today will not help these people. It does not 
 offer them retrospective relief. Their plight is an issue that the government must address separately and soon. What this bill does is fill a gaping hole in the nation's welfare safety net. It requires employers to insure their work forces under a wage protection insurance scheme and therefore guarantees the money they legally owe.
Australia is the only country in the developed world without—at least in some parts of its borders—a system that either guarantees workers' entitlements against an employer's insolvency or provides them with the utmost priority against all other creditors. Australia has prided itself on its forward-thinking social reforms since Federation, yet we trail the developed world in a matter as significant and as important as protecting workers' entitlements.
Under this bill, in the case of an employer's insolvency, workers will be insured for unpaid wages, annual leave or long service leave, liabilities resulting from the termination of employment without notice or with insufficient notice, and liabilities for repayment of any amounts paid by the employee to the employer for training in a particular trade or profession. Unless exempt under the legislation, all employers must take out and maintain a policy of wage protection insurance with an approved insurer for their work force. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner will administer the scheme.
It is estimated that the money required from employers, not only to insure their workers but also to cover the scheme's administrative costs, would be an extra 0.1 per cent of their total wages bill—a marginal price to pay for such a major social reform.
When I first discussed this issue in this House almost two years ago, I remember quite clearly a member on the government benches saying that I was not the first person on the planet to raise the issue. I do not claim to be. This is an issue that has raised its head a number of times in Australia. It is an issue that should have been addressed long ago. It is an issue to which the major parties should have paid more attention.
I am proud to say that the opposition has committed itself to making the protection of 
 workers' entitlements part of its industrial relations policy at the next election. The onus is now on the government to respond in kind. I am quite prepared for the government to amend my bill as long as its amendments bring about the same result. If it would like to suggest alternative ways of protecting workers' entitlements to those that are in my bill, perhaps I can assist by making a few extra of my own.
One suggestion it may like to consider is making lending institutions pay for the privilege of retaining their position of priority over other creditors, including workers, in the event of company insolvency. Contributions to a wage guarantee fund by the banks would make up a large share of the money needed for a scheme like this to operate.
If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is averse to making all members of the corporate community participate in a scheme such as mine, perhaps he could allow exemptions to the vast majority if they were to enter formal arrangements to place money covering their employees' entitlements in trust. Whatever he chooses to do, I urge the Prime Minister to pay serious consideration to the bill I am introducing into the House today. The Prime Minister may support it in full or use it as a foundation for his own legislation, but he must do something and he must do it now. He must put forward a proposal that will offer security and wage protection to Australian workers now and in the future.
The opposition is ready and willing to offer its full support if he does so. There can be no more procrastination. The security of Australia's workers must be guaranteed. Their legal entitlements are theirs and theirs only. As legislators, we must guarantee that that commitment is kept. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask leave of the House to present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.
Leave granted.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,1998-03-23,"—I move:
That the House:
(1)	 condemns the practice of child labour and calls on governments around the world to do all in their power to outlaw this evil practice; and
(2)	 calls on governments and the private sector to boycott products from countries that use children in this shameful way.
Yesterday in my electorate I attended the Arana Hills Little Athletics Trophy Day, where there were presentations for children aged between six and 15. I saw the joy and the happiness on the faces of those children. It is a happiness that only a child knows, when there is innocence and security of family and loved ones, free education, sport, plenty to eat, clean water and a doctor. It is a time for just having fun. Contrast this with the fact that an estimated 250 million children around the world work in hazardous and exploitative conditions and 12 million children under the age of five die each year, mainly from preventable disease and malnutrition. This indicates that something has to be done in a total sense to ameliorate the sufferings of children.
On the Indian subcontinent alone it is estimated that 45 million children are caught up in this iniquitous cycle. But statistics alone do not tell the real story. Mubina is a bonded labourer in the infamous beedi tobacco factory near Madras. Her parents were very poor and her father was suffering from TB. They borrowed $47 from the local money lender and pledged five-year-old Mubina to work for him in the beedi unit. Two years on she still is doing this work. For 12 hours a day from 6 a.m. she sits cross-legged on the floor closing beedi ends. She has a quota of 3,000 a day. She has never been to school—not that she has a choice—because now the responsibility of keeping the family alive has fallen on her little shoulders.
Seven-year-old Easwari worked a 12-hour day in a firecracker factory filling tubes with sulphur, aluminium dust and coal. After working there two years she was severely 
 injured in an explosion caused by a child cutting gunpowder fuses. Her sister was killed in the accident. She is seriously disfigured in her arms, hands and body. In Salem in Tamil Nadu there are 100,000 child labourers. Some estimates suggest as many as 400,000. Figures are difficult to come by, of course.
Slavery on the subcontinent dates back at least 1,500 years but in the area of child labour some appalling things have been happening. Children were frequently beaten with iron rods and wounded with scissors if they were slow in work or if they asked for adequate food, or if they so much as went to the toilet without the owner's permission. The Times of India reported on 14 August 1995 of a woman's attempt to rescue her youngest son after his brother died on the job in a carpet weaving factory. The employer of her son threatened to kill the boy if she attempted to meet him.
In the silver industry in Salem, boys and girls enter the industry in equal numbers, usually aged between six and eight, sometimes as young as five. Most remain bonded to the industry throughout childhood and adolescence. Bondage has the effect that, when the children move from employer to employer, they might receive a bigger advance from their new employer so that they might pay both off—that is, their previous employer—and enjoy a small and temporary boost in cash flow.
The average advance for six-year-olds is 5,000 rupees, about $160. One rupee equals about one farthing or half a cent. Although interest is not added to the principal amount owed, the disparity between the extremely low rate of wages paid and the minimum wage is equivalent to an effective annual interest rate in the region of 300 per cent. Beginning children earn one to five rupees a day; an accomplished child 10 rupees a day; bonded workers and older can make as much as 20 to 25 rupees a day, which reflects 10 years or more experience.
A Human Rights Watch interview of children found injuries such as burns on fingers, arms, legs and feet. Scars were demonstrated, caused by work tools, blowtorches and acid mixers. Eyestrain and headache were com 
 mon. No protective masks or goggles were supplied and torches were primitive. Children obviously had to keep their eyes near the point of the welding, and burns were routine. Clinical burns on the bodies of children, sparks in the eyes from welding, having to mix acid without protective gear—the list goes on.
Mylappa is an eight-year-old boy who had been working in silk twisting for three years when he was interviewed by Human Rights Watch. His mother took an advance of money after the father died and now the family is working to pay off the loan. He earns one rupee an hour and works 12 hours a day. During power shutdowns he does not receive wages but must stay in the factory and help the employer out as ordered. He is chastised if he arrives late to work, he is beaten and so forth.
It is a similar situation with girls as well. In fact, it even gets worse, because girl factory workers suffer from sexual abuse, frequently targeted by the owners of the factory. Because of the high rate of abuse, almost everyone assumes factory girls have been `touched', that is, molested or raped by the employers, and as a consequence they are shunned as potential brides. The working conditions are horrendous in these factories. There is no first aid and they are cramped in dark, damp and poorly ventilated conditions. One story emerged of a child being beaten up and placed in iron fetters.
We must remember that the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which the subcontinent is a party and most states are parties, specifies under article 28 that states parties must promote and encourage international cooperation in support of developing countries' efforts to ensure access to education for children. Article 32 enjoins states parties to protect children from performing work that is likely to be hazardous or harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. The convention attached international responsibility to states parties—that includes Australia—to prevent this occurring.
One hundred million children between the ages of six and 11 have never attended 
 school. At the World Conference on Education for All in 1990, governments promised to increase resources available to education. However, at the present time, the share of the developing world's gross national product devoted to education averages four per cent, the same as 1990. In some places it has declined. Education is a sound investment. The World Bank says that primary education is the largest single contributor to economic growth rates in Asian countries. Note that the Republic of Korea spends $130 per person per year; India $9; Pakistan $3; Bangladesh $2. It would cost an estimated $6 billion a year to put every child in school by the year 2000. If you think that is a lot, it is less than one per cent of what the world spends every year on weapons.
Poor families are in urgent need and ought not to have to use their children to obtain these temporary reprieves. We need to give credit to poor families. The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh has achieved widespread international recognition by providing credit to the poorest members of society. The Grameen Bank has to be supported in its particular projects.
As we have seen by recent news reports on the export of child labour products, major problems have arisen in relation to identifying sources. The identification that products have been produced by child labour is a continuing challenge to all governments. In the United States, the US government will establish a system to identify products produced by forced or indentured child labour so as to ban their entry into the United States. In the international arena, the ILO's Program on the Elimination of Child Labour, IPEC, is one that demands support. At the present time a new ILO Convention on Child Labour is to be considered by the ILO conference in June 1998.
I think Australia needs to do much more in terms of identifying goods produced by forced or indentured child labour. The United States made an amendment to its Trade Act to prevent the importation of goods where articles or merchandise are mined, produced or manufactured by such labour. The law gives wide powers to Customs to intercept 
 imports and carry out investigations to determine sources of products where child labour is involved. We know that this has happened in the past, particularly in relation to rugs and carpets.
The Rugmark Foundation has demonstrated that elimination of this practice can be achieved. Rugmark is a non-profit corporation made up of representatives from human rights groups, UNICEF and members of the carpet industry. It relies on inspectors employed by the foundation who conduct random surprise inspections of looms that are pre-registered with the foundation.
The practice of child labour is a blot on society and a shame to the whole world. But it is more than just child labour; it is raising the status of the child by education and by providing opportunities through the mechanisms of such great organisations as the Grameen Bank. I commend this report, The state of the world's children, a 1997 UNICEF publication, to the House. Some of the pictures in this particular publication are ample evidence, in my view, of the terrible practice of child labour. We need to do more. I urge this House to give support to this motion.
—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Child Labour</title>,Private Members' Business,3,1
"Willis, Ralph, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I second the motion. This matter which has been brought before the House is indeed a most appropriate one in the sense that it addresses an issue which should be of great concern to not only this parliament  but also every parliament around the world. There is no more disgraceful activity on the face of the planet at the moment than the exploitation of so many millions of children through child labour. We are talking about 250 million children, as the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) mentioned.
That 250 million represents one quarter of all of the children in developing countries aged between five and 14. So in that age group one quarter of all of the children are working. Of that number, about 120 million are working full time—that is, they are not at school but working full time in the appalling conditions to which the member for Dickson has referred. This is a tremendous disgrace. It 
 means 12 per cent of those children have no opportunity for school and are working in appalling conditions—often conditions almost beyond our imagination. What we need to do is to consider what we as a parliament can recommend as action to be taken against such measures.
There is a gathering of world momentum towards taking some action. I am very pleased to see that there is such a momentum. That momentum has come through the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the United Nations adopted in 1990 and which virtually all countries, with some exceptions, including the USA, have ratified. That convention is certainly an important protection for children. But the reality is that many of the countries that have ratified it do not adhere to its conditions and are not going to for a long time.
We also have the ILO conventions. The ILO conventions addressing this issue have been in place since 1919—at least one convention has—and there have been a number since in relation to forced labour and minimum ages. But those conventions are increasingly recognised as being inadequate to address the problem, and there is a need for a more specific convention which addresses this problem directly.
The ILO has been moving towards the adoption of such a convention. This year there will in fact be the first round of discussion on a convention which outlaws exploitative labour. Exploitative labour is the more horrendous part of child labour—that which relates to full-time work at too early an age; work that exerts undue physical, social or psychological stress; work and life on the streets; work that hampers access to education; work that undermines children's dignity and self-esteem, such as slavery or bonded labour; and sexual exploitation. Such a convention would certainly help by focusing directly on the major aspects of the problem and it would help to address a deficiency in the labour conventions at the present time.
There has also been gathering momentum in the sense of international conferences on this issue. In Sweden in 1996 there was a convention on the commercial sexual exploit 
 ation of children. Last year in Amsterdam and Oslo there were conventions on the problem of exploitative labour. This year, of course, we have the forthcoming discussion at the ILO. So there is quite a roll on to get some kind of activity going.
But the ILO has not just been looking at the matter of the convention. It has also had in place a program, to which the member for Dickson referred, and that is IPEC, the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour, which started in 1992 with funding by the German government, which continues to fund it along with some other developed countries, which included Australia. But my understanding is that Australia has ceased funding to that program. If so, that is an extraordinarily disgraceful development.
What IPEC does is to enable the ILO to provide support to countries, to appraise the nature and extent of child labour, to identify priority groups and to develop and implement policies and programs which aim at the elimination of child labour. Nineteen countries are currently involved; 10 are in the process of being brought into it. This has proved to be an effective approach but the funds applied against the scale of the problem are totally inadequate. There are also UNICEF projects directed at this issue as well as many non-government organisations working in the area.
What else could be done? This motion refers to boycotts by government and by the private sector. I am not quite sure what the member means by that, but I hope he does not mean trade sanctions. This issue is a very controversial one. Trade sanctions have been looked at by a body which the Keating Labor government commissioned in 1995, and it reported in February 1996. It basically recommended against having trade boycotts because, it said, they would not be effective. It said that they would be deficient because they would impact only on child labour employed in the traded goods sector, which only covers about five per cent of child labour according to the 1997 UNICEF report The state of the world's children. So that means 95 per cent of child exploitative labour would be unaffected by trade sanctions. Also, the effect would likely be to shift child labour from the traded 
 goods sector to domestic industries, thus still leaving them in exploitative labour. In other words, it would be ineffective in that sense.
They also said that a ban on importing products of child labour would need to distinguish between exploitative child labour and other labour and this relies on judgments that would be difficult in many cases; that there would also be problems in identifying products of exploitative child labour to a level that withstood legal challenge; and that the enforcement effects would be extremely resource intensive and easily circumvented. For those reasons, the ban was likely to be ineffective. They therefore concluded that the problem of child labour is multifaceted. It is better to apply funds to addressing the problem directly, as is done with the IPEC program, rather than through trade boycotts, which have a superficial appeal but clearly are not likely to be tremendously effective.
UNICEF and the ILO are both mightily motivated by this issue. UNICEF devoted its 50th annual report to this issue, therefore indicating the great importance they give it. The ILO was clearly highly motivated to address it. Neither of them are arguing for trade boycotts. They are arguing to directly attack the problem by setting in place the legal frameworks which give proper protection and also the social structure which will enable these issues to be more appropriately addressed. That usually comes down to funds.
In particular, those organisations point to the need for the provision of free basic education. The children involved are not getting any education. It is unbelievable that at least 12 per cent but up to 25 per cent of the developing world's children between five and 14 get little or no education. That is extraordinary. It locks those people permanently into unskilled work or no work at all for the rest of their lives because they do not have an education, a background, which will give them the skills to be employed in the future. It is therefore a cycle of poverty.
To overcome that, UNICEF and the ILO recommend strongly that we focus on education. That requires funds. It requires funds for schools to be developed. The Harkin bill, a trade boycott bill which was introduced in the 
 United States, scared the Bangladesh garment industry into sacking 50,000 young  people. A follow-up study found that a lot of those people did not go to school; instead they got jobs in terrible areas like prostitution, street hawking and the like. So there was little in the way of gain. The ILO, UNICEF and others then introduced another program to try to provide education facilities, to provide a stipend to those children so they had an income. This is a costly program.
The bottom line of this is that, if the Western world is really concerned about child labour, it is not a matter of it just passing trade boycotts so we can all feel good; the West should be not only encouraging the countries concerned to devote a suitable proportion of their resources to providing such basic things as good labour inspection services to ensure their laws are policed and good education facilities but also providing appropriate aid. The West is continually reducing its aid. We are down to 0.28 per cent of GDP. Developed countries generally are down to 0.25 per cent, against a target of 0.7 per cent. The percentage is declining all the time. It is no good standing up here and talking about the need to do things when we are not addressing the issue appropriately.

"Nelson, Dr Brendan, MP",LP,1998-03-23,"—If you cannot do much about Australia's commitment to foreign aid when you are the Treasurer of the country, as the member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) was in the previous government, what hope is there for the rest of us? I quote:
The day will come when the progress of nations will be judged not by their military or economic strength, nor by the splendour of their capital cities and public buildings, but by the wellbeing of their peoples; by their levels of health, nutrition and education; by their opportunities to earn a fair reward for their labours; by their ability to participate in the decisions that affect their lives; by the respect that is shown for their civil and political liberties; by the provision that is made for those who are vulnerable and disadvantaged; and by the protection that is afforded to the growing minds and bodies of their children.
This was the definition of `the progress of nations' as enunciated by the United Nations Children's Fund in 1993. If this is how world 
 progress is to be measured, we have a considerable distance to go. The health and wellbeing of children, the extent to which we nurture their idealism and protect their vulnerable transition to adulthood are critical measures of a caring society. What kind of world do we as people who live in an affluent country want to live in? What are we as parliamentarians prepared to do to make it happen, to overcome the injustice and the inhumanity of child labour?
Opinion pollsters that service both major political parties in this parliament seldom take their clipboards to the shacks, the slums and the shanty towns of the developing world but, if they did, they would find there that the aspirations of parents for their children are little different from those of the people whom we are privileged to represent in this parliament.
Australians have joined the rest of the world in being far more preoccupied with the soap opera antics of the royal family and the alleged sexual indiscretions of a US President than the injustice of children who are underfed, slavishly overworked, subjected to harmful physical and work practices and denied any form of social and legal status. We are at risk of becoming a people who no longer care about the rest of the world. In that regard, I concur entirely with the comments of the member for Gellibrand, because I believe that the strength of individuals and of nations can be measured in terms of the care, concern and compassion that are shown to those who are most vulnerable and who are most in need.
The comments of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) when she first spoke in this place—that we should withdraw from the United Nations, for example; and that we should not send foreign aid to the rest of the world—reflect an inattention that is in all of us, a dark side of human nature that says, `I should care only for myself and the things that are immediately around me.' I believe that the Australian government I am privileged to currently be a member of and all Australian governments need to seriously reconsider not only the way in which we spend our foreign aid money but also the quantum of wealth that we are prepared to 
 contribute to those who are in need. The ultimate price of progress in many countries is being paid by children—so well enunciated by my colleagues who have spoken to this motion.
How we choose to live affects the world. Let us choose to live to change the world. And let us not ever succumb to the warning given by Robert Kennedy in June 1966 in Cape Town when he warned of the danger of futility—the belief that there is nothing one man or woman can do against the vast array of the world's misery and ills. We can do something about it, and I believe that, if there is a political will and it exists strongly in this parliament, change will be effected.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith that this House:
(1)	 notes that the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Max Moore-Wilton, has apparently certified in writing that Senator Parer's confidential declaration of interests are in compliance with the guidelines on ministerial responsibility, and that the Prime Minister has accepted this advice;
(2)	 notes that, notwithstanding this clearance by Mr Moore-Wilton and, ultimately, the Prime Minister, considerable evidence of a conflict of interest involving the Minister has emerged, which the Minister has belatedly recognised, by attempting to divest himself of some of the private interests in question; and 

(3)	 calls on the Prime Minister to table in the Parliament all of the advices by Mr Moore-Wilton on the compliance with the guidelines by the Minister for Resources and Energy with respect to his pecuniary interests.
We have had submitted to the parliament today, via the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and Senator Parer in the other place, an absolute flood of documentation. The more you read it the more it puts the minister firmly in the gun on this matter. This is a man with an apparent conflict of interest; this is a man with a real conflict of interest; this is a man with a conflict of interest that takes him well beyond any reasonable interpretation of the ministerial guidelines established by the Prime Minister—so proudly in the first instance but we noted in that extraordinary interview with Lyneham on Friday evening that he is prepared now to concede that apparently that set of interests, that declaration, was the practice of previous governments.
There is one set of documents, however, that has not been tabled here and those are documents that go to the state of the examination made by the head of the Prime Minister's department, the content of that examination and the advice that he tendered to the Prime Minister on that matter, which is now thoroughly germane to this issue as it proceeds and unfolds to this point and as it will proceed and unfold over the next couple of days.
To refresh people's memory on why it is important to understand how the head of the Prime Minister's department and the Prime Minister choose to interpret these documents, I go back to the guidelines of ministerial conduct. The reason we must have a suspension of standing orders is so that we can compare those considerations of Mr Max Moore-Wilton and the Prime Minister with the standards of conduct that they are obliged to examine. That is the whole point of having that documentation tabled.
The matters that they must examine go to this. It says:
It is vital that ministers and parliamentary secretaries do not by their conduct undermine public confidence in . . . the government. 

It goes on at another point to say:
Although their public lives encroach upon their private lives, it is important that ministers and parliamentary secretaries avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes.
Any appearance of using public office. It goes on:
The nature of their duties is such that they may need to have regard to the interests of members of their immediate families (to the extent that ministers know their interests) as well as their own when ensuring that no conflict or apparent conflict between interests and duties arises.
No conflict or apparent conflict. It is preceded by a paragraph that deals with the question of giving any appearance.
Having gone through the circumstances it lays down for resigning directorships—and we have already seen that at the very least Senator Parer was tardy in a number of aspects of that particular requirement upon him—we come to the absolute clincher, that section which has not permitted a single editorial writer in this country to walk around the proposition that the Prime Minister has decided to extend a new level of crony capitalism in this country to one of his mates. No editorial writer, no commentator, has seen any way for the Prime Minister to walk around this point.
—I remind the honourable leader that he is moving a very narrow motion.
—And we wonder how Max Moore-Wilton has managed to walk around it, which is why we want to see his documents. That provision says:
.	 Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities.
Nothing there about having to minutely examine a conflict of interest or establish a decision related to a particular company in order to establish a conflict of interest. It simply says you get out. That is what this says. It goes on—and this will be an interesting thing to examine against those letters that have been tabled here today, as we will have an opportunity to do as the week goes on:
The transfer of interests to a family member or to a nominee or trust is not an acceptable form of divestment.
It is not an acceptable form of divestment.
—I remind the Leader of the Opposition that this is a suspension of standing orders.
—So the question arises, when it is as plain as the nose on your face to any person who understands the English language and to any person who has a modicum of understanding of the issues relating to accountability in this place, why that has not been apparent to Mr Max Moore-Wilton and to the Prime Minister in their private confabulations on this matter. Are we to assume that the Prime Minister and Mr Max Moore-Wilton have been misled or did they in fact know about these things?
It may be, and it may be not, the case that the documents that we are asking for here today, which have not been included amongst that flood of documents related to his private interests which have appeared on the table—and I would have thought that the waiver that the Prime Minister refused to give on tabling this further information on the basis of past practice would scarcely apply in circumstances with the flood of private documentation that we have received here today—would have obviated that particular argument.
We would expect that in defending himself the Prime Minister would be able to point to how Mr Max Moore-Wilton has gone through Pan Australian Resources and examined them uphill and down dale and made absolutely certain that there was no potential conflict of interest and that the minister was not engaged in any shareholding in relation to his portfolio—precisely the matter that Mr Max Moore-Wilton was obliged to inspect.
We would probably find from that documentation some sort of analysis done by Mr Max Moore-Wilton of QCMM (ESP) shares in Australian resources. We would have also seen no doubt the examination that he has made of the interests in coalmining in Jellinbah in the Bowen Basin. Indeed, we would find an analysis of any of those interests in that whole plethora of resources operations that the minister has now evidently 
 found himself in some way or another involved with. This is an absolutely essential part of this parliament's task. This parliament is absolutely obligated to ensure an enforcement and upholding of standards.
—This is a suspension of standing orders; not the substantive motion.
—Ah, come on!
—The honourable member for Hotham will remain silent.
Mr Albanese interjecting—
—The honourable member for Grayndler will withdraw that.
—I withdraw.
—I didn't even hear that.
—The honourable member for Hotham will remain silent if he wishes to remain in the House.
—Unless we get a suspension of standing orders to enable the House to consider the Max Moore-Wilton documentation, along with all the other documentation which has been tabled, it will not be possible for the House to make a complete judgment on the material that was tabled here in this chamber today.
I would have thought that it stuck out to all honourable members that that was what was required here. We would find out whether Max Moore-Wilton took it a point further and saw whether or not the family shareholding in Gashbah Pty Ltd, Spanlex—and remember you do not divest to somebody else under the terms and conditions of Mr Howard's propositions—Aquatec Environmental Ltd, Maxcon Industries, Sunshine Water, Kemkay and Auswater Ltd also had some mention in the Max Moore-Wilton correspondence.
We would find out whether an opportunity would arise  therefore to contrast the minister's performance in relation to CSR. He exited CSR because he thought it might affect a decision or be seen to be affecting a decision he had taken in relation to bauxite mining. What the heck is the difference between that and all the other linking companies that have been revealed here today—companies front and centre linked to just about every conceivable resource except oil? 
 But do not worry about it, we are working on that one. Every other conceivable resource that is mined in this country in some way or another related to the minister's interests.
Frankly, if they are in the Max Moore-Wilton documents, the Prime Minister is culpable. If they are not in the Max Moore-Wilton documents, we ask ourselves: what the hell is he doing? Why is the secretary to the Prime Minister's department clearing people when there is this amount of information available to them? (Time expired)
—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>MINISTER FOR RESOURCES AND ENERGY</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Reith, Peter, MP",LP,1998-03-23,"—I am delighted to speak now, and I thank the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) for bringing me on whilst I still have a captive audience on the other side. What a disappointment to the opposition today's question time must be. They spent days building up expectations. They were going to drop the biggest bucket you have ever seen. They had this bloke on toast, so they said. They were going to have a great week this week. This was the week when muckraking was to go to new lows and bring the government to its knees. Those were the claims being made over the weekend.
—Is this in accord—
Mr Beazley interjecting—
—The honourable member for Hotham will remain silent. Not much of the Leader of the Opposition's was, either. In terms of the narrow motion, I think that both of you have strayed somewhat from the principal question in relation to the suspension of standing orders.
—Mr Speaker, it was a faint hope for you to suggest that the member for Hotham could contain himself for many moments longer, because no-one has spent more time over the weekend trying to build up expectations that the Labor Party were going to get Senator Parer, only today to find that the subject of their attack was the fact that when he was involved with this coal company, prior to his becoming a minister, the company decided to set up a share owner 
 ship scheme and he got 44 shares. A share ownership scheme is akin to a superannuation deal where basically you say to the employees, `We will put something away for you for some future time.' What were the circumstances surrounding this?
—I remind the minister again that we are on the suspension of standing orders, not on the substantive motion.
—We are, Mr Speaker, but this rather vacuous, empty suspension before the chair raises the implication that there has been a failure to comply with the ministerial guidelines and a failure to pick that up in the independent assessment undertaken by the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
My point to you, Mr Speaker, is that the claims being made in respect of this particular company have already all been dealt with. In the end, there is nothing new in this. I thought we were going to get something new. There is nothing new in this. This is old news. This is stuff that was out last week, and the reason it was out last week—or the week before—is that, when Senator Parer before he became the minister had an involvement in this company, this company had something like a superannuation scheme for the employees. This company obviously has made investments on behalf of the employees. So what? This is not big news. This is not a big deal.
The challenge for the opposition today was to come forward with some new allegation—an allegation of a conflict of interest. That was the challenge for them, yet it is a challenge that they have not only not met today but failed to meet the whole time this thing has been running. We basically say to the opposition: it is time you either put up or shut up. You have failed to put up now for 10 days. You have had a campaign of muckraking against an honest, decent, hard-working, good minister and you have failed to put up anything whatsoever.
—What rubbish!
—You say it is rubbish. The plaintive cry from the humbled Leader of the Opposition—ho, ho!—talks about conflict of 
 interest. His senior colleague, a former cabinet colleague of his in the Senate, Senator Robert Ray, has talked about conflict of interest. This is what the Labor Party says—your colleague in the Senate—about Senator Parer. This is from the Senate Hansard , 11 March 1998. He says:
I would never think for a moment that Senator Parer would consciously and directly take a decision affecting the coal industry to directly benefit himself . . . 
The words I read out make it absolutely clear. They have never had an allegation against Senator Parer that he has been in a conflict of interest situation. You have never had it, and those are the words of your very own colleague in the Senate.
When you look at it, what are the allegations that they ultimately need to make? The guts of this whole thing is: why do you have guidelines? You have guidelines so that you can make an assessment of whether or not somebody has been in a position of conflict of interest. That is the reason you have guidelines and, ultimately, commonsense has to prevail. Look at some of the facts and circumstances behind this case. Firstly, on the evidence produced themselves—
—We are on the suspension of standing orders. I remind you that we are not talking on the substantive motion.
—I certainly hear what you say and, Mr Speaker, a substantive motion would be necessary if the Labor Party wanted to make some slanderous imputation or inference against the minister. Of course, they sort of do—and they don't. The reason they don't is that they can't, and that is the point I am trying to make. This is a sneaky, sly device by the Labor Party to blacken a name. When you go through, what are the basic facts here? First of all, there has been no conflict of interest. Secondly, I think of relevance to this debate is that at no time has the minister received income from the particular activities the subject of this whole matter. So no conflict of interest has actually been alleged. Secondly, there is no income from the trust. You see, this trust has—
Opposition members interjecting—
—Members of the opposition will remain silent. The minister has the call, but I hope he is addressing the question of suspension of standing orders.
—I am, Mr Speaker. This trust is a source of income for the adult children of the minister. That is the point of this trust.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This minister is continually disregarding your rulings. You have told him to stick to the matter before the chair; there is nothing in the matter before the chair about the minister's trusts and all this. He knows the minister is guilty. He ought to just come out and say so.
—The honourable member for Watson will withdraw that remark. He does not know the minister is guilty.
—He sure looks like it, Mr Speaker.
—The member for Watson will withdraw that innuendo and inference. Do you withdraw it?
—I know the minister is guilty but, if the minister at the table does not believe he is guilty, I will withdraw it.
—Thank you. The honourable member will resume his seat. I have extended the same licence to both the speakers to date, but I assure you both that in days gone by the suspension of standing orders were far more narrowly interpreted than they are today.
—Mr Speaker, that's a terrible—
—The honourable member will resume his seat.
—Mr Speaker, it will test all your patience when they—
—Mr Speaker, I think that your remarks—
—You are not arguing my point of order, I trust.
—Mr Speaker, your remarks were a slur on the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) and me and I want you to withdraw them.
—The honourable member will resume his seat. You have not established a point of order. I made the remark that we are now essentially debating a suspension of standing orders. Some licence has been given to the Leader of the Opposition and some licence is now being given to the Leader of the House.
—Cancel his licence.
—We are always charitable.
—The member for Hotham seeks similar licence and, as the chief muckraker for the opposition, licence is what he will be after. The opposition has manipulated points of order to deprive me of my time, but I do say that the jocularity evident on the other side shows you that not even they treat this matter seriously and, quite frankly, nor should they. This is a suspension so that the House can note a couple of propositions which we do not accept, calling on the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to table certain documents. We will reject it—it is a joke.",REPS,<title>MINISTER FOR RESOURCES AND ENERGY</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—We do treat this seriously; it is the government that is not treating it seriously. What we had tabled in the House today, after two weeks of our probing, was a nine-page letter from Senator Parer. I believe that, before long, this will go down as one of the longest resignation letters without the words `I resign' on it that will come.
The question that this suspension of standing orders seeks to ascertain is: if, after our probing, and if, after our questioning in the parliament and through the media last week, we have been able to force Senator Parer to come forward with a nine-page letter on just coal, why didn't Max Moore-Wilton? Why didn't the person who was given carriage of the task by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) report to the Prime Minister on the details that are in question? We know the history of this. Max Moore-Wilton was tasked with this issue after the John Moore fiasco.
—Again, we are on the suspension of standing orders, I remind the honourable member.
—This is the Max Moore-Wilton context, Mr Speaker. He was asked 
 then to look through every minister's register of interests. We want to know—
—You are on a suspension of standing orders, I remind you.
—I am appreciative of it, Mr Speaker. This is specifically saying that we want the advice from Max Moore-Wilton. What we are trying to establish is: what did he ask back in 1996? I hope you listen to me on this point, Mr Speaker, because I do not want to get interrupted on it.
—I suggest the honourable gentleman addresses the motion before the chair.
—No, I am addressing the motion. The reason we are seeking the tabling of the Max Moore-Wilton advice is that the Prime Minister tasked him not once but three times to go through every minister: first of all, in October 1996; then again in May 1997, from the Prime Minister's own mouth here in the parliament last week; and again in October 1997 following Senator Parer's letter to the Prime Minister on the CSR shares—three instances in which Max Moore-Wilton was asked by the Prime Minister—
—This is not the substantive question.
—It is the substantive motion, Mr Speaker. It is why we are seeking suspension of the standing orders to table these damn documents.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The motion before the chair is that the standing and sessional orders be suspended. The convention in the House is that a member should at least speak to the reasons why there should be a suspension. That is a separate matter.
—I think the Leader of the House has made his point. The minister can resume his seat. I would ask the honourable member to address the question before the chair, which is specifically the suspension of standing orders.
—Yes it is—suspension of standing orders to table the advice from Max Moore-Wilton pertinent to this matter, because it is what we have not been told that 
 matters in this exercise. There is nothing in the documentation tabled today that mentions Pan Australian, which we have asked about in this parliament. We want to know whether Max Moore-Wilton asked the questions about Pan Australian, which are the questions that we asked. Did the man tasked by the Prime Minister ask those questions?
We have also established—and this is why we want this suspension to get the tabling of the documents—that it is not now just the minister for coal owing shares in a coalmine; it is the minister for gold owing shares in a goldmine, the minister for diamonds owning shares in a diamond mine. It is like a remake of that great John Denver song, with a bit of adaption: some days are diamonds, some days are coal. This is the minister who has nothing left in his responsibilities that he has not conflicted with.
—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Again, the member for Hotham is way, way off this motion.
—No, the honourable member for Hotham is currently on the question.
—The minister has hidden this material from the public and the parliament. Did he hide it from Max Moore-Wilton? That is the question that we want answered in this place. What did he hide from Max Moore-Wilton? If Senator Parer goes, so too does the Prime Minister's permanent head of department because he is the person who thrice has cleared Senator Parer. We have continued to demonstrate the continuing conflict of interest—a conflict of interest not just in terms of his coal dealings but in every other resource with the exception, as the Leader of the Opposition points out, of oil.

	 Question put:
	 That the motion (Mr Beazley's ) be agreed to.",REPS,<title>MINISTER FOR RESOURCES AND ENERGY</title>,<title>Motion of Censure</title>,Censure Motion,8,1
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	 notes that there exists significant scientific controversy as to the effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted from mobile phone towers;
(2)	 resolves that current legislation should be amended to require that mobile phone towers not be installed within a radius of 300 metres from schools and playgrounds;
(3)	 resolves that the telecommunications industry be levied to raise funds to conduct research into the health and safety aspects of electromagnetic radiation emitted by mobile telephone towers; and
(4)	 calls for a review of Australian standard AS2772 which relates to electromagnetic radiation emissions.
This motion is seconded by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton).
—Are you sure?
—I am sure. This issue concerns a number of members on both sides of the House and concerns the construction of mobile telephone towers in the vicinity of schools. I give credit for the source of the wording of the motion to an organisation in my electorate called SPINS, which is the acronym for Stop Phone Installations Near Schools. They are very concerned about a proposal by Vodafone to construct a mobile telephone tower immediately across the road from Blakehurst Primary School. I will go into those circumstances in the course of my speech.
Currently there are about 4½ million mobile phones in Australia and about 2,000 towers, which all give off electromagnetic radiation. There has been a considerable debate, over the past couple of years in particular, as to the effect of this electromagnetic energy. The issue was first raised in a Four Corners program in July 1995, but even as early as 1994 the CSIRO had issued a report saying that there were some issues that needed 
 further investigation and flagged it as a potential concern.
The cautions were raised in a professional sense in December 1996 by Dr Bruce Hocking, who is a former Telstra medical director. He published a paper in the Journal of Australian Medicine in December 1996 and established that there was a potential link between children under 15 years of age suffering from leukaemia and their proximity to a mobile telephone tower in St Leonards at North Sydney—that is, the incidence of leukaemia among children of that age group in that area compared with the rest of Sydney was certainly higher. That study has since been found to correlate with another study in Honolulu in Hawaii, where there has also been a higher incidence of leukaemia among children near television towers.
That raises the issue of mobile phone towers. Certainly, the fact is that the radiation emitted from mobile phone towers is not nearly as high as that emitted from TV towers. Nonetheless, there are issues that need addressing. The mere fact that there is a concern justifies my motion and putting a moratorium on any further construction of mobile telephone towers in the vicinity of schools.
The debate that is occurring now centres largely on the fact that the industry relies on the Australian Standard. The Australian Standard is one of preventing human exposure to radiation of such a level that it generates a thermal effect. The radiation is so intense—as I understand it, in my ignorance—that it actually increases the oscillations of cells, which generates heat and causes damage to the cells themselves. But evidence is emerging that electromagnetic radiation which is less than that intensity is also harmful.
A report in the Australian on 6 May last year told of a study undertaken at the request of Telstra. It was a completely objective test run by very qualified scientists. The test involved mice and occurred in 1984 and 1985. It showed that there was a twofold increase in the likelihood of these mice developing B-cell lymphoma. It is concerning that, while the lymphoma was evident in the early part of the experiment, the incidence 
 continued to rise over 18 months, which tends to suggest that the effects are cumulative and time related. That is a real concern. Telstra had clauses of confidentiality in respect of those test results. I am not suggesting anything sinister, but the fact is that the results have now come out.
There are a number in the industry who are adopting the tobacco industry's defence—that is, they are constantly repeating that `men or women are not rodents'. On the other hand, scientists are saying that DNA is DNA, and humans and animals alike have DNA. The study also indicated that there were some among the population of mice who were more susceptible than others.
The article in the Australian says that this susceptibility is something that clearly needs further identification and it is not good enough for the industry to simply rely on Australian Standard 2772 to say that this radiation from mobile phone towers is not in the thermal category and therefore not a risk. The fact of the matter is that the study undertaken on mice indicated that something less than thermal radiation certainly is implicated as a potential cause of these cancers.
When you are looking at school kids, you have to be concerned: these mice were exposed for about two hours a day; for school kids, we are talking about 6½ hours a day, five days a week. Blakehurst Primary is on a hill directly across the road from a tower. Effectively, it is 100 metres across from where the radiation source will be.
I do not wish to be a scaremongerer or to dissuade parents at Blakehurst Primary from keeping their children at the school. That is not my purpose at all. My purpose is to flag the extent of scientific debate. Certainly, it is only a debate at this stage. I readily concede that if anyone commenced a court case they would not establish, as a matter of probability, a causal connection between exposure to electromagnetic radiation and the development of illnesses such as childhood leukaemia.
However, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that, as a hypothesis, it needs and requires testing. The government itself has admitted that fact. It has allocated $4 million 
 for further testing and research to be undertaken.
I will not read out the contents of an ad which has been recently published by the National Health and Medical Research Council, but it clearly calls for research on these very issues, that is, the biological effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation. It is not merely scaremongering. Yes, there have been some academics who have been more emotional and perhaps more sensational in espousing a causal connection, but even the March 1998 bulletin of the Australian Communications Authority, the industry watchdog, acknowledges the uncertain scientific knowledge, stating:
However, the ACA also recognises that this is an emerging area of science and is consequently structuring its regulatory framework so that as new scientific knowledge becomes available new developments can be incorporated.
My whole point is this: you do not get a second chance. If a child is exposed now and in 20 years time the child develops a form of tumour or some other illness, you cannot rewind the clock.
The tragedy for parents whose kids go to Blakehurst Primary School is that they may well in the future be included as part of the scientific data studies, and that is just not good enough. There is a risk, and no-one can say there is not a risk. If there is a risk and that risk is being reviewed and studied, in the meantime you do not expose children to that risk. Parents are entitled to assume that when their children go to school they are going to an environment which is risk free. All the industry is being required to do is to have a moratorium on building mobile telephone towers within 300 metres of a school while this research is being undertaken. I have corresponded with Vodafone on a number of occasions now. I hope they show good faith, because if they do not this debate is going to become increasingly public and I know that parents will be making a choice as to where they buy their phones.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,1998-03-23,"—I suppose it would be fair to say that there is still a great deal of conjecture in the community as to the effects of electromagnetic radiation in all its forms. My colleague the member for Barton (Mr McClelland), in presenting this motion to the House and in drawing our attention to mobile phone towers, touches on an area of concern to all Australians. Without in any way wishing to diminish the focus of his concern, I wonder if we have not ranged sufficiently widely in addressing this matter of electromagnetic radiation in its various forms even within the telecommunications disciplines, for example, mobile handsets themselves. I say that because telecommunications and new technologies are expanding at an ever-increasing pace. While I commend my colleague for giving a primary focus to children and their immediate environment, I ask what the situation is for those same children who are exposed, either at school or at home, to some form of electromagnetic radiation hitherto thought to be benign. I would therefore appeal, in the broad, that the allied matters of electromagnetic radiation in communications technology be comprehensively addressed.
Looking at the motion itself, we all know that levels of electromagnetic radiation are higher at their source and diminish with distance. In talking about household appliances, radiation is hardly detectable at about 1½ metres. We have in our own homes appliances that come into close or intimate contact with us: hair dryers and electric blankets, for example. As one paper put it quite succinctly, `It is also unclear whether brief, high-level fields of appliances have more impact than low level fields of power lines, wiring and other sources.'
Electromagnetic waves pass through many objects, including trees, the walls of our homes and other buildings. These waves pass through our bodies, but it is difficult to measure the types and intensities of electromagnetic radiation fields that we come in contact with because we all live in different circumstances and are exposed to diverse and varying types of radiation. But, again broadly speaking, what is known is that when they 
 generate heat at high levels of frequency then it is time for concern. There are within the electromagnetic radiation spectrum frequencies which are known to affect genetic materials. As honourable members will be aware, frequencies are measured in hertz, or cycles per second. As we have come to know them in their most frequently used forms, these measures of strength are kilohertz, 103; megahertz, 106; and gigahertz, 109. The greater the frequency, the shorter the wavelength and the greater the energy transmitted. At 1016 hertz the waves become ionising, or capable of affecting the atomic structure of matter—cells, for example, are vulnerable. Ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays are at a greater frequency than 1016 and can cause cancer through damage to genetic material. We should look back in horror when we consider that, when buying shoes during the 1950s, one could look at how well those shoes fitted through a self-operated X-ray machine.
However, in considering the spectrum in which mobile telephone towers sit, we are looking at the non-ionising types of radiation referred to as RF or radio frequency microwave radiation in the 100 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz range. This range encompasses AM radio, FM radio, VHF and UHF TV, mobile phones, radar and microwave ovens. Australian Standard 2772.1, to which the honourable member refers in his resolution, covers this range.
Experimentation in this field generally has been confined to laboratory animals, so it is difficult to draw conclusions which necessarily apply to children or adults. In other words, do such experiments provide an adequate model? Research conducted by the Centenary Institution of Cancer Medicine and Cell Biology gives rise to some concern. Over an 18-month period it subjected 200 mice predisposed to lymphomas to intense pulse radiation similar to that emanating from digital microwave sources. These were the same sorts of pulses that would have been generated by, say, European cellular telephones.
There were two times as many lymphomas in the mice subjected to the microwaves than in those that were not. The study was fi 
 nanced by Telstra. As Michael Day said in his summation of this research in New Scientist:
Just how microwaves could promote cancer is unclear.
But what is clear is the need for more focused research both at the handset and transmission tower areas of science. When we consider the RF radiation from TV towers and mobile phone towers, the member for Barton's concerns—and no doubt the concerns of all of us—take a sharper focus. TV towers have a much higher power rating and give out more intense radiation. Fortunately, these are located on hills and mountains generally a fair distance from areas of population. North Sydney, however, is an exception to this rule.
At 100 to 150 metres, the radiation from a mobile phone tower is at its peak. As one moves further away the level of intensity drops off rapidly. TV towers transmit at strengths 15,000 times that of mobile phone towers. The Australian standard of 200 microwatts per square centimetre easily encompasses the six microwatts per square metre said to be the maximum value for analog microwave towers and one microwatt for digital towers. In the case of analog, this would represent only three per cent of the allowable power density.
In the case of a TV tower, transmission strength at one kilometre is five to 10 microwatts per square centimetre and falls away rapidly over the next kilometre. However, what is disturbing is to find that a paper by Dr Bruce Hocking, quoted in a number of journals, alludes to findings that would indicate leukemia may be linked to the strength of RF radiation from TV towers in urban areas. This study refers to the incidence of leukemia in an area within a four-kilometre radius of a cluster of TV towers. The number of cases in this area compared with a control group at eight to 12 kilometres from the tower was markedly different. In the former group, the incidence of childhood leukemia was 60 per cent higher and mortality 100 per cent higher. In adults, leukemia was 13 per cent higher.
European and US epidemiological studies indicate that the incidence of certain cancers is 1.5 to four times higher in individuals 
 exposed to suspected high levels of electromagnetic radiation. In both these cases, the studies are inconclusive and require more definitive research. Nevertheless, the warning signs are there. If, as Dr Hocking observed, levels of eight microwatts per square centimetre were found near TV towers, and if we loosely extrapolate this in a comparison with the six microwatts per square centimetre 150 kilometres from an analog phone tower, then there would appear to be a very strong case for some additional research.
We need to realise that we have five million mobile phone users in this country. By head of population, we are the greatest users outside Scandinavia and well ahead of the US, UK and Canada. It is natural then, given our demography and geography, that we will need to continue to be users of cellular and microwave technology. What follows then—and it is very much in our own interest—is that there be greater and more research into this field of endeavour. To that extent, the member for Barton's motion is timely. With those covenants that I put in my presentation today, I broadly support his thrust.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Mobile Phone Towers</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Wilton, Greg, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—I commend the motion moved by the member for Barton (Mr McClelland). As he has put quite succinctly, there is evidence—and it is now known as fact—that electromagnetic radiation does indeed emanate from mobile phone towers. Of course, there has been a great deal of research to support the fact that this is the case. But no-one has convinced me nor the member for Barton that there is no health threat caused by the low levels of electromagnetic radiation that does emanate from these mobile phone towers.
There is sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation into the possibility of further health risks outlined by my colleague. One of the more cited journal articles on this matter is a 1993 paper by Dr Ivan Beale from the University of Auckland titled `Biological effects of weak radio frequency radiation'. In that article Dr Beale states:
Our current safety standards are based only on research showing adverse effects of body tissue heating in animals exposed for brief periods to relatively high radiation levels. 

He goes on to say that there are no research studies of the long-term animal or human exposures to the more complex type of radiation emitted from mobile phone towers. Therefore, he questions the legitimacy of the existing standards of exposure. Whilst exposure of the general public to radiation levels of more than a few microwatts per square centimetre is rare, Dr Beale says that even that amount is millions of times higher than the radio frequency levels arising from natural sources. He also says:
Given their circumstances and considering also the lack of relevant research studies and the limited applicability of current exposure standards, a responsible course of action is to minimise unnecessary exposure . . . prudent avoidance—
as he puts it—
is now being widely applied for addressing the uncertainties regarding health risks from non-ionising radiation. Its application is particularly appropriate in situations involving exposure of more vulnerable sections of the public, such as children, who may be particularly prone to effects of exposure and may have limited ability to protect themselves.
The operation of. . . (mobile phone towers) on or near kindergartens or school properties is likely to result in large increases in radio frequency exposure for groups of children. This is contrary to the principle of prudent avoidance and inconsistent with good health protection policy.
This area of research is developing rapidly. While we need more quality independent research undertaken into the nature of electromagnetic energy being emitted from mobile phone towers, we can say the Beale statements result from an assessment of hundreds of papers produced on the effects of this form of electromagnetic radiation.
The industry has told its critics that they should find evidence that phone towers may damage people's health. I think the onus should be on the multi-million dollar industry to prove to the public that there is indeed no health risk. We, the general public, have a right to be protected from the potential health risks caused by mobile phone towers. Like previous speakers, I am particularly concerned about the location of such towers near both kindergartens and schools.
Both the member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and the member for Barton referred to an 
 article by Bruce Hocking, a former Telstra medical director, in the Medical Journal of Australia linking leukemia incidence with the proximity of TV towers. This study should lead us to do what New Zealand has done: avoid locating TV towers next to schools and kindergartens. What the member for Hinkler did not say in citing as he did the increased incidence of leukemia around these mobile phone towers is that in late 1996 the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) dismissed the study by saying it probably represented a cancer cluster. I have no doubt that any reasonable reassessment of Dr Hocking's paper would illustrate that this increased incidence of acute leukemia in children was uniformly distributed across the suburbs close to towers.
There is no doubt that community concern about this matter is increasing. There is no doubt it is of great concern to parents, especially those in the outer urban areas of southern and eastern Melbourne, including those represented by me and the next speaker, the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson). I am sure that he will join with me in calling for a moratorium on the placement of these mobile phone towers adjacent to both schools and kindergartens, where the threat to young students is unknown.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,1998-03-23,"—More than 4.5 million Australians, including around 30,000 people in Dunkley, use a mobile phone in their work, leisure or private lives. Thankfully, the coalition replaced the `let her rip' ALP approach to mobile phone towers with a sensible and sensitive regulatory arrangement. Optus, Telstra and Vodafone are now directly accountable through local planning laws for tower deployment.
Today's motion is more about the emotions that surround community debate on this subject than the facts of the issues. At least Labor members, who showed such disinterest in this subject when in government, are now acquainting themselves with these issues. However, it should be a debate about science—real science; not counterfeit science that had to be rolled out under the former ALP regime, which gave little credence or weighting to visual and amenity concerns 
 about poorly located and unwelcome mobile phone towers.
This motion fails the test of scientific validity. The relevant standard in Australia covering the emission of electromagnetic energy, or radiation, is the interim standard AS 2772.1, refined in 1998. The Australian Communications Authority says that these standards are amongst the most stringent in the world. Radio frequency devices operated in accordance with recognised human exposure safety standards will not pose a health risk.
The ACA also recognises that the regulatory framework should allow for more scientific developments and findings to be incorporated. Our national standards are about five times stricter than those applying in the United States. Not only is our standard of 200 microwatts per square centimetre for mobile phone frequencies stricter; it is also about 250 times less intense than the experimental animal threshold for thermally induced behavioural changes from which many of the scientific observations have been derived.
The scientific consensus is that digital mobile telephone towers emit a maximum of around one microwatt—much less than the six microwatts for AMPS technology—or one-tenth of one microwatt per square centimetre of electromagnetic energy. In other words, telephone towers normally generate an exposure of electromagnetic energy of about one-2,000th, or 0.05 per cent, of the standard for mobile telephone handsets used in Australia. There can be no disputing that the actual users of mobile phones are subject to higher doses of radiation, particularly if aids like hands-free operation and ear pieces are not used to reduce this exposure. Mobile phone users place themselves at the immediate point that receives and transmits the signal—the handset. The phone towers emit EME in a terrestrial manner. The key defining characteristic about electromagnetic energy is proximity to the transmission and reception device. This motion misses this point.
The radiation emitted by a mobile telephone tower peaks—albeit at a minuscule level, as I mentioned earlier—at between 100 and 150 metres but then declines. Given the scientific 
 facts, there is no evidence that suggests a separation distance of 300 metres has any logical basis. In fact, the insistence on an arbitrary separation distance risks causing a carrier to `dig in' in favour of very poor sites rather than move cooperatively to another location where separation distances, amenity and environmental protection and visual screening could all have been greatly improved.
Counterfeit science like that being propelled today is impeding better outcomes for communities. I might add there is a world of difference between television transmission towers and mobile phone towers. Everyday household appliances emit another type of radiation—ELF. Household shavers can create up to 15,000 microteslas of magnetic flux density next to the skin. Small stimulation of cancer can occur at the exposure of 400 to 500 microteslas. A hair drier can give rise to 2,000 microteslas. Even though these types of radiation exposures are mostly transient, is the member for Barton proposing that we ban the use of all shavers and hair driers within 300 metres?
It can be argued that science has a solid hold on the thermal impact of EME and we already have some of the most stringent standards in place. The picture on non-thermal impacts is less clear, though. That is why the government has provided $4 million to the National Health and Medical Research Council to fund research projects in this area. Given the critical proximity factor I mentioned earlier, the research rightly focuses on mobile telephones—not so much on the towers, as the motion seeks to emphasise.
Specifications for this research include that it should lend itself to attempted replication by researchers. We have all read of the Royal Adelaide Hospital research where mice genetically bred to be predisposed to cancer developed cancer at a greater rate than their rodent colleagues after exposure to radiation for 18 months. Difficulty in replicating the findings, conflict with other research conclusions and doubts about the applicability of the work to humans, given differing body mass, tissue density and cell composition, support the 
 government's contention that more work needs to be done.
Most mobile phone users are not bred to be cancer prone or sleep with a mobile phone the size of their bed. Let us stick to the facts, let us be true to the science and let us carry out the additional research in the area where it is needed: at the handset. (Time expired)
—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made on order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS</title>,<title>Mobile Phone Towers</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1
"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—Today I seek to highlight the government's gross mishandling of the end of war list for Vietnam, which has caused considerable dismay and anger in the veteran community. It continues a pattern already set by the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) with the so-called `double medalling' fiasco for Korean War veterans and her attempt to mislead naval veterans of the Malayan Emergency about the contents of a 1996 letter from the UK's First Sea Lord of the Admiralty.
The issue has a long and fairly complex history. It arises because of a quota system in place during the war which restricted the number of medals and commendations that could be issued by commanding officers. This quota disadvantaged 78 ADF personnel, 28 of whom were given a lesser award than recommended by their commanding officer and another 50 who missed out completely at the time.
The end of war list is designed to correct this situation. It includes 59 veterans who were nominated for acts of gallantry and a further 19 nominated for meritorious service. It is the government's handling of the gallantry cases that is the point of contention and that has been indisputably inept. The complication arises because the veterans concerned were originally recommended for imperial medals, such as the Military Cross for officers or the Military Medal for other ranks. Australia is no longer able to award imperial honours. The replacement Australian system of honours is now fully operative and, under this system, the relevant level 3 medal is the Medal for Gallantry.
To everyone except the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel it would appear a relatively straightforward matter to award the veterans concerned the Medal for Gallantry in lieu of the imperial medals they were originally recommended for. It appears that the minister is happy to award the Medal for Gallantry to veterans who were recommended for the Military Cross but not 
 to those who were recommended for the Military Medal. She has argued that the order of precedence requires her to award the latter veterans a commendation rather than the Medal for Gallantry. She clearly finds it difficult to explain why this is so. No-one else in the government or the veteran community seems keen to associate themselves with her position.
The opposition has been contacted by a number of experts on military medals who dispute the minister's contentions. They say that there is nothing in the order of precedence that requires the government to downgrade a recommendation for an imperial Military Medal to an Australian commendation. They say the Military Medal is a level 3 award but the commendation is a lesser, level 4 award. The key to the whole saga appears to be that the six or so veterans who were recommended for the Military Medal were not officers. The minister appears unhappy about awarding diggers the same gallantry medals as officers, so she has arbitrarily downgraded gallantry by diggers to a commendation. In so doing she has undermined the very basis of the Australian system of honours, which was critically designed to move away from awards that were linked to rank or to service in a particular stream of the defence forces. She seeks to do something that the British Tory government long ago repudiated and got rid of.
Despite her denial on radio 2GB on 18 March, it remains the case that only officers are to get gallantry medals under the end of war list. While some ordinary diggers are to get medals for meritorious service, none are to receive medals for gallantry. This is what the debate is about and her comments, on that occasion, were designed to confuse the issue. During the same interview the minister implied that her critics were seeking to elevate diggers' awards to give them higher recommendation than their commanding officers had recommended. This is totally false. The opposition and prominent veteran leaders like Bruce Ruxton are simply demanding that diggers get a medal, not a commendation, where this is what their commanding officer initially recommended.
The case of John Burridge, a Perth veteran and medals expert, highlights the incompetence shown in this matter. It is a bitter irony that he first went to Vietnam in 1968 as a 21-year-old national serviceman who was conscripted there by the coalition. He was recommended for the imperial Military Medal for acts of gallantry on 8 May 1969. The citation by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Khan, included the following passage:
Private Burridge moved forward, on his own initiative, to a position 15 metres from the enemy and commenced engaging the (enemy) bunkers. He maintained his position for over an hour and effectively prevented the enemy from moving to other bunkers on the flanks of the platoon. His actions drew most of the enemy rocket fire onto his position and as a result he was wounded in both legs. Despite his wounds and further enemy engagement of his position, Private Burridge continued to fire on the bunkers and restrict the effectiveness of the enemy fire until the remainder of the platoon could move to new positions. His courage and his complete disregard for his own safety were major factors in preventing further casualties to the platoon and his conduct was an inspiration to all.
Because of the quota system, John Burridge did not get the Military Medal he was recommended for. The relevant paperwork confirms that Lieutenant Colonel Khan's superiors, including the commander of Australian forces in Vietnam, Major General Hay, supported his recommendation. Solely because of the quota system, the only recognition that John Burridge received at the time was to be mentioned in dispatches in 1971. Because the imperial Military Medal cannot be awarded to him in 1998, he should get the Medal for Gallantry. He is instead being offered a commendation, which he describes as an insult and which he intends to reject.
Clearly the minister is seeking to alter what commanding officers in the field, with more experience and more knowledge than she has, actually recommended. The government seems more interested in the fact that Mr Burridge was a private, and a conscript to boot, than in his bravery. To offer him a commendation on the basis of his rank is to compound the unfairness he suffered 29 years ago because of the quota system.
This unfairness has prompted the RSL's Bruce Ruxton to go in to bat for these veterans and to meet with the minister. By all accounts their meeting last week was a robust affair. Afterwards Mr Ruxton was quoted in the Canberra Times on 18 March as saying:
We'll keep on punching, we'll keep up the pressure because it's crazy. . . It's not right because they are awarding one thing to officers and another to other ranks. . . (Veterans) are furious; it's just another knock for the Vietnam vets.
A letter to the editor in the Age  of 5 March from Bruce Sim of Sunbury reinforces these criticisms. He wrote:
For 26 years, Vietnam veterans have waited for their comrades to receive their nation's honour for acts of unstinting heroism. Our current Government was elected with a promise to finalise the End of War list. Details of the list have recently been published but once again Vietnam veterans have been slapped in the face and treated with contempt. The End of War list will award gallantry medals to officers, and other ranks will receive commendations . . . This is nonsense and, to the shame of this nation, it continues what is becoming a tradition of kicking in the teeth those who served their country.
The minister should have the good grace to reconsider her decision and provide a gallantry medal to those who have more than earned such recognition. Quite clearly this latest situation is one in which she finds very few supporters in the veteran community, very few supporters amongst the people who participated in the war in Vietnam, very few supporters amongst the officers who made the recommendations and very few supporters, quite frankly, in the government of this country.
In the brief moments left to me I would like to turn to another matter. I congratulate the alliance of councils in western Sydney for their efforts today in lobbying the government over the question of Badgerys Creek. They are the representatives of 1½ million Australians who are increasingly concerned with the flaws in the EIS. In this flawed EIS we are seeing a situation where those carrying out the purported survey are ensuring that there is minimal public right to participate. The recent announcement that form letters will basically be ignored typifies the attempt to try to enforce—
—Hear, hear!
—`Hear, hear,' the member for North Sydney says. He defends a practice in which this EIS is seeking to minimise public participation, seeking to minimise the rights of constituents in western Sydney to have a say in  this process. I congratulate those councils regardless of their political affiliations for the way they have taken up this campaign against an airport which promises western Sydney and 1½ million Australians 70,000 extra vehicle trips a day, increased pollution and the aggravation of learning difficulties. I commend those councils' activities. The government must consider very seriously the Snowy Mountains organisation's analysis and criticism of this EIS.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Military Awards</title>,Grievance Debate,12,1
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,1998-03-23,"—In summing up the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 , I want to thank honourable members for their contributions. I want to cover briefly two issues that have been raised during the debate. The bill amends a number of acts to remove the legislative requirement for the portfolio minister to approve the terms and conditions of employment, including remuneration of the principal employee of statutory authorities within the primary industries and energy portfolio, placing the responsibility for this process entirely with the individual portfolio organisations.
In no other portfolio has the minister undertaken such a significant role in providing written approval to the terms and conditions of employment of a CEO. The proposed amendments are also consistent with recent developments in the government's approach to public sector workplace relations which indicate that it would be unrealistic to isolate 
 statutory authorities within the primary industries and energy portfolio for ministerial approval of employment conditions—totally inappropriate. Ministerial involvement also necessitates administrative procedures which can be time consuming and which add to the risk of losing prominent appointees due to delays in finalising appointments.
I now turn to the $3.6 million reduction in the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation's special appropriation for 1997-98. We have to make these savings because of the Labor Party's incompetence whilst they were in government. The saving will contribute to our goal of winding back Labor's $10.3 billion budget deficit. The saving will also help pay for the South East Fishery's adjustment program, which we had to set up due to the Labor Party's hopelessly inept management of that fishery. The saving is possible because the FRDC has substantial financial reserves. FRDC will still be able to meet all of its obligations. The reduction will not affect its long-term research priorities. The federal government funds FRDC in a slightly different way to its other primary industries research and development corporations. We make a very large unmatched contribution to the corporation in addition to matching contributions from the fishing industry.
The amendments will only affect our unmatched contribution to FRDC. The government is continuing to match industry contributions on a dollar for dollar basis. The federal government remains committed to research for the fishing industry, and we are demonstrating that by matching the industry's contribution on the basis that for every dollar that they put in, the federal government will put one dollar in for research.
I agree that fisheries research is important, but it was more urgent and important to fix up the south-east fisheries which were so disastrously mismanaged by the previous government. I commend the bill to this House.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—The second reading debate on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill will be I think fairly uncontentious in the House in terms of the clauses of the bill. I do not think it will be the same in the Senate. In my contribution I want to refer to some of the matters that my colleague Senator Faulkner, who is the shadow minister principally responsible for this area, will raise in the Senate because they are very important issues of public debate, important issues about the probity of our electoral processes, the probity of funding of one of our major political parties in this country.
But, in speaking to the  Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997 , I want to make it clear that the opposition supports the majority of the provisions in this bill. That is 
 not surprising. After all, the amendments it proposes are of a technical or administrative nature, dealing with electoral administration and operational procedures in the conduct of elections and referendums.
The government has just distributed some amendments regarding application forms for postal votes. The opposition will be supporting those also. We have had only a very brief opportunity to examine them but, as far as we can tell, they are matters which we will be pleased to support. We certainly will support them here in the House. Subject to further analysis by my colleague Senator Faulkner, that will be the case in the Senate. I see no reason why it should not be.
There is one item that we do wish to seek to amend in the House. I hope it will attract the support of the House. We wish to take item 48, the overseas elector provisions, a little further. We are pleased to see the government attempt to address this issue. However, they do stop short of a full implementation of the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in their report on the 1996 federal election. Of course, governments have the right not to implement committee reports, even unanimous reports of joint committees, because that is the nature of the executive initiative in our Westminster system.
This committee has been a tradition of some 15 years standing—since I think Mick Young, as the minister responsible for electoral matters, initiated the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. It may have been a select committee for one or two elections.
It has made very important reviews. We have had a continuing bipartisan approach—not to every issue on electoral matters, because some of them are fundamentally very contentious and matters of principle between the parties. Therefore, of course, we have robust debate about those. But the overwhelming majority of these technical/administrative matters have been dealt with very professionally by that committee over the years. I have appeared before it as a witness before I was in the parliament and in fact on one occasion since, and I have seen its reports in my capacity as a minister. I think 
 the committee, over the years, has done a very good job. In this instance the government has chosen not to fully implement the recommendations of the joint standing committee.
Particularly with regard to item 48, as the legislation currently stands, electors who travel overseas for a period of three years or less may remain on the roll, provided they register with their DROs as eligible overseas electors. They must do so within three months before leaving to go overseas or within 12 months after leaving Australia. This period can be extended by annual application. The committee recommended that the three-year period be extended to six years and the capacity for electors to apply for further extensions on a year-by-year basis should be retained.
This legislation falls short of that recommendation as it limits the time limit for applications to two years. This would not be useful to those overseas voters who have already been overseas for more than two years and who have lost the opportunity to apply for overseas voter status. Our amendments seek to ensure that, from 28 days after the date of royal assent, any Australian overseas for the purpose of employment, or their spouse or children, can apply for overseas elector status for a period of six years, with the option of annual extensions. I would not expect a flood of applications taking advantage of this measure, although it does empower those Australians overseas who really want to exercise their right to vote in Australian elections.
It seems to me the principle underlying the electoral legislation ought be that all the Australians who wish to vote ought be given the opportunity to vote as best we are able. The reasoning is to allow those Australians who have been affected by this clause in their legislation to take advantage of this new amendment. A number of people have been actively campaigning for this change and it would seem somewhat absurd if the desired change were achieved with a two-year time limit on applications and those very people who have been campaigning for the change were still not eligible to enrol.
We also believe that many people do not actually think about such things as electoral enrolment until elections come round. Someone who went overseas just after an election may otherwise miss the two-year cut off before thinking about elections and enrolment in the election year. A two-year cut off seems a rather anomalous provision in an electoral system that has a three-year electoral cycle. You would have thought that three, six, nine years, et cetera and those things that go up in threes would have been a more appropriate cut-off.
I would also note that the majority of recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters have not been addressed in this legislation, which is fair enough. The government is essentially trying to put the non-contentious matters here before us and it is important to get those dealt with. I understand the government has plans to introduce further legislation to address the other perhaps more controversial recommendations and we will be very interested to see what they come up with in response to those matters. There has been some recent speculation in the media which might be a course of interest and that will be pursued more by my colleagues in the Senate.
However, what I do want to do this evening is take the opportunity on behalf of the opposition to flag certain other amendments to this bill that we will be moving in the Senate. I have outlined our general support for the bill, our support for the government's amendment and support for the amendments we will be moving here. Those are essentially, as I say, about technical, machinery matters—not unimportant matters; they are important to the efficient operation of a democracy, but they are not controversial. Not that I necessarily expect our amendment to be carried here in the House but, either way, I do not think it is a matter of great contention.
But the matters that we will be dealing with in the Senate are very important. We will be moving amendments there to close what seems to be a loophole in the Electoral Act, the loophole which the Liberal Party of Australia has been exploiting. The Liberal Party again has been sidestepping the disclos 
 ure provisions of the Electoral Act. This is not surprising; they have form in this matter. At every stage in the legislation, at every attempt to close the loopholes, the Liberal Party has found a new loophole seeking to avoid disclosure as far as possible. On each occasion the parliament has had to come around again and legislate to close the loophole.
It is a mind-set not dissimilar to that with the tax avoidance industry: if you can avoid the letter of the law, it does not matter if you tear apart the spirit of the law. The spirit of the disclosure provisions has been clear ever since they were introduced. It is that the intention is that the Australian people be able to know who is funding the political parties in their election campaigns. It is an issue in most Western democracies now: how are the major political parties funded and can we get an understanding of whether there is some influence being brought to bear as a result of those funding arrangements? To seek to avoid it on each occasion, as the Liberal Party has done on each and every occasion, including this one, simply reinforces the concern that there is something to hide.
The Liberal Party has had a history of exploiting apparent loopholes to launder money from undisclosed sources. It is not a big secret. Everybody knows how they did it up until 1995. The Liberal Party used the Free Enterprise Foundation. They laundered funds through donations of massive sums to the coalition, without revealing where the funds originally came from, that is, donors gave their money to the Free Enterprise Foundation, the Free Enterprise Foundation donated to the Liberal Party, all the disclosure provisions said was, `Donation from Free Enterprise Foundation', and nobody could go behind that to say what was the original source of the money. It might have met the letter of the law, but it tore apart the democratic spirit of it; it tore apart the proposition that the Australian people are entitled to know who is funding the political parties.
The previous Labor government amended the Electoral Act to close this loophole by determining that associated entities had to disclose their source of funds. This resulted in 
 a crackdown on disclosures in 1995 and, shock and horror, the Free Enterprise Foundation was required to disclose any new donations it received. Straightaway, we find a new scam. Let us have a look at the Liberal Party's 1996-97 returns to the Electoral Commission. We know that at the election the Liberal Party had a $10 million debt to the National Australia Bank, which gave them financial backing for the 1996 election campaign. That should have been public; it is public and that enables people to debate. There has been comment on and general acceptance of the fact that that $10 million of debt underwritten by the National Australia Bank in effect was given on the condition that the Liberal Party, if elected to government—as they have been—would let the banks into the superannuation industry, as they have done and as they are seeking to do even further. We might not like that but the donation of all that money was on the public record.
The Liberal Party's return to the Electoral Commission for 1995-96 listed their debt to the NAB at $6,762,763. But lo and behold by 1996-97 the debt to the NAB has been reduced to $158,305. For the same year a new lender was listed for the first time—the Greenfields Foundation—to which the Liberal Party owed $4,650,000. This is not some great financial institution; I would not want to turn up at the Greenfields Foundation and say, `Excuse me, can you lend me some money for a mortgage for my house?' If I were trying to set up a new business here in Canberra—that is where Greenfields Foundation is—I would not back myself to get a small business loan from the Greenfields Foundation.
—Your counterpart goes to Ron Walker.
—That is right, and I think Ron Walker goes to the Greenfields Foundation. We have this new scam. The trustees of the Greenfields Foundation do not appear to be current officials of the Liberal Party but, the House will be shocked to know, they certainly appear to share an uncanny number of contacts with the Free Enterprise Foundation. That will be a surprise to every 
 body, I know. For example, the Greenfields Foundation shares two of the three trustees with the Free Enterprise Foundation—Mr Tony Bandle and Sir John Atwill, who just happens to be a former president of the Liberal Party.
The 1996-97 disclosure shows the Free Enterprise Foundation having a postal address of GPO Box 292, Canberra, ACT 2601. But the trustees of the Free Enterprise Foundation have a postal address of C/- PO Box 52, Deakin West, ACT. This postal address was used by the Free Enterprise Foundation itself in 1995-96 and—wait for it—it is now used by the Greenfields Foundation. The same postal address is also used by Bandle McAneney & Co., to whom we will refer in a moment. You might remember that Mr Tony Bandle was one of the trustees of both the Free Enterprise Foundation and the Greenfields Foundation and Mr McAneney is the third trustee for the Greenfields Foundation. So, we have this connection between Bandle, McAneney and the Greenfields Foundation, and the Free Enterprise Foundation telephone contact on their return is for Bandle McAneney & Co.
I am advised, Mr Deputy Speaker—you will be distressed to hear this—that Bandle McAneney & Co. has also been a signatory for Liberal Party cheques. I am sure that they are not associated in any way. This is just the most extraordinary series of coincidences! Nobody would say that these bodies are in any way associated, because, you see, the Electoral Act says that all donations over $1,500 to political parties must be disclosed. The source of money for the Greenfields Foundation, it is claimed, does not have to be disclosed because the money was in the form of a loan to the Liberal Party. For this reason it is alleged that the source of the money to the Greenfields Foundation does not need to be disclosed under the Electoral Act.
There is nothing wrong with making a loan to a political party. Financial institutions do it all the time and the debt is disclosed. If there is a debt to the National Australia Bank or the Commonwealth Bank, everybody understands the commercial ramifications of that and you observe it rising and falling with 
 the fundraising and expenditure programs of the parties. That is a proper piece of public information. But the problem arises from the fact that we have here the possibility that the Greenfields Foundation can collect substantial donations from sources which remain anonymous for the purposes of funding disclosure. This will remain the case until the AEC determines them to be an associated entity.
It is not for me to determine that the Greenfields Foundation is an associated entity of the Liberal Party. The overlapping signatories, addresses and other elements of profound coincidence may be found ultimately to be just that. What we have is the effect that money is being forwarded to the Liberal Party and the sources of that money are not disclosed, contrary to the clear intention of the parliament and the clear and reasonable expectation of the Australian people. We do not know whether the loan will ever be repaid, how the funding is secured and whether the interest rate is concessional. We have made changes to the tax act so that—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order of relevance: I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is a bill for an act to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984—
—As I understand it, the honourable member for Canberra was pointing out where he saw deficiencies within the act, which is within his right to do. There is no point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on another point of order: the bill is a fairly narrow bill. It relates to technical amendments. The member for Canberra is ranging very widely, well removed from any amendment included in the legislation. The closest he has come is to tell us that he wants to talk about matters which will be moved by Senator Faulkner in the other place. I would ask you to request that he be relevant and remain within the standing orders of the House.
—There is a list of speakers and since you have set the guidelines I hope everyone in the chair follows those strict guidelines as to relevance.
—Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do accept that we need to remain relevant, but it is important to say what is not in the bill that should be there. That is a perfectly relevant thing to say. This bill should cover this matter. This loophole should be closed at the first opportunity. This is the first opportunity, and nobody has taken any action to close it. I am criticising this government for failing to disclose it, and the points of order being raised will not stop me from doing so.
As I was saying before I was interrupted, we have changed the tax laws. I think this government changed the tax laws so that when you enter into non-commercial rates of interest in transactions, particularly with bodies with which you are associated, certain tax consequences follow. That is, in effect, deemed to be income. We do know that the Liberal Party has made a payment of $100,000 to the Greenfields Foundation. That money may have been a repayment. The timing does not make it clear. It might have been made as a grant to set up the foundation.
Even if it is a repayment on a loan, it is a very lucrative rate, at about 2½ per cent, and would not be a loan on any commercial basis. Therefore, there would be a significant element of donation if a non-commercial loan were provided. At the very least, apart from the tax consequences for the Greenfields Foundation or for the Liberal Party, what it says is that the difference between the commercial interest rate and the interest rate at which the money is loaned would seem to me to be properly regarded as a donation for the purposes of the act. What is occurring is that, by using this apparent loophole in the Electoral Act, the Liberal Party is receiving moneys through a loan which it may never have to nor ever intend to repay.
Section 287 of the Electoral Act defines an associated entity as one which is either controlled by a political party or which operates wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party. Section 314AE of the Electoral Act requires an associated entity to lodge an annual return, including details of all gifts of more than $1,500 received during the financial year, and specify the details of the 
 donor. Greenfields have not lodged such a return, and we await with great interest a request from the Australian Electoral Commission to require such a return.
The AEC's regular audit of the Liberal Party could reveal the terms of the loan and other information that may reveal the Greenfields Foundation as an associated entity, one which operates wholly or mainly for the benefit of a political party. We are seeking some action on this matter. We would  like to see the law changed, and we will seek to do that in the Senate. In the interim, we do know that the Australian Electoral Commission wrote to Greenfields to inquire as to their status as an associated entity. However, the response of Greenfields was that they did not feel they were required to provide further information, which is very convenient.
I draw the attention of the House to the Australian Electoral Commission's Funding and disclosure report: Election 1996, in particular, recommendation 10 regarding associated entities. The report identifies that there are some areas of dispute in the wording of the act's definition of associated entities and that these should not be allowed to become sources of confusion or loopholes. To date the AEC has relied upon the cooperation of organisations in engaging in discussions as to their status as associated entities. However, in some cases the AEC has been unable to determine whether an organisation should disclose as an associated entity.
There is currently nothing to prevent an organisation from simply claiming that they do not meet the definition of an associated entity and by so doing refusing to supply any justification for their stance. This is exactly what the Greenfields Foundation have done. They have deliberately exploited the apparent loophole in the definition of associated entity by writing back that they did not consider themselves to be an associated entity with not one shred of adequate information to justify that stance. Given the connections between the Liberal Party, the Free Enterprise Foundation and the Greenfields Foundation, it is essential that the Australian Electoral Commission investigate the Greenfields Founda 
 tion to ascertain whether or not they qualify as an associated entity.
At the moment the Australian Electoral Commission feels constrained from acting. During the estimates committee process, the AEC claimed that we have no authority in the act to go behind a separate foundation on the basis of any suspicion that we may have. They have conceded that they may be able to pursue the Greenfields Foundation after a regular compliance audit of the federal Liberal Party. However, we may have to wait for as long as two years for that to occur. It is a clearly totally unsatisfactory situation. As far as the Labor opposition is concerned, we are not prepared to wait for this government to take action, firstly, to get the compliance audit happening as a matter of urgency and, secondly, to act to close this apparent loophole in the act. We do not expect this government to act, because it is not in their financial interest to do so. They have a loophole which they are exploiting. They are not likely to move to close it.
The debate of this bill provides the perfect opportunity to close this apparent loophole by way of amendment to the Electoral Act. The government should have acted but not surprisingly they have not. We are now as an opposition working on detailed amendments to make sure that the Liberal Party cannot exploit the funding and disclosure provisions in the act in the way that they have, and we will be doing everything we can to expose this rort and to close the opportunity for it to continue to be exploited. That is a debate which will be very important in the Senate. I hope that the amendments we move at that stage are successful. I reiterate that the opposition supports the majority of the provisions in this bill. We support the government's amendments. When we get to the consideration in detail stage we will be moving an amendment in the House to item 48. Beyond that, we will be supporting the legislation.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-03-23,"—When one listens to the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan), one is treated to a journey traversing what the member himself claims are deficiencies in the legislation left to this country by the former government. The 
 honourable member for Canberra did not in any way, shape or form suggest any illegality by the Liberal Party of Australia with respect to the disclosure of various matters concerning funding of the last election. In fact, there is no evidence at all that the Liberal Party has acted in any way which is either improper or illegal, and I believe that it is entirely inappropriate for the honourable member for Canberra to come into the chamber and smear the Liberal Party when the Liberal Party quite scrupulously and quite obviously has kept within the law of this land, as left to this country by the former Labor government.
—Disgraceful!
—It is a disgraceful action by the honourable member for Canberra, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Kooyong. I believe that what the member for Canberra ought to have done was to come into the chamber, stand up and say that this was a bill dealing with non-contentious amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. He went on to say that the opposition did not oppose most of the changes in the legislation, with the exception of one additional suggestion: an amendment dealing with the rights of certain overseas voters. He ought then to have gone into the history of this legislation—how it has its genesis in three different reports handed down by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, now ably chaired by my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Nairn). He ought to have said that the government was going to receive the fulsome support of the opposition in this bill. But, regrettably, having said those things initially, he went on to smear the Liberal Party, he went on to deviate from the specific provisions of the bill, he went on to pre-empt discussion in the other place and then he went on to refer to matters which would subsequently be raised by Senator Faulkner.
This is a technical bill, dealing with matters which people on both sides of the House broadly support. The government, as has been foreshadowed, will further consider changes to the electoral legislation, but those changes are not included in this bill. The honourable 
 member for Canberra conceded that it was important that the non-contentious changes should pass through parliament and should become law, and that is exactly what the government is doing. Senator Minchin has divided the non-contentious from the more contentious areas with a view to facilitating the immediate implementation into law of the changes provided for in this bill.
Some of the major provisions of the bill include allowance for the provision of gender of electors for the purpose of approved medical research and public health screening and for members, senators and registered political parties. The bill also improves the enrolment objection process by allowing relatives and friends who do not live in the same subdivision as electors of unsound mind to apply for their removal from the roll on medical advice and without the payment of an objection deposit. The bill also provides for electors whose enrolment has been objected to to be removed from the roll in the period between the issue of the writ for an election and the close of the rolls.
Most importantly—and this is a change which will save some $1.1 million for every three years of a parliamentary term—the bill will allow the Australian Electoral Commission the option to use the more up-to-date method of printing security ballot papers instead of watermarked ballot papers. This will make the considerable savings I mentioned a moment ago.
The bill also provides that comments and objections in relation to a redistribution are made available for public scrutiny in a manner similar to suggestions. Most importantly for rapidly growing areas and states, the bill relaxes the tight constraints on electoral variations between electorates to allow the community of interest factors to be properly considered. The bill also allows greater opportunity for the public to object to proposed boundaries.
The bill goes on to provide for the removal of the requirement that persons or organisations must object to a redistribution committee proposal to be able to lodge an objection to the augmented Electoral Commission's proposed redistribution and, most importantly, 
 it allows for the redistribution midpoint equality of enrolments to be within a range of plus or minus 3.5 per cent rather than the present plus or minus two per cent.
I would like to refer to that particular aspect. Because of mass internal migration from the areas we like to refer to as the rust belt of southern Australia to Queensland—particularly south-east Queensland—we are finding in Queensland that every three years we have a redistribution and every three years Queensland gains an extra electorate at the expense of Victoria, South Australia or the ACT. In fact, the two states of South Australia and Victoria and the ACT, at the redistributions in 1991, 1994 and 1997, have each respectively lost a seat to Queensland. So, while the Electoral Act makes a very sensible provision for redistributions over a certain period, Queensland is gaining a seat every three years as a result of growth and this redistribution, and of course there must be a redistribution also in the state or territory losing a seat. I believe that if the amendments provided for in this legislation become law it might be possible for some of the changes which are being made to the boundaries of electorates to be minimised.
The amendments included in the bill certainly would not remove the entitlement of Queensland to gain an extra seat every three years, but it might mean that some of the alterations which have occurred in some of our seats would be less dramatic and less disruptive. As an indication of the kind of disruption experienced by Queensland electorates, I would like to draw the attention of the House to what has happened to the electorate of Fisher—a finely represented electorate in this place—which has in the last three terms of parliament undergone three redistributions. In the 1991 redistribution, the electorate of Fisher was 8,086 square kilometres. 
It gained 30,136 voters and lost 53,744 voters. In 1994 the electorate grew to 9,583 square kilometres, and it gained 18,000 voters and lost 29,232 voters. If that was not enough, in 1997, the redistribution recently completed, the size of Fisher is reduced—in fact it collapses—from 9,583 square kilo 
 metres down to 558 and gains 28,433 voters and loses 31,616 voters.
—Are you worried about your electorate payments?
—Happily, the political complexion of Fisher will not change as a result of those redistributions. However, the point is that there is very great disruption and electors do not know from one poll to the next what seat they are going to be in. The member opposite ought not to interject in this debate; he should support this legislation and tell the honourable member for Canberra to stick to the bill and not to digress in the disgraceful way that he has.
The Labor Party likes to talk about electoral funding. Why will the Labor Party not tell us how the trade union movement funds elections after elections after elections when, in many cases, members of those trade unions have no idea that their money is being used for that purpose? Trade unionists are members and supporters of all political parties and yet, despite that, the Labor Party virtually misappropriates their money and uses it for electoral purposes to support the Labor Party—
—Order!
—when the members of those unions oppose the Labor Party.
—The honourable member for Fisher should know that when the chair calls for order and the member sees another member on his feet he should resume his seat. I call the honourable member for Batman on a point of order.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I take exception to the use of the word `misappropriation' and I ask that it be withdrawn.
—The member has asked for the word to be withdrawn. It would assist the process of the debate if the honourable member for Fisher would withdraw the word.
—I am happy to withdraw the word `misappropriation' as it refers to the honourable member for Batman. Of course I 
 did not include him in that description; I was referring to the organisational entity called the Australian Labor Party. I am warming up in this debate—
—You are being relevant too, I hope.
—and I would delight in being able to proceed for another 10 minutes but unfortunately the government is very keen to have this bill passed by this chamber and we have been invited to restrict our speeches to a period of 10 minutes only. Thus the pearls of wisdom that I was going to cast forth—and I regret that the member for Batman will now not have the chance of listening to them—will have to wait for another opportunity.
In a democracy, an electoral system with integrity is a prime aim. It is absolutely vital that on polling day we make sure that the government which is elected represents what the people of Australia wanted to happen on that day. Nothing focuses our attention as members of parliament more than electoral matters.
This bill is fair, it is reasonable, it is moderate and it is non-contentious. It will receive the support of this House and, hopefully, the other place. It is vital that it becomes law as soon as possible. The disgraceful conduct of the honourable member for Canberra, and no doubt that conduct which we are yet to see from other members opposite, is very regrettable. I would ask that succeeding Labor speakers stick strictly to the provisions of this bill, as, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am quite sure you will concede that I have. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Rocher, Allan, MP",IND,1998-03-23,"—I was surprised that the honourable member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) decided to introduce some partisan considerations into the debate on this bill. You would remember, and I certainly do, the matter of a cheque in the run up to an election from a firm called Harris Daishowa and the resignation of the relevant minister after that election, although he was re-elected, before the parliament could convene. The honourable gentleman who was re-elected and who resigned was not prepared to come into the parliament to give the reasons 
 that were given publicly for that particular episode. The political parties are, of course, arguing out of their own self interest; at least, that is the example of the first two speakers.
The honourable Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) said, in his second reading speech, that the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997  introduces a variety of amendments, including a number of technical ones, arising from some of the recommendations contained in the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters about the conduct of the 1996 federal election. The committee handed down that report on 16 June 1997 and, other than the introduction of this bill, there has been absolutely no response to that report.
With that in mind I made written inquiries to the government on 22 January this year, drawing attention to the fact that the three-month period within which a government response to a report is required had well and truly expired and also inquiring as to when the government expected to respond to the report. I did get a letter in response from the honourable Senator Nick Minchin, Special Minister of State, who advised me:
I am aware of the Government's commitment to respond to reports of Parliamentary Committees within 3 months of them being tabled. However, this particular Report contains 73 recommendations and a number of these have required extensive consultation with some Government agencies to allow work on the Response to proceed. The Government expects to table its Response in the Autumn Sitting of the Parliament.
So far so good. I understand the problems confronting the government. The minister went on to say, in his letter:
Although the Response is yet to be tabled, 22 of the Report recommendations are included in the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997, introduced into the House of Representatives on 1 December 1997.
I would have thought that a government would have moved heaven and earth to have a response to a report dealing with the very matters which either are or should have been dealt with in this bill.
More significantly, one recommendation of the joint standing committee's report is that this bill does not implement the report's 
 recommendation 62. The recommendation is not technical but rather is a substantive proposal in relation to the equity of treatment of candidates in federal elections. Recommendation 62 says:
That section 78 of the of the Income Tax Assessment Act be amended to provide that donations to an independent candidate at a federal or state election are tax deductible, at the same level as donations to registered parties.
I would have thought any conscientious government would have addressed itself to that—a matter of justice and fairness. Currently, donations to a registered political party are tax deductible to an annual level of $100. In other words, you can donate $100 every year and that is tax deductible. There is no similar tax treatment provided, though, for supporters of Independent candidates in federal elections who make donations to the campaigns of those candidates. I have an obvious interest in this matter as an Independent member of this House and as a potentially unendorsed and, therefore, Independent candidate in the forthcoming election. I made a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters during its inquiry, stating:
The exclusion for tax purposes of donations to the campaign funds of independent candidates has no basis in equity.
I submitted to the committee then:
Either all donations should be allowable deductions for tax purposes within limits presently stipulated, or that tax deductibility should be not allowed for any donation.
In his second reading speech, amongst other things, the minister said:
Other recommendations of that report relating to matters of electoral reform are currently being considered.
Before this debate winds up, perhaps the minister, or his representative at the table, can tell the House in his reply whether recommendation 62 is one of those being considered for implementation by the government. It is apparent that this is not the first time that I have raised this matter in this place and sought some form of response from the present government. On 20 October 1997, during question time, I asked the Treasurer (Mr Costello) whether he agrees that an inequity exists in the treatment of tax 
 deductibility of political donations. I then asked the Treasurer whether he concurs with recommendation 62. The response of the honourable gentleman was to concede that I had what he described as a `conceptual' point. I differ with him in that; it is far from conceptual. He said:
I suppose you could say at a conceptual level that there should be an equivalence of treatment.
Despite the Treasurer's in-principle agreement with the committee's recommendation, the government has yet to take steps to introduce legislation to rectify the inequitable treatment accorded to Independent candidates and their supporters. It is a simple matter to do just that.
I raised the matter again on 1 December last year in the course of the consideration in detail stage of the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997  because the recommendation is essentially a tax matter. I moved an amendment to Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 that, if passed, would have the effect of implementing recommendation 62 of the report of the joint standing committee. The amendment is there and drafted. All the government has to do is emulate, or regurgitate, my words in an amendment to one of its many tax acts which come through the House. Already, we have an omnibus amending bill,  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1997 , before the House and on the Notice Paper at the moment. It could well have done that. It has had plenty of time.
I said at the time that I moved that amendment that I was motivated by my belief that it is a matter of fairness that any donors to my election campaign—provided their donations do not exceed the stipulated $100—should benefit from any tax deductibility. As I said earlier, as the law stands at present, donations to my campaign, and to the campaigns of my Independent colleagues the member for Moore (Mr Filing) and the member for Calare (Mr Andren), cannot be tax deductible. It is a matter of ordinary justice that Independent candidates should be in the same position as their main opponents, or any opponent, who are usually endorsed by the major parties. That is a matter of simple 
 fairness. The present situation is clearly anomalous: a candidate of a party is able to enjoy the opportunity of receiving donations that attract a tax deduction while another candidate standing in the same election—even standing at that election in the same seat—is not.
A cynic might observe that the major parties are not particularly concerned about the tax deductibility of donations to the campaigns of Independents because there is nothing in it for them. Against that, the Treasurer has, at least informally, in answer to my question without notice, agreed with the principle of my case. But the government is apparently in no rush to rectify the inequity. Consequently, unless I or one of the other members without party affiliations presses the case, it is likely that, although it is fair and just and is recommended by a joint committee of the parliament, it will never see the light of day in this place—and certainly not before the next election. To adopt the committee's recommendation would confer a benefit on taxpayers without, in my view, imposing much of a burden on the revenue. But, even if it is a burden, the proposed benefit is one that should then be shared by taxpayers across the political spectrum regardless of loyalties to a particular candidate or candidates.
In moving my amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 6) 1997 on 1 December of that year, I proposed that the tax deductibility allowance in the case of Independent candidates be very stringent and limited in ways that even the current benefit for candidates from parties is not. I proposed that the deduction apply only to donations within a certain period so that it could not be construed, or even suggested, that some personal advantage might accrue to an individual Independent candidate. My proposition is fair and straightforward, and I have the weight of argument in my favour. Never mind the technical amendments introduced by this bill. I ask the minister: is the government prepared to do the fair and just thing and introduce a government amendment to implement recommendation 62 of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters?

"Nairn, Gary, MP",LP,1998-03-23,"—I also rise today to support the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997 . I think everybody agrees that this bill is a series of technical amendments that are not contentious, and everybody should be supporting it. Really, it is a bill that fixes up quite a number of matters in the Electoral Act that were not addressed during the many years of Labor government. Even the 1993 report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters made a number of recommendations, none of which were really implemented. It has taken this government to introduce this bill with amendments not only from the 1993 report but also from the redistribution report and the 1996 report—and I was the chairman of the joint standing committee that brought the 1996 report down.
Before making a few comments in relation to some aspects of the bill, I would comment on the quite disgraceful digression by the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) in his contribution. He went way off what this bill is about and made various accusations and comments about political donations. He was throwing a bit of dirt around in the typical ALP fashion—if you throw a bit around, hopefully it will stick. I thought it was a bit tough, considering that he admitted that nothing had been done incorrectly, nobody had broken the law, but he still proposed to throw a bit of dirt around.
It was particularly tough coming from the member for Canberra, who I am sure had quite a hand in that questionable deal that was done a few years ago between the then ALP government and the Australian Labor Party in their rental deal on Centenary House—the deal where the rental started immediately the deal was done, before the bricks and mortar went up, and there was an automatic increase every year. That he should stand around here, talking about political donations, is pretty good when you can disclose, basically, money from the Australian taxpayer increasing at about the rate of nine or 10 per cent inflation—I think was the deal they did at the time—as well as having inflation at that time running at about three or four per cent. So it is pretty rough for the member for Canberra 
 to come in here and piously talk about political funding, when he had his hands all over that deal which locked the Australian taxpayer into a very high rent for a very long period of time—all for the benefit of the ALP.
But I come back to the bill. Because of the time involved tonight, I will restrict my comments to aspects relating to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on the 1996 election, the committee of which, as I have said, I was the chairman. Something like 22 recommendations out of the 70-odd recommendations in that report have been included in this particular bill. They are all technical, but I think a couple really need to be spoken about in a bit more detail because they are quite relevant and are things that really should have been done some time ago.
Recommendations 13 and 14 of that report are included in this bill; these relate to the Langer aspects. You may remember from the 1996 election the Albert Langer episode. He ended up in gaol as a result of advertisements he was running on how people should vote. What he was out to do, basically, was to have people put the major parties last and exhaust their voting preferences. There was quite an outcry about that particular incident. I think the Australia Electoral Commission copped flak, and everybody copped flak, at the fact that this chap ended up in gaol.
For that particular part of the report, we took a variety of evidence and, at the end of the day, two recommendations were included in the report. The first was that section 329A of the Electoral Act be repealed, and that was the part of the act under which Albert Langer was prosecuted. But, in addition, to get over the problem that was being created by Albert Langer, there was a further recommendation, recommendation 14, which says that section 240 of the Electoral Act, which provides for full preferential voting in House of Representatives elections, be amended to include the words `consecutive numbers without the repetition of any number'.
Basically, that recommendation, which has been picked up as an amendment in this bill, overcomes the problem that was being put forward with Albert Langer advocating a 
 1,2,3,3,3, et cetera, for a ballot paper—which was not clear in the rest of the Electoral Act. With this particular change, if people voted in that fashion it would be an informal vote; whereas previously that vote would be exhausted. So I think those two recommendations are vitally important.
Also included in this particular bill is recommendation 28, which reads that the Electoral Act be amended `to enable presiding officers to take ballot papers immediately outside a polling place to electors who, because of physical incapacity, cannot enter the polling place; scrutineers should be given the opportunity to observe this process'. I think that aspect is included in some state acts already where a person, because of their physical nature, is just not capable of getting in, or it would be a possibly painful experience to get right into the polling station. I have seen it work in another state where the legislation did allow it. It was quite appropriate for the particular person: they were in a car, and the presiding officer was able to take the ballot paper to the person in the car, with scrutineers from either side to watch the process. So I think that is a fair and reasonable amendment to be included.
Recommendation 40 from the 1996 report is:
that section 170(3) of the Electoral Act be amended to increase the deposit for nomination from $250 to $350 for the House of Representatives, and from $500 to $700 for the Senate.
That is the deposit which is refundable if a certain percentage of the vote is gained. There can be lots of debate about whether it is fair to increase the deposit and what should it be increased to, but I think it is only reasonable to have a reasonable deposit—something that is applicable to the day—for elections because, if it is too small, you will get an incredible number of people nominating for the hell of it rather than for any really serious reason, and that has been seen a number of times.
The overriding aspect as to why we made that recommendation in that committee was that the actual amount has not changed since 1983. I know that under the former Labor government inflation was running very high; we have had very low inflation under the 
 current government in the last couple of years, so if we had the low inflation rate through that period it would be a different story. But we did have quite high inflation during many of those years of the former Labor government from 1983, so I think an increase from $250 to $350 for the House of Representatives is not unreasonable and from $500 to $700 for the Senate is equally so.
Recommendation 41 is:
that section 166(1)(b)(i) of the Electoral Act be amended so that the number of signatures required in support of a nomination by a candidate not endorsed by a registered political party is increased from six to 50.
Currently, if you are not part of a political party, you can just go out and get six signatures and nominate. Given that a political party has to demonstrate before it can be registered a membership of at least 500, we felt that it was not unreasonable to increase the number of signatures for a person not endorsed by a political party from six to 50. Quite frankly, if they cannot get 50 signatures in a federal electorate, they are probably not standing a very high chance of even getting their deposit back, let alone being in the final two of the count.
Recommendation 58 of the 1996 report is:
that section 309 of the Electoral Act be amended so that registered political parties are not required to lodge returns of electoral expenditure.
Some people might see that recommendation and say we are going to stop political parties declaring what they have earned. That is not the case at all. Currently, political parties are basically doing it twice: every year they have to provide returns—very detailed in all sorts of categories—on income and expenditure and they also have to lodge a return after each election. Both of the major political parties argued that that was really doubling the work for them and that it was not really proving anything—at the end of the day the information was still being provided—and I think people would agree that is a reasonable amendment to make. The actual annual accounts and returns have to be done—the information has to be provided—but doing it twice does not make a great deal of sense.
They are some of the key technical amendments that were recommended in the 1996 report that have been included in this bill and, as I said, I will limit my comments to those particular ones, but other recommendations from the 1993 report and from the report on the redistribution have been included. All of the recommendations make for a far better Electoral Act. The integrity of the electoral system has to be kept at an absolute optimum, and the amendments that are proposed within this bill do that. I support it very strongly.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Zammit, Paul, MP",IND,1998-03-23,"—I just want to make a few passing comments in regard to this non-controversial piece of legislation, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997. Our society is  constantly changing and to meet the needs of this ever-changing society the function and role of bureaucracies and organisations—government and non-government—need to be constantly reviewed and revised.
In 1994 the former Australian Electoral Office was superseded by the Australian Electoral Commission, its role being to provide the Australian people with an independent electoral service which not only meets the needs of the people but also encourages them to understand and participate in the electoral process—in other words, to be an active and participatory member of our democratic society. As with other facets of our democratic society, the AEC has had to move with the times. Over the past two decades a number of reviews have been undertaken by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and a number of amendments based on committee recommendations have already been introduced.
The Electoral and Referendum Bill 1997 includes further amendments arising from the recommendations of two Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters reports: on electoral redistribution, tabled in December 1995, and on the conduct of the 1996 federal election, tabled in June 1997. As I said earlier, I would like to comment briefly on three of the proposed amendments. The first concerns recommendation 52 of the 1997 report, which advocates that section 91 of the Electoral Act be amended so that greater 
 detail on individual persons on the electoral roll—that is, their age, gender and salutation—could be made available to senators, members and registered political parties. It was also recommended that this same data could be made available for use in approved medical research and public health screening surveys.
Whilst I would be among the first to admit that gender details, in particular, would make my job as a federal politician much easier when sending out letters to new electors in my area, I am, nonetheless, concerned over privacy issues. What we do not want in Australia is a move towards an Orwellian-type society and, I am afraid to say, we are heading in that direction more and more as time goes on with the greater use of technology.
Proposed section 94A would allow people who are working overseas for a period of less than six years and who would ordinarily be eligible to be on the electoral roll to enrol whilst residing overseas. In today's world, work commitments can often mean that Australians are overseas for extended periods of time but at the same time many, of course, want their vote to count at election time.
The third amendment I want to speak to is the repeal of subsection 329(3) of the principal act. This particular section of the act received considerable media coverage at the last federal election, when Albert Langer advocated a vote other than the full preferential system of voting provided for in section 240 of the principal act, and he was subsequently gaoled for contempt of court.
The result of this amendment is that optional preferential voting will still be valid and people will now be able to lobby others to vote in a similar fashion. It is perhaps an interesting note on our democratic participation in Australia and the very nature of our democratic society when the actions of one person can ultimately lead to a change in electoral legislation. This is not a very controversial bill, so I have restricted my comments to just three amendments. I very strongly support the amendments.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,1998-03-23,"—Australia's first federal election was held in March 1901. In fact, it was really six 
 separate elections held at more or less the same time and conducted under the widely diverse laws governing lower house elections in each of the states. Some states granted universal franchise; other states restricted eligibility for voters on the grounds of race, sex and property ownership. Some states adopted statewide voting for the House of Representatives; others opted for single member constituencies. In fact, voluntary voting was one of the few features common across the nation, but it did not survive very long. It was decided eventually that compulsory voting would be adopted, which is the system that has served the Australian democracy very well since.
Voting systems and determinants of voter eligibility were standardised in the Commonwealth electoral and franchise acts of 1902. In 1918 preferential voting was established. Enrolment was made compulsory in 1911, and voting was made compulsory in 1924, following low turnouts that averaged around 64 per cent. I note that since 1925 turnout has never fallen below 90 per cent. There has been a series of changes since then. The system of electing the Senate was changed in 1948 to proportional representation. In 1973 the voting age was reduced from 21 to 18. Also witnessed in 1983 was a further raft of changes, including above-the-line voting for the Senate.
The important thing is that the result of this evolutionary process is an electoral system which is exceptional in terms of its inclusiveness, its integrity and its fairness. It has to be admitted that this does not mean that the system is perfect. The bottom line is that, while there is always room for reform and improvement, these are not insignificant achievements and they should not be overlooked.
Through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the parliament provides a mechanism for considering and recommending reforms and improvements. The bill before the House today is the result of the committee's inquiries. From these have flowed a number of significant recommendations for change to Australia's electoral laws, some of which, including the recommendation for compulsory voting, would fundamentally 
 alter Australia's electoral system. This bill, however, deals essentially with only the technical and comparatively less controversial issues raised in the committee's report. Notwithstanding this, the bill covers a broad range of issues and raises some important questions. I will deal with only four or five of these.
The first relates to redistributions. The redistribution provision in the bill will implement three major changes in the redistribution process. The first is that the initial stage of the process—the determination of state and territory entitlements to House of Representatives seats—will fall due in the 13th rather than the 10th month after the meeting of the newly elected House of Representatives. The rationale for this change is comparatively straightforward. Since entitlements are determined on the basis of current rather than projected population figures, the delay of three months means that the figures used to determine the number of seats to which each state and territory is entitled to at an election will be one calendar quarter closer to the eventual election date. The Australian Electoral Commission has advised that moving the determination to the 13th month should not unduly affect the redistribution timetable or, just as importantly in some senses, subsequent political timetables. This appears to be a logical and workable improvement.
The second change in the redistribution process proposed by the bill relates to the allowable variation between the enrolment numbers in any given division and the statewide average. The bill proposes to extend the degree of tolerance between divisional enrolments and the statewide average to 3.5 per cent 3½ years after the redistribution so as to give greater flexibility to redistribution committees to apply the qualitative criteria while maintaining the primacy of numerical considerations.
The third major change to the redistribution process proposed by the bill relates to the consideration given by redistribution committees to the various qualitative criteria. Currently under section 66(3) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the redistribution committee must give due consideration to the 
 division's community of interests, the means of communication and travel, physical features and existing boundaries. The bill proposes that existing electoral boundaries be made subordinate to other qualitative criteria.
I am unsure that this constitutes a major advance in electoral legislation. Existing boundaries are only one of the four criteria. The fact is that, in so far as past redistributions have been valid and well based, the existing boundaries are the sum of the redistribution committee's taking into account community of interests, means of communication and travel, physical features and area.
Axiomatically, existing boundaries should be disturbed as little as possible other than to meet the numerical imperatives or to address past debatable decisions made by the committees. Of course, these are always few and far between. It also needs to be said that the various establishments of boundaries create new communities of interest as groups within the electorate organise themselves in accordance with the confines of their single member constituency.
As I began by saying, I am not sure what this amendment contributes and I do wish to emphasise that redistribution committees would be wrong to see in this amendment a rationale for writing down too far the significance of existing boundaries, either as criteria themselves or as a component of the critical definition of community of interests.
The bill also proposes a couple of sensitive changes to the procedures for candidates nominating for House of Representatives and Senate elections. The nomination deposit will increase from $250 to $350 in the House of Representatives and by an analogous sum in the Senate. Although this is the first increase in 15 years and is significantly less in percentage terms than inflation over the period, there is still a sense in which financial impost is being placed on the exercise of democratic rights. The change will, however, make some of those with no real chance of being elected think more carefully about nominating, and I think this is an important consideration.
In a similar vein is the proposal to increase the number of signatures required in support of the nomination of a candidate not endorsed 
 by a registered political party, from six to 50. I would note in passing, however, that, while the increase in nomination deposits was less than the inflation rate, the increase in signatures required is just a tiny bit in excess of population growth.
The bill also contains a large number of provisions regulating activities during an election campaign and the conduct of the election itself. Most of these are essentially small procedural amendments, but there are a couple of more important and high profile changes responding to the issues raised during the 1996 election by the imprisonment of Mr Albert Langer. This has been canvassed by other speakers in this debate, and I think canvassed very effectively. I believe the bill does address the issues raised by the Langer case.
The consequence of the changes, however, is that a not insignificant number of voters will have their votes ruled invalid as a result of honest mistakes made in filling out the ballot papers. The effective disenfranchisement of voters, no matter what the rationale, is something which needs to be very carefully monitored, and I believe that the commission intends to do that, but I would like to see the results of that monitoring in due course.
The bill introduces a number of changes to Australia's electoral legislation, but it is important that these changes be kept in perspective. They are not made to repair a system which is full of holes, but rather they are designed to improve a system which is amongst the very best in the world in terms of its fairness, its inclusiveness and its integrity. They are part of an ongoing process of evaluation, reform and improvement which goes back to the very early days of Federation, and which will continue so long as we continue to strive to achieve the elusive perfect electoral system.
In this respect I do want to compliment the government for moving on some amendments about postal vote applications which I think are very important and will facilitate the efficacy of voting, particularly on the part of more elderly Australians, who are a very important part of the political system. I 
 commend the government on these amendments.
I believe the fundamentals of the system are right. What is required is finetuning. This bill contributes to that and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—Given the hour and the enormous crowd in the gallery, I will keep my comments on the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill 1997  brief. I appreciate the presence of such luminaries as the member for Kooyong (Mr Georgiou), who has an abiding interest in matters of this nature. I see we have another member of the state secretaries club present in the chamber. I will be brief and I will conclude my comments tonight in order to assist the bill going through the House. The bill, as has been said, is essentially a number of minor machinery matters which are a necessary part of the continuing evolution of the system. As the previous speaker said, it is a system we can all be proud of. Just on that point, I am at a loss therefore to understand some of the membership of the current Electoral Matters Committee with respect to their predilection for major changes to the system on the question of voluntary voting. I think that is shared by some members on both sides of the House.
—It is not the subject of this bill.
—It is not the subject of the bill, as I have been reminded. The fact is that we are talking minor amendments here but important ones. The Langer case has been covered by a number of previous speakers, so I will not go into that other than to say that I think what has been proposed will remedy the matter. But we should, as was said earlier, monitor the process in order to see whether it has in fact worked post the next election.
A number of changes relate to the question of the redistribution system. As one who has had his seat abolished, I have an enormous grudge against the redistribution system in this country. It is something that has caused me a great deal of pain. I once said that, if you really do not like someone in the political system, the best thing to do is to get them to prepare a redistribution committee submission, 
 because if they are not mad before they start doing it they will be mad after they have completed it. The changes that have been proposed with respect to that I think make sense. Relating to the question of a further quarter's ABS data being available around the matter of whether distributions should in fact be triggered, I think that is sensible. It means that the information that is being utilised in order to make a decision about whether a redistribution is required is more up to date and accurate, and that is to be commended.
On the question of existing boundaries as part of the criteria and making that subordinate to the other criteria such as community of interests, communications, travel and physical features, it is a never-ending battle to understand those criteria in terms of their operation. I can often recall looking at a range of different aspects of a proposed set of maps as produced by a redistribution committee and having had a situation where on different occasions different criteria have been utilised to make a point on the same area. I recall, as I think the member for Kooyong does, the argument on the seat of Flinders in Victoria at the redistribution before last, where it was said it was in effect a silly seat which should not go around Westernport Bay and this redistribution would fix it. The following redistribution reinstigated it. The fact of the matter is that it did not show a lot of rhyme and reason then and it still does not now, so I will look with interest to see how that criterion will in fact operate. I have my doubts as to whether in fact we will see a lot more sense come to the process, but I do think that it is a difficult job and it is not a job that I would wish to have to do myself. I wish the commission all the very best with future redistributions and hope that they will one day shine upon me as they have not done in the past.
—But you're complaining.
—I have survived, I guess.
—Have you declared an interest?
—I have an interest in this, yes. But, as to whether I have an abiding interest of the intensity of others that might 
 be mentioned today, that is in fact not the case.
The fact is that the legislation, as part of that evolution process, is an important part of developing a system which is one of the best in the world. It is a system which is often pointed to overseas, and officers from this country are often used overseas to assist in electoral processes. It is something we should all be proud of and it is something that we should look forward to in the future. I commend the bill to the House and wish it a very speedy passage as we approach the adjournment debate.",REPS,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT BILL 1997</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,15,1
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,1998-03-23,"—Tonight I want to talk about country doctors. Tasmania is suffering from both the state and federal governments not being able to get their acts together with expenditure on health. The result of this is that services are being closed and nothing is being done to replace those services. This is leaving local people without doctors or medical help for long periods when they were used to 24-hour a day district hospitals.
This was the situation recently in St Marys on the east coast of Tasmania when the district hospital closed for good, leaving in its place a nine-to-five medical centre. It had played an important role in the community, particularly with the elderly, and led to locals using the town as their main centre. Now people are concerned that without the hospital not only will the medical services be curtailed but the local economy will suffer. Already shopkeepers have reported a drastic decrease in trade and those that used to do their shopping while visiting the hospital are no longer coming. This is what happens when services are downgraded in the country. People do not have many alternatives and many are being left isolated and forgotten or even have to contemplate moving away. This has already made ghost towns of many communities across Australia.
A report compiled recently by the federal government was presented to the federal government's health committee last week, I understand. It included a submission from the Australian Medical Association and the Rural Doctors Association and has a number of recommendations to improve medical work force recruitment and retention schemes for rural and remote areas.
A section of the submission has recognised the plight of country doctors who have to work unaided 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If they do not have a hospital and medical facilities handy they have no backup at all. There was a recognition of a need for incentives to keep doctors in country regions.
This submission looks at putting a further $250 million and employing an extra 1,000 doctors Australia wide by 2003 towards getting on top of the shortage of rural services. There were also calls for national medical recruitment for rural and remote areas and an urgent evaluation of the health infrastructure. There were some very sensible suggestions in the AMA's paper and the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) should give careful consideration to them. Like all other country services, they cannot be expected to operate in a market situation—there has to be input from government. Doctors are no different. Threats to Medicare are certainly not going to help the situation.
I have been in contact constantly with the research going on in rural health and the means by which medical services can be encouraged in rural and remote areas. I think this submission has some worthwhile recommendations. This government should be pursuing them. With the latest debacle at the Premiers Conference, where there was no ability to negotiate better funding for the states' health, only increases the problems for country health generally.
All this nonsense about the repayment of the black hole debt only shows that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) do not care about ordinary Australians. If we have a surplus of $2.5 billion in 1998-99, why can't some of it be used to help shore up the medical systems of Australia. 
 Why can't it help some of my electors get into elective surgery? Why can't we?
That $250 million suggested in the submission would make a huge difference to people's lives in the country and it would also give young people from the country areas incentives to train and return to their own districts to practice. It would provide a multiplier effect to country areas and help boost rural economies. I will be interested to see the whole report and see what the profession plans for the future. The government should be releasing it publicly so the community can make its own comments. We need to know what commitment there is to rural and regional people. This government keeps telling us how committed they are. Let us see some evidence of this. This report could be a start. It should be tabled.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Country Doctors</title>,Adjournment,16,1
