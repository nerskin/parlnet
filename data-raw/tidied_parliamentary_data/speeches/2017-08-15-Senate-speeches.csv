Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  I'm pleased to finally have the opportunity to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. The Labor Party have been calling for years for this type of legislation to protect vulnerable workers, with no joy at all. Finally we have some action on protecting vulnerable workers, but it certainly does not go far enough. Having said that, it is, I guess, better than nothing, and this bill does go some way towards dealing with the exploitation that occurs across our economy in Australia. We support its passage through the Senate because, as I said, we are better off having something than nothing at all, which is what we have had for a number of years. The government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to act to protect vulnerable workers. 


At the last election Labor had policies to combat sham contracting; to shut down the practices of companies, phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities; to reform the Fair Work Act to protect vulnerable workers; to criminalise employer conduct that involves the use of coercion or threats during the commission of serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act, particularly in relation to temporary overseas workers; and to make it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages from employers and directors of responsible companies. This bill, however, does nothing to address these issues, and that is why I emphasise that this bill does not go far enough to protect vulnerable workers. It also does not protect workers from cuts to penalty rates made by this government. Up to 700,000 Australians will lose up to $77 per week—people who will have to work longer for less, women who will be disproportionately affected by those penalty rate cuts, and regional communities who will have less money spent in their economies. So there is a real need for this bill. 


The issues that I've just raised are of major concern to the opposition—to the Labor Party and to me personally. For some time now senators in this place would have been aware that I've been on an inquiry looking at the introduction of a modern slavery act in Australia. A lot of the evidence that has been brought to our attention during the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's inquiry into modern slavery in Australia has included examples of some of the issues that were covered by Labor's policies at the last election. These included issues to do with coercion and threats by employers, particularly for temporary overseas workers, and issues to do with workers being unable to recover unpaid wages from their employers.


I would like to refer to the submission to the inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act by The Freedom Partnership: End Modern Slavery—that is, the Salvation Army, as well as the Uniting Church of Australia, FECCA and ACRATH. In their very, very detailed submission, they give examples of workers who have not been protected. Indeed, I would like to share with the Senate one example of what modern slavery looks like in Australian supply chains across a range of industries. In fact, this example is about a man called Samuel Kautai. Samuel Kautai was a young man from the Cook Islands, who along with four other men, all around the ages of 17- and 18-years-old—just starting out in their working life—were recruited by an employer's brother in the construction industry and were promised that while they would not get any wages for the first three weeks, after that they would get paid the full amount, and be able to send money back home to their families in the Cook Islands. However, he was never paid more than $50 a month. This is here, in Australia. He was never paid any more than $50 a month. And worse than that, Samuel and some of his co-workers, were physically abused, underfed and endured long working hours without decent breaks. This case was pursued by the CFMEU under industrial mechanisms and by the NSW Police Force under state criminal law. The case was decided both times in favour of the applicant, which, of course, resulted in the employer having to pay back to Samuel Kautai and the other employees what they were duly and rightly owed.


When we talk about protecting vulnerable workers, we are talking about workers across a range of industries from construction to carpentry to welding to the meat industry as well as domestic workers, market garden workers, horticultural—I have so many examples in this submission to our modern slavery inquiry of workers who have simply been ripped off and who have been treated appallingly, all because of their employers obviously doing wrong by them, but also because we don't have legislation that provides those protections that Labor has been asking and urging this government to deliver.


These examples of exploitation make it clear that action is needed. For example, subcontractors' exploitation—who were engaged by Myer employing cleaners on sham contracts under which workers were paid below award wages, denied penalty rates and superannuation, and worked without occupational health and safety protections—needs to end. Of course, we are all very familiar with what occurred with the 7-Eleven stores. They were operating a business model based on methodical, systematic exploitation of vulnerable foreign workers that included the gross underpayment of wages and doctoring of pay records designed to conceal unlawful conduct, and workers subjected to threats of deportation and physical intimidation. This has no place in a civilised society like ours. It has no place in Australia.


Protecting vulnerable workers is laudable, but, unfortunately, this government cannot be trusted when it comes to protecting vulnerable workers. We have concern that this bill gives coercive powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman without external scrutiny and oversight, and that it could be abused to investigate unions and industrial action rather than actually protecting the vulnerable workers that it needs to protect. We believe that this legislation needs to be amended to ensure that these powers can only be used in investigations into the underpayment of wages.


Labor will continue to lead the way in protecting vulnerable workers, be it through legislation or amendments to this bill in this place or be it through our work in support of the introduction of a modern slavery act similar to that in place in the UK, France and the Netherlands. And, of course, Labor will also ask for the Fair Work Ombudsman to have all the powers necessary to pursue employers who exploit workers. The Fair Work Ombudsman must have powers to be able to pursue those employers, whatever the case may be. But the powers, of course, must have proper oversight. That is what we are asking for in relation to this Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill.


As I outlined, this bill does fall significantly short of the suite of policy and legislative reforms that Labor first announced more than 12 months ago, before this Turnbull government even turned its mind to the notion of protecting vulnerable workers, because it's so caught up in its ideological obsession with unions and its lobbying against workers rather than actually standing up for their protection. I'm pleased to have had the chance to speak on this bill. We've been calling for action to protect these workers for a very long time without any joy. But something is better than nothing, and it's pleasing to see what we have before the Senate today. Let's strengthen this bill so that it can really do what it should do: protect vulnerable workers in Australia.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-08-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:41):  The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill—it's not a normal name for a bill that comes out of this government. But the circumstances are worth considering. It got to a point where there was such enormous pressure on the government that they had to do something. But when we look at the detail of the bill we see that something isn't adequate; it doesn't actually solve the problem. And the problem is enormous: extreme exploitation of some of the most vulnerable workers that we have in our society. The fact that the bill has been introduced is significant, but we need to look into the detail, and the Greens will be moving amendments similar to those that my colleague the Greens industrial relations spokesperson, Adam Bandt, moved in the other place.


This bill is before us because of the courage of a few people who really looked into what was going on with the franchisees to understand the conditions that the workers were existing under. It became apparent that they are very tough. For many of them, their lives are on hold because of uncertainty with regard to the wages that they will be paid, and even if they will be paid. A lot of these scandals started with 7-Eleven. We quickly learnt that one person's convenience store is often another person's workplace of extreme exploitation and rip-offs. What we learnt is that 7-Eleven is probably just the tip of the iceberg, because there's Caltex, Domino's and probably many others where the loopholes in the law are now well-known by the legal eagles who are employed. They've worked out how they can become rich very quickly off the back of people who are actually keeping these businesses going.


These scams are extreme. It was found that some people were getting paid and were then being forced to give back part of their wages in so-called cashback scams. It was found that, so the proper payment and proper taxes did not have to be paid, the hours the people were being rostered for did not actually represent the hours they were working. It is a real scam of the books that has been going on for a long time and is now out in the open. We have the opportunity to clean it up, and clean it up properly, but that will only occur if this bill is amended.


What we also need to remember here is that the workforce that we're dealing with is often people with limited English or people who are from overseas and very worried that they may be under threat of being deported, even if they have a secure visa and it's totally legitimate that they live here. There have been many reports of intimidation, threats and insinuations made along the lines of, 'If you speak up, if you try to change things and get your proper pay, you could well be deported.' That's deeply shocking, and it needs to be factored in to how we handle this situation.


In my opening remarks I said that we have this bill before us now largely because of the dedication of a few individuals. One of them is Michael Fraser, who really dug into what was going on here. With the 7-Eleven case, he went from store to store collecting stories, winning the understanding, support and confidence of the people working there so he could document what was really going on—the levels of oppression and exploitation that shouldn't be occurring in workplaces anywhere in Australia. There was also a group of Fairfax journalists who took on this story and reported it in detail—another factor leading to the government being forced to act. We also learned from their studies that it was not just the workers who were getting done over; the people who bought into these franchise operations were, in many instances, also being put in a situation where their income was greatly reduced—it was often quite minimal—because of the way head office operated, and they were under pretty clear directions that a lot of the money had to go back to head office. Again, it's worth looking into the operations here: (1) we need to understand it and (2) it informs us of why this bill is inadequate in its present form.


How do these franchises work? Most of us have had the experience of going into a 7-Eleven. Wherever you go, they all look pretty much the same in terms of the stock that they carry, where the stock is, the signage and all that sort of thing. This is how it operates: the head office dictates how these places are managed, micromanaging to the nth degree. But one aspect of how these small businesses—if we can use that term in this case—operate that isn't consistent is the payment of wages. This is where they seem to have a whole different set of standards. The small business franchisees that run the business carry the legal risk if there is underpayment. It's not the head office; it's not the billionaire who's sitting back, doing pretty well off the back of the hardship of so many of the workers in the industry. We see time and time again that the worker who sits at the bottom is the one who is being ripped off.


This is where we are again reminded of the failure of the bill before us, because it does not offer the protection that the title of the bill suggests. If you believed the title of the bill before us—'protection of vulnerable workers'—you'd think it sounds pretty absolute, but that's not the case. What we need here is shared responsibility, and that is why we need to amend what's before us. The bill does not shift any responsibility back home to the owner—and they're really getting filthy rich off the way this system works. When you read the stories of the people who are making money for the people who own these companies, you see that what's going on is very ugly.


As I said, the bill does not make the head office responsible. Instead, it effectively says, 'You're only responsible if you knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that the franchisee was underpaying the worker.' That's just passing the buck. It's simply unacceptable; it's been exposed and it has to change. That's why we're going to move to amend the bill—to close that loophole and make sure that the head office is responsible. That's the essence of what we're dealing with here. Really, the government should've had a good look at the Greens' bill that Adam Bandt, the MP for Melbourne, worked on. That really brings all these issues together and makes it very clear that we do need that shared responsibility, that you can't let the head office off the hook here.


So we will be moving an amendment that will make it very clear that, if you're a worker in one of these franchises—7-Eleven, Domino's or wherever—and you are underpaid, you can go straight to the head office and claim your underpayment. At the moment, it doesn't work that way. What happens is that the head office can just get out of it. We read that time and time again in those reports and articles about what was happening. They were just passing the buck back to the small business owners that they have further down their chain of command. This really does need to change here, otherwise what the government is doing is a farce. We need it set up so that if the worker wins a court case they can claim it against the head office. This is the key to achieving the protection that the government is stating is in this bill. Then it is up to the head office. They are then the ones who have to have the battle with the franchisees that they have brought in to run their stores. That is where the battle lies. Meanwhile, the workers who have been exploited and underpaid have been able to pick up their correct pay, because they have been able to go direct to the head office. It is a very simple requirement. The government has done a disservice here.


In many ways, it is classic in terms of what you see from Liberal-National parties when they are in government. They will often try to walk both sides of the road, particularly when a problem has been identified where the business world is doing the wrong thing. They will say, 'We'll bring in a correction; we'll fix this up,' but they have left the loopholes in the bill so that big business can still, effectively, get away with so much of the exploitation. Again, let's remind ourselves: it should not be the worker left in limbo trying to work out how they get their money, who owes them money and who can actually pay them. That is what was revealed in so many of the reports that exposed how so many of the companies were working. Whether it is 7-Eleven, Domino's or Caltex, there is a similar pattern. It is ruthless; it must stop. We have the opportunity right now to stop this level of exploitation.


I can't emphasise enough: it should not be up to the individual worker to try and work out who is the person responsible for the underpayment and who will actually pay them the money. We have to get rid of the tricks—and there are tricks in the legislation before us. Our amendment effectively says that the worker can go directly to the head office and get their money back. Then we're leaving it up to the franchisees and the head offices to fight it out and to work out how they are going to undertake their business model. It really does need to change. It really needs to recognise that people have rights and that they can't use some legal scams to get away with what's currently going on.


So, yes, we do need this legislation, but to be effective it does need to be considerably amended. I look forward to the discussion at the committee stage.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-08-15,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (12:52):  I, too, am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. I'm going to make a very boring contribution following the media superstar, Senator Rhiannon, but I'll do my best!


A lot has been said over the last couple of months since this bill was brought on for consideration by this parliament, highlighting a great many examples of abuse of vulnerable workers and business enterprises taking advantage of those who may not be able to stand up for themselves. So I too am willing to commend the government for bringing on this legislation and for putting in place some protections and setting up a regime, or attempting to set up a regime, that will actually do something to provide some protections for workers who, as I say, may not be able to stand up for themselves.


We have seen companies such as 7-Eleven, Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's and Caltex—to name a few household brands—implicated in the allegations made about underpayment of vulnerable workers. Not having as much air time are the widespread ramifications flowing from underpayment of workers. These people have families. They have bills to pay. If they are underpaid, meeting those obligations is very, very difficult. It also has an impact on other businesses that are doing the right thing. Those who are paying the right amount—and, in some cases, more than the award rate—have an increased cost to doing business compared to those who are flouting the law and taking advantage of vulnerable workers. That's why this legislation is so incredibly important. It is why I am going to commend it to the Senate.


The Fair Work Ombudsman in its submission to the Senate inquiry on this legislation gave a great many accounts of the breaches that it had investigated and that were reported to it and the impacts that this has had on individual companies and individual human beings who were caught up in these cases. We heard stories of migrant workers being paid as little as $14.12 or $10 an hour, well below the federal minimum wage, which is something none of us should stand by and condone. That's exactly what we're getting at here—trying to crack down on this sort of behaviour. There were also stories of young people being forced to accept non-cash payments of pizza and soft drink rather than being paid the money that they were entitled to be paid. It's just unconscionable that any business proprietor or senior manager in any business entity would seek to take away from someone what they are entitled to be given in return for the work that they are contributing. So, when you hear of people doing this sort of thing, providing in-kind payment, as they would probably refer to it, in the form of sugary drinks and fast food, rather than the money they need to pay for whatever it is they need to pay for—the power bill, rent and food—it's just not good enough.


The Fair Work Ombudsman's submission to the inquiry looked at what action has been taken by business operators to evade compliance efforts. There were some startling things—for example, phoenixing, where companies liquidate and then set up a new business to avoid any liabilities that have accrued against that business in not paying what employees are due; the failure to keep records or falsifying the records that do exist, making it difficult to verify the hours that have been worked and what workers have been paid for the hours they are supposed to have worked; engaging in the cashback schemes, which I will touch on later; and targeting vulnerable workers who are less aware of their rights and less likely to report problems for a whole range of reasons, such as language barriers, a lack of familiarity around the mechanisms that are available to vulnerable workers and the protections that might be available. There are all sorts of problems. Then, of course, as we've heard before, workers have been threatened with their visa or their job—'If you don't take what I'm giving you, I'm going to send you home and seek that your visa be cancelled, or I'll terminate your employment and you won't have any money.'


I want to quote from a couple of parts of the Fair Work Ombudsman's submission because I think it's important to look at some of the things that it said. This entity works at the coalface. This is the entity that receives the complaints. This is the entity that deals with the allegations and gets to the bottom of what's going on and tries to do the right thing by the people who are purportedly being ripped off. The Fair Work Ombudsman's submission says on page 7, paragraph 17:


In some of these cases, the existing framework has not been sufficient to deter ongoing and systemic conduct across sectors, industries and regions, and usually with respect to these workers. Some unscrupulous employers view non-compliance as a business model and do not fear being caught out for their behaviours, or consider penalties associated with their breaches of the law an acceptable cost of doing business. These employers often do not keep proper records or payslips and are unwilling to engage with the FWO in an investigation.


That gives you an insight into what the Fair Work Ombudsman is dealing with in trying to get to the bottom of these things. The fact that the Fair Work Ombudsman acknowledges in its submission that there are business operators who see this as a way of doing business—a worthwhile risk; something that they are willing to sort of take a chance on in the event that they get caught out and may have to pay a fine—is just unbelievable. How these people can sleep at night, thinking, 'It is worth it in the end,' all the while inflicting some sort of misery on individuals who have been underpaid is certainly not something that is at all Australian. Again, that's why I'm so pleased that we are considering this legislation today.


Moving to paragraph 23, the submission goes on to say:


The package of measures outlined in the Bill together would make a significant difference to FWO's capacity to address this conduct where it occurs. In particular, providing higher penalties that reflect the gravity of serious contraventions of the law and ensuring there are real deterrents against not keeping records or falsifying records for the purpose of disguising underpayments. Ensuring Fair Work inspectors are taken seriously and cannot simply be ignored will make a significant difference when tackling the worst sort of conduct.


The FWO refers to, in the broad, the amendments proposed in this piece of legislation, saying that these will help them do their job—to deal with those dodgy operators who falsify, destroy, don't keep records and who think they can get away with ignoring the FWO when they come knocking, saying: 'Hey, we have examples or complaints against your business suggesting that you're engaging in this sort of conduct. We want you to provide evidence that this is not the case.' I think the fact that they're going to be able to clamp down on that is an excellent thing and something I look forward to seeing the results of as we move forward.


Moving to the conclusion of the Fair Work Ombudsman's submission to the inquiry, paragraph 113, they conclude by saying:


As the FWO has noted, the regulatory framework is fit for purpose in most circumstances but is not sufficient to deal with the most egregious behaviour in matters involving the exploitation of vulnerable workers. The proposed amendments would enhance the FWO’s ability to deal with serious and concerning conduct within the jurisdiction of the FW Act and contribute to efforts across government and within communities to address the drivers of workplace exploitation.


As I say, this is from the people who are at the coalface of dealing with this issue, of dealing with the complaints from vulnerable workers, their family, their friends and other employee-representative organisations who become aware of this stuff. To hear them make those comments about what this bill will do—the people who have to go out and apply it—is encouraging.


Fundamentally, when we do see this abuse of power—be it the employer, a senior manager or someone from any other representative organisation exploiting vulnerable workers—it is incumbent upon us to take action. This legislation does exactly that. Under the amendments contained in the bill, as has been stated in previous contributions, the franchisor will, in certain circumstances, become liable where a franchisee or one of the franchisor's subsidiaries violates specific sections of the act, such as the National Employment Standards, any modern awards, methods and frequency of payments, or record-keeping obligations. Most of those are very straightforward and, I think, speak for themselves.


Much has been made in the debate about the transfer or liability to the franchisor, so it's important to set out exactly what the amendments will establish and in what circumstances they'd be applied. The amendments introduced the notion of serious contraventions to apply deliberate and systematic breaches. They strengthen the liability and responsibility of franchisors for the business conduct in the franchises under their direction. It's important, though, to point out that the breaches targeted through these amendments differ greatly from the genuine mistakes—and they occur. I'm aware of one in Hobart, which attracted a great deal of media attention which was a genuine mistake. It was a business that had engaged the services of a third party to do its bookkeeping, a reputable firm. Clearly, this reputable firm and the individual they sent along to do this business's books didn't know what they were doing. As a result, the staff were underpaid a significant amount and this business was dealt with under the law. As with many of these cases, a significant amount of public attention was given to this business, somewhat unfairly. All the same, it will be nice to see these genuine mistakes, if they can be properly demonstrated, taken out of the basket that some of these more dodgy operators should be kept in and dealt with. In doing that, there is the three-stage test, to determine whether or not this is a genuine mistake, that must be satisfied before the franchisor can be held responsible. That test is as follows: 


… the franchisor:


had significant control or influence over the franchisee,


knew or should have known about the underpayments, or


failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the violations.


Those three steps do establish a bit of a mental intent test, for want of a better expression, to ensure that the entity against whom the complaint is being made was seeking to actually do what has been done and that is the subject of the complaint.


The bill also seeks to define a 'serious contravention' as one that is intentional and is part of a systematic pattern relating to one or more individuals. Again it points to it being something that's planned or deliberate and is happening to a number of employees, rather than just one out of 30 or 10. Further, the bill notes elements that the court may give regard to when assessing whether a systematic pattern exists. So there are going to be strict tests under the law that the courts will adhere to when assessing these things.


A 'responsible franchisor' is one who has a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee entity's affairs. The bill aims to ensure that franchisees and franchisors are held responsible for a series of contraventions, including underpayments and sham contracting, which we've heard a lot about in the debate over the last day or two. The bill also extends accessorial liability to franchisors where they knew or should have known that contraventions were occurring in one of their franchises. This liability means that an individual or company involved in the breach would also be potentially responsible in situations where they were not directly participating in the breach itself. So the amendments will apply to both franchisors and master franchisors if they exercise a significant level of influence or control over the franchisee's activities. The amendments do provide exemptions for franchisors in circumstances where they can demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to prevent contraventions and there were no reasonable steps they could have taken to prevent such a contravention from taking place.


Other provisions include increasing penalties tenfold for serious contraventions of specific parts of the act and for failure to maintain proper records. Individuals who engage in serious contraventions face a maximum penalty of 600 penalty units, which is $108,000, and companies could face a penalty of $540,000. That is, as stated, a tenfold increase on the current penalties and represents the government's resolve to deter these sorts of practices. I think it's important to note that, in the submissions to the inquiry, a number of entities said that the penalties didn't go far enough and others said that they went too far. To my mind, when you see those sorts of comments being made, it often means that you've got the balance right. Certain entities with certain interests believe that we're going a bit hard and others would like to see us go harder.


Further amendments outlaw the cashback and other coercive behaviour by employers where employees may be paid correctly but then forced by their employer to repay part of their wages. I heard Senator Williams explaining yesterday this disgraceful conduct. In some cases it has been suggested that the employer marches the employee down to the ATM and asks them to hand back a portion of what they've been paid. To see employers trying to make it look like they're doing the right thing on paper—'We've paid them X amount this week'—and then forcing their employee to give back a certain amount, because they were threatening them with having their visa removed or terminating their employment, is just disgraceful.


The EM for the bill specifically references the inquiry into the 7-Eleven scandal, which we've all heard and read so much about, and their involvement in cashback practices. It's important to note through this scrutiny and in debating this legislation that it was just some franchisees who did this and that others did pay their employees the lawful rate. Again, in the same case that had received so much public attention, the franchisee then deliberately falsified records to disguise underpayments. This practice, which clearly demonstrates that these businesses were seeking to deliberately rip off employees and hide it from the public and from the regulator, is exactly what we should be looking for and catching out. The amendments hold franchisors and companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. The bill also builds on steps already taken by the government to protect vulnerable workers and broadens the circumstances in which franchisors can be held responsible for employment law breaches by their franchisees.


I will now touch on some of the contributions made by some of my colleagues yesterday in the debate. It's always good to listen to Senator Helen Polley and the contributions she makes in these debates. And I'm disappointed that I haven't yet heard Senator Bilyk's contributions, but I look forward to listening to that afterwards. Senator Polley referenced earlier on, consistent with some submitters to the inquiry, that the bill didn't go far enough. I make the point that there were some submitters who said it went too far, again pointing to the fact that the balance in this bill is right. And, when you take that into account with the amendments that have been proposed in the majority report on the inquiry into this bill, I think that the bill is exactly what we should be passing.


I have been amused at the reference to cuts to penalty rates and how that somehow gets intertwined into the substance of this bill. I accept it's an issue that there has been a great deal of public debate on. I don't think that I need to point out, for those who have listened to the debates on that issue, the rewriting of history from the opposition with regard to that. But it's very convenient. And, when they can conflate that into this attack on workers, then—




Senator Bilyk:
  You were doing so well up until then!




Senator DUNIAM:
  All points to the opposition for trying, but, when it isn't material to the substance of this bill, I do have to question why it does get raised. But I do understand that there is a pitch out there in the community to try to paint Australia as the most unequal society in the world and that it's all because of this government. I guess that all fits into the arguments, the dog whistles and the catch cries of the opposition in trying to defeat this sort of legislation.


In conclusion, in the words of the Fair Work Commission, 'No one single measure will fix this oversight,' but the package of measures in this bill will go some way to combatting some of the most serious worker exploitation in this country. In commending the bill to the Senate, I want to also pay tribute to the work of my colleague Senator Bridget McKenzie, as the chair of the legislation committee that inquired into this bill, and the proposals that her committee report made. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (13:12):  I'm pleased that I was given some time today to talk on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. It's good that, having seen levels of abuse of workers' rights that not even this government could ignore, we are finally presented with the bill. Over the last couple of years, just some of the high-profile cases of exploitation of workers we've heard about include 7-Eleven shop assistants, Myer cleaners and Pizza Hut delivery drivers. But what we need to remember is that not all cases have been high profile. There has been consistent evidence of the exploitation of workers taking place over quite some time.


It is utterly despicable that in 2017 we're still hearing of exploitation of workers on such a large scale. Labor senators welcome the provisions of the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, which will reduce the exploitation of some vulnerable workers in Australia. However, Labor senators consider that in some aspects the bill as currently drafted falls well short of addressing the range of ways workers are exploited. It falls significantly short on the suite of legislative measures required to properly address the breadth of worker exploitation.


For those who said that the bill has gone too far, I would suggest that they possibly don't like accountability, because the bill does nothing in relation to sham contracting, phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities or reforms to the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers, and it does nothing to make it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages. As such, Labor senators believe that a number of amendments are required in order to provide a more comprehensive solution to the very deliberate and systematic exploitation of workers in Australian workplaces. It could be a better bill, and if the Senate accepts our amendments, it will be, but I do acknowledge that it is a start.


I shouldn't have to say it, especially here in the Australian Senate, but throughout the country employees shouldn't be ripped off by their employer, ever—full stop. Employees should be fairly paid in line with their agreements and the law. Employers shouldn't deliberately rob their workers to boost their own profits. We should be a better nation than that. However, we've seen in the last couple of years gross, systemic and wilful exploitation of workers, in particular, by some very large national franchises. This is completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable to the employees and to the employers who are placed at a competitive disadvantage by doing the right thing and paying award wages or over award wages, and who aren't exploiting their workers. It's unacceptable to the union movement and it's unacceptable to our sense as a nation of the fair go.


The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 amends the Fair Work Act to increase penalties for serious contraventions defined as conduct which is:


(a) deliberate; and


(b) part of a systematic pattern of conduct relating to one or more other persons—


of prescribed workplace laws. Also:


Increasing penalties for record-keeping failures.


Making franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments by their franchisees or subsidiaries where they knew or ought reasonably to have known of the contraventions and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. The new responsibilities will only apply where franchisors and holding companies have a significant degree of influence or control over their business networks.


And the franchisor or holding company may raise a defence of taking reasonable steps to prevent a contravention, and:


Expressly prohibiting employers from unreasonably requiring their employees to make payments (e.g. demanding a proportion of their wages be paid back in cash)—


giving the Fair Work Ombudsman and employees at SES level the power to compulsorily question persons as part of an investigation in to the breaches of the Fair Work Act where failure to answer questions gives rise to a civil liability.


As I said, those measures are a start, but they don't go far enough. But there's a policy that does properly protect workers' rights. Labor's rights at work policy released at the start of 2016 committed a Labor government to put in place a suite of reforms to protect rights at work by cracking down on unscrupulous employers who are willing to exploit employees.


Labor's Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 is a far more comprehensive suite of measures to protect vulnerable workers. As an example, our bill contains amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009, which make it clear that the Fair Work Act applies to all employees, irrespective of their immigration status; require the Fair Work Ombudsman to publish information for employees about the relationship between workplace and immigration laws and the right of overseas workers to seek redress for contraventions of workplace laws; provide additional protection from adverse action taken against an employee who questions whether a workplace right exists or whether they're an employee and not an independent contractor; introduce a reasonable person test in determining whether an employer has engaged in sham contracting; give the court the power to make orders requiring directors of phoenix companies to pay unpaid wages and other employee entitlements when a company of which they're a director is phoenixed; increase threefold the maximum penalty for employers, other than small businesses, who deliberately and systematically deny workers the wages they are due; give the courts the power to disqualify directors involved in companies that are found to have deliberately engaged in serious contraventions of workplace relations laws; and introduce new criminal offences for conduct that involves the use of coercion or threat within the meaning of slavery or slavery conditions of the Criminal Code where employers commit serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act in relation to temporary overseas workers.


Labor's bill is significantly better than the one presented today. I would like to take a moment to talk about the importance of ensuring that franchisors ensure franchisees are in compliance with the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Ombudsman in the report into 7-Eleven found:


It is our opinion that 7-Eleven had a reasonable basis on which to inquire and to act. To the extent that 7-Eleven contends that issues were limited to the few rather than the many, the Fair Work Ombudsman provided evidence of widespread compliance risks across the network in October 2014 at the commencement of the inquiry and again in May 2015 when presented with the preliminary findings of the 20 stores audited in September 2014.


So, in other words, 7-Eleven knew of the behaviour that had been going on across its franchisees for many years, yet they did nothing to protect the workers. This is utterly shameful. In addition, the Fair Work Ombudsman's 7-Eleven report said:


While 7-Eleven is not legally responsible for entitlements payable to employees of franchisees, it has a moral and ethical responsibility for what has occurred within its network and is capable of preventing it occurring again.


On this same issue, Labor senators, in their additional comments to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's report into this bill, noted:


… the concerns raised by submitters such as WEstjustice that the bill as currently drafted does not make it clear that responsible franchisor entities and holding companies will be liable for the breaches of the franchisee entity or subsidiary.


Labor senators also consider that the bill does not go far enough in its amendments to expand accessorial liability. As the Franchise Council of Australia argued:


No evidence provided makes the case for singling out franchising when Fair Work compliance concerns are an economy-wide issue.


Labor senators contend that this evidence supports the need for liability to be extended so that franchisors cannot avoid responsibility by merely rearranging their affairs. Employers shouldn't be able to wash their hands by shifting employees to labour hire firms. This is one of the reasons that the bill, as originally drafted, doesn't go far enough.


However, just protecting workers from exploitation is not enough. We also have to work to protect their take-home pay. Of course, we all know that penalty rates are of vital importance to low-paid workers, and on this the government has failed those workers again. I often wonder if those on the other side of the chamber have ever had to rely on penalty rates—not just getting them from working a part-time job while living with mum and dad and all the comforts of home but actually relying on them. We're not just talking about students and young people; we're talking about 700,000 people: mothers and fathers, carers, primary bread winners for families. If those opposite really understood, they would side with our lowest paid workers and make their lives a little easier. But those opposite are not the ones negatively impacted by penalty rate cuts.


Labor does not accept the failed, flawed, sterile view of this country that says you reward those at the very top and hope that something trickles down to everyone else. It's clear to see that this government's priorities are utterly wrong. The last thing Australia needs is a cut to household budgets, which are already stretched to the last dollar. When corporate profits are at record highs and wages growth is at a record low, it is not the time to give multinationals a tax cut and workers a pay cut. Australians facing a cut to their penalty rates just want someone to fight for them. Well, guess what? That's exactly what Labor is doing.


Those opposite say we should just accept the decision of the umpire. We respect the Fair Work Commission—absolutely we do—but they've made the wrong decision in cutting Sunday penalty rates, and we will not stand idly by while Australia's lowest paid workers pay the price. A new Labor government will reverse this penalty rate cut and protect vulnerable workers from exploitation. I call upon the government and the crossbench to work with Labor, pass our amendments and leave this place with a significantly better bill. Our lowest paid and most vulnerable workers need legal protection from unscrupulous operators who are getting away with exploitation and theft. We should be making laws that protect the most vulnerable, not allowing these injustices to continue.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-08-15,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:24):  I rise to oppose a bill with a dishonest name. It's the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. It doesn't promote fair work and it doesn't protect vulnerable workers. Like other industrial relations legislation, it destroys jobs and the lives of people who could fill those jobs. The bill raises penalties for paying a consenting adult $18 an hour, because the ban on low-skilled work, euphemistically called the minimum wage, is set at $18.29. This kills jobs, particularly for those unemployed Australians who are young, mature—or mature-ish, like me—disabled, have poor English or are fresh out of jail. Supporters of the minimum wage, to my left and right, are crushing the hopes of the most disadvantaged Australians. It is immoral.


The bill before us today also hits franchisors with $100,000 fines when someone else, a franchisee, does not comply with the fair work law, even though the franchisor does not know about, help or encourage the noncompliance. This is unjust. It's like a wrathful God incensed by the sins of the father and visiting them upon the son. It will also stop the franchise business model in its tracks. Australia will be forced back into the 1970s where, instead of a franchise restaurant or cafe, we ate at a local greasy spoon and, instead of ducking into an IGA to pick up some groceries, we would be lucky if we picked up a wilted lettuce at a dusty corner store. Businesses will become more and more reluctant to offer budding entrepreneurs a franchise, which is an easy way for them to start their own business. Instead, thousands of budding entrepreneurs will have to continue to work for the man, rather than become their own boss.


I will be moving amendments to soften the edges of this bill's attack on the franchise model. The Franchise Council of Australia, and many others, advised the Senate committee reviewing this bill that only those franchisors who influence their franchisees' employment arrangements should be held responsible for a franchisee's noncompliance with employment law. The Senate committee recommended consideration of an amendment along these lines. I will move such an amendment, to be co-sponsored by Senator Bernardi. My amendment will add a condition to the definition of 'responsible franchisor entity' so that not only does the franchisor need to have a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee's affairs but also the influence or control must relate to the franchisee's compliance with workplace laws. It won't be sufficient if a franchisor only has influence over the size of the pickle in a franchisee's Big Mac.


My amendment will also make a corresponding change to the related civil remedy provisions. Currently, these provisions establish a contravention if the responsible franchisor entity knew, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that its franchisee would fail to comply with workplace laws. They also establish a contravention if a body corporate knew, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that its subsidiary would fail to comply with workplace laws. With my amendment, the contraventions would arise only if the franchisor or body corporate would know these things, or ought to know these things, in the ordinary course of business. So, if a franchisor hears from a loudmouth taxi driver that his barber said that he heard from his next door neighbour that the franchisee is paying below the minimum wage, the franchisor won't have broken the law simply because of these Chinese whispers.


This is a bill of the Liberal-National government and it is furiously supported by Labor and the Greens. These major parties pretend that fairness can be achieved by making a declaration in legislation rather than through voluntary deals struck between established businesses, budding entrepreneurs and workers. The Liberal Democrats stand against this madness. Just like the emperor has no clothes, the fair work system actually isn't fair.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (13:29):  The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 is a lame attempt by this government to deal with a real crisis that we're facing in this country, and that is the crisis of wage theft that is rampant across our economy and rampant across a wide variety of industries and is, as a result, seeing the gross exploitation of far too many working people in this country. The bill is a very belated effort by this government to deal with the unbelievable exploitation of workers that we witnessed occurring at the 7-Eleven chain of stores a number of years ago. It's been years since this exploitation was revealed by media outlets, and, for years, the Labor Party, trade unions and many others in our community have been calling this government for action. Now, finally, we see the government coming forward with legislation, which, to some extent, deals with these issues but doesn't go anywhere near far enough.


I'm very proud of the fact that the workers who were exploited by 7-Eleven were represented by my former law firm, Maurice Blackburn Lawyers. I pay tribute to the efforts of Giri Sivaraman and his team at Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, who took on these cases on a pro bono basis and, as a result of the legal action taken on behalf of these workers, have managed to extract, literally, millions of dollars in underpayments to workers, many of whom came to Australia on temporary visas. That work has gone some way to rectify the massive losses that these exploited workers suffered.


In the interest of time, I will give a couple of quick examples of the kinds of conditions that people working at 7-Eleven were experiencing. The first claimant commenced working at 7-Eleven on a bridging visa B. They worked at three different 7-Eleven stores between 2011 and 2014. In total, this claimant was underpaid over $180,000, including interest. At one store, the claimant was required to work many weeks unpaid, which the franchisee characterised as training. At each store, he was paid below the award rate. He was paid somewhere between $10 and $12 per hour, well below the award rate. He was not paid overtime, was not paid penalty rates, was not paid for all the hours worked and wasn't provided with rest or meal breaks. For some time, the claimant worked 60 or 70 hours a week between all three stores. At one point in time, he worked 110 hours in a week. The claimant received deliberately falsified pay slips that halved the hours he actually worked. He was robbed twice in one day by a man with a serrated knife, and he was forced by the franchisee to work the next day. So he was robbed by an armed robber twice in one day and then his franchisee at 7-Eleven turned around and robbed him again by underpaying him.


The second claimant that I'll mention worked at two different 7-Eleven stores between 2005 and 2006. This claimant was underpaid by nearly $100,000, including interest. At one store, he was required to complete 32 hours of unpaid alleged training. Money was deducted from his pay if customers drove off without paying for fuel. Can you imagine the cruelty of an employer who would actually do that to someone! Not only would the employer underpay them and not pay them for alleged training but, if their customers drove off without paying for fuel, they would also take that out of the worker's pay packet. At each store, this person was paid below the award rate, not paid over time, not paid penalty rates, not paid for all hours worked and not provided with rest or meal breaks. At one store he worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for over six months. That's not to mention the fact that this particular claimant's wife was extremely ill with stage 4 cancer.


These are the kinds of stories that emerged as a result of media coverage of the disgraceful behaviour of 7-Eleven and the complete lack of responsibility taken by their senior management, the franchisors, in the behaviour of their franchisees. The thing I remember most from talking to my former colleagues at Maurice Blackburn who were working on the case was that, no matter how bad you thought the behaviour of 7-Eleven was—and it was absolutely abominable behaviour—in many instances, for those people they were acting for who were working at 7-Eleven, that was their second, better paid job, because they were working elsewhere getting even more exploited than they were at 7-Eleven. That gives you some idea of the scale of wage theft and exploitation that is happening in this country. But it's not just 7-Eleven where this is happening. We've seen many other exposes through the great work of people like Adele Ferguson and her team at Fairfax Media, exposing the behaviour of Caltex, BP, Pizza Hut and Domino's.


Some of the worst instances we've seen have been in the meat-processing industry, particularly a company called Baiada and the way that they have been treating their workers in North Queensland. This is not an issue that is restricted to one particular company or one particular business model being franchised; this is something happening right across our economy and right across every kind of employment relationship that we see. I have seen it myself, both on the Gold Coast and in Central Queensland, those being the two major parts of Queensland that I represent, and it's really got to stop.


The fact that this is happening beyond one business tells you that this is actually a business model that is being adopted by a large number of companies right around this country, and the only way they are staying in business and the only way they are delivering profits to their owners is by ripping off highly vulnerable workers. As I said, this bill is the government's alleged attempt to respond to this problem.


Now, I do welcome the changes that the government is making in this bill, but they go nowhere near enough to deal with the scale and breadth of problems that we are seeing happen in our economy through exploitation of vulnerable workers. This bill doesn't address the problems that we are seeing around sham contracting, where many workers, who any objective test of whether they are an employee or not would say that they are an employee and therefore entitled to the rights that come with employment—leave, superannuation and all sorts of other rights that come with being an employee—but instead these people are being treated as contractors and denied rights. The bill does nothing about that.


This bill does nothing about phoenixing, which we're seeing not only in the construction industry but in security, in cleaning and in a whole range of industries. This is where people are employed by one firm and underpaid—or not paid at all in some cases. Then the business is shut down overnight and the assets moved to another company, which starts operating the next day under a different guise, and the people who have worked there and have gone unpaid end up losing out.


This bill does nothing about the problems that we're seeing around exploitation of people through labour hire. Obviously, that is something I have spoken about on a number of occasions in the chamber, particularly in relation to the problems that we have seen in Central Queensland in the mining industry. People are being sacked from permanent employment and the very same day mining companies are bringing people on through labour-hire arrangements, paying them less pay and giving them worse conditions. This bill does nothing about that. It does nothing to stop the incredible growth in casualisation that we're seeing right throughout the economy as well, where people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent work. And of course this bill does nothing whatsoever to reverse the recent decision of the Fair Work Commission to cut people's penalty rates, which will have a dreadful effect not only on working people's budgets but on the economy overall.


Labor is going to step up to the challenge and is going to put forward some amendments in this debate that do try to deal with some of these other problems that we're seeing in the economy. We're going to put forward amendments which prohibit unreasonable demands for money by employers to prospective employees. This bill does go some way to stopping employers from demanding money be paid to them by current employees, with the threat hanging over them that if they don't pay that money they could be deported, lose their visa or lose their job. But this does nothing to stop employers from making the same kinds of threats and demanding money from prospective employees. Recently, we saw instances where a Domino's franchisee demanded around $150,000, I think it was, from someone in order to get a job. If they didn't pay that money, they weren't going to get the job and they were being threatened with immigration reprisals. One of the amendments that Labor is also going to put forward for this bill is to extend the liability of franchisors to labour-hire and supply chains.


This bill does do some good things in making franchisors liable, in some instances, for the actions of their franchisees. If their franchisees are underpaying their workers then, in some instances, franchisors will be held responsible. But we know very well—and every week new cases surface, whether they be in Central Queensland, the Gold Coast or other parts of Australia—that host companies are engaging dodgy labour-hire firms to bring people in on below-award illegal rates of pay and are getting away with it, because the workers who are brought in by these labour-hire firms are too scared to complain because they are in fear of losing their jobs. Currently, there is nothing in Australian law that stops a labour-hire company from doing that unless those laws are enforced. And currently there is no obligation whatsoever on a host employer to make sure that a labour-hire firm that they engage is doing the right thing and paying people the appropriate wages and conditions.


Big employers should not be allowed to get away with using labour-hire firms to underpay their workers. If a big firm—whether it be a mining company, a retail chain or whoever—engages a labour hire firm which then goes on to pay someone below the legal rates and conditions, then the host employer, the person who has engaged the labour hire firm, should be held responsible. The bill does nothing about that. It is time we took steps to correct firms who are doing the wrong thing. I'm very pleased that Labor will be moving amendments to that effect, and I look forward to joining the debate when we get to those amendments.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (13:40):  I rise to make a contribution in respect of the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. As previous Labor senators in this debate have indicated, whilst we are glad that the government has taken some tentative steps to address the issue, in the face of the egregious examples of abuse by certain franchise companies these steps are woefully inadequate. We have seen very many examples of this, and I will talk a bit about that as well.


This bill has been a long time coming. It does do a few things worthy of note. Among other things, it introduces a new civil remedy offence of 'unreasonably requiring an employee to spend or pay an amount of their money in relation to the performance of work'. The Senate committee inquiry in relation to the bill revealed stakeholder concerns that this new offence will not cover unreasonable demands made by employers to prospective employees as a condition of employment. This is of serious concern. This is a serious deficiency in the bill.


Additionally, as highlighted in the submission by Morris Blackburn—a firm that has a lot of experience representing workers, often on a pro bono basis—these proposed changes to the liabilities of franchisors do not go far enough. If we're talking about improving accountability and making sure workers are paid what they are owed, then these changes need to be stronger. The liability imposed by the proposed section 558B attaches only to a franchisor who is a responsible franchisor entity. The bill defines this as a franchisor that has 'a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee entity's affairs'. In short, I believe this change will merely encourage franchisors to operate at arm's length from franchisees to ensure that liability does not apply under section 558B. This change would have the effect of merely allowing franchisors to distance themselves from the alleged underpayment but would do nothing to stop the underpayment from occurring.


Secondly, there are additional protections for franchisors if they take what's referred to as 'reasonable steps to prevent a contravention'. The prevention test describes it as 'the franchisor need only take pre-emptive action in advance of a contravention and will not be in breach of the provision if they fail to address the contravention once it has occurred or is occurring'. This is an obvious flaw as, after becoming aware of the contravention, a franchisor can in essence do nothing and escape liability if it otherwise meets the prevention test in section 558B. It's concerning that meeting this prevention test could be as simple as a franchisor advising a franchisee of their obligation through a simple 'tick and flick' checklist.


Given these weaknesses in the bill, it is my view that more scrutiny is warranted. And this is where we look at the egregious examples of abuse that came out in the 7-Eleven underpayment scandal. This profit-splitting arrangement, in which a franchisor took 57 per cent of profits made by franchisees and imposed a significant number of business expenses on the franchisees, actually incentivised franchisees' noncompliance with the act as a way of recovering profits they had surrendered to the franchisor.


I was listening to Senator Williams's contribution in relation to this matter yesterday. Senator Williams advocated a review of the franchising arrangements. My personal view is that that is something which could be accommodated. There are some questions to be asked in relation to the franchising model and protecting franchisees and, in turn, protecting the rights of workers employed by the franchisees. The courts are needed here to examine if the business model of the franchisor has substantially contributed to franchisees breaking workplace law. Sadly, even when we have worker exploitation occurring on an industrial scale, this government has remained absent. We only need to look at 7-Eleven's dastardly attempts to minimise what's owed to employees, who have clearly been overworked and underpaid, yet this government has done nothing but produce weak legislation that will only have a slight impact in stopping this situation from occurring again.


Victims of this scandal are still being short-changed. Prakash Kumar, who was underpaid hundreds of thousands of dollars at a number of 7-Elevens, was offered a payout under the new scheme that is $100,000 less than the amount he originally claimed for. Another former 7-Eleven worker Raj Desia was made an offer by the panel of $60,986 which was $16,000 less than the amount he was owed. As recently as 25 July, a 7-Eleven owner in Brisbane was personally fined $28,000 and his company fined $140,000 by the Federal Circuit Court after he was found to have underpaid eight staff and falsified records to cover their tracks. This is an absolutely disgraceful situation. Australians expect that our industrial relations system is going to protect vulnerable workers. When we have people coming into the country who are particularly vulnerable on visas, who are studying and who rely on their jobs in order to remain in the country, they particularly need to be protected. In the face of these egregious examples, we have a government which is not taking reasonable steps to address the issues. If the government was to get serious about assessing whether the franchisor has taken reasonable steps to ensure that exploitation doesn't occur, the bill should also require consideration of the vulnerability of workers to exploitation, such as young workers or workers on visas. 


Submissions to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's inquiry into the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 identified the behaviour allegedly engaged in by a Domino's franchise where sponsorship for a working visa and a job was offered on the condition of payment of $150,000, as an example. While it would appear that particular pre-employment requirement for an up-front payment linked to the provision of a visa may be prohibited by other legislation, other unreasonable pre-employment requirements are not. Stakeholders from business and unions made submissions to the Senate committee inquiry, raising concerns about the lack of oversight in the bill for the proposed new Fair Work Ombudsman compulsory questioning powers. Whilst Labor supports giving the FWO the powers necessary to prevent, uncover and prosecute the exploitation and underpayment of vulnerable workers, we are also concerned that these powers are exercised appropriately. We really need to address this particular issue. Unfortunately, this legislation doesn't go far enough, and there are a number of amendments that Labor has in mind here. These will certainly improve the effectiveness of the bill. 


I have been participating in the Education and Employment References Committee's inquiry into corporate avoidance of the Fair Work Act. I have heard numerous witnesses indicating to me that wage theft is now on the rise and is at historic levels in this country. It is quite clear to me that the Fair Work legislation is not working fairly for ordinary workers, particularly not for vulnerable workers. We need to have a thorough look at this issue. Unfortunately, the legislation we have before us at the moment is not going anywhere near addressing some of these issues. Senator Watt has touched on some of these issues. Other issues that should be looked at that require urgent attention are things like stopping sham contracting. I fully support any attempt to address that but, unfortunately, this bill doesn't go anywhere near that. Another issue is providing proper licensing for labour hire companies. Even the Franchise Council has indicated that the issues that came out, for example, in the 7-Eleven scandal, apply across the whole of the workforce, and the labour hire industry is also needing a bit of a shake-up. I note that the Queensland government has taken steps to introduce licensing arrangements here for labour hire companies, and we did start to look at this in relation to the backpacker tax at a federal level. There is also shutting down the practice of companies phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities; properly reforming the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers; criminalising employer conduct that involves the use of coercion or threats during the commission of serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act in relation to temporary overseas workers; and making it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages from employers and directors of responsible companies.


Having said that, I won't use all the time available to me, in the interests of trying to get on with the job of getting this bill done in a proper way. But, as I say, a number of these exploitation issues go across the economy. We support this bill with amendments. Quite frankly, the bill is better than nothing, and on that basis I commend it to the chamber.

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (13:50):  I'm pleased to talk about the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 today to highlight a group of vulnerable workers in Australia who are paid less than the minimum wage and aren't covered by the Fair Work Act. They don't have federal occupational health and safety protections or workers compensation and they can't take annual leave, sick leave or carers leave. They don't get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. More than 33,000 workers, because that's what they are, come under the Community Development Program. Of the 33,000, 31,000, or 94 per cent, are Indigenous, mainly living in regional and remote Australia. Because of where they live, and because they are mainly Aboriginal, these workers are out of sight and out of mind for the majority of Australians. This policy forces the overwhelmingly Indigenous population of remote communities into labour with none of the benefits of employment enjoyed by every other Australian worker.


The union movement is deeply committed to ending this discriminatory CDP policy. Kara Keys from the ACTU described it by saying:


This is a program which discriminates on the basis of race, and has no place in a modern society.


The ACTU looks forward to a future in which all Australian workers are treated equally, Indigenous people are not treated as second-class workers and are given the same opportunities and rights at work that any Australian worker rightfully expects.


The First Nations Workers Alliance has been launched to give a voice to this group of workers, a group who often don't have a voice, let alone a national presence. I will say a bit about CDP. Participants undertake activities, including hygiene classes, T-shirt dyeing and art making. Some participants have described this aspect of CDP as taking part in adult child care. There is very little of community development in the approach. Participants can also spend up to six months in a workplace, which the government describes as a long-term work experience opportunity. Basically, though, it's a pool of free labour for employers to access in remote areas, and those employers have none of the responsibilities that we would normally expect to their employees. The First Nations Workers Alliance is campaigning for wage justice, an issue that is at the heart of the labour movement. I congratulate the ACTU and the union movement across the board for their support of the First Nations Workers Alliance.


On the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, Labor stands with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to recommit to delivering a greater say on issues that affect their lives. It is a day that we celebrated only recently. We've made it clear we support enshrining an Indigenous voice in our Constitution, because for too long First Australians have been excluded from the nation's birth certificate. Labor is committed to advancing the recommendations from the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the Referendum Council's report. Labor has clearly outlined a bipartisan parliamentary process to make this recognition a reality. We are committed to deliver practical, community-driven measures to help close the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in every part of our national life, from education and employment to justice, housing and health. That's why we worked to set up the current Senate committee that is looking into the CDP.


I take this opportunity to thank all those organisations and individuals who've made submissions and will give evidence in the coming weeks to this inquiry. I'd like to share some of what people have already submitted. Mr Dereck Harris is chair of the Ngaanyatjarra Council, which delivers services to remote communities in WA just across the NT border. He makes it clear what happened when CDP replaced the old community development employment program: 'We feel the government stole our self-respect when CDP was taken away, and we will sink lower if we're forced to go on the healthy welfare card.'


People worked for CDEP because they got paid money, but under CDP they come in because they don't want their pay to get stopped. It is a punitive system that is clearly discriminatory, does nothing to foster job development and employment, exploits workers and fails to develop and empower remote communities socially or economically. This legislation is better than nothing, but being better than nothing does not make it as good as it could have been. It offers limited protections to vulnerable workers but, I suspect, nothing at all to our most vulnerable workers: those on CDP living in remote areas.

 (Queensland) (13:56):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise through the Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party on behalf of the people of Queensland to support the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, protecting unpaid workers and other vulnerable workers. My focus is on two aspects. I will start with the problems this bill addresses, and there are four main problems.


First, we have seen reports of the deliberate and widespread underpayment of workers. These have been too common in Australia. Allegations of underpayment have been raised in relation to major corporations 7-Eleven, Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's, Subway, Caltex, Domino's and Pizza Hut and their franchises. Second, this conduct by certain businesses is enabled by inadequate penalties and ineffective laws which fail to deter law-breaking and make worker exploitation difficult for the regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman, to prove. The ALP was responsible for creating the Fair Work Act. Third, underpayment of workers is unfair for workers but also for competing small businesses who do the right thing and face higher costs because they are complying with the law. Fourth, when someone abuses their power, whether it be union bosses intimidating small businesses or dodgy employers exploiting vulnerable workers, the government must and should take action.


So the solutions in this bill as we see them are targeting serious contraventions and making franchisors and holding companies accountable. The bill as we understand it will, firstly, amend the Fair Work Act to increase penalties by 10 times for serious contraventions of payment related protections in the Fair Work Act. This will apply when contraventions are systemic and deliberate. The bill will raise penalties for record-keeping requirements to make them consistent with penalties for underpayment of workers.


Secondly, it will outlaw cashback and other coercive behaviour by employers where employees may be paid correctly but then forced by their employer to repay part of their wages.


Thirdly, it will hold franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. We have also checked to make sure that, with regard to the varying franchisee/franchisor relationships, people who are not responsible won't be made accountable. This will hold accountable only those who are indeed responsible for payments.


Fourthly, it will strengthen investigation of underpayments by giving the Fair Work Ombudsman effective evidence-gathering powers and outlawing the provision of false and misleading information and the hindering and obstruction of inspectors who carry out investigations into compliance with the Fair Work Act.


It's quite clear, from the experience that many Australians have had and from the media reports, that these are urgently needed and necessary plugs in holes in Labor's Fair Work Act. While these are welcome, sadly, it only looks at one side of what makes workers vulnerable: underpayment. And I want to speak on behalf of vulnerable workers, because, including workers—

The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! Senator Roberts, that's probably a good time at which to interrupt the debate. It's now 2pm; we now move to questions without notice.

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (12:31):  I'm pleased to finally have the opportunity to speak on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. The Labor Party have been calling for years for this type of legislation to protect vulnerable workers, with no joy at all. Finally we have some action on protecting vulnerable workers, but it certainly does not go far enough. Having said that, it is, I guess, better than nothing, and this bill does go some way towards dealing with the exploitation that occurs across our economy in Australia. We support its passage through the Senate because, as I said, we are better off having something than nothing at all, which is what we have had for a number of years. The government has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to act to protect vulnerable workers. 


At the last election Labor had policies to combat sham contracting; to shut down the practices of companies, phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities; to reform the Fair Work Act to protect vulnerable workers; to criminalise employer conduct that involves the use of coercion or threats during the commission of serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act, particularly in relation to temporary overseas workers; and to make it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages from employers and directors of responsible companies. This bill, however, does nothing to address these issues, and that is why I emphasise that this bill does not go far enough to protect vulnerable workers. It also does not protect workers from cuts to penalty rates made by this government. Up to 700,000 Australians will lose up to $77 per week—people who will have to work longer for less, women who will be disproportionately affected by those penalty rate cuts, and regional communities who will have less money spent in their economies. So there is a real need for this bill. 


The issues that I've just raised are of major concern to the opposition—to the Labor Party and to me personally. For some time now senators in this place would have been aware that I've been on an inquiry looking at the introduction of a modern slavery act in Australia. A lot of the evidence that has been brought to our attention during the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade's inquiry into modern slavery in Australia has included examples of some of the issues that were covered by Labor's policies at the last election. These included issues to do with coercion and threats by employers, particularly for temporary overseas workers, and issues to do with workers being unable to recover unpaid wages from their employers.


I would like to refer to the submission to the inquiry into establishing a modern slavery act by The Freedom Partnership: End Modern Slavery—that is, the Salvation Army, as well as the Uniting Church of Australia, FECCA and ACRATH. In their very, very detailed submission, they give examples of workers who have not been protected. Indeed, I would like to share with the Senate one example of what modern slavery looks like in Australian supply chains across a range of industries. In fact, this example is about a man called Samuel Kautai. Samuel Kautai was a young man from the Cook Islands, who along with four other men, all around the ages of 17- and 18-years-old—just starting out in their working life—were recruited by an employer's brother in the construction industry and were promised that while they would not get any wages for the first three weeks, after that they would get paid the full amount, and be able to send money back home to their families in the Cook Islands. However, he was never paid more than $50 a month. This is here, in Australia. He was never paid any more than $50 a month. And worse than that, Samuel and some of his co-workers, were physically abused, underfed and endured long working hours without decent breaks. This case was pursued by the CFMEU under industrial mechanisms and by the NSW Police Force under state criminal law. The case was decided both times in favour of the applicant, which, of course, resulted in the employer having to pay back to Samuel Kautai and the other employees what they were duly and rightly owed.


When we talk about protecting vulnerable workers, we are talking about workers across a range of industries from construction to carpentry to welding to the meat industry as well as domestic workers, market garden workers, horticultural—I have so many examples in this submission to our modern slavery inquiry of workers who have simply been ripped off and who have been treated appallingly, all because of their employers obviously doing wrong by them, but also because we don't have legislation that provides those protections that Labor has been asking and urging this government to deliver.


These examples of exploitation make it clear that action is needed. For example, subcontractors' exploitation—who were engaged by Myer employing cleaners on sham contracts under which workers were paid below award wages, denied penalty rates and superannuation, and worked without occupational health and safety protections—needs to end. Of course, we are all very familiar with what occurred with the 7-Eleven stores. They were operating a business model based on methodical, systematic exploitation of vulnerable foreign workers that included the gross underpayment of wages and doctoring of pay records designed to conceal unlawful conduct, and workers subjected to threats of deportation and physical intimidation. This has no place in a civilised society like ours. It has no place in Australia.


Protecting vulnerable workers is laudable, but, unfortunately, this government cannot be trusted when it comes to protecting vulnerable workers. We have concern that this bill gives coercive powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman without external scrutiny and oversight, and that it could be abused to investigate unions and industrial action rather than actually protecting the vulnerable workers that it needs to protect. We believe that this legislation needs to be amended to ensure that these powers can only be used in investigations into the underpayment of wages.


Labor will continue to lead the way in protecting vulnerable workers, be it through legislation or amendments to this bill in this place or be it through our work in support of the introduction of a modern slavery act similar to that in place in the UK, France and the Netherlands. And, of course, Labor will also ask for the Fair Work Ombudsman to have all the powers necessary to pursue employers who exploit workers. The Fair Work Ombudsman must have powers to be able to pursue those employers, whatever the case may be. But the powers, of course, must have proper oversight. That is what we are asking for in relation to this Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill.


As I outlined, this bill does fall significantly short of the suite of policy and legislative reforms that Labor first announced more than 12 months ago, before this Turnbull government even turned its mind to the notion of protecting vulnerable workers, because it's so caught up in its ideological obsession with unions and its lobbying against workers rather than actually standing up for their protection. I'm pleased to have had the chance to speak on this bill. We've been calling for action to protect these workers for a very long time without any joy. But something is better than nothing, and it's pleasing to see what we have before the Senate today. Let's strengthen this bill so that it can really do what it should do: protect vulnerable workers in Australia.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-08-15,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (12:41):  The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill—it's not a normal name for a bill that comes out of this government. But the circumstances are worth considering. It got to a point where there was such enormous pressure on the government that they had to do something. But when we look at the detail of the bill we see that something isn't adequate; it doesn't actually solve the problem. And the problem is enormous: extreme exploitation of some of the most vulnerable workers that we have in our society. The fact that the bill has been introduced is significant, but we need to look into the detail, and the Greens will be moving amendments similar to those that my colleague the Greens industrial relations spokesperson, Adam Bandt, moved in the other place.


This bill is before us because of the courage of a few people who really looked into what was going on with the franchisees to understand the conditions that the workers were existing under. It became apparent that they are very tough. For many of them, their lives are on hold because of uncertainty with regard to the wages that they will be paid, and even if they will be paid. A lot of these scandals started with 7-Eleven. We quickly learnt that one person's convenience store is often another person's workplace of extreme exploitation and rip-offs. What we learnt is that 7-Eleven is probably just the tip of the iceberg, because there's Caltex, Domino's and probably many others where the loopholes in the law are now well-known by the legal eagles who are employed. They've worked out how they can become rich very quickly off the back of people who are actually keeping these businesses going.


These scams are extreme. It was found that some people were getting paid and were then being forced to give back part of their wages in so-called cashback scams. It was found that, so the proper payment and proper taxes did not have to be paid, the hours the people were being rostered for did not actually represent the hours they were working. It is a real scam of the books that has been going on for a long time and is now out in the open. We have the opportunity to clean it up, and clean it up properly, but that will only occur if this bill is amended.


What we also need to remember here is that the workforce that we're dealing with is often people with limited English or people who are from overseas and very worried that they may be under threat of being deported, even if they have a secure visa and it's totally legitimate that they live here. There have been many reports of intimidation, threats and insinuations made along the lines of, 'If you speak up, if you try to change things and get your proper pay, you could well be deported.' That's deeply shocking, and it needs to be factored in to how we handle this situation.


In my opening remarks I said that we have this bill before us now largely because of the dedication of a few individuals. One of them is Michael Fraser, who really dug into what was going on here. With the 7-Eleven case, he went from store to store collecting stories, winning the understanding, support and confidence of the people working there so he could document what was really going on—the levels of oppression and exploitation that shouldn't be occurring in workplaces anywhere in Australia. There was also a group of Fairfax journalists who took on this story and reported it in detail—another factor leading to the government being forced to act. We also learned from their studies that it was not just the workers who were getting done over; the people who bought into these franchise operations were, in many instances, also being put in a situation where their income was greatly reduced—it was often quite minimal—because of the way head office operated, and they were under pretty clear directions that a lot of the money had to go back to head office. Again, it's worth looking into the operations here: (1) we need to understand it and (2) it informs us of why this bill is inadequate in its present form.


How do these franchises work? Most of us have had the experience of going into a 7-Eleven. Wherever you go, they all look pretty much the same in terms of the stock that they carry, where the stock is, the signage and all that sort of thing. This is how it operates: the head office dictates how these places are managed, micromanaging to the nth degree. But one aspect of how these small businesses—if we can use that term in this case—operate that isn't consistent is the payment of wages. This is where they seem to have a whole different set of standards. The small business franchisees that run the business carry the legal risk if there is underpayment. It's not the head office; it's not the billionaire who's sitting back, doing pretty well off the back of the hardship of so many of the workers in the industry. We see time and time again that the worker who sits at the bottom is the one who is being ripped off.


This is where we are again reminded of the failure of the bill before us, because it does not offer the protection that the title of the bill suggests. If you believed the title of the bill before us—'protection of vulnerable workers'—you'd think it sounds pretty absolute, but that's not the case. What we need here is shared responsibility, and that is why we need to amend what's before us. The bill does not shift any responsibility back home to the owner—and they're really getting filthy rich off the way this system works. When you read the stories of the people who are making money for the people who own these companies, you see that what's going on is very ugly.


As I said, the bill does not make the head office responsible. Instead, it effectively says, 'You're only responsible if you knew or could reasonably have been expected to have known that the franchisee was underpaying the worker.' That's just passing the buck. It's simply unacceptable; it's been exposed and it has to change. That's why we're going to move to amend the bill—to close that loophole and make sure that the head office is responsible. That's the essence of what we're dealing with here. Really, the government should've had a good look at the Greens' bill that Adam Bandt, the MP for Melbourne, worked on. That really brings all these issues together and makes it very clear that we do need that shared responsibility, that you can't let the head office off the hook here.


So we will be moving an amendment that will make it very clear that, if you're a worker in one of these franchises—7-Eleven, Domino's or wherever—and you are underpaid, you can go straight to the head office and claim your underpayment. At the moment, it doesn't work that way. What happens is that the head office can just get out of it. We read that time and time again in those reports and articles about what was happening. They were just passing the buck back to the small business owners that they have further down their chain of command. This really does need to change here, otherwise what the government is doing is a farce. We need it set up so that if the worker wins a court case they can claim it against the head office. This is the key to achieving the protection that the government is stating is in this bill. Then it is up to the head office. They are then the ones who have to have the battle with the franchisees that they have brought in to run their stores. That is where the battle lies. Meanwhile, the workers who have been exploited and underpaid have been able to pick up their correct pay, because they have been able to go direct to the head office. It is a very simple requirement. The government has done a disservice here.


In many ways, it is classic in terms of what you see from Liberal-National parties when they are in government. They will often try to walk both sides of the road, particularly when a problem has been identified where the business world is doing the wrong thing. They will say, 'We'll bring in a correction; we'll fix this up,' but they have left the loopholes in the bill so that big business can still, effectively, get away with so much of the exploitation. Again, let's remind ourselves: it should not be the worker left in limbo trying to work out how they get their money, who owes them money and who can actually pay them. That is what was revealed in so many of the reports that exposed how so many of the companies were working. Whether it is 7-Eleven, Domino's or Caltex, there is a similar pattern. It is ruthless; it must stop. We have the opportunity right now to stop this level of exploitation.


I can't emphasise enough: it should not be up to the individual worker to try and work out who is the person responsible for the underpayment and who will actually pay them the money. We have to get rid of the tricks—and there are tricks in the legislation before us. Our amendment effectively says that the worker can go directly to the head office and get their money back. Then we're leaving it up to the franchisees and the head offices to fight it out and to work out how they are going to undertake their business model. It really does need to change. It really needs to recognise that people have rights and that they can't use some legal scams to get away with what's currently going on.


So, yes, we do need this legislation, but to be effective it does need to be considerably amended. I look forward to the discussion at the committee stage.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-08-15,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (12:52):  I, too, am pleased to be able to contribute to the debate on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. I'm going to make a very boring contribution following the media superstar, Senator Rhiannon, but I'll do my best!


A lot has been said over the last couple of months since this bill was brought on for consideration by this parliament, highlighting a great many examples of abuse of vulnerable workers and business enterprises taking advantage of those who may not be able to stand up for themselves. So I too am willing to commend the government for bringing on this legislation and for putting in place some protections and setting up a regime, or attempting to set up a regime, that will actually do something to provide some protections for workers who, as I say, may not be able to stand up for themselves.


We have seen companies such as 7-Eleven, Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's and Caltex—to name a few household brands—implicated in the allegations made about underpayment of vulnerable workers. Not having as much air time are the widespread ramifications flowing from underpayment of workers. These people have families. They have bills to pay. If they are underpaid, meeting those obligations is very, very difficult. It also has an impact on other businesses that are doing the right thing. Those who are paying the right amount—and, in some cases, more than the award rate—have an increased cost to doing business compared to those who are flouting the law and taking advantage of vulnerable workers. That's why this legislation is so incredibly important. It is why I am going to commend it to the Senate.


The Fair Work Ombudsman in its submission to the Senate inquiry on this legislation gave a great many accounts of the breaches that it had investigated and that were reported to it and the impacts that this has had on individual companies and individual human beings who were caught up in these cases. We heard stories of migrant workers being paid as little as $14.12 or $10 an hour, well below the federal minimum wage, which is something none of us should stand by and condone. That's exactly what we're getting at here—trying to crack down on this sort of behaviour. There were also stories of young people being forced to accept non-cash payments of pizza and soft drink rather than being paid the money that they were entitled to be paid. It's just unconscionable that any business proprietor or senior manager in any business entity would seek to take away from someone what they are entitled to be given in return for the work that they are contributing. So, when you hear of people doing this sort of thing, providing in-kind payment, as they would probably refer to it, in the form of sugary drinks and fast food, rather than the money they need to pay for whatever it is they need to pay for—the power bill, rent and food—it's just not good enough.


The Fair Work Ombudsman's submission to the inquiry looked at what action has been taken by business operators to evade compliance efforts. There were some startling things—for example, phoenixing, where companies liquidate and then set up a new business to avoid any liabilities that have accrued against that business in not paying what employees are due; the failure to keep records or falsifying the records that do exist, making it difficult to verify the hours that have been worked and what workers have been paid for the hours they are supposed to have worked; engaging in the cashback schemes, which I will touch on later; and targeting vulnerable workers who are less aware of their rights and less likely to report problems for a whole range of reasons, such as language barriers, a lack of familiarity around the mechanisms that are available to vulnerable workers and the protections that might be available. There are all sorts of problems. Then, of course, as we've heard before, workers have been threatened with their visa or their job—'If you don't take what I'm giving you, I'm going to send you home and seek that your visa be cancelled, or I'll terminate your employment and you won't have any money.'


I want to quote from a couple of parts of the Fair Work Ombudsman's submission because I think it's important to look at some of the things that it said. This entity works at the coalface. This is the entity that receives the complaints. This is the entity that deals with the allegations and gets to the bottom of what's going on and tries to do the right thing by the people who are purportedly being ripped off. The Fair Work Ombudsman's submission says on page 7, paragraph 17:


In some of these cases, the existing framework has not been sufficient to deter ongoing and systemic conduct across sectors, industries and regions, and usually with respect to these workers. Some unscrupulous employers view non-compliance as a business model and do not fear being caught out for their behaviours, or consider penalties associated with their breaches of the law an acceptable cost of doing business. These employers often do not keep proper records or payslips and are unwilling to engage with the FWO in an investigation.


That gives you an insight into what the Fair Work Ombudsman is dealing with in trying to get to the bottom of these things. The fact that the Fair Work Ombudsman acknowledges in its submission that there are business operators who see this as a way of doing business—a worthwhile risk; something that they are willing to sort of take a chance on in the event that they get caught out and may have to pay a fine—is just unbelievable. How these people can sleep at night, thinking, 'It is worth it in the end,' all the while inflicting some sort of misery on individuals who have been underpaid is certainly not something that is at all Australian. Again, that's why I'm so pleased that we are considering this legislation today.


Moving to paragraph 23, the submission goes on to say:


The package of measures outlined in the Bill together would make a significant difference to FWO's capacity to address this conduct where it occurs. In particular, providing higher penalties that reflect the gravity of serious contraventions of the law and ensuring there are real deterrents against not keeping records or falsifying records for the purpose of disguising underpayments. Ensuring Fair Work inspectors are taken seriously and cannot simply be ignored will make a significant difference when tackling the worst sort of conduct.


The FWO refers to, in the broad, the amendments proposed in this piece of legislation, saying that these will help them do their job—to deal with those dodgy operators who falsify, destroy, don't keep records and who think they can get away with ignoring the FWO when they come knocking, saying: 'Hey, we have examples or complaints against your business suggesting that you're engaging in this sort of conduct. We want you to provide evidence that this is not the case.' I think the fact that they're going to be able to clamp down on that is an excellent thing and something I look forward to seeing the results of as we move forward.


Moving to the conclusion of the Fair Work Ombudsman's submission to the inquiry, paragraph 113, they conclude by saying:


As the FWO has noted, the regulatory framework is fit for purpose in most circumstances but is not sufficient to deal with the most egregious behaviour in matters involving the exploitation of vulnerable workers. The proposed amendments would enhance the FWO’s ability to deal with serious and concerning conduct within the jurisdiction of the FW Act and contribute to efforts across government and within communities to address the drivers of workplace exploitation.


As I say, this is from the people who are at the coalface of dealing with this issue, of dealing with the complaints from vulnerable workers, their family, their friends and other employee-representative organisations who become aware of this stuff. To hear them make those comments about what this bill will do—the people who have to go out and apply it—is encouraging.


Fundamentally, when we do see this abuse of power—be it the employer, a senior manager or someone from any other representative organisation exploiting vulnerable workers—it is incumbent upon us to take action. This legislation does exactly that. Under the amendments contained in the bill, as has been stated in previous contributions, the franchisor will, in certain circumstances, become liable where a franchisee or one of the franchisor's subsidiaries violates specific sections of the act, such as the National Employment Standards, any modern awards, methods and frequency of payments, or record-keeping obligations. Most of those are very straightforward and, I think, speak for themselves.


Much has been made in the debate about the transfer or liability to the franchisor, so it's important to set out exactly what the amendments will establish and in what circumstances they'd be applied. The amendments introduced the notion of serious contraventions to apply deliberate and systematic breaches. They strengthen the liability and responsibility of franchisors for the business conduct in the franchises under their direction. It's important, though, to point out that the breaches targeted through these amendments differ greatly from the genuine mistakes—and they occur. I'm aware of one in Hobart, which attracted a great deal of media attention which was a genuine mistake. It was a business that had engaged the services of a third party to do its bookkeeping, a reputable firm. Clearly, this reputable firm and the individual they sent along to do this business's books didn't know what they were doing. As a result, the staff were underpaid a significant amount and this business was dealt with under the law. As with many of these cases, a significant amount of public attention was given to this business, somewhat unfairly. All the same, it will be nice to see these genuine mistakes, if they can be properly demonstrated, taken out of the basket that some of these more dodgy operators should be kept in and dealt with. In doing that, there is the three-stage test, to determine whether or not this is a genuine mistake, that must be satisfied before the franchisor can be held responsible. That test is as follows: 


… the franchisor:


had significant control or influence over the franchisee,


knew or should have known about the underpayments, or


failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the violations.


Those three steps do establish a bit of a mental intent test, for want of a better expression, to ensure that the entity against whom the complaint is being made was seeking to actually do what has been done and that is the subject of the complaint.


The bill also seeks to define a 'serious contravention' as one that is intentional and is part of a systematic pattern relating to one or more individuals. Again it points to it being something that's planned or deliberate and is happening to a number of employees, rather than just one out of 30 or 10. Further, the bill notes elements that the court may give regard to when assessing whether a systematic pattern exists. So there are going to be strict tests under the law that the courts will adhere to when assessing these things.


A 'responsible franchisor' is one who has a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee entity's affairs. The bill aims to ensure that franchisees and franchisors are held responsible for a series of contraventions, including underpayments and sham contracting, which we've heard a lot about in the debate over the last day or two. The bill also extends accessorial liability to franchisors where they knew or should have known that contraventions were occurring in one of their franchises. This liability means that an individual or company involved in the breach would also be potentially responsible in situations where they were not directly participating in the breach itself. So the amendments will apply to both franchisors and master franchisors if they exercise a significant level of influence or control over the franchisee's activities. The amendments do provide exemptions for franchisors in circumstances where they can demonstrate that they took reasonable steps to prevent contraventions and there were no reasonable steps they could have taken to prevent such a contravention from taking place.


Other provisions include increasing penalties tenfold for serious contraventions of specific parts of the act and for failure to maintain proper records. Individuals who engage in serious contraventions face a maximum penalty of 600 penalty units, which is $108,000, and companies could face a penalty of $540,000. That is, as stated, a tenfold increase on the current penalties and represents the government's resolve to deter these sorts of practices. I think it's important to note that, in the submissions to the inquiry, a number of entities said that the penalties didn't go far enough and others said that they went too far. To my mind, when you see those sorts of comments being made, it often means that you've got the balance right. Certain entities with certain interests believe that we're going a bit hard and others would like to see us go harder.


Further amendments outlaw the cashback and other coercive behaviour by employers where employees may be paid correctly but then forced by their employer to repay part of their wages. I heard Senator Williams explaining yesterday this disgraceful conduct. In some cases it has been suggested that the employer marches the employee down to the ATM and asks them to hand back a portion of what they've been paid. To see employers trying to make it look like they're doing the right thing on paper—'We've paid them X amount this week'—and then forcing their employee to give back a certain amount, because they were threatening them with having their visa removed or terminating their employment, is just disgraceful.


The EM for the bill specifically references the inquiry into the 7-Eleven scandal, which we've all heard and read so much about, and their involvement in cashback practices. It's important to note through this scrutiny and in debating this legislation that it was just some franchisees who did this and that others did pay their employees the lawful rate. Again, in the same case that had received so much public attention, the franchisee then deliberately falsified records to disguise underpayments. This practice, which clearly demonstrates that these businesses were seeking to deliberately rip off employees and hide it from the public and from the regulator, is exactly what we should be looking for and catching out. The amendments hold franchisors and companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. The bill also builds on steps already taken by the government to protect vulnerable workers and broadens the circumstances in which franchisors can be held responsible for employment law breaches by their franchisees.


I will now touch on some of the contributions made by some of my colleagues yesterday in the debate. It's always good to listen to Senator Helen Polley and the contributions she makes in these debates. And I'm disappointed that I haven't yet heard Senator Bilyk's contributions, but I look forward to listening to that afterwards. Senator Polley referenced earlier on, consistent with some submitters to the inquiry, that the bill didn't go far enough. I make the point that there were some submitters who said it went too far, again pointing to the fact that the balance in this bill is right. And, when you take that into account with the amendments that have been proposed in the majority report on the inquiry into this bill, I think that the bill is exactly what we should be passing.


I have been amused at the reference to cuts to penalty rates and how that somehow gets intertwined into the substance of this bill. I accept it's an issue that there has been a great deal of public debate on. I don't think that I need to point out, for those who have listened to the debates on that issue, the rewriting of history from the opposition with regard to that. But it's very convenient. And, when they can conflate that into this attack on workers, then—




Senator Bilyk:
  You were doing so well up until then!




Senator DUNIAM:
  All points to the opposition for trying, but, when it isn't material to the substance of this bill, I do have to question why it does get raised. But I do understand that there is a pitch out there in the community to try to paint Australia as the most unequal society in the world and that it's all because of this government. I guess that all fits into the arguments, the dog whistles and the catch cries of the opposition in trying to defeat this sort of legislation.


In conclusion, in the words of the Fair Work Commission, 'No one single measure will fix this oversight,' but the package of measures in this bill will go some way to combatting some of the most serious worker exploitation in this country. In commending the bill to the Senate, I want to also pay tribute to the work of my colleague Senator Bridget McKenzie, as the chair of the legislation committee that inquired into this bill, and the proposals that her committee report made. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (13:12):  I'm pleased that I was given some time today to talk on the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. It's good that, having seen levels of abuse of workers' rights that not even this government could ignore, we are finally presented with the bill. Over the last couple of years, just some of the high-profile cases of exploitation of workers we've heard about include 7-Eleven shop assistants, Myer cleaners and Pizza Hut delivery drivers. But what we need to remember is that not all cases have been high profile. There has been consistent evidence of the exploitation of workers taking place over quite some time.


It is utterly despicable that in 2017 we're still hearing of exploitation of workers on such a large scale. Labor senators welcome the provisions of the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, which will reduce the exploitation of some vulnerable workers in Australia. However, Labor senators consider that in some aspects the bill as currently drafted falls well short of addressing the range of ways workers are exploited. It falls significantly short on the suite of legislative measures required to properly address the breadth of worker exploitation.


For those who said that the bill has gone too far, I would suggest that they possibly don't like accountability, because the bill does nothing in relation to sham contracting, phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities or reforms to the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers, and it does nothing to make it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages. As such, Labor senators believe that a number of amendments are required in order to provide a more comprehensive solution to the very deliberate and systematic exploitation of workers in Australian workplaces. It could be a better bill, and if the Senate accepts our amendments, it will be, but I do acknowledge that it is a start.


I shouldn't have to say it, especially here in the Australian Senate, but throughout the country employees shouldn't be ripped off by their employer, ever—full stop. Employees should be fairly paid in line with their agreements and the law. Employers shouldn't deliberately rob their workers to boost their own profits. We should be a better nation than that. However, we've seen in the last couple of years gross, systemic and wilful exploitation of workers, in particular, by some very large national franchises. This is completely unacceptable. It's unacceptable to the employees and to the employers who are placed at a competitive disadvantage by doing the right thing and paying award wages or over award wages, and who aren't exploiting their workers. It's unacceptable to the union movement and it's unacceptable to our sense as a nation of the fair go.


The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 amends the Fair Work Act to increase penalties for serious contraventions defined as conduct which is:


(a) deliberate; and


(b) part of a systematic pattern of conduct relating to one or more other persons—


of prescribed workplace laws. Also:


Increasing penalties for record-keeping failures.


Making franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments by their franchisees or subsidiaries where they knew or ought reasonably to have known of the contraventions and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. The new responsibilities will only apply where franchisors and holding companies have a significant degree of influence or control over their business networks.


And the franchisor or holding company may raise a defence of taking reasonable steps to prevent a contravention, and:


Expressly prohibiting employers from unreasonably requiring their employees to make payments (e.g. demanding a proportion of their wages be paid back in cash)—


giving the Fair Work Ombudsman and employees at SES level the power to compulsorily question persons as part of an investigation in to the breaches of the Fair Work Act where failure to answer questions gives rise to a civil liability.


As I said, those measures are a start, but they don't go far enough. But there's a policy that does properly protect workers' rights. Labor's rights at work policy released at the start of 2016 committed a Labor government to put in place a suite of reforms to protect rights at work by cracking down on unscrupulous employers who are willing to exploit employees.


Labor's Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 is a far more comprehensive suite of measures to protect vulnerable workers. As an example, our bill contains amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009, which make it clear that the Fair Work Act applies to all employees, irrespective of their immigration status; require the Fair Work Ombudsman to publish information for employees about the relationship between workplace and immigration laws and the right of overseas workers to seek redress for contraventions of workplace laws; provide additional protection from adverse action taken against an employee who questions whether a workplace right exists or whether they're an employee and not an independent contractor; introduce a reasonable person test in determining whether an employer has engaged in sham contracting; give the court the power to make orders requiring directors of phoenix companies to pay unpaid wages and other employee entitlements when a company of which they're a director is phoenixed; increase threefold the maximum penalty for employers, other than small businesses, who deliberately and systematically deny workers the wages they are due; give the courts the power to disqualify directors involved in companies that are found to have deliberately engaged in serious contraventions of workplace relations laws; and introduce new criminal offences for conduct that involves the use of coercion or threat within the meaning of slavery or slavery conditions of the Criminal Code where employers commit serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act in relation to temporary overseas workers.


Labor's bill is significantly better than the one presented today. I would like to take a moment to talk about the importance of ensuring that franchisors ensure franchisees are in compliance with the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Ombudsman in the report into 7-Eleven found:


It is our opinion that 7-Eleven had a reasonable basis on which to inquire and to act. To the extent that 7-Eleven contends that issues were limited to the few rather than the many, the Fair Work Ombudsman provided evidence of widespread compliance risks across the network in October 2014 at the commencement of the inquiry and again in May 2015 when presented with the preliminary findings of the 20 stores audited in September 2014.


So, in other words, 7-Eleven knew of the behaviour that had been going on across its franchisees for many years, yet they did nothing to protect the workers. This is utterly shameful. In addition, the Fair Work Ombudsman's 7-Eleven report said:


While 7-Eleven is not legally responsible for entitlements payable to employees of franchisees, it has a moral and ethical responsibility for what has occurred within its network and is capable of preventing it occurring again.


On this same issue, Labor senators, in their additional comments to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's report into this bill, noted:


… the concerns raised by submitters such as WEstjustice that the bill as currently drafted does not make it clear that responsible franchisor entities and holding companies will be liable for the breaches of the franchisee entity or subsidiary.


Labor senators also consider that the bill does not go far enough in its amendments to expand accessorial liability. As the Franchise Council of Australia argued:


No evidence provided makes the case for singling out franchising when Fair Work compliance concerns are an economy-wide issue.


Labor senators contend that this evidence supports the need for liability to be extended so that franchisors cannot avoid responsibility by merely rearranging their affairs. Employers shouldn't be able to wash their hands by shifting employees to labour hire firms. This is one of the reasons that the bill, as originally drafted, doesn't go far enough.


However, just protecting workers from exploitation is not enough. We also have to work to protect their take-home pay. Of course, we all know that penalty rates are of vital importance to low-paid workers, and on this the government has failed those workers again. I often wonder if those on the other side of the chamber have ever had to rely on penalty rates—not just getting them from working a part-time job while living with mum and dad and all the comforts of home but actually relying on them. We're not just talking about students and young people; we're talking about 700,000 people: mothers and fathers, carers, primary bread winners for families. If those opposite really understood, they would side with our lowest paid workers and make their lives a little easier. But those opposite are not the ones negatively impacted by penalty rate cuts.


Labor does not accept the failed, flawed, sterile view of this country that says you reward those at the very top and hope that something trickles down to everyone else. It's clear to see that this government's priorities are utterly wrong. The last thing Australia needs is a cut to household budgets, which are already stretched to the last dollar. When corporate profits are at record highs and wages growth is at a record low, it is not the time to give multinationals a tax cut and workers a pay cut. Australians facing a cut to their penalty rates just want someone to fight for them. Well, guess what? That's exactly what Labor is doing.


Those opposite say we should just accept the decision of the umpire. We respect the Fair Work Commission—absolutely we do—but they've made the wrong decision in cutting Sunday penalty rates, and we will not stand idly by while Australia's lowest paid workers pay the price. A new Labor government will reverse this penalty rate cut and protect vulnerable workers from exploitation. I call upon the government and the crossbench to work with Labor, pass our amendments and leave this place with a significantly better bill. Our lowest paid and most vulnerable workers need legal protection from unscrupulous operators who are getting away with exploitation and theft. We should be making laws that protect the most vulnerable, not allowing these injustices to continue.

"Leyonhjelm, Sen David",LDP,2017-08-15,"



Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (13:24):  I rise to oppose a bill with a dishonest name. It's the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. It doesn't promote fair work and it doesn't protect vulnerable workers. Like other industrial relations legislation, it destroys jobs and the lives of people who could fill those jobs. The bill raises penalties for paying a consenting adult $18 an hour, because the ban on low-skilled work, euphemistically called the minimum wage, is set at $18.29. This kills jobs, particularly for those unemployed Australians who are young, mature—or mature-ish, like me—disabled, have poor English or are fresh out of jail. Supporters of the minimum wage, to my left and right, are crushing the hopes of the most disadvantaged Australians. It is immoral.


The bill before us today also hits franchisors with $100,000 fines when someone else, a franchisee, does not comply with the fair work law, even though the franchisor does not know about, help or encourage the noncompliance. This is unjust. It's like a wrathful God incensed by the sins of the father and visiting them upon the son. It will also stop the franchise business model in its tracks. Australia will be forced back into the 1970s where, instead of a franchise restaurant or cafe, we ate at a local greasy spoon and, instead of ducking into an IGA to pick up some groceries, we would be lucky if we picked up a wilted lettuce at a dusty corner store. Businesses will become more and more reluctant to offer budding entrepreneurs a franchise, which is an easy way for them to start their own business. Instead, thousands of budding entrepreneurs will have to continue to work for the man, rather than become their own boss.


I will be moving amendments to soften the edges of this bill's attack on the franchise model. The Franchise Council of Australia, and many others, advised the Senate committee reviewing this bill that only those franchisors who influence their franchisees' employment arrangements should be held responsible for a franchisee's noncompliance with employment law. The Senate committee recommended consideration of an amendment along these lines. I will move such an amendment, to be co-sponsored by Senator Bernardi. My amendment will add a condition to the definition of 'responsible franchisor entity' so that not only does the franchisor need to have a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee's affairs but also the influence or control must relate to the franchisee's compliance with workplace laws. It won't be sufficient if a franchisor only has influence over the size of the pickle in a franchisee's Big Mac.


My amendment will also make a corresponding change to the related civil remedy provisions. Currently, these provisions establish a contravention if the responsible franchisor entity knew, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that its franchisee would fail to comply with workplace laws. They also establish a contravention if a body corporate knew, or could reasonably be expected to have known, that its subsidiary would fail to comply with workplace laws. With my amendment, the contraventions would arise only if the franchisor or body corporate would know these things, or ought to know these things, in the ordinary course of business. So, if a franchisor hears from a loudmouth taxi driver that his barber said that he heard from his next door neighbour that the franchisee is paying below the minimum wage, the franchisor won't have broken the law simply because of these Chinese whispers.


This is a bill of the Liberal-National government and it is furiously supported by Labor and the Greens. These major parties pretend that fairness can be achieved by making a declaration in legislation rather than through voluntary deals struck between established businesses, budding entrepreneurs and workers. The Liberal Democrats stand against this madness. Just like the emperor has no clothes, the fair work system actually isn't fair.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (13:29):  The Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 is a lame attempt by this government to deal with a real crisis that we're facing in this country, and that is the crisis of wage theft that is rampant across our economy and rampant across a wide variety of industries and is, as a result, seeing the gross exploitation of far too many working people in this country. The bill is a very belated effort by this government to deal with the unbelievable exploitation of workers that we witnessed occurring at the 7-Eleven chain of stores a number of years ago. It's been years since this exploitation was revealed by media outlets, and, for years, the Labor Party, trade unions and many others in our community have been calling this government for action. Now, finally, we see the government coming forward with legislation, which, to some extent, deals with these issues but doesn't go anywhere near far enough.


I'm very proud of the fact that the workers who were exploited by 7-Eleven were represented by my former law firm, Maurice Blackburn Lawyers. I pay tribute to the efforts of Giri Sivaraman and his team at Maurice Blackburn Lawyers, who took on these cases on a pro bono basis and, as a result of the legal action taken on behalf of these workers, have managed to extract, literally, millions of dollars in underpayments to workers, many of whom came to Australia on temporary visas. That work has gone some way to rectify the massive losses that these exploited workers suffered.


In the interest of time, I will give a couple of quick examples of the kinds of conditions that people working at 7-Eleven were experiencing. The first claimant commenced working at 7-Eleven on a bridging visa B. They worked at three different 7-Eleven stores between 2011 and 2014. In total, this claimant was underpaid over $180,000, including interest. At one store, the claimant was required to work many weeks unpaid, which the franchisee characterised as training. At each store, he was paid below the award rate. He was paid somewhere between $10 and $12 per hour, well below the award rate. He was not paid overtime, was not paid penalty rates, was not paid for all the hours worked and wasn't provided with rest or meal breaks. For some time, the claimant worked 60 or 70 hours a week between all three stores. At one point in time, he worked 110 hours in a week. The claimant received deliberately falsified pay slips that halved the hours he actually worked. He was robbed twice in one day by a man with a serrated knife, and he was forced by the franchisee to work the next day. So he was robbed by an armed robber twice in one day and then his franchisee at 7-Eleven turned around and robbed him again by underpaying him.


The second claimant that I'll mention worked at two different 7-Eleven stores between 2005 and 2006. This claimant was underpaid by nearly $100,000, including interest. At one store, he was required to complete 32 hours of unpaid alleged training. Money was deducted from his pay if customers drove off without paying for fuel. Can you imagine the cruelty of an employer who would actually do that to someone! Not only would the employer underpay them and not pay them for alleged training but, if their customers drove off without paying for fuel, they would also take that out of the worker's pay packet. At each store, this person was paid below the award rate, not paid over time, not paid penalty rates, not paid for all hours worked and not provided with rest or meal breaks. At one store he worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for over six months. That's not to mention the fact that this particular claimant's wife was extremely ill with stage 4 cancer.


These are the kinds of stories that emerged as a result of media coverage of the disgraceful behaviour of 7-Eleven and the complete lack of responsibility taken by their senior management, the franchisors, in the behaviour of their franchisees. The thing I remember most from talking to my former colleagues at Maurice Blackburn who were working on the case was that, no matter how bad you thought the behaviour of 7-Eleven was—and it was absolutely abominable behaviour—in many instances, for those people they were acting for who were working at 7-Eleven, that was their second, better paid job, because they were working elsewhere getting even more exploited than they were at 7-Eleven. That gives you some idea of the scale of wage theft and exploitation that is happening in this country. But it's not just 7-Eleven where this is happening. We've seen many other exposes through the great work of people like Adele Ferguson and her team at Fairfax Media, exposing the behaviour of Caltex, BP, Pizza Hut and Domino's.


Some of the worst instances we've seen have been in the meat-processing industry, particularly a company called Baiada and the way that they have been treating their workers in North Queensland. This is not an issue that is restricted to one particular company or one particular business model being franchised; this is something happening right across our economy and right across every kind of employment relationship that we see. I have seen it myself, both on the Gold Coast and in Central Queensland, those being the two major parts of Queensland that I represent, and it's really got to stop.


The fact that this is happening beyond one business tells you that this is actually a business model that is being adopted by a large number of companies right around this country, and the only way they are staying in business and the only way they are delivering profits to their owners is by ripping off highly vulnerable workers. As I said, this bill is the government's alleged attempt to respond to this problem.


Now, I do welcome the changes that the government is making in this bill, but they go nowhere near enough to deal with the scale and breadth of problems that we are seeing happen in our economy through exploitation of vulnerable workers. This bill doesn't address the problems that we are seeing around sham contracting, where many workers, who any objective test of whether they are an employee or not would say that they are an employee and therefore entitled to the rights that come with employment—leave, superannuation and all sorts of other rights that come with being an employee—but instead these people are being treated as contractors and denied rights. The bill does nothing about that.


This bill does nothing about phoenixing, which we're seeing not only in the construction industry but in security, in cleaning and in a whole range of industries. This is where people are employed by one firm and underpaid—or not paid at all in some cases. Then the business is shut down overnight and the assets moved to another company, which starts operating the next day under a different guise, and the people who have worked there and have gone unpaid end up losing out.


This bill does nothing about the problems that we're seeing around exploitation of people through labour hire. Obviously, that is something I have spoken about on a number of occasions in the chamber, particularly in relation to the problems that we have seen in Central Queensland in the mining industry. People are being sacked from permanent employment and the very same day mining companies are bringing people on through labour-hire arrangements, paying them less pay and giving them worse conditions. This bill does nothing about that. It does nothing to stop the incredible growth in casualisation that we're seeing right throughout the economy as well, where people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent work. And of course this bill does nothing whatsoever to reverse the recent decision of the Fair Work Commission to cut people's penalty rates, which will have a dreadful effect not only on working people's budgets but on the economy overall.


Labor is going to step up to the challenge and is going to put forward some amendments in this debate that do try to deal with some of these other problems that we're seeing in the economy. We're going to put forward amendments which prohibit unreasonable demands for money by employers to prospective employees. This bill does go some way to stopping employers from demanding money be paid to them by current employees, with the threat hanging over them that if they don't pay that money they could be deported, lose their visa or lose their job. But this does nothing to stop employers from making the same kinds of threats and demanding money from prospective employees. Recently, we saw instances where a Domino's franchisee demanded around $150,000, I think it was, from someone in order to get a job. If they didn't pay that money, they weren't going to get the job and they were being threatened with immigration reprisals. One of the amendments that Labor is also going to put forward for this bill is to extend the liability of franchisors to labour-hire and supply chains.


This bill does do some good things in making franchisors liable, in some instances, for the actions of their franchisees. If their franchisees are underpaying their workers then, in some instances, franchisors will be held responsible. But we know very well—and every week new cases surface, whether they be in Central Queensland, the Gold Coast or other parts of Australia—that host companies are engaging dodgy labour-hire firms to bring people in on below-award illegal rates of pay and are getting away with it, because the workers who are brought in by these labour-hire firms are too scared to complain because they are in fear of losing their jobs. Currently, there is nothing in Australian law that stops a labour-hire company from doing that unless those laws are enforced. And currently there is no obligation whatsoever on a host employer to make sure that a labour-hire firm that they engage is doing the right thing and paying people the appropriate wages and conditions.


Big employers should not be allowed to get away with using labour-hire firms to underpay their workers. If a big firm—whether it be a mining company, a retail chain or whoever—engages a labour hire firm which then goes on to pay someone below the legal rates and conditions, then the host employer, the person who has engaged the labour hire firm, should be held responsible. The bill does nothing about that. It is time we took steps to correct firms who are doing the wrong thing. I'm very pleased that Labor will be moving amendments to that effect, and I look forward to joining the debate when we get to those amendments.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (13:40):  I rise to make a contribution in respect of the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017. As previous Labor senators in this debate have indicated, whilst we are glad that the government has taken some tentative steps to address the issue, in the face of the egregious examples of abuse by certain franchise companies these steps are woefully inadequate. We have seen very many examples of this, and I will talk a bit about that as well.


This bill has been a long time coming. It does do a few things worthy of note. Among other things, it introduces a new civil remedy offence of 'unreasonably requiring an employee to spend or pay an amount of their money in relation to the performance of work'. The Senate committee inquiry in relation to the bill revealed stakeholder concerns that this new offence will not cover unreasonable demands made by employers to prospective employees as a condition of employment. This is of serious concern. This is a serious deficiency in the bill.


Additionally, as highlighted in the submission by Morris Blackburn—a firm that has a lot of experience representing workers, often on a pro bono basis—these proposed changes to the liabilities of franchisors do not go far enough. If we're talking about improving accountability and making sure workers are paid what they are owed, then these changes need to be stronger. The liability imposed by the proposed section 558B attaches only to a franchisor who is a responsible franchisor entity. The bill defines this as a franchisor that has 'a significant degree of influence or control over the franchisee entity's affairs'. In short, I believe this change will merely encourage franchisors to operate at arm's length from franchisees to ensure that liability does not apply under section 558B. This change would have the effect of merely allowing franchisors to distance themselves from the alleged underpayment but would do nothing to stop the underpayment from occurring.


Secondly, there are additional protections for franchisors if they take what's referred to as 'reasonable steps to prevent a contravention'. The prevention test describes it as 'the franchisor need only take pre-emptive action in advance of a contravention and will not be in breach of the provision if they fail to address the contravention once it has occurred or is occurring'. This is an obvious flaw as, after becoming aware of the contravention, a franchisor can in essence do nothing and escape liability if it otherwise meets the prevention test in section 558B. It's concerning that meeting this prevention test could be as simple as a franchisor advising a franchisee of their obligation through a simple 'tick and flick' checklist.


Given these weaknesses in the bill, it is my view that more scrutiny is warranted. And this is where we look at the egregious examples of abuse that came out in the 7-Eleven underpayment scandal. This profit-splitting arrangement, in which a franchisor took 57 per cent of profits made by franchisees and imposed a significant number of business expenses on the franchisees, actually incentivised franchisees' noncompliance with the act as a way of recovering profits they had surrendered to the franchisor.


I was listening to Senator Williams's contribution in relation to this matter yesterday. Senator Williams advocated a review of the franchising arrangements. My personal view is that that is something which could be accommodated. There are some questions to be asked in relation to the franchising model and protecting franchisees and, in turn, protecting the rights of workers employed by the franchisees. The courts are needed here to examine if the business model of the franchisor has substantially contributed to franchisees breaking workplace law. Sadly, even when we have worker exploitation occurring on an industrial scale, this government has remained absent. We only need to look at 7-Eleven's dastardly attempts to minimise what's owed to employees, who have clearly been overworked and underpaid, yet this government has done nothing but produce weak legislation that will only have a slight impact in stopping this situation from occurring again.


Victims of this scandal are still being short-changed. Prakash Kumar, who was underpaid hundreds of thousands of dollars at a number of 7-Elevens, was offered a payout under the new scheme that is $100,000 less than the amount he originally claimed for. Another former 7-Eleven worker Raj Desia was made an offer by the panel of $60,986 which was $16,000 less than the amount he was owed. As recently as 25 July, a 7-Eleven owner in Brisbane was personally fined $28,000 and his company fined $140,000 by the Federal Circuit Court after he was found to have underpaid eight staff and falsified records to cover their tracks. This is an absolutely disgraceful situation. Australians expect that our industrial relations system is going to protect vulnerable workers. When we have people coming into the country who are particularly vulnerable on visas, who are studying and who rely on their jobs in order to remain in the country, they particularly need to be protected. In the face of these egregious examples, we have a government which is not taking reasonable steps to address the issues. If the government was to get serious about assessing whether the franchisor has taken reasonable steps to ensure that exploitation doesn't occur, the bill should also require consideration of the vulnerability of workers to exploitation, such as young workers or workers on visas. 


Submissions to the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee's inquiry into the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 identified the behaviour allegedly engaged in by a Domino's franchise where sponsorship for a working visa and a job was offered on the condition of payment of $150,000, as an example. While it would appear that particular pre-employment requirement for an up-front payment linked to the provision of a visa may be prohibited by other legislation, other unreasonable pre-employment requirements are not. Stakeholders from business and unions made submissions to the Senate committee inquiry, raising concerns about the lack of oversight in the bill for the proposed new Fair Work Ombudsman compulsory questioning powers. Whilst Labor supports giving the FWO the powers necessary to prevent, uncover and prosecute the exploitation and underpayment of vulnerable workers, we are also concerned that these powers are exercised appropriately. We really need to address this particular issue. Unfortunately, this legislation doesn't go far enough, and there are a number of amendments that Labor has in mind here. These will certainly improve the effectiveness of the bill. 


I have been participating in the Education and Employment References Committee's inquiry into corporate avoidance of the Fair Work Act. I have heard numerous witnesses indicating to me that wage theft is now on the rise and is at historic levels in this country. It is quite clear to me that the Fair Work legislation is not working fairly for ordinary workers, particularly not for vulnerable workers. We need to have a thorough look at this issue. Unfortunately, the legislation we have before us at the moment is not going anywhere near addressing some of these issues. Senator Watt has touched on some of these issues. Other issues that should be looked at that require urgent attention are things like stopping sham contracting. I fully support any attempt to address that but, unfortunately, this bill doesn't go anywhere near that. Another issue is providing proper licensing for labour hire companies. Even the Franchise Council has indicated that the issues that came out, for example, in the 7-Eleven scandal, apply across the whole of the workforce, and the labour hire industry is also needing a bit of a shake-up. I note that the Queensland government has taken steps to introduce licensing arrangements here for labour hire companies, and we did start to look at this in relation to the backpacker tax at a federal level. There is also shutting down the practice of companies phoenixing to avoid wage liabilities; properly reforming the Fair Work Act to strengthen protections for workers; criminalising employer conduct that involves the use of coercion or threats during the commission of serious contraventions of the Fair Work Act in relation to temporary overseas workers; and making it easier for workers to recover unpaid wages from employers and directors of responsible companies.


Having said that, I won't use all the time available to me, in the interests of trying to get on with the job of getting this bill done in a proper way. But, as I say, a number of these exploitation issues go across the economy. We support this bill with amendments. Quite frankly, the bill is better than nothing, and on that basis I commend it to the chamber.

"McCarthy, Sen Malarndirri",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (13:50):  I'm pleased to talk about the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017 today to highlight a group of vulnerable workers in Australia who are paid less than the minimum wage and aren't covered by the Fair Work Act. They don't have federal occupational health and safety protections or workers compensation and they can't take annual leave, sick leave or carers leave. They don't get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. More than 33,000 workers, because that's what they are, come under the Community Development Program. Of the 33,000, 31,000, or 94 per cent, are Indigenous, mainly living in regional and remote Australia. Because of where they live, and because they are mainly Aboriginal, these workers are out of sight and out of mind for the majority of Australians. This policy forces the overwhelmingly Indigenous population of remote communities into labour with none of the benefits of employment enjoyed by every other Australian worker.


The union movement is deeply committed to ending this discriminatory CDP policy. Kara Keys from the ACTU described it by saying:


This is a program which discriminates on the basis of race, and has no place in a modern society.


The ACTU looks forward to a future in which all Australian workers are treated equally, Indigenous people are not treated as second-class workers and are given the same opportunities and rights at work that any Australian worker rightfully expects.


The First Nations Workers Alliance has been launched to give a voice to this group of workers, a group who often don't have a voice, let alone a national presence. I will say a bit about CDP. Participants undertake activities, including hygiene classes, T-shirt dyeing and art making. Some participants have described this aspect of CDP as taking part in adult child care. There is very little of community development in the approach. Participants can also spend up to six months in a workplace, which the government describes as a long-term work experience opportunity. Basically, though, it's a pool of free labour for employers to access in remote areas, and those employers have none of the responsibilities that we would normally expect to their employees. The First Nations Workers Alliance is campaigning for wage justice, an issue that is at the heart of the labour movement. I congratulate the ACTU and the union movement across the board for their support of the First Nations Workers Alliance.


On the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, Labor stands with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to recommit to delivering a greater say on issues that affect their lives. It is a day that we celebrated only recently. We've made it clear we support enshrining an Indigenous voice in our Constitution, because for too long First Australians have been excluded from the nation's birth certificate. Labor is committed to advancing the recommendations from the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the Referendum Council's report. Labor has clearly outlined a bipartisan parliamentary process to make this recognition a reality. We are committed to deliver practical, community-driven measures to help close the gap for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in every part of our national life, from education and employment to justice, housing and health. That's why we worked to set up the current Senate committee that is looking into the CDP.


I take this opportunity to thank all those organisations and individuals who've made submissions and will give evidence in the coming weeks to this inquiry. I'd like to share some of what people have already submitted. Mr Dereck Harris is chair of the Ngaanyatjarra Council, which delivers services to remote communities in WA just across the NT border. He makes it clear what happened when CDP replaced the old community development employment program: 'We feel the government stole our self-respect when CDP was taken away, and we will sink lower if we're forced to go on the healthy welfare card.'


People worked for CDEP because they got paid money, but under CDP they come in because they don't want their pay to get stopped. It is a punitive system that is clearly discriminatory, does nothing to foster job development and employment, exploits workers and fails to develop and empower remote communities socially or economically. This legislation is better than nothing, but being better than nothing does not make it as good as it could have been. It offers limited protections to vulnerable workers but, I suspect, nothing at all to our most vulnerable workers: those on CDP living in remote areas.

Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (13:56):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise through the Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party on behalf of the people of Queensland to support the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Vulnerable Workers) Bill 2017, protecting unpaid workers and other vulnerable workers. My focus is on two aspects. I will start with the problems this bill addresses, and there are four main problems.


First, we have seen reports of the deliberate and widespread underpayment of workers. These have been too common in Australia. Allegations of underpayment have been raised in relation to major corporations 7-Eleven, Muffin Break, Gloria Jean's, Subway, Caltex, Domino's and Pizza Hut and their franchises. Second, this conduct by certain businesses is enabled by inadequate penalties and ineffective laws which fail to deter law-breaking and make worker exploitation difficult for the regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman, to prove. The ALP was responsible for creating the Fair Work Act. Third, underpayment of workers is unfair for workers but also for competing small businesses who do the right thing and face higher costs because they are complying with the law. Fourth, when someone abuses their power, whether it be union bosses intimidating small businesses or dodgy employers exploiting vulnerable workers, the government must and should take action.


So the solutions in this bill as we see them are targeting serious contraventions and making franchisors and holding companies accountable. The bill as we understand it will, firstly, amend the Fair Work Act to increase penalties by 10 times for serious contraventions of payment related protections in the Fair Work Act. This will apply when contraventions are systemic and deliberate. The bill will raise penalties for record-keeping requirements to make them consistent with penalties for underpayment of workers.


Secondly, it will outlaw cashback and other coercive behaviour by employers where employees may be paid correctly but then forced by their employer to repay part of their wages.


Thirdly, it will hold franchisors and holding companies responsible for underpayments where they should have known about them but failed to take reasonable steps to prevent them. We have also checked to make sure that, with regard to the varying franchisee/franchisor relationships, people who are not responsible won't be made accountable. This will hold accountable only those who are indeed responsible for payments.


Fourthly, it will strengthen investigation of underpayments by giving the Fair Work Ombudsman effective evidence-gathering powers and outlawing the provision of false and misleading information and the hindering and obstruction of inspectors who carry out investigations into compliance with the Fair Work Act.


It's quite clear, from the experience that many Australians have had and from the media reports, that these are urgently needed and necessary plugs in holes in Labor's Fair Work Act. While these are welcome, sadly, it only looks at one side of what makes workers vulnerable: underpayment. And I want to speak on behalf of vulnerable workers, because, including workers—

Given the Deputy Prime Minister is a citizen of New Zealand, can the minister confirm his situation is black and white?

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:03):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Regional Development (Senator Nash) and the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators Watt and Chisholm today relating to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Joyce).


Colleagues, today we had a government that excelled to new heights in the parody that they have become. They are a government that are simply losing it. There is no other description for it. If you look at the performance of Mr Turnbull, Mr Pyne, Senator Brandis and, regrettably, Ms Bishop, you would say to yourself that the government have lost the plot. They have turned themselves into a parody.


Really, the central political strategy of this government at the moment is the 'Kiwis under the bed' scare campaign—hyperventilating and yelling about those dangerous Kiwis under our beds, that dangerous foreign interference. I hate to break it to them, but, you know, this is the New Zealand that is the 'NZ' in Anzac. I know we're very grumpy about the fact the we haven't won the Bledisloe Cup since 2002—




Senator Payne:
  Oh shush!




Senator WONG:
  'Oh shush'—yes, I know. I ask: when did we last win at Eden Park? Apparently it was in 1986, so reflect upon how long ago that was. I know there are things which are upsetting in the bilateral relationship, but really, this 'Kiwis under the bed' daft line that this government has come up with is laughable—except that it is more than laughable; it is much worse.


I am extremely disappointed in my colleague, Ms Bishop—who, despite our differences, I do think is a credible and hardworking foreign minister—who was presumably sent out today to launch an extraordinary partisan attack on our friends across the Tasman. It really was an extraordinary attack. She managed to attack both the government, by refusing to believe the Minister of Internal Affairs when he said that this issue of Mr Joyce's citizenship had been raised at their end by the media—she refused to believe him—and then she attacked the New Zealand Labour Party. It is really an extraordinarily disappointing thing that we have an Australian foreign minister who has been prepared, and/or has been sent out—it reflects badly on either the Prime Minister or on her—to risk relations with our close friend and ally, simply to distract attention from the crisis that is facing the government.


It is an extraordinary attack, and I would ask the government—I understand that they are very upset about Mr Joyce failing to do his paperwork—to reflect on the wisdom of using the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this way, and reflect on being prepared to risk our relationship with our very close friend New Zealand, in order to distract attention from the domestic political travails of the government. It is immature, it is childish and it is not the act of a mature government. Frankly, it is not the act of a mature Prime Minister. It really demonstrates this Prime Minister's glass jaw.


Of course—news flash—the Labor Party is actually not responsible for Barnaby Joyce's dad being a New Zealander. I know that might come as a surprise to a government that likes to blame the Australian Labor Party for everything, but we're actually not responsible for the fact that his dad's a New Zealander.


It has been a most unwise strategy from the Prime Minister and his senior ministers, including Senator Brandis, today. They have been prepared to attack others overseas and to risk an important bilateral relationship, simply in order to try and distract attention from the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister is a New Zealand citizen. The government would have been far better to have responded in a serious and mature fashion. Instead, we have what can only be described as a completely daft strategy of running a 'Kiwis under the bed' defence. What I say to the government on this is: grow up. I think the Australian people would look most dimly on the way in which you have sought to hyperventilate and sought to attack an important relationship because of your political problems. It is an immature and childish approach from this government, and it is one that really does no cabinet minister, no foreign minister and certainly not the Prime Minister any credit.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-08-15,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:08):  New Zealand, of course, is a very close friend and ally of Australia, and we make no attack on the New Zealand government. We make no criticism of New Zealand. We make no attack on the relationship—of course we do not. Credible and hardworking though you may consider Ms Bishop to be as foreign minister, Senator Wong, I'm afraid, after that contribution, the same compliment cannot be returned to you because, although New Zealand is a close friend and ally, of whose government and of whom we make no criticism whatever, nevertheless, it is a foreign nation, and if Senator Wong, who is supposed to be the shadow foreign minister, cannot understand that there is something extremely inappropriate about the Australian Labor Party using, in an underhand and devious way, the internal political processes of a foreign country, albeit a friendly foreign country, to subvert Australian political processes then she is not fit to be the shadow foreign minister. The view that I express is a view shared by none other than the Prime Minister of New Zealand himself, Mr Bill English, who a short while ago in answer to a question in the New Zealand parliament had this to say: 'These are serious issues, to interfere in another country's politics, and it appears that there has been a serious misjudgement by the member's fellow opposition party.' The member he was referring to, Chris Hipkins, is a close associate of members of the Australian Labor Party. The fellow opposition party to which Mr Bill English was referring was none other than the Australian Labor Party. 


The fact is that the issue of the citizenship of Mr Joyce is a legitimate matter for parliamentary debate in Australia. The government, in an extremely forthright manner, itself put this question onto the agenda. Nobody had the faintest inkling that Mr Joyce was going to rise in the House of Representatives at 10 am yesterday to indicate that he had been advised the previous Thursday by the New Zealand High Commission that they considered that he may be a citizen, by descent from his father, of New Zealand. He was under no pressure to do so, but he did, because having become aware of that matter it was his instinct as an honourable man to put the matter into the public arena and take the appropriate course, which he did. And, ever since, in the last 28 hours or so, the Australian Labor Party has done nothing but play politics with the matter.


We now know that, in pursuing their political vendetta against the Deputy Prime Minister, they have chosen not only to debate the matter here, or in the other place, or in the Australian media; they have also interfered in the processes of the New Zealand parliament by an underhand conspiracy with Mr Chris Hipkins, a New Zealand Labour member of Australia and an associate of various Australian Labor Party members of the parliament—including, by the way, Mr Perrett, the member for Moreton, our colleague Senator Catryna Bilyk from Tasmania and others.


You don't do that. You just don't do that. You don't use the processes of another country—you don't interfere in the processes of another country—to pursue a political campaign in Australia to try to bring down the Australian government. I am shocked at Senator Wong; I thought she was smarter than that. What is really revealing is that neither she nor her colleagues seem to grasp the significance of this behaviour. They seek to ridicule, they seek to belittle, but they don't grasp the significance of foreign interference in New Zealand and using New Zealand's parliamentary processes to prosecute an Australian argument.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (15:13):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to follow the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I will direct a number of my remarks to the incredible double standards he is displaying in his response to the situation that now confronts the Deputy Prime Minister. Both yesterday in question time and today again, we have seen an extraordinary position taken by Senator Brandis, the first law officer of this country, who you would think would go out of his way to ensure that the law of this country and our Constitution was upheld. Instead, he is doing his usual twisting and turning—evasion—to try to preserve whatever remains of his government's political honour.


I had a look back at some of the comments that Senator Brandis made in question time yesterday, which he went on to repeat today. In answer to Senator Cameron's question about what the difference was between the situation Senator Canavan found himself in before—properly—standing aside and the one the Deputy Prime Minister now faces, Senator Brandis said:


There are obvious factual and legal differences between the two cases.


He didn't want to comment about what they were. He said:


Suffice it to say that, when acquainted with the situation on 25 July and on the basis of his understanding of the facts at that time, Senator Canavan decided that he would prefer to stand down. The facts of Mr Joyce's case are much clearer to us than were the facts as known to Senator Canavan at the time he made his decision.


I was shocked when I heard Senator Brandis make those comments. In essence, his argument was and seems to remain, based on his comments today, that in Senator Canavan's case the facts and the situation were unclear and, therefore, the right thing for him to do was to stand down from his ministry, while in the Deputy Prime Minister's case the facts are very clear—that he is a dual citizen, that he is a citizen of New Zealand—but for some reason he should remain in office as Deputy Prime Minister of this country.


Surely, if anything, it would be exactly the opposite. Surely, if anything, if a minister's situation is crystal clear, as is the case with the Deputy Prime Minister, that minister should be standing down immediately. It should be the minister whose situation is unclear who might just have an argument that he should remain in his position while the situation is clarified by the court. But instead we have the first law officer of this country getting up and trying to argue exactly the opposite. All I can hope—




Senator Brandis:
  Because the facts clearly establish that.




Senator WATT:
  I will take Senator Brandis's interjection. He's maintaining this argument that the facts are clear, in the Deputy Prime Minister's case, that he is a New Zealander. He is 100 per cent New Zealand, and yet he can continue to serve in this government. The fact that the Deputy Prime Minister remains in office, and the fact that we have the Attorney-General and every other minister defending the right of the Deputy Prime Minister to remain in that position, not only shows the great illegitimacy in their government but also shows exactly how beholden the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister are to the National Party to remain in office.


Senator Brandis's other comments yesterday, in answer to a question from Senator Wong, were even more absurd. Senator Wong asked Senator Brandis:


Can the minister advise the Senate which of these 'factual and legal differences' requires one minister to stand aside but permits another to continue?


Senator Brandis responded:


With respect, Senator Wong, it's not which factual and legal differences that is the point. The point is that there are factual and legal differences …


This is absurd. He is smiling. Even Senator Brandis acknowledges the humour in the remarks that he's making by smiling about the comments he's made.




Senator Brandis:
  Point of order, Deputy President.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you—



Senator Brandis interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Brandis, please wait for the call. And that is not a point of order.




Senator Brandis:
  May I have the call?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Yes.




Senator Brandis:
  I was laughing at Senator Watt's stupidity.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  That is not a point of order.




Senator WATT:
  Oh, Senator Brandis, it's always good to be in the chamber with you. All I can say is that I really hope that Senator Canavan and Mr Joyce have both made sure they have better counsel who can make better arguments before the High Court than the arguments that Senator Brandis has put forward today. I would be happy to put around the can and take up a bit of a collection to make sure they can get themselves better lawyers and better counsel than Senator Brandis, should he be intending to appear for them.


And today we've had it go even further. I thought that Julie Bishop, the foreign minister, was having a bad day today already, but her day got a lot worse when she turned to her robust ally Senator Brandis to defend her position. You know as a minister you are in deep, deep, deep trouble when it's Senator Brandis who has to come out here and defend your position, and that's what we saw from Senator Brandis today. I'm waiting for Senator Brandis to declare war on New Zealand. This ridiculous rhetoric that is coming out of his mouth, and every other minister's mouth, should stop immediately.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:18):  It's with some sadness that I see and note and have to say that the Labor Party clearly have no idea of foreign matters and seek to trivialise very, very serious matters. It's like Senator Dastyari, when talking about the prospective major terrorist attack on an airline travelling out of Australia, equating it to his book being of halal standard. This is the Labor Party all over. They don't understand foreign affairs, and clearly none of the speakers who have spoken today, including, regrettably, the person who on a change of government would be foreign minister—and God forgive us that that may ever happen—understand what it's all about when an Australian parliamentarian like Mr Shorten can't prosecute his attacks or his vendettas within the Australian political scene but chooses to go to a foreign country to try to make a political point.


We are indeed fortunate in this country to have someone of the calibre of Julie Bishop as our foreign minister. She is universally recognised as a great foreign minister, and she continues to do that day by day. We're also extremely fortunate in Australia to have an Attorney-General of the capability and learning of Senator Brandis. In spite of the Labor Party's strange vendetta against Senator Brandis, continuing to bring up Senate inquiries into matters involving Senator Brandis, each one of those inquiries has clearly demonstrated that Senator Brandis has at all occasions discharged his duties in accordance with the law and extremely capably.


This is a sad day for the Australian parliament when an Australian political leader resorts to a foreign country to mount a political attack within Australia. As was said in question time, we know Mr Shorten has loyalty to very few—certainly not to the union members, $100,000 of whose money it appears he stole to give to a political party. Certainly not—




Senator McAllister:
  Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: I have been listening to Senator Macdonald's contribution. I believe that the imputation that he just made about Mr Shorten is in contradiction of the standing orders, which forbid senators from reflecting on people in the other place.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I heard the comment. Senator Macdonald, I would ask you to withdraw, please, and please continue your remarks.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  Whatever it is you want me to withdraw, I will. But, Madam Deputy President, I'm always encouraged that, whenever I speak and particularly when I start exposing some truths about the Australian Labor Party, one of their members will take a point of order. I'm gratified by that, because it always shows to me and anyone listening to this broadcast that you're on the right track.


It's clearly been exposed in question time today that Mr Shorten refuses to answer whether he had authority to give $100,000 of his union members' money to a political party. We know Mr Shorten lacks any sense of loyalty to anyone—anyone close to him, anyone far from him, anyone in the political sense or anyone in Australian life generally. That is of course why Mr Shorten's standing in the opinion polls continues to plummet, and it's why we all know as experienced politicians that it won't be long before Mr Albanese makes the challenge to Mr Shorten's leadership. I hope he doesn't, because, from a political point of view, we would much rather have Mr Shorten as our opponent at the next election. But clearly those in the Labor Party are petrified at Mr Shorten leading them to the next election. We only await, with bated breath, Mr Shorten coming clean and answering some of the questions that have been raised about his use—or misuse, might I say—of the money that he had control over as the leader of the Australian Workers' Union.


This is a sad day for the Australian parliament. It's again demonstrated by the alternative foreign minister that they have no idea of foreign affairs or propriety. (Time expired)

Senator CHISHOLM
 (Queensland) (15:25):  I, too, wish to speak about the dysfunction we're seeing from the government on section 44 of the Constitution. I think that Senator Wong outlined the ridiculousness of the arguments the government have been putting around the Kiwis under the bed. My colleague Senator Watt highlighted the inconsistencies from the legal arguments we have seen from those opposite, particularly from the Attorney-General, George Brandis. We have seen Senator Canavan stand aside, but Barnaby Joyce, in the other house, refuses to do the same thing.


I think the important thing here is the dysfunction that the government have and the impact it is having on Australian families. That is something no-one has touched on yet; certainly, Senator Macdonald went nowhere near this. Let me talk about some of the issues that the government aren't dealing with because they are consumed about their own survival and increasingly desperate, as we have seen with their attacks today.


Let's talk about power prices. We hear a lot of those opposite come in and say that this is the most important issue, but what are they actually doing on it? We have seen no progress on this important issue, particularly when it comes to the clean energy target, in recent weeks. It is not even up for discussion from them in their caucus so far. We know that there is a war between the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister around the clean energy target. We want to see who is declared the winner. But in the meantime Australian families are paying more for power because of their inaction. The Labor Party are on the record saying we're willing to talk. We're willing to meet and compromise to bring in a clean energy target to provide certainty, but we see dysfunction and chaos on the other side. They are incapable of solving the issue.


Another issue close to my heart is the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. That is the fund that has not funded one single project. We know that the previous minister for this, Senator Canavan, has stood aside. The current minister responsible is the Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce, who is now also under a cloud. The people of northern Australia are crying out for jobs, as Senator Macdonald well knows, but because of the dysfunction of this government not one project has been funded. There will probably be more delays because of the change in ministers we've had, and we will probably end up with another change in the ministry soon.


I spoke last night about the National Broadband Network. There is a growing crisis in the community with regard to people switching onto the NBN, with slow speeds and frustration around resolving problems. All we get from this lacklustre government and the lacklustre minister is lip-service about these problems. The Australian people have had enough, and increasingly they're blaming this government for the dysfunction of the NBN.


Another issue which is really important, particularly in Queensland, is the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements following Tropical Cyclone Debbie. Again, we see the dysfunction of the government. They are not making the adequate contribution to match the state government's funding of the important recovery projects that we see in Mackay, the Whitsundays and Rockhampton. The mayors are all on side with this. They are the ones calling for the government to come to the party to match the state government funding to ensure these communities can rebuild effectively, but the government have abandoned those communities. Minister Keenan will not even go back and visit those places. It is an absolutely shameful period, where George Christensen, the member for Dawson, has not put his shoulder to the wheel to solve this problem.


Again, there is an issue that was just discussed at question time today: the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. The Leader of the Government in the Senate didn't even have a brief. This is an important issue that was highlighted in the media—the theft of water with regard to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—and the Leader of the Government in the Senate didn't even have a brief. That's how seriously they're treating the issue. They're happy to abandon the people who rely on the Murray-Darling Basin as well. But the opposition are going to put a focus on this, hopefully through a Senate inquiry, to get to the bottom of what is going on. At least one party in here will take this seriously.


So what we have highlighted here is the ongoing dysfunction of this government over section 44, but, more importantly, the negative impact that dysfunction is having on Australian families when it comes to issues like power prices, the NBN and jobs in regional Queensland. It is a disgraceful period for this government.

That the Senate—


(a) notes:


   (i) the importance of women and girls managing their menstruation hygienically, with confidence, dignity and without stigma,


   (ii) that women and girls without access to menstrual hygiene products resort to using newspaper, rolled up toilet paper, rags and leaves,

   (iv) the discussion paper from the University of Queensland and WaterAid Australia, published in July 2017, which noted the challenge of some girls in remote communities who are missing school each month due to a lack of products to enable menstrual hygiene management,


   (v) that Australian women earn on average $261.30 per week less than their male counterparts, and they are more likely to live below the poverty line,


   (vi) that period poverty is a significant issue for those who are already statistically at greater risk of being unable to afford basic essentials such as pads and tampons,


   (vii) that menstrual hygiene items are a necessity and access to these items is a right not a privilege,


   (viii) that it is unacceptable that any woman or girl in Australia should be unable to access menstrual hygiene items,


   (ix) that, in July 2017, the Scottish Government announced that it will distribute free menstrual hygiene items to those in need as part of a six-month pilot program in Aberdeen, Scotland,


   (x) that the pilot program is expected to provide more than one thousand disadvantaged women and girls free access to menstrual hygiene items at various locations including secondary schools, homeless shelters and foodbanks, and


   (xi) that a similar pilot program in Australia would represent the first step in developing a sensitive and dignified solution to making these products easily accessible to those who need them; and


(b) calls on the Government to fund an evaluated pilot program in low socio-economic areas around Australia based on the trial in Aberdeen, Scotland, where free menstrual hygiene items are being distributed to women and girls.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government opposes the motion. The calling into question of a senator's eligibility to sit in this place is a very serious step, and that step should only be taken in cases where there is a clear case to answer. The motion seeks to turn this long-accepted principle on its head, effectively calling into question every senator's position until he or she is able to provide conclusive proof of his or her citizenship status. That would constitute a wrong-headed reversal of the onus of proof, especially given the undoubted public interest in certainty for the composition of the parliament. Further, another referral would only add to the existing workloads of Senate committees, and the committee secretariats in particular.

Labor has taken a consistent approach on similar matters for several years. It reflects the past position of those opposite and the Australian Greens. Labor does not support reversing the onus of proof and requiring all senators to prove their eligibility where no question has arisen. However, where the public record reveals serious credible doubts, the only appropriate resolution is through a referral to the one body that can make an authoritative determination—that is, the High Court of Australia.

  Australia is consistently ranked by Transparency International as one of the least corrupt countries in the world. The government takes a zero-tolerance approach to corruption in all its forms.

A robust multiagency approach is preferable to creating an entirely new agency. The establishment of a national integrity commission would not better guarantee protection against corruption. No single overarching body should be responsible for tackling corruption. By dispersing responsibility, accountability increases.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:09):  It's quite clear that the Turnbull government has failed Australian families. When we look at the latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey we can see that there are growing levels of financial stress and inequality, and we are confronted with a government that either wants to pretend that the issue doesn't exist or, alternatively, comes up with ideologically-driven and misguided policies to address the issue but which ultimately end up being counterproductive.


We know that in July this year the Treasurer actually denied that inequality was getting worse. He actually came out and tried to argue the point on that. But we know that if a problem is identified by Labor, it's as if this government wants to say that night is day and day is night. What they're doing is applying out-of-touch thinking, and basically coming up with ideologically-driven and counterproductive measures, as I said.


We know that inequality is a real issue for our country. We only succeed when we succeed together. We won't see economic growth unless Australians—ordinary Australians—feel confident to spend and invest for the future. I never thought I'd see the day when we had the Reserve Bank of Australia governor coming out and saying that we have record household debt and low wage rises which are hurting the national economy, and calling on workers to demand higher pay rises in order to stimulate the economy. So when we have the Reserve Bank governor coming out and saying that sort of thing, it's incumbent on our federal government to take note and to try to come up with policies which address these issues.


We have household debt at the level of 189 per cent of GDP, amongst the highest in the world. So we have a huge issue, but what does the Treasurer say about that? In March of this year, the Treasurer actually said that low wage growth was the Australian economy's biggest challenge—which was a promising start, and at least on that occasion the Treasurer seemed to grasp that there is a problem with low wage growth. But what does this government do about the issue of low wage growth? Well, it hoes into the earnings of those who are amongst the lowest paid in our workforce. How is that any way to address the issue of low wages growth? Of course, what I'm referring to there is the Fair Work Commission's decision to cut penalty rates. That decision stands, and at the moment is on track to be inflicted on Australian workers—particularly in the retail and hospitality areas—whilst this government stands idly by, twiddling its thumbs and waiting for something to happen.


On the other hand, the Labor opposition under Mr Shorten has made our position crystal clear on this. For the benefit of those listening, I think it is always worthwhile reminding people that in the first 100 days of a Shorten Labor government, the government will take steps to legislate to restore penalty rates that have been cut under the Fair Work Commission decision. That is a very clear direction; it is a very clear policy measure to overcome the level of stress and inequality that's being experienced by Australian families.


On the other side we just see internal squabbling and policy paralysis, which is not good for our country. Australian families deserve to have a government which is focused on them, with laser-like precision. They want a government that is going to care about the pressures that Australian families are feeling. At the moment, the only pressure that the government seems to be responding to is its own internal questions about citizenship and a whole range of other issues which are distracting and not in the interests of getting the problems sorted out.


The McKell Institute has done a lot of work in relation to the impact of the penalty rates decision, and I want to go to that very quickly. I want to highlight the fact that there are some regional electorates which are worse impacted by the penalty rates cut. Some regional electorates stand to lose up to $21 million in disposable income. Regional and rural economies are subject to losing approximately $289.5 million when, as the McKell Institute says, businesses shift money previously allocated to labour costs within these regions into other jurisdictions. We know that in these regional areas retail and hospitality industries employ close to 20 per cent of the working population. Generally, a higher proportion of the rural and regional workforce is employed in retail and hospitality than the urban workforce. The data seems to suggest that a quarter of a million people will be impacted negatively solely by the Sunday rate cuts. This will concurrently affect the local economies.


Of course, the resultant lack of spending is hardly good for local communities and their economies, and all the while we're exacerbating the pressures and stresses that Australians are feeling, particularly in regional areas. One of the parts of Queensland I like to visit as often as I can is the federal electorate of Flynn, which has 2,884 retail workers and 2,458 hospitality workers. That, together with pharmacy and fast food, adds up to 5,800 workers potentially affected by the penalty rates cuts. Total income loss to the community is something of the order of $14 million from the federal electorate of Flynn. This is in an area of Queensland which is already struggling with a range of other factors, and on top of that we have disposable income being ripped out of the local economy. It's very hard to understand how that can be good for improving the situation of Australian families.


With the record-low wage growth that I talked about, we know that the government has failed to deliver for Australians. The HILDA Survey shows that median household and annual disposable income has declined for the past few years and reinforces the comments from the RBA governor that I talked about earlier. The survey has highlighted the fact that home ownership is getting out of reach. The survey shows that, for couples with dependent children, home ownership has fallen from 55.5 per cent in 2002 to 38.6 per cent in 2014.


What's this government's response to the issue of home ownership and housing affordability in general? Basically it rejects Labor's propositions in respect of negative gearing and capital gains tax and has come up with quite a strange policy which taps into superannuation and is entitled the First Home Super Saver Scheme. There is no legislation in place, but it's already out there. The ATO is sounding a warning to those people who may be contributing to their super accounts to try to take advantage of this scheme. The ATO is saying, 'We are unable to comment on policy that is yet to be enacted by the government.' This would appear to be another epic fail in a scheme that not only will not fix the housing affordability crisis but in the process and for good measure will undermine superannuation. We noted that, earlier this year, the Financial Services Council, normally the cheer squad for the government, has come out and made the point that tinkering with superannuation would undermine public confidence in superannuation.


So there are a range of findings in this report that show that action does need to be taken to address financial stress and inequality. When it comes to incomes, employment outcomes, home ownership, retirement and childcare, this government has failed to deliver. Labor has led the debate in all of these areas. We look after the interests of ordinary people, giving them a fair go with a decent safety net.

"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-08-15,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (16:19):  I'm not quite sure that it's a pleasure to rise to speak on this debate, but I will speak nonetheless, and I thank the proposer of this matter of public importance, Senator Gallagher, for bringing it on. We have another day of debate around demonising those who wish to try and do well and creating a little bit of the politics of envy around what's happening in this country, while at the same time just blaming the government for all of it. That sounds great in a short speech in a debate that seven people across Australia are listening to, but we really have to get out into reality and check the facts on these things.


The disappointing thing, though, after listening to Senator Ketter's contribution and the contributions to the similar debates we've had this week and last week, is that nowhere in there is there anything about nurturing aspiration, encouraging growth and trying to get people to try to do things for themselves. It's all about trying to flatten out society and to create a base—almost a socialist approach to policy—which, I have to say, is very disappointing. These token ideas that are put forward are not going to do what the opposition claim they will. There is this idea of addressing what they're calling inequality in this nation. What about dealing with things like cost-of-living pressures? What about the equal opportunity to get a job? Instead, if you take the policies of the opposition, they prefer to stifle businesses from investing and stifle them when it comes to growth and employing more Australians to actually contribute to the economy—preventing Australians from trying to put away for their future, invest, save and create a better environment for their own kids as they get older.


I point to policies in terms of job creation and helping young people get jobs, which is important in regional communities particularly—I think Senator Polley would agree—like the Youth Jobs PaTH Program, which is targeted at helping young people get jobs. It is this novel idea of trying to get people who want to work to work. I think we should be providing that opportunity for everyone. That's what programs like this are targeted at. They are real programs which will deliver real results and hopefully create employment opportunities for young people.


No-one in this chamber or anywhere across the country denies that there aren't people who are doing it tough. That's not what this is about. Everyone has to acknowledge that there are people who are doing it tough, but to conflate the issue of people doing it tough with the notion that people shouldn't be doing any better is not the right way to go about it. To suggest that people will only improve their standard of living if we bring down the top end and tax them more heavily is absolutely the wrong approach, in my view.


The Turnbull government has done a lot when it comes to assisting those in need and providing essential services through things like the NDIS and increased education funding, providing those essential services which will help people—students and those with a disability—to contribute to society. The budget that we brought down earlier this year does that. You have to look at the Tasmanian government as well. After the last three years, under the leadership of Premier Will Hodgman, the state's now heading in the right direction, with job growth of 10,000 new jobs since the 2014 state election. That's good news for our state—and I think again that Senator Polley would agree.




Senator Polley:
  No, I disagree, because they're not in regional Tasmania.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I'll take that interjection. Senator Polley thinks that 10,000 jobs, in terms of growth, is not good news, which is disappointing to hear.


But we should be here as a government to assist those who wish to work hard, who wish to contribute to the economy and who wish to see Australia become a better place. Sometimes that requires incentivising growth—people taking risks and people wanting to do better for themselves. I don't think we should demonise wealth. I don't think we should demonise people who wish to do a little better for themselves. This is something that I've referred to before. There's no talk from the opposition or indeed from the crossbench—or at least some of the crossbench—when it comes to nurturing aspiration. I've not heard one opposition senator talk about the need to encourage young people to want to do better for themselves, to start a business, to invest, to build a home, to employ others and to make sure that when their kids come into the world they're going to have a better life and should be encouraged to do the same.


I recently had the good fortune to travel with my wife to visit some relatives in the United States. One thing I noticed was the difference in culture and attitude towards enterprise. The people there want to take a risk and invest their money. The people there desire a better standard of living—a better home and a better car. I don't think that's a bad thing. You don't see there the envy that gets thrown around the place in Australia, where people say it is bad that a person drives an expensive car or lives in a big house, that they shouldn't have it because that person over there doesn't have it. I don't think that's the right attitude. Instead, I believe we should be encouraging people to aspire to that themselves. In this country we have every opportunity to do that, and we should be encouraging people to do that. I don't believe wealth creation should be something people are ashamed of, and it's not something we should be preventing people from doing—in particular, young people.


I would reiterate that things are going well in terms of opportunities for people to secure employment and save for the future. There were 240,000 jobs created in the last financial year, the largest increase in employment since before the GFC a decade ago. That is great news. So people are going to have the opportunity to get a job, pay their bills and put money away for the future. If you listen to Senator Ketter, and to some of the contributions in similar debates in previous days, it's all about taxing the top end and clamping down on negative gearing. I'm not sure how many senators and members in this place have multiple investment properties. I don't think that's a bad thing if they do. If over the course of their working lives they have managed to acquire property, to invest, to put something away for their retirement, well done to them. But it sends the wrong message when they come in here and say it's bad that properties are negatively geared and we have to clamp down on those people who do that.


The Productivity Commission found in 2015 that 40 per cent of families paid no net tax—once transfer payments such as family tax benefit are taken into account. Contrast that with the top 10 per cent of income earners, who pay almost 50 per cent of the personal income tax received by the Australian government. The top one per cent of individuals pay a staggering 17 per cent of all tax received and the top 0.3 per cent of individuals pay 58 per cent of the capital gains tax. They're paying a decent amount of government revenue. To me, it looks like they're doing a fair share of the heavy lifting when it comes to paying tax.


But Australians know that increasing taxes does not increase wages; as we have said many times over, it stifles growth. So I would call on my colleagues on the other side to alter their thinking on this. Don't adopt the socialist and, to a degree, communist way and try to prevent people from growing their personal wealth. Look to foster growth and 'nurture aspiration'. I look forward to Senator Polley's contribution on this, to see how many times she talks about 'nurturing aspiration' in the state of Tasmania, where young people want to make a go of things and have a better future.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-08-15,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:28):  This is an issue I've talked about in this chamber on many occasions. In fact, I chaired a Senate inquiry that found that inequality in this country is getting worse. It distresses me greatly to hear this discussion being juvenilised down to 'the politics of envy'. Try telling that to young people who are being locked out of the housing market. In the HILDA survey, if you read the chapter on housing, it's quite distressing when you look at the impacts the current system is having on young home owners. I know many young people who think they will never be able to afford to buy a house. In this country, not only are we dealing with growing income inequality, we're also dealing with wealth inequality, and that's an issue that particularly plays out on young people and those people who are trying to address those issues of inequality, who are trying to find work and who are trying to find accommodation.


We have a system that favours cashed-up landlords who outbid young people who are trying to buy houses. They keep pushing the price up and up so that young people can't afford to buy those houses. And that's because, guess what? Wealth inequality means that the bulk of the wealth, or a large amount of the wealth, is actually owned by a small proportion of people who then lobby government to set the rules. They lobby government really, really hard about not changing negative gearing, about not changing capital gains, about not changing issues around trusts and about not wanting to have banking royal commissions. For example, they use that wealth not just to acquire more wealth, making the community more unequal, but they also use it to lobby government. And then—you guessed it!—government senators come in here and they say, 'Oh, that's the politics of envy!' The fact is that the rules in this country specifically entrench inequality.


The same government—the politics-of-envy government—who talk about nurturing young people's endeavour are the ones who also wanted to condemn young people to living on thin air for six months. And then, when they couldn't get that through this place, they wanted to make them live on thin air for four weeks. They're the same ones who refuse to acknowledge that income support in this country is too low. In fact, they go out of their way to vilify people who are living below the poverty line on inadequate income support payments—inadequate Newstart payments and inadequate youth allowance payments that further inequality.


While I'm on this subject, this is why I was greatly distressed on Monday when this chamber voted down our efforts to increase Newstart. I've been campaigning in this place for over five years—longer than that—to increase those base rates of Newstart and youth allowance. Five years ago—actually, nearly 5½ years ago—I lived for a short time on Newstart to try to raise awareness of the issues and just to feel what it was like living on Newstart. And we are still campaigning to get an increase.


We knew then it was below the poverty line. When you get big business and community organisations agreeing that Newstart is too low and that it contributes to people living below the poverty line, you actually must realise that there is a problem. That's why I was really upset when the Labor Party said that what we'll have is another review of whether Newstart is actually adequate or not. Actually, that review could be just going out and finding the nearest five or six people who are living on Newstart and asking them whether they think it's adequate or not, because it's not! It is not an answer to the issues to just have another review; it's to commit to Newstart. So, besides coming along where the Greens went on negative gearing, on capital gains tax, on trusts and on the banking royal commission, how about following us down the line of agreeing to increase Newstart and youth allowance? Make a commitment to do one of the quickest things you can do to address the issues of poverty and inequality. We agree! We were out there leading the debate on inequality a long time ago. Agree that one of the ways you can address inequality is to increase Newstart and youth allowance. Then let's look at what other amendments we need to make—and they are to make some significant changes to our social safety net, to see how we can have a system that addresses the issues of the 21st century. There is no doubt that things need to change. I support this ongoing issue of inequality— (Time expired)

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:33): Well, this government is at war with the young, from cuts to education funding through to a deliberate attempt to sabotage any meaningful action on climate change. This government shows every time that the only thing it cares about less than young people's present is their future. The only time that this government shows an interest in young people's futures is when it cries crocodile tears over the deficit to justify cuts to services.


The latest HILDA statistics show the toll that this war on the young has had on young Australians' economic prospects. We know that housing is one of the primary drivers of wealth, but young people are being locked out of the housing market. For many young people, the dream of home ownership is just that, a dream. From 2002 to 2014, home ownership for 25- to 29-year-olds dropped by a third. Professor Wilkins from the Melbourne Institute—the one the government likes to talk about—has said that one of the more concerning trends is a growing wealth divide by age group. It is very much connected to what is going on in the housing market. And what has the government proposed to do about it? Absolutely nothing.


It isn't just a question of wealth; it has other implications. Young people are being denied the freedoms and life experiences that their parents and their grandparents had. The number of men and women aged 22 to 25 who live with their parents is up: for men by 43 per cent and for women by 27 per cent, since 2001. These are not positive trends in our national life. Young people are earning less, and it is part of the reason that they're staying at home. Young people are paying more than ever before for their education, yet graduates are less likely to find work when they leave university, and they will be paid less if they do. Real earnings for bachelor-degree graduates declined 16 per cent between 2006 and 2014. Young people who obtain non-university qualifications when they finish school do even worse and young people who do not gain qualifications after school do worst of all.


I say to Senator Duniam, respectfully, as he waxes lyrical about aspiration and encouraging people to put just a little more away to build something for their future: fine sentiment from government senators is not enough. It is not enough to address the material impacts that policy decisions made by government are having on the young Australians that I know, because the truth is that none of these things are beyond the government's control. All of these things are being made worse by the government's inaction. All of them are being made worse by the government's punitive approach to people who may not be doing quite so well as them, who might not be so comfortable as them and the people that live around them in the leafy suburbs that they represent.


What have the government offered on wages? They've offered penalty rate cuts to young people, and they stood again and again against Labor's efforts to restore penalty rates to where they were previously. And who is affected? It is young people, who are far more likely to be working in casual roles and working irregular hours. What have they offered to the young unemployed? They have offered the PaTH internships, a completely inadequate and deficient response. Young people need real jobs with fair conditions, not faux internships with unfair wages.


What have they offered on wealth? They have refused to act on negative gearing and refused to act on capital gains tax, despite every expert in the country telling them it would make a difference. Their super for housing proposal, unbelievably, asks young people to literally mortgage their retirement in order to fund a home. For decades, part of our economic compact has been that each generation can hope to do better than the one that came before it. As the HILDA data demonstrates, young people's wealth and income are sliding, and they may be forgiven for thinking that the government have forgotten about them. I will say this: Labor hasn't. When this shambles opposite us finally comes to an end, young people's future will be a priority, not just a rhetorical debating point.

"Hume, Sen Jane",LP,2017-08-15,"



Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:38):  I rise today to speak in response to the matter of public importance submitted to the Senate by our parliamentary colleague from the ACT Senator Gallagher. Senator Gallagher would like the chamber to consider the growing levels of financial stress and inequality being experienced by Australian families, as revealed by the latest household, income and labour dynamics survey, the HILDA Survey.


I feel I need to apologise in advance to those who were here yesterday for what may be, potentially, a sense of deja vu, because it was only yesterday that I delivered an eerily similar refutation of Senator Wong's matter of public importance. My response is similar because, in spite of the opposition's hectoring, the government position has not changed in 24 hours. This government does indeed take the plight of working families very seriously. But rather than griping or wringing its hands, the Turnbull government is committed to delivering, has delivered and will continue to deliver genuine policy solutions and legislative change to ease the burden on Australian families.


I find the disingenuous opportunism of the Australian Labor Party on issues of inequality so galling. Senator Gallagher, like Senator Wong before her did yesterday, and countless others are uncritically following their leader's empty rhetoric on income inequality as an attempt to incite the corrosive politics of envy. In the absence of any substantive policy agenda, the Leader of the Opposition is attempting to use populist bombast to somehow prove the case for his socialist agenda. But the Leader of the Opposition should be warned: do not underestimate the intelligence of the Australian population.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  Australians are not fools, Senator Polley. They can see through the opportunism of an opposition desperate to overcome the entrenched personal unpopularity of their leader. The Australian electorate have seen the opposition leader, Mr Shorten, at work: disposing of Prime Minister after Prime Minister and selling out the members of his own union, the very people he was there to protect. The Australian people are far too smart to be duped by this rhetoric, which, quite simply, is a smokescreen for a radical redistribution agenda. Australians, while egalitarian and generous by nature, are naturally suspicious of socialist ideals that demand that, in order for someone to win, someone else must lose. Australians have resisted socialism before, and they will do so again and again and again at the ballot box, over and over.


Senator Gallagher should know better than to ignore the facts by trying to make the case for an increasingly unequal Australian society and by using statistics she clearly does not understand. While I am loath to use my time in this chamber to go into the dry economics of statistical measures of income inequality, I simply cannot stomach the continued perversion of the truth by those opposite to suit their political agenda. So, please, indulge me for just a moment. Senator Gallagher's reference to the HILDA Survey refers to a statistical measure called the Gini coefficient. It is a commonly used measure of inequality that ranges from zero to one. Zero means total equality and one means total inequality. So, zero is everyone on the same income and one is the equivalent of one person having all the income. The HILDA survey data shows that the Gini coefficient was 0.303 in 2000-01 and was 0.296 in 2014-15. In other words, it has in fact barely shifted. If anything, it has in fact decreased. So do those opposite fail to understand the information that they regurgitate? Or, instead, do they wilfully deceive the Australian people to serve their political agenda?


While those opposite are desperately grasping at mendacious opportunities for political advantage, the Turnbull government is actually doing the hard yards of policy development and implementation to deliver household savings to those families who need it most, to shore up the Australian economy for future years and to deliver its intergenerational responsibilities to the Australian families of the future. We have delivered a $2.5 billion investment in early childhood education and care. Almost one million families benefit from that, and low- to middle-income families are the greatest beneficiaries of that package. Only the Turnbull government has actually tackled the rising energy prices head-on by directly dealing with energy retailers. This will ensure that Australian families get a better deal. The Turnbull government is dealing directly with gas suppliers to ensure that Australian businesses and householders come first. And the Turnbull government has repealed the insidious limited merits review regime, introduced under Labor in 2008, that has cost Australian families millions of dollars in excessive energy bills for nearly a decade.


Finally, the Turnbull government has delivered relief to the small business community in the form of cuts to the corporate tax rates for small and medium-sized entities and maintained the instant asset write-off provisions to encourage investment by those businesses. This is a government that is committed to assisting the small business community to invest in growth, to pay their workers more and to put on more workers.


This is a government that takes the cost of living pressures seriously and a government committed to delivering for families and small businesses, not to squawking politically motivated slogans intent on emotionally dividing our nation into the haves and the have-nots. Australia remains one of the most wonderfully egalitarian and equal societies in the world. We have one of the most progressive tax systems in the OECD. The economic data has shown a decrease in measures of inequality, and yet the ALP persist with this disingenuous and perverse rhetoric of the politics of envy. While I thank Senator Gallagher for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate, I am content in dismissing it as the mere political stunt it is.

"Roberts, Sen Malcolm",PHON,2017-08-15,"



Senator ROBERTS
 (Queensland) (16:45):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to speak about reducing the cost of living for Aussie families and battlers because it's the core of One Nation policies. Most everything we do we hold against this measure: how will this reduce the cost of living for families and battlers? That's our measure.


We turn now to today's MPI, which at its heart talks about cost of living issues. Federal Labor leader Bill Shorten made a speech recently in which he claimed to the ALP faithful that inequality was, 'the biggest threat to our health as an economy and our cohesion as a society'. Inequality of wealth is certainly an economic phenomenon that must be considered by policymakers. The left, however, often revert to a view—usually to win an election—that wealth creation is unjust and inequitable. The opposite is the truth. Wealth creation and having sufficient and growing wealth is the sign of a healthy economy, not whether someone else has even more sufficient and growing wealth. Everyone deserves a fair go to make the most of life.


To put it another way, wealth creation in free markets is inherently win-win, not zero sum. Inequality only makes economic sense as one possible indicator that something may be askew with real net wealth, be it the levels, trend, distribution and, especially, sources of wealth. Real net wealth is not driven by inequality, but by factors such as real income and wages versus the real cost of living. The latter is partially and imperfectly measured by the consumer price index, which nevertheless clearly shows why poor and middle-class Aussies continue to struggle. Price inflation, as measured by the CPI, has been largely and shockingly accumulating like compound interest since the early 1970s.


Those on the right side of politics—the freedom side of politics—will, or at least should, be aware of the primary role that too many government interventions have in reducing real net wealth and the distribution of wealth. I will say that again: government interventions reduce real net wealth and the distribution of that wealth. Poor government intervention in markets is driving up prices across the economy and putting pressure on the cost of living of those that can least afford it. Key amongst these interventions are regulation, taxation and inflation of the money supply. Such interventions not only always reduce real wealth but always have distribution consequences and inefficiencies as well, whether intended or unintended. Let us remember the famous saying, 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions.' Regardless of intentions, most, if not all, government interventions eventually hurt the many to the benefit of the few. The many are the grassroots businesses, consumers, taxpayers and families of this country. The few are the elite lobbyists, activists, bureaucrats and politicians. The poster boy—or is it politically correct nowadays to instead say 'poster gender-fluid entity'?—for such interventions is the plethora of climate-related ones since 2007 and the all-too predictable impacts on electricity prices since then. The electricity CPI clearly shows what the story has been in the past decade. The small dip from 2013 to 2015 is the removal of the Gillard Labor-Greens carbon tax. The shocking rise in electricity CPI overall since 2008 has almost exclusively been driven by government regulations and taxpayer subsidies in solar and wind. The energy market, thanks to government regulations, is not an energy market; it's an energy racket. The problem of CPI is caused by regulation. The solution is not more regulation.


In conclusion, free-market wealth and thus any inequality are not at the expense of others. Government-facilitated wealth is, has been and always will be at the cost of others. This is where significant and sustainable inequality almost always comes from: fake or crony capitalism, not real free-market capitalism. We at Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party are the party of cheaper electricity. We at One Nation are the party of a lower cost of living. We need to celebrate human progress, human creativity and that most awesome resource of all, the free human spirit.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (16:50):  I rise too to make a contribution in this debate. I can't just let it slide that Senator Duniam, like all of those on that side, was talking about inequality as a 'claim'. There couldn't be anywhere further from the truth, because Australians are feeling the inequality in this country at the moment. To back that up, Senator Hume made comment in relation to the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey. You can't ignore that. You can't just grab one set of figures out and come into this chamber—although I'd have to say there was a lot more grit in her performance, and she at least delivered her attempt to puff up what the government's been doing, which was still so far from the truth it's not funny.


Senator Duniam was speaking about the youth of Tasmania and what a great job the Liberal state government has been doing in Tasmania. Well, once again, he has misled this chamber, because there have been no signs of any hope. There have been no signs of any jobs for our young people, with the high employment rates we have in my home state.


We must consider new approaches to tackling inequality and poverty in this country. Unlike those opposite, Labor understands this. We understand this, and we've already started with our announcements of policy thus far that will go a long way towards turning around the inequality that this country has developed under this government.


Those opposite can shrug their shoulders all they like about the facts, but the facts are these: the HILDA Survey shows that child poverty is worsening in single-parent families. That's a fact. At the same time, childcare costs have doubled; wages growth has flatlined; and levels of homeownership continue to fall. Australian families are bearing the brunt of rising childcare costs, and they are really struggling. The HILDA Survey also shows that the likelihood of child poverty in single-parent families is very high, between 20 and 25 per cent, which is considerably higher than the general community rate of around 10 per cent. That's a significant difference.


The government's complex new work laws and cuts to early-education access will make things even worse for vulnerable children and single parents trying to stay in the workforce, further fuelling the inequality. The Turnbull government has also recently made a $1.4 billion cut to the family tax benefits. By freezing family tax benefit payment rates, the Turnbull government is leaving 1.5 million Australian families and millions of children far worse off. That is not a government which has any understanding of inequality in this country.


The HILDA figures show that the Turnbull government continues to put investors buying their fourth or fifth property ahead of young people trying to buy their first home. How out of touch can you be? We've already laid out our policies in relation to negative gearing. We've put those out on the table, and what do we hear from those opposite? They say we're just trying to play envy politics. Well, it's not about envy politics. It's about giving young people and young families the opportunity to have their first home. Those opposite have absolutely no credibility on housing. They claimed in the 2017 budget that they would deliver an extraordinary large housing package and it would be an impressive package and it would be well received. But there is nothing in it. There is nothing in there at all to address the key drivers of housing unaffordability—nothing at all.


The huge drop in homeownership for people under the age of 40, the declining living standards and flat wages are the headlines. But it is the Turnbull government's policy response that needs to be highlighted. They are not giving the attention to these issues that they deserve. It is almost like there is this big black hole of lack of policy from that side, and it is just getting bigger and bigger. We know they are distracted with their leadership issues. We know they are distracted by the chaos and the dysfunction within their own caucus. But that isn't what they were elected to do. They were elected to represent the views and the future of Australian citizens, and they are letting them down. Yesterday we had Senator Macdonald make another of his— (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2017-08-15,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania) (16:56):  The hapless Labor Party have come into this place today, proposing a matter of public importance which highlighted some of the very real difficulties that Australian families are facing. What it allows this Senate to do, and the Australian people to understand, is that the Liberal-National Party government understand these difficulties and we are addressing them, whereas the Australian Labor Party have a recipe to make their difficult circumstances so much worse. That is the distinction that the Australian people face, and I therefore thank the Australian Labor Party for putting this MPI to us today.


Make no mistake: if the Australian Labor Party had its way, just for example, the cost of building infrastructure in this country would be 30 per cent higher because there would not be the Australian Building and Construction Commission. When you have to pay 30 per cent more for your infrastructure, if it's public, it is the taxpayer that suffers. If it is private infrastructure, the builder passes that on, or the developer passes that on—to whom? To the people who rent the premises. What do they do? They charge more for the goods and services to the consumer to cover the higher rental. So, each time Mr Shorten defends the CFMEU and says that he will abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, every single Australian should be aware that that is a recipe for increasing their cost of living.


We move to another issue, which I know many Australians are facing with difficulty, and that is the cost of energy. Which is the state that has the highest domestic power prices in the country—indeed, in the world? 




Senator Ruston:
  South Australia.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Ruston, you've got it! It is South Australia, because of the manic, ideological approach to renewable energy, an approach that is bankrupting households and small businesses and putting people out of work. And do you know what the Labor recipe for this is? Even more of the same! If Mr Shorten were to become Prime Minister, we would be having a 50 per cent renewable energy target to make the current situation so much worse. What are we doing as a Liberal-National Party government? We are saying affordability and security of supply have to be front and centre of any energy policy. So here again we have the answers, and the Australian Labor Party if given the chance would make the situation worse.


Or, indeed, we can move to issue of coastal shipping in this country. It is completely out of whack. Coming from Tasmania, I know the cost of coastal shipping; how it prejudices our capacity to export and as a result to grow jobs. Despite that, I'm delighted to report that when a state and federal Liberal government work together in lock step, as we have done in Tasmania since 2013, the unemployment rate can come down from 8.1 per cent to 5.9 per cent. Now, that is something that really helps households: giving people jobs. That has been the focus of the Liberal governments, both in Canberra and in Hobart, and that is why Premier Will Hodgman and his government deserve such accolades for the wonderful work they are doing in assisting.


But, having said that, we understand that a lot more needs to be done, and that is why the Hodgman Liberal government deserves and needs a second term to drive home those benefits. Coastal shipping is costing Bell Bay, an aluminium smelter in Tasmania, an increase in their shipping costs of 63 per cent. So we have Senator Polley, a Labor senator from Tasmania, opining in this place that we've got a problem with flat wages. Oh! I wonder why that might be? If you bump up the price of production—be it in coastal shipping; be it in relation to the rorts, rackets and rip-offs in building infrastructure; or be it because of a renewable energy target with energy costs; all these things that Labor inflicts on business—then guess what? There is not the room to provide the wage increases that the Australian Labor Party claim that the workers of Australia deserve.


Now, let's be very clear: I would prefer lower energy prices and the capacity for Australian businesses to pay Australian workers more. I would prefer that the cost of infrastructure would be lower so that workers could be paid more. They're the sorts of things that the Australian Labor Party simply do not understand. But what Labor have now embarked upon is a campaign claiming that they are championing equality. What they are championing is unabashed envy. They want to cut down the tall poppy. They want to say, 'If you succeed, we won't be supporting you.' They want to say to people, 'We want equality of outcome.'


We in the Liberal Party believe in equality, but it's in equality of opportunity. No matter what task you give somebody, somebody will be the best at it and somebody will be the worst at it. Indeed, even the Australian Labor Party—allegedly, believe it or not—elect a leader, who gets paid a lot more than the backbench. And, allegedly, Mr Shorten is their best! Believe it or not! But that is what the Labor Party are saying to the Australian people. And that is why he gets paid nearly double the salary of the backbencher. Oh! Where's the equality of that? Have you ever noticed that, when it comes to the Labor Party and trade union officials, the equality issue does not seem to play out?


But the simple fact is that envy corrodes the being. It poisons the soul of the people who harbour that envy, and that is what the Labor Party are, unfortunately, displaying. And so, when Labor say 'equality', understand that it is cheap, nasty envy—a corrosive attribute. All we have to do is look at countries like North Korea and Venezuela. Everybody's equal in those countries these days: equal in abject poverty. Venezuela, before Hugo Chavez, was a country of wealth unparalleled in South America. But today it is in abject poverty, courtesy of the failed socialist prescription.


So in the moments remaining I will just make a few statements that I hope will penetrate the thinking of the Australian Labor Party. But these are truths that are unassailable. They are these: you cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity; what one receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving; the government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else; you cannot multiply wealth by dividing it; and when half the people get the idea they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half get the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation. Look at Venezuela: socialism fails when it runs out of other people's money. (Time expired)

Senator McCARTHY
 (Northern Territory) (17:05):  I just have to pick up on the comments by the previous speaker on equality of opportunity. Wouldn't that be lovely? Wouldn't that be wonderful if all Australians had access to an opportunity of equality? But that's not the case. It's certainly not the case for so many of my constituents across the Northern Territory. Opportunity, and access to opportunity, is something we still only dream of. I would say that, when we bring an MPI of such significance to the Senate, we bring it because we are incredibly conscious of the enormous pressures that are growing every day on Australian families. It isn't about being nasty. It isn't about being corrosive. This is about reminding those in government and putting them on notice that there are Australians in this country who need you to show leadership, who need you to care. And that's not what is happening out there. It is definitely not what is happening out there.


Australia is characterised as having very low rates of poverty and economic segregation and a culture of a fair go. We've always been proud of the apparent economic equality in our society, but the Melbourne Institute's Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey has shown that households are doing it tougher. Before the election of the previous Prime Minister, a typical Australian family took home about what it did in 2009. It now takes home much less. Families are doing it tougher, and people who traditionally could look forward to a future of increasing wealth are now looking at a future of increasing economic uncertainty.


University graduates earn much less than their predecessors used to—$1,023 a week, down from $1,468—and they are much less likely to be in full-time jobs four years later—73 per cent, down from 91 per cent. Australians with only a high school qualification are doing even worse. When the survey started, 81 per cent were employed full time within four years. Now it's just 62 per cent.


More young people are living longer with their parents, and those who are fortunate enough to be able to afford to buy a house are finding it harder to pay off. Let's not go to the fact that, for constituents in the Northern Territory, the dream of even owning a home is still way off in the distance. Older people are finding it much tougher too, with superannuation amounts failing to meet the expenses of living longer.


The HILDA Survey shows that child poverty is worsening in single-parent families. At the same time, childcare costs have doubled for many, wages growth has flatlined, and levels of home ownership continue to fall. The survey shows that the likelihood of child poverty in single-parent families is between 20 per cent and 25 per cent, considerably higher than the general community rate of around 10 per cent.


What the HILDA report has revealed is something that Indigenous Australians have been living with for years—well, forever, really—and that is that the gap is widening: the gap between the haves and the have-nots, the gap between rich and poor and the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. In February this year, the Prime Minister tabled the 2017 Closing the gap report. It showed Australia is failing on six out of seven key measures to boost Indigenous Australia.


This government is going to spend $122 million on a postal plebiscite on marriage equality. Imagine what programs to close the gap of Indigenous disadvantage this amount of money could fund. The death of the wonderful singer Dr G Yunupingu at the age of just 46 from long-term illness brings home once again the disparity in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Think for a moment of the health services on country that could be funded with $122 million. This government is showing what its priorities are. It's not about tackling inequality; it's not about closing the gap; and it's certainly not about having a vision that will create a stronger and fairer Australia.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales—Minister for International Development and the Pacific) (17:58):  On behalf of the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, I table a ministerial statement on the conclusion of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. I move:


That the Senate take note of the statement. 


I'm very pleased that this statement was made yesterday during the guest of government visit by the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, the Hon. Manasseh Sogavare MP. In particular, it gives me great pride and satisfaction to note that the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, or RAMSI as it was known, concluded its mission on 30 June this year. Operation Helpem Fren ended after 14 years of Australian-led support. Australia, through governments on both sides of politics, provided the leadership and a substantial share of the human and financial resources that initiated, powered and sustained this critical and highly regarded regional intervention. It was essentially a civilian-led policing operation intended to re-establish law and order and implement the necessary governance and economic reforms to provide the Solomon Islands with a firm foundation on which to build its future security and prosperity. This was reinforced by the Solomon Islands domestic enabling legislation. RAMSI was also endorsed by the Pacific Islands Forum, so the legal foundation for its presence in the Solomon Islands was therefore very strong.


From 1998 to 2003 the Solomon Islands was being pulled apart by lawlessness, violence and rampant criminality. The causes were complex, but ethnic and provincial tensions and relocation were at the core of the conflict. By July 2003 the Solomon Islands was well on the way to becoming a failed state. Its economy had ceased to function. The state was no longer providing even the most basic of services, including water and electricity, and basic law and order had broken down. Children were not going to school and were often press-ganged into the service of marauding militants. These same militias were literally holding the government to ransom, extorting money from the state's near-empty coffers.


So in July 2003, after much deliberation, the Howard government made the decision to help the Solomon Islands government bring the country back from the precipice. The Howard government well understood that the ills which were plaguing the Solomon Islands could quickly spread throughout the region. While RAMSI was led by Australia, its success lay in the fact that it was a genuinely regional initiative, having been established under a treaty to which all 15 contributing Pacific Island countries, including New Zealand and Australia, were parties. Our Pacific neighbours collectively contributed thousands of police, military, diplomatic and advisory personnel to the mission. It has set an important precedent and provides us with a model for future regional collaboration. RAMSI was particularly successful in achieving its immediate priority of re-establishing law and order. In the first week, more than 3,700 guns were collected and destroyed. In its third week, the surrender of renegade militants was negotiated with the help of mediators. By the end of the third year, 6,300 arrests had been made for militant and criminal activity.


In 2017 Solomon Islands presents a very different picture. Whilst islanders today face many unresolved challenges, life has long since returned to relative normality. I've had the privilege of visiting the Solomon Islands four times in my role as Minister for International Development and the Pacific. I have seen the national health services helping to distribute medicines in the outer provinces, I've seen the infrastructure developments—the roads, bridges and wharves, which provide the lifeblood of economic growth. I have seen how the women of the Solomon Islands are working together to promote private enterprise, advocate for better services and combat domestic violence. I've seen how Australian aid dollars are supporting these good works. The Solomon Islands is reaping the benefits of stability, with the economy having grown more than 80 per cent in the first 10 years of RAMSI. Underpinning this growth is an effective, functioning and rehabilitated police force, of which about one-third are women, which has not only been remoulded to once again provide the nation's front line of security but has also delivered training to other police forces in the Pacific and is now contributing to UN peacekeeping in Sudan.


All of this came at a cost. More importantly, I want to acknowledge the human cost. Six RAMSI officers lost their lives over its term, including four Australians: Private Jamie Clark, 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, ADF; Adam Dunning, Protective Service Officer, Australian Federal Police; Ronald Lewis, Protective Service Officer, Australian Federal Police; and Tony Scriva, a civilian adviser to the Solomon Islands government. They will always be remembered for their sacrifice. Australia invested approximately $2.8 billion of the $3 billion cost over the 14 years of the operation. And the cost to Australia, financial and otherwise, would have been far greater had we not acted when we did.


Now it is imperative that the gains from RAMSI be preserved. Prime Minister Sogavare understands better than anyone the importance and complexities of the challenges which lie ahead, and he has dedicated himself and his government to tackling them head on. But the Solomon Islands will not do it alone, and Prime Minister Sogavare has our full support. In June this year, on behalf of the Australian government, I signed a three-year aid partnership agreement between our two countries which establishes our shared vision for cooperation to foster inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction and stability in the Solomon Islands.


Ultimately, however, to achieve these goals the Solomon Islands government will need to maintain law and order and stability for a sustained period. To this end, Australia and the Solomon Islands have worked to develop a package of assistance to consolidate bilaterally the work that RAMSI has up to now driven. This includes a policing program under which we have placed 44 AFP advisers in Honiara to mentor, train and advise the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. This will be complemented by new bilateral programs of support for justice and governance. This package will amount to $141 million over four years, from 2017 to 2021. This is part of our overseas development assistance to the Solomon Islands, which in 2017-18 will be $142.2 million. On Monday, our governments also signed a bilateral security treaty, the first of its kind in the Pacific. The treaty will enable Australian Defence Force, police and civilian personnel to deploy operationally in emergency situations to provide security or humanitarian assistance at the Solomon Islands government's request.


Regional security cooperation in the Solomons did not begin with RAMSI. Last week, I had the honour and privilege to represent Australia at the commemorations in Honiara marking the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Guadalcanal, including the sinking on 9 August 1942 of the first HMAS Canberra, with the loss of 84 of her crew, off Savo Island. The Canberra remains the largest Australian warship ever to have been lost in battle. I felt privileged to be at the memorial service for the Canberra, conducted on HMAS Success about 760 metres above the Canberra's final resting place where I was joined by veterans and some veterans' families. The Canberra rests in Ironbottom Sound, the largest maritime war grave in the world, where over 30 ships and many planes were lost. I visited Bloody Ridge, site of one of the best known of the battles on Guadalcanal, which US Marine Corps General Neller described as hallow ground. This site has now been declared a national park by the Solomon Islands government.


Australia's engagements in the Solomon Islands in support of the land offensive of the United States Marine Corps tied up Japanese resources that would otherwise have been deployed at Kokoda and hence turned the tide of the Pacific War. During the war, Australian Coastwatchers worked side by side with island scouts to report on movements and intentions of Japanese forces, work of vital intelligence importance to the Allies. As Australian Coastwatcher John Keenan recalled:


Without local help I don't know what we would have done. We wouldn't have lasted ten minutes.


The achievements of the Coastwatchers were summed up by US Fleet Admiral Halsey:


The Coastwatchers saved Guadalcanal, and Guadalcanal saved the South Pacific.


Given the longstanding strong ties between our nations and our peoples, in 2003 it was natural for the Solomon Islands to turn to Australia for help in its hour of need. In 2017, as RAMSI prepared to leave, it was equally natural for the Solomon Islanders to ask whether Australia would continue to stand by their side. Australia is inseparably connected to the Solomon Islands and the Pacific region, which is why we responded with a resounding yes to Helpem Fren.

"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2017-08-15,"



Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (18:09):  I'm really pleased to be able to share this afternoon in the acknowledgement of the work of RAMSI, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. I particularly note the other title that it has, which I think is very meaningful and encapsulates the whole meaning of this exercise—that is, Operation Helpem Fren. In that focus, it talks about how this operation was conceived. It was a cry for help from one of our friends in the Pacific, the Solomon Islands.


We know that over a period of time there had been violence and disruption in this beautiful country and there was a need for support. At that time, the Solomon Islands cried for help from a friend. Australia, under Prime Minister Howard, responded to that call. But it wasn't only Australia. As we know, one of the real strengths of the RAMSI exercise was the way that the countries of the Pacific Islands Forum gathered together and made a joint commitment that they would work with the people and the government of the Solomon Islands to ensure that there would be real peace and security in that community. 


I think that over the period of time 2003-17 we saw 15 island nations, including Australia and New Zealand, working together, bringing their skills, professionalism, commitment and sense of area—a sense of being part of the Pacific—to make sure that RAMSI, Operation Helpem Fren, would be a success, and that we would see what we have seen now. We have seen a country that has re-established law and order, a country that has new friends across the Pacific who have worked together to make sure that there will be security in the region, a thriving economy, the opportunity for children to go to school and an opportunity for an effective police force. One of the core elements of this particular process was this commitment to effective law and order and a strong, trained professional police force. 


Senator Fierravanti-Wells and I have many shared experiences. One of those experiences was a visit to the Solomon Islands earlier this year with Senator Wong and Minister Bishop. Among other things, we met with people who had been part of the policing program, and we heard Minister Bishop talk about the pride with which all the participants in RAMSI had seen the way that the police were able to develop not just in their own area, but also to a well-trained organisation that was sharing their skills now, taking the Operation Helpem Fren to help other friends, to ensure that we build on this basis. Minister Bishop particularly mentioned the fact that training is now provided by the Solomon Islands to other Pacific island states. They deploy officers to UN missions across the world, and support disaster relief funds in neighbouring states—places like Vanuatu, following Cyclone Pam. 


One of the real joys of that visit was to see the pride of the newly recruited women members of the police force standing shoulder-to-shoulder in their community of police, to proudly take on the role they had chosen. They had careers working in security for their community. One of the particular elements was engagement in the newly formed domestic violence laws in that nation. That is so inspiring to other countries and so inspiring to the community across all the Solomon Islands. They know that their government, their police force and their community now are committed to ensuring that women and families are safe. The work with the domestic violence shelter provided a high point, I think, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, of our visit. 


Senator Fierravanti-Wells mentioned the loss of life during the commitment to RAMSI, and that has been acknowledged in the other place, where two beautiful speeches were made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten. I have obtained Senator Fierravanti-Wells' approval to table both those speeches. I think they should be tabled. I was particularly impressed by the way Bill Shorten was able to link the history of our relationship with the Solomon Islands to the example and the experience we had through RAMSI and also for hope into the future. It is important to look at the future, because this period, the RAMSI Helpem Fren period, has now been concluded. But that, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells pointed out, is not the end of a relationship; it is the hope for the future of the relationship. 


I want to mention the photographic display that was launched yesterday in this place. The photos were truly beautiful, confronting and inspiring images that looked at the hope for the next phase in the Solomon Islands' community and government. These pictures pulsated with a sense of hope for an optimistic future. Women, families, young people gathered together to acknowledge and celebrate the work of RAMSI but were also looking to the future. We know now of the signed commitments into the future of our ongoing working relationship with our friend, Solomon Islands. We know that there is great hope for this time. We know that our government is committed totally to ensuring that that relationship will continue.


This has been a genuinely successful exercise in terms of: the engagement of the people across the Pacific; the acknowledgement that there was a need for an intervention; the acknowledgement that that must be done with partnership; and, also, the rebuilding of communities so that when there are more calls—and there will be more calls not just in the Pacific but across our world for support, for help—we know there will be a sound basis, through the work that was done through RAMSI, for further operations of helping friends to be there and to be successful.

I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017implements the commitment the government made on 20 April 2017 to strengthen the requirements for Australian citizenship. It also incorporates a number of integrity measures introduced into the last parliament. 


Australian citizenship is an extraordinary privilege. Pathways to citizenship give new migrants the opportunity to be full and active participants in Australian society.


Citizenship was first defined in Australian law in the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948, and came into force on Australia Day 1949. Since then, more than five million people have chosen to become Australian citizens. 


Australians come from every culture, every race, every faith and every nation. Together we have built a modern and prosperous Australia. The success of our nation is based on our shared values, rights and responsibilities. 


The measures contained in this bill will help us build on this success. It will ensure we continue to welcome new Australians committed to making a positive contribution through the many opportunities our country affords. 


As a government, we are committed to maintaining strong public confidence and support for our migration and citizenship programmes – through an assurance of integrity to the Australian public. 


We are proud of our heritage and generosity as a nation. We look forward to continuing to welcome new migrants – irrespective of race, religion, national or ethnic origin – who embrace our Australian laws and values, and who seek to contribute to, rather than undermine, our society. 


The measures in this bill commencing from 20 April 2017 are the government's response to the 2015 National consultation on citizenship – your right, your responsibility, which indicated strong community support for strengthening the test for Australian citizenship. The Australian community expects that aspiring citizens demonstrate their allegiance to Australia, their commitment to live in accordance with Australian laws and values, and be willing to integrate into and become contributing members of the Australian community. 


In accordance with the announced measures, there will be an increase in the general residence requirement. An applicant for Australian citizenship will need to demonstrate a minimum of four years of permanent residence immediately prior to their application for citizenship, with a maximum of 12 months outside of Australia in this time period. This represents a change from the current requirement of a minimum of 12 months as a permanent resident. Strengthening the residency requirement is intended to support integration and facilitate a more thorough evaluation of a person's commitment to Australia, our values and adherence to our laws. It also brings Australia more in line with the general requirements of other nations. 


The National consultation found ""A residence requirement in citizenship law is an objective measure of a person's association with Australia. It also serves as a probationary period, so that a person's word and deeds across this time can be considered should the person apply for Australian citizenship. Increasing the value and integrity of citizenship by changing the residence requirement from four years lawful stay to four years permanent residence is appropriate…""


The government is also introducing a requirement to have competent English language through listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. 


English language is essential for economic participation and social cohesion. The Productivity Commission in 2016 highlighted the importance of English language proficiency for integration and settlement outcomes. There is also strong public support to ensure aspiring citizens are fully able to participate in Australian life, by speaking English, our national language. 


Aspiring citizens are currently required to possess a level of 'basic' English. This is indirectly assessed when an applicant sits the citizenship test. Aspiring citizens will now be required to undertake a separate upfront English language test with an accredited provider and achieve a level of 'competent'. There will be exemptions, such as for applicants over 60 years of age, or under 16 years of age at the time they applied for citizenship or those with an enduring or permanent mental or physical incapacity. There will be other exemptions from testing, as is currently the case for skilled migration assessments, such as for citizens of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, the United States of America or New Zealand who hold a valid passport, or for applicants who have undertaken specified English language studies at a recognised Australian education institution.


Applicants will be required to sign an Australian Values Statement in order to make a valid application for citizenship. It will require applicants to make an undertaking to integrate into and contribute to the Australian community. The current Australian Values Statement includes an understanding of: 


respect for the freedom and dignity of the individual;


freedom of religion; 


commitment to the rule of law;


parliamentary democracy;


equality of men and women; 


equality of opportunity for individuals, regardless of their race, religion or ethnic background; and


English language, as the national language, is an important unifying element of Australian society.


Applicants will be required to demonstrate their integration into the Australian community in accordance with Australian values. 


For example, this may include:


abiding by Australian laws;


attaining competent English;


ensuring eligible children attend school;


seeking employment rather than relying on welfare where there is capacity to do so; or


being involved with community groups. 


The bill provides that the minister may determine changes to the text and requirements in relation to the Australian Values Statement by legislative instrument. Values based questions will also be added to the citizenship test. 


The Department of Immigration and Border Protection will assess this information based on documents provided as part of an aspiring citizen's application and may also assess this at interview.


In addition to existing police checks which are undertaken as part of an application for citizenship, an applicant will also be assessed for specified conduct that is inconsistent with Australian values, such as domestic or family violence, criminality including female genital mutilation and involvement in gangs and organised crime.


The pledge will be extended to all streams of citizenship by application, including citizenship by descent, adoption and resumption. Applicants over 16 years of age will need to make the pledge before they can become a citizen. Applicants for citizenship by conferral on the grounds of being born in Papua, born to a former citizen or under statelessness provisions, will no longer be exempt from making the pledge. Exemptions will include permanent or enduring physical or mental incapacity. 


The pledge will also refer to allegiance to Australia. The government has separately passed legislation to provide for the loss of citizenship of dual-nationals who betray their allegiance through involvement in terrorist related activity. 


Consistent with measures introduced in the last parliament by the former minister, the bill contains additional measures to improve the integrity of the citizenship programme. 


Currently, only aspiring citizens aged 18 years and over are required to meet the 'good character' requirement – which involves criminal history checks. There is a small minority of people under 18 who clearly do not meet community expectations of good character and have been involved in serious or violent crime, such as gang violence. The bill amends these provisions to require all applicants, including those under 18, to be of good character. 


The bill also amends the offence provisions to reflect modern sentencing practices, including where a person is subject to a court order for home detention or where they have not been sentenced to prison but are nonetheless under obligations to a court. 


The bill provides that approval must be cancelled if the minister is no longer satisfied of the applicant's identity or if they have become a risk to national security. The minister may also cancel approval if satisfied that the person no longer meets other eligibility requirements. The bill extends the maximum period of time where the Minister can delay an applicant making the pledge of allegiance from 12 months to two years, to better align with timeframes of some complex investigations. 


The bill provides for the revocation of citizenship where a person became a citizen as a result of fraud or misrepresentation. The minister must be satisfied that it would be contrary to the public interest for the person to remain a citizen. While law enforcement agencies, for a range of reasons, may not be in a position to prosecute all forms of fraud and misrepresentation in the citizenship process, the government is committed to providing the highest levels of integrity where possible. Each person being considered for revocation of their Australian citizenship would be given natural justice before the minister makes a decision. A decision to revoke citizenship on these grounds would be open to judicial review. 


Currently, the act provides that a person is deemed never to have been an Australian citizen where they attained citizenship by descent, but were later found not to have had an Australian parent at the time of birth. There have been difficult cases in recent times in relation to this. There have been people who were registered as Australian citizens by descent, thought they were Australian all their lives, but have been found later in life not to have been eligible in the first place and consequently deemed to have never been a citizen. 


The proposed amendments repeal the operation of law provision and insert a discretionary power. This will allow the circumstances of a particular case to be taken into account when deciding if citizenship by descent should be revoked. 


Currently under the act, children acquire citizenship automatically if they are born in Australia to an Australian citizen or permanent resident parent, or if they are ordinarily resident in Australia until their 10th birthday. The bill specifies the automatic acquisition of citizenship on a person's 10th birthday applies to those persons who have maintained lawful residence in Australia throughout the 10 years, including maintaining a right to return if they travel outside Australia during those years. These amendments will not affect access to citizenship by children born in Australia to New Zealand citizens or children who are stateless. The changes also remove the automatic acquisition of citizenship on the 10th birthday of a child in Australia born to a parent with diplomatic or consular privileges and immunities. 


The provision giving citizenship to children found abandoned in Australia is also amended to be consistent with the original policy intent, which is to reflect Australia's international obligations under the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. 


The bill also amends the definition of 'spouse' and 'de facto partner' to be consistent with the Migration Act and to reflect the policy position that the relationship between the applicant and their Australian citizen spouse or partner must be genuine and continuing. 


The majority of applicants for citizenship have come to Australia originally on a visa in accordance with the Migration Act. Personal information is collected through the visa process and is relevant when the person applies for citizenship. Likewise, personal information collected about a person under the Citizenship Act can be relevant if the department is considering whether to cancel a person's visa after a citizenship application has been refused. The bill provides that personal information collected under one act and associated regulations may be used and disclosed for the purposes of the other. 


We have seen in recent times a number of Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) migration decisions that are outside community standards. This has also occurred in relation to citizenship decisions. Specifically, the AAT has found that people were of good character despite having been convicted of child sexual offences, manslaughter, people smuggling or domestic violence.


The bill seeks to better align the powers in the Citizenship Act with the Migration Act to remedy decisions that may be outside of community standards. The provisions will allow the minister to personally set aside certain decisions of the AAT if it is in the public interest to do so. Consistent with the Migration Act, personal decisions of the minister will not be subject to merits review. However, such decisions would still be subject to judicial review in the Federal or High Court. The new provision does not propose to exclude or limit judicial review. 


The bill makes a range of other and consequential amendments to support the integrity of the citizenship programme. 




Conclusion



The measures in this bill enhance the institution of citizenship. 


As many have rightly acknowledged, we are one of the most successful migrant nations in the world today.


We have prospered and forged a secure and harmonious society. This has been built by people of every possible background, united by common values that include a commitment to the rule of law; freedom – including of religion and speech; support for Parliamentary democracy; equality of men and women; equality of opportunity for individuals; community involvement; and the pursuit of opportunity through education, employment and entrepreneurship. 


We should never take our success for granted. 


This bill reinforces the integrity of our citizenship programme. This will help maintain strong public support for migration and the value of Australian citizenship in what is an increasingly challenging national security environment and complex global security situation. 


The measures in this bill will ensure we continue to welcome people committed to the success of our great nation – enriching our society and building our economic prosperity.

Senator FARRELL:




I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


Serving as a member of the Australian Defence Force involves risk and sacrifice. In acknowledgement of this service and sacrifice, our country needs to support our veterans and their families now and into the future. Families play a unique role within the military life and service, themselves making many sacrifices. Our ADF personnel and veterans look to their families for support while in service, in transition and in civilian life. These men and women and children are the unsung heroes of our defence forces. This is why it is important to ensure that they have the support they need to address the unique challenges of military life. After all, greater support for our military families is greater support for our serving and ex-service personnel.


In June, the opposition announced that we would develop a strategy to provide greater support and resources to military families. This was to implement the key recommendations of the National Mental Health Commission's review into the services available to veterans and current serving members of the Australian Defence Force in relation to prevention of self-harm and suicide. Developing a family engagement and support strategy will identify where we can provide greater support to military families, those who matter most to our ADF personnel and veterans: their wives, husbands, sons and daughters. Labor's commitment to develop a family engagement and support strategy in government would be co-designed with defence and veteran families and communities to focus on known stress points for families, including transition for defence members into civilian life.


The NMHC's review highlighted that there is currently a lack of emphasis on the critical role that families play in the lives of current and former serving members. There is no doubt that families play a critical role in providing support to serving and ex-service personnel suffering from mental health issues. Developing a family strategy acknowledges the important role of families in the rehabilitation of ADF members and veterans from both physical and mental injury and illness. Families can be the greatest support when dealing with life-changing events that can occur throughout and after military service.


Labor acknowledges that it is vital that government and parliament continue to work in a collaborative way with these ex-service organisations to ensure that there is no-one falling through the gaps. That is why Labor has supported the government's additional funding to rectify DVA's longstanding ICT issues, along with expanded access to non-liability health care for any member of the ADF who has served one day. To veterans: we value your dedication and your feedback. We want to know where we can do better. We recognise that the effort should never stop and that the job is never done.


Labor looks forward to continuing its work with veterans and the ex-service community and with the government and the department to ensure that we continue to strive for the best outcomes for our ex-service personnel and their families.

Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (19:20):  I rise tonight with a heavy heart to reflect upon a tragedy that has happened in recent weeks that resulted in the loss of a little angel named Willow Walker in the Central West part of my home state. I have decided to reflect upon this for a number of reasons. Willow Walker, the daughter of Brooke and Daniel, and sister to her brother, Harley, was a child of the Collins and Walker families of the Central West in Queensland.


I had the privilege to be able to join the family, extended family, friends and, indeed, almost the entire community of the Central West as Willow's life was celebrated. I was particularly moved by a number of things that I saw. Firstly, the stoic and resilient approach taken by her parents as they celebrated this little girl's life was inspirational—nothing short of inspirational. Supported by the broader family, the grandparents and, indeed, the entire community of the district, in so many ways it really was a restoration in the faith of our communities. I'm reflecting on this on the basis that these are rural communities. I think that the opportunity to provide support in these circumstances—the very nature of those communities, where everybody knows each other and everybody feels affected by these things, makes it easier or more likely for that support to happen in some of our smaller rural communities than we might sometimes see in larger metropolitan areas.


The entire Central West was affected by this enormous tragedy. It is an area that's remained under the heavy hand of drought now for four or five years. It remains one of the districts—there are many—in Australia that have not recovered from the impacts of drought and of market forces that have really challenged the economic and social stability of these places. In the midst of that, to see them rally around the Walker and Collins families around the loss of this little angel, Willow Walker, was something that I am unlikely to forget.


I felt so moved that I believe the circumstances need to be placed on the annals of our Hansard here in the federal parliament, to let all the Brookes and Daniels of Australia, who each face their own tragedies, many of which we don't learn about, know that we recognise their strengths. We recognise the strengths of their communities. They go to the very heart of what makes us Australians. They are deeply held in the culture and psyche of our people, who endure very difficult circumstances as they make their contributions to this nation. So I just wanted to say to Brooke, Daniel and Harley: the loss of Willow has not gone unnoticed. The impacts of how you celebrated her life were inspirational, and they will continue to play a part in underpinning this enormously important culture.
