"Scott, Bruce, MP",NATS,2003-11-24,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report, entitled Defence Sub Committee visit to RAAF Williamtown, Darwin Establishments, East Timor and RAAF Tindal, 14 to 17 July 2003.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—The visit provided an excellent opportunity for members of the subcommittee to familiarise themselves with the Australian Defence Force establishments situated on RAAF Base Williamtown and the various Defence establishments in the Darwin area, in particular Northern Command—NORCOM—and the North West Mobile Force—NORFORCE.
During the visit to RAAF Williamtown, the subcommittee was briefed on the role and operation of the ADF Warfare Centre and the Surveillance Control Group. Number 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron, based at RAAF Williamtown, has assisted in a range of overseas operations, including the recent war in Iraq. As part of the visit to Defence facilities in Darwin, the subcommittee was briefed on the role and operation of Headquarters Northern Command—NORCOM—and the role of NORFORCE in conducting surveillance operations in remote parts of Northern Australia. NORFORCE comprises about 60 per cent of Indigenous Australians, who perform a vital and effective role in operating in and providing surveillance in some of the harshest environments in Australia.
On Wednesday, 16 July, the subcommittee visited East Timor where, at the time, there were just under 1,000 ADF personnel, who formed Australian Battalion Group Rotation Eight situated in Forward Operating Base Moleana and in the Bobonaro District. The Australian contingent is part of Operation Citadel, the Australian contribution to the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor. The ADF forces operating in East Timor perform under arduous conditions and are a credit to Australia. The subcommittee visited the forward operating bases at Moleana, Maliana and Gleno. On Thursday, 17 July, the final day of the visit program, the subcommittee visited RAAF Tindal and was briefed on the role and operations of 322 Combat Support Wing and 75 Squadron. RAAF FA18 Hornets from 75 Squadron were involved in operations in the war in Iraq and received praise for their professionalism and skill.
In conclusion, Australian Defence Force personnel, operating in a range of diverse environments, continue to demonstrate professionalism, dedication and expertise. I commend the report to the House.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,0,1
"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I am pleased to support the comments of the honourable member for Maranoa, the Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I think one of the good things about the Defence Subcommittee is that, from time to time, it does go on visits to seek and meet ADF personnel on their home bases. It is a procedure that has much to commend it. Certainly it is an invaluable opportunity for members of the subcommittee to learn first-hand about what is being done and, in a formal way, elicit what may or may not be working as well as it might. This trip was no exception. 
The Defence Subcommittee has always sought to visit deployed ADF personnel wherever they have been. If my memory serves me correctly, the trip to East Timor is the third visit that the Defence Subcommittee has made. If it is good enough for serving men and women to serve the country overseas in a variety of operations, then it ought to be appropriate for members of parliament to go and observe their successes.
On every visit to East Timor it is always impressive to see Australians in operation—not only their professionalism in carrying out the work that they are trained to do but also the way in which they interact with the locals. This visit was no exception. For my own part, I do have some concern about the drawdown of Australian troops—from roughly 1,000 to something like 300 in its area of operation and, all over, some 400. Notwithstanding the drawdown, there has been a one-third increase in the area of responsibility. The drawdown is based on the presumption of the East Timorese being able to take over some of the functions of the peacekeeping forces in that country. For my part, I certainly believe that the future security of East Timor very much rests in developing good relations with Indonesia, and that will be a vital part of its future.
The chairman of the subcommittee mentioned NORFORCE and the reconnaissance units attached to it, some 60 per cent of whose members are Indigenous. It is a feature of all our reserve reconnaissance units that they are largely made up of Indigenous members who make an outstanding contribution to the ADF. We would be at a loss without the competence of those reconnaissance units. I commend this report of the Defence Subcommittee to the House and trust that all honourable members will have an opportunity to read the report.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises the contribution of the Royal Australian Air Force to the defence of Australia;
(2)	recognises and acknowledges the importance of the F111 fleet to the security of Australia and the region and the contribution this aircraft has made to Australia's defence;
(3)	congratulates the Australian Defence Force Parliament-ary Program for giving Members of Parliament greater access and a better working knowledge of the daily operations of our defence forces;
(4)	congratulates RAAF Base Amberley for the great work it does as a defence base and recognises the expertise of the RAAF personnel working at the base; and
(5)	recognises the contribution RAAF Base Amberley makes to the city of Ipswich and the community link that has been fostered over many years.
The Oxley electorate and the city of Ipswich have for many years been proud supporters of RAAF Base Amberley. From its humble, early beginnings in 1938 this base has grown to be an important part of Ipswich, its people and its identity. The RAAF throughout Australia has made a huge contribution to the defence of Australia, but more importantly the RAAF, particularly at Amberley, has been integral in the overall defence picture for our region. Part of the base's role has been, since the 1973 introduction of the F111, as a key strategic air platform for the defence of our nation. There has also been the deterrence factor that such an aircraft has in our region.
When I first wrote this motion some months ago to congratulate and recognise the RAAF and the F111 for their contribution to Australia's defence, the debate was still raging as to the possible date of retirement for the F111 platform. At that time I had just completed the ADF Parliamentary Program at RAAF Base Amberley and gained a much better understanding of the capability and contribution of the F111. My time at the base also made me realise that there is no other platform that can deliver the same defence projection for Australia as the F111. But the fleet is becoming aged and I believe everyone agrees that, at some time in the future, change will be necessary.
At that point in time the questions remained as to when the retirement year would be announced, how to replace the F111 capability and what would fill the gap between the time of retirement and the commissioning of any new platform. Some of those questions have since been answered by the government and this has at least given certainty to RAAF Base Amberley and the many thousands of personnel and contractors attached to the base and the F111.
My biggest concern for some time has been the gap in defence capability that will be created by the retirement of the F111 in 2010. The fact that the government has decided to retire early the F111 platform means that there will be that defence gap, with only the size of the gap in question now. In this case the capability gap created is massive and will remain even after the new joint strike fighter, the F35, is fully commissioned as the replacement for the ageing F111 platform. Dr Carlo Kopp, writing for the Aerospace and Defence Newsletter HeadsUp, claims that the F111 cuts will cripple Australian power. It is a big claim and one he backs with data on our current capabilities. He argues:
The basic force structure equations in relation to combat power is dictated by numbers of aircraft, how many weapons they carry, and how far they can carry them.
That makes perfect sense and is logical. To understand this better, Dr Kopp explained that throw-weight is the internationally accepted measure of the striking capability of a defence force. He further explains that the throw-weight is a product of the strike range of the weapons systems and its firepower. According to Dr Kopp this data dramatically outlines that:
The removal of the F111 from the RAAF inventory amounts to a 62.5 per cent reduction in RAAF throw weight. Even after considering a simpler measure like relative firepower in total numbers of 2000 lb weapons lifted still yields a 45 per cent reduction in strike capability when the F111 is removed. 
He also claims that the government's defence capability review briefing statement that there would be no strike capability gap is a very brave statement.
I have on many occasions made public my concerns about the defence capability gap that will exist before the F35 is ready. Even if the F35 is delivered on time in 2012-15, there will still be a need to train pilots, aircrew, maintenance people and support personnel as well as to tool up for this new platform. This effort alone will be a major task, beyond the mere delivery of the equipment itself. The fact that, even after full commissioning, the F35 will not be capable of delivering the same throw-weight as the F111 remains difficult to accept.
There is no doubt that we are faced with hard choices, but the fact that the government has mismanaged its defence budget with massive overspending and blow-outs has meant that critical defence decisions are weighted towards budget constraints rather than capability maintenance. For Australia to maintain its current capability, it will need to purchase more F35s and support aircraft than presently indicated in the budget or review current defence strategy altogether.
One area, though, where the government has got it right is in the introduction of the ADF Parliamentary Program. As members of parliament we are often called upon to make vital strategic policy decisions about defence without fully appreciating what happens behind the scenes in terms of the defence forces and the people they employ. The ADFPP is one of the most interesting and vital programs that a member of parliament could participate in to gain a better understanding of defence. This program has given many MPs an otherwise impossible to be obtained insight into the daily workings of defence bases, defence platforms and equipment and, even more importantly, a look at the lives of our Defence Force personnel and the contribution they make to Australia.
For me, the opportunity to spend a week at RAAF Base Amberley has been an absolute privilege and an experience I will not forget. I met a great bunch of people that are highly dedicated to their work, highly skilled and highly motivated. The people I met are enthusiastic about the RAAF, they understand the roles they play and they are more than willing to show a member of parliament just what it is about Defence life that makes it such an exceptional career. The opportunity to live and breathe the RAAF Amberley experience as part of 82 Wing and the F111 family showed me how important a well-resourced and equipped modern air force is to our security and our regional role of cooperation with our neighbours.
I also want to note the contribution that RAAF Base Amberley makes to Ipswich city and the local community. The base and the RAAF community have, without a doubt, helped shape Ipswich city. It is hard to imagine what Ipswich would be like today if it were not for Amberley, as Australia's premier base, and the F111. But unfortunately the F111 will be no more from 2010. This will be the end of an era, the end of an Australian icon like no other, as the government has announced the retirement of the F111 fleet. 
I want to specifically thank a number of people I came across during my stay at Amberley: the staff at the officers mess, the sergeants mess and the airmen's mess alike. It was a particularly rewarding experience for me personally to spend a week on a base such as Amberley, our No. 1 base, to see not only the different platforms—the F111, the Caribou and other aircraft—but also what happens behind the scenes with the maintenance and the many contractors that we now have, such as TAS Aviation, Boeing, Honeywell, Raytheon and a number of others. These are now an integral part of Defence Force life. They are integral in the sense that they now make up a vital part of the maintenance crews. In fact, as Defence—and, in particular, RAAF in this area—moves more and more towards private contractors, we can see a growing link between what was once the bastion of Defence Force personnel and what is now done by civilian contractors. It works better than I expected. Having been given a briefing and having met all of the different contractors, I was very impressed by the level of service they provide and the understanding they have of what actually makes a strong Defence Force. I do have a concern, though, that in the long run, we will lose the in-house skills and corporate knowledge in terms of training our own people.
I would like to thank Fran Bailey, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, for organising the program. I also want to thank Wing Commander Kim Osley, Squadron Leader Dallas Hagerty—who, by the way, flies Caribous, which he tells me is just as much fun and just as important as flying F111s—Squadron Leader Steve Clark, who piloted the F111 I had the privilege of navigating, and Air Commodore John Quaife, Commander Air Combat Group with the FA18s, for the debrief and further insight into the strategic importance of the F111. And a special thanks, of course, goes to the head of the ADF Parliamentary Program, Mr Ray Perry, a retired air commodore, and the executive officer, Gary Walbrook, for a job well done.
—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Royal Australian Air Force</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1
"Thompson, Cameron, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—I second the motion, and I thank the member for Oxley for bringing the motion forward. Amberley is an important asset to the Ipswich region and to all of Australia. As the member for Blair, it is something that I am immensely proud of, as Amberley is located within the borders of my electorate—but I know that the member for Oxley has many RAAF personnel living in his area. It is good to see this debate on the Notice Paper so that we can pay credit to some of the good work that is being done at Amberley as well as note the progress of the ADF Parliamentary Program.
I want to lead off by talking a little bit about Amberley. It is somewhat ironic that when they initially set out to locate an Air Force base in south-east Queensland, the one that eventually became Amberley, they looked in an area of swampy land down at Boondall where the Boondall entertainment centre now is—of course there was no entertainment centre there then. They rejected that area because it was too prone to flooding. Of course, what is ironic now is that the Brisbane airport is in the vicinity of Boondall. I still think that Amberley is a much better asset as far as Australia is concerned than Brisbane airport. I think we can do many things in relation to air departures and organising the defence of the nation through RAAF Base Amberley than could ever have been done at the Boondall site. It was a very good choice by the people in those days to spend the equivalent of $21,600 on about 330 hectares of land to purchase the base of Amberley. The base has grown since then. Today it is made up of 1,660 hectares, so it has grown dramatically since its purchase in 1938. There are 3,500 service and civilian personnel working out of Amberley, and the core of the activity is no doubt the F111. The F111, a brilliant innovation in air combat and strike missions, was developed and first delivered to the Australian Air Force in June 1973 and it has gone on to defend this nation admirably ever since. 
On the base at Amberley, the two F111 squadrons are located within 82 Wing—previously operating separately as the Strike Reconnaissance Group; now part of the Air Combat Group. Also on the base—not to leave out everyone else that acts there—there is 44 Wing, the air traffic control detachment; 78 Wing, the technical training flight; the Airfield Defence Wing, which provides the airfield defence guards who go in and establish very quickly locations where RAAF activities are required; and a health services wing, which provides very important support to the personnel. One of the main activities on the base is the Combat Support Group, which is under the command of Air Commodore Stewart Cameron. The base itself is commanded by Steve Butterworth.
I now want to turn to the activities of the parliamentary program. This program has been successful in bringing home to local members such as me the way the people at a base such as Amberley—the people whom we seek to represent—go about their activities, the strong sense of camaraderie, the strong base that they have in training and the high aspirations that they have in seeking to defend this country and make Australia a better place through their participation in the RAAF and also through the other branches of the services involved in the parliamentary program.
I was not involved in the 2003 program, unlike the member for Oxley—he was lucky enough to get a trip on an F111. I was involved in a program in 2002 where we looked at the training of RAAF personnel. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in that program at Point Cook, watching the future air traffic controllers, navigators, pilots and all the admin officers and other people involved in RAAF activities going through their paces and learning what it takes to become an officer. It was all about leadership. I think members of this parliament should look very closely at the leadership program that they run down there, particularly the part at the Wombat State Forest down in Victoria where they go through their leadership exercises. I would like to challenge members of parliament to look at whether they could participate in those programs and actually pass.

"Wilkie, Kim, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I rise to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Oxley. Having witnessed them first hand as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, I believe that the RAAF personnel that we have are exceptional. They perform an absolutely vital role for Australia's security, and we need to give them all the support that we can. I get very disappointed when I hear some people complaining about things such as aircraft noise when we are dealing with some of our fighter jets—particularly around here in recent times. RAAF personnel do an absolutely fabulous job, and we really need to get behind them.
I was part of the Defence Force Parliamentary Program which was deployed to Amberley Air Force Base earlier this year. We were attached to 82 Wing, which has two squadrons of F111s, a training arm and an operational arm. Of course, they also have the other wings that have been mentioned previously. The other participants on that program were the member for Mitchell, Alan Cadman, and the member for Oxley, Bernie Ripoll. We had a thoroughly entertaining experience looking at how these aircraft operate. 
In talking about the member for Oxley, I should mention that Amberley is just outside Ipswich. There is a fabulous motorway, the Ipswich Motorway, that goes down there and it is in need of some very dramatic repairs. It is great to see that Labor has announced that, if we get into power, we are going to fund that initiative. Bernie, well done—you have really fought for your electorate. It will be great to see that come through. Of course, one of the key beneficiaries will be the RAAF personnel who will be able to get down to their base a lot quicker and safer.
The Defence Force Parliamentary Program is an excellent program. I was involved last year on a patrol boat out of Cairns going on the HMAS Ipswich and recently went on the Collins class submarine, the HMAS Sheean, and got to see how good the Navy personnel are. Whilst we were at Amberley, we saw how the ground crews operate, how the weapons systems operate and are maintained, how civilian contractors work—for example, Boeing—and the operational planning for missions. There is a tremendous amount of work that goes on behind the scenes that people would not normally see. We even spent some time in a flight simulator.
The F111 is a fabulous aircraft, and it is so sad that it will be mothballed early. This is one of the only aircraft in the world that can carry something like 22,000 pounds of payload 2,500 nautical miles. For a country like Australia, where we have to cover vast distances and get out to where these aircraft are needed, that sort of capability is enormously important, particularly when you consider that nothing in our region comes close to dealing with these sorts of aircraft. They can travel at over twice the speed of sound at altitude and, as we experienced, they can travel at mach 1.3 at 90 feet off the water. It is quite amazing to experience that aircraft at that sort of speed.
As I said, they have certain strengths, such as their speed and payload, but they also have a unique ejection system. If you are in an F111 and you get into trouble, the entire cockpit blows away from the aircraft. Therefore, if you are high up, you do not have to worry about freezing temperatures and, if you land in the water, the capsule actually floats. So it is a lot safer. The problem of course is that, if you do have to eject, you go out of the aircraft at something like 20 Gs. So your spine gets compressed about three-quarters of an inch—which is not very good for your back. To show you how good the F111s are, they recently took part in some exercises in the United States in Operation Red Flag. They flew every mission that was available to be flown in and they had no casualties. This was despite the fact that they were competing against 28 other nations. That gives you an example of the sort of capability we have.
In terms of weaknesses, obviously age is a problem. They are high maintenance. We have had wings cracking and leaking fuel tanks. But the main problem of course has been the lack of funds. The government is spending so much of the defence budget in operational areas, I believe it is forgetting about the actual need to upgrade and maintain our capability at a real level. As was mentioned previously, there is a gap between the scrapping of the F111 and the introduction of the new joint strike fighter. These new aircraft will not be able to perform with the same sort of capability; in fact, the aircraft cannot even lift some of the bombs that we are going to be using. 
The member for Oxley has thanked certain people. I would like to pass on my congratulations and thanks to Air Commodore Ray Perry, Executive Officer Gary Walbrook, Lieutenant Commander Kaylene Williams—who has done previous deployments—and also the member for Wannon, David Hawker, who travelled to England and looked at how these programs should be put together and set it up. It was a fabulous effort. I also pass on my thanks to the Hon. Fran Bailey; General Cosgrove; the three heads of the forces; and, at Amberley, Base Commander and Wing Commander Kim Osley; Base Program Coordinator, Squadron Leader Dallas Hagerty; my pilot, who is the most experienced F111 pilot in the world, Training Flight Commander Squadron Leader Ted Schneider; Air Commodore John Quaiffe; and all the staff, aircrew and private contractors involved.

"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—I feel well qualified to take part in the debate this afternoon on RAAF Base Amberley. The city I represent is Australia's only garrison city, a garrison city that has components of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Army and some small components of the Navy. Because of that, it is not surprising that Townsville has this year contributed the most Australian Defence Force personnel to serve overseas in the last 12 months, a mighty effort for Townsville.
Last Thursday night I was on Townsville's Strand to see the welcome home parade with the Chief of Army. It was packed, as Townsville and Thuringowa people came out to pay tribute to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who had been deployed to the strife torn regions around the globe. No community in this country has done more to support the ADF. ADF personnel are like members of each and every family in Townsville and Thuringowa, and that is how we see them.
The motion before the House today has made mention of the contribution the RAAF has made to the defence of Australia. RAAF Townsville has a number of important components. The 323 Combat Services Support Squadron, led by Wing Commander Glendan Krause, manages all the day-to-day base functions that are needed. The 395 Expeditionary Combat Support Wing manages all the expeditionary work that the RAAF does across the country and across the world, and it is commanded out of Townsville, not out of Amberley.
No. 1 Combat Logistics Squadron manages all of the bits and pieces that are needed when our troops are deployed overseas. The No. 1 Air Terminal Squadron, detachment Townsville, manages the movement of people. The 27 Squadron is a reserve squadron, and we have a detachment of Caribous from Amberley 38 Squadron at Townsville. We have 44 Wing Air Traffic Control, and a number of their personnel are in Iraq at the moment running Baghdad International Airport. Isn't it interesting that Australia's RAAF air traffic controllers are doing air traffic control? They were asked to go to Baghdad because they are the best in the world—and they have come out of Townsville.
We have a rather unique school at RAAF Townsville as well: the combat survival training school, which is one of the premier combat survival training schools in the world today. Members of defence forces from all round the world come to Townsville to attend the school. It is also interesting that members of all three services—Navy, Army and Air Force—who are in flying jobs attend the school in Townsville. That is a great example of the three services working together—and it is happening in our garrison city in the north. 
I was very privileged to have participated in the ADF Parliamentary Program. While I have Australia's largest army base in my electorate, of the two programs that I have done in the last two years one has been Air Force and one has been Navy. Last year, I was at RAAF Edinburgh to participate in a parliamentary program. I was pleased to see a wide range of activities.
I started off in the recruit training unit. I was carrying the same pack and doing the same thing as the recruits. It is a marvellous program. The young recruits love it. It is a 10-week course—fortunately, I did not have to stay for 10 weeks—and they learn a lot about themselves and about being part of a team. I saw aviation medication and the research and development unit, 92 Wing, and the radar surveillance unit, which I cannot talk about. But it is fascinating what Australia can do.
I have had no exposure to the Navy, but I was particularly impressed this year with the women in the Navy. The Navy is seamless. Women are able to get to senior positions, and their capabilities are fantastic. I very much appreciate the opportunity Fran Bailey gave me to participate in the program. I recommend the ADF parliamentary program to my colleagues—go and enjoy and learn.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Royal Australian Air Force</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I join with other speakers in this debate in placing on the parliamentary record our thanks and appreciation for the work of the Royal Australian Air Force. It is a good thing that the parliament has discussions about defence related issues. All too seldom do we have the opportunity to talk about these matters. The parliamentary program that has been referred to by other speakers is an excellent way in which many members can gain exposure to something of the life of our military. The challenge for all of us in this place as we progress in these debates is to go beyond simply regurgitating the little bits of information we pick up as we wander around Defence establishments to being able to critically analyse what is going on.
With respect to the RAAF—and particularly with respect to Amberley air base at Ipswich, in my colleague the member for Oxley's electorate—the F111s based at Amberley are extraordinary aircraft. They have many unique capabilities that set them apart from all other aircraft flying in the world. It is no secret that the United States has on a couple of occasions sought the support of Australia and the provision of our F111s to engagements that the US has been involved in since they mothballed all of their F111s. For various reasons we have not done that. In fact, I am trying to think whether or not the F111s have been in a combat environment since they were first acquired. I am not sure they have. But there is no doubt that they are a particularly capable aircraft.
There is also no doubt that dominance of the air is the single most critical thing that all nations look to when it comes to matters of national security and defence. In spite of the great work done by our Air Force personnel—exceedingly well led by the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Angus Houston, a person of high integrity and well regarded in this place—they have been let down by poor decision making on the part of the Howard government.
We are at the point where the F111s are to be phased out, and the decision to replace them is vitally important to the security of our nation as we move through the first two and possibly three decades of this new century. It was somewhat astounding to find out how the current government decided to handle that matter. There was a program for the defence department and the Air Force to evaluate the various options—the various platforms available around the world. Without any forewarning, without any proper analysis, the government simply scrapped that process, threw it out the window and made an announcement that we were going to participate in the joint strike fighter, or JSF, program. That stunned everybody in the defence community. I want to read from an article in the Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter of July-August last year, when that decision was taken. Referring to the decision by the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, it said: 
Hill's announcement spread through the Australian and international defence and aerospace industries within minutes. In the Canberra offices of BAE Systems, the European Aircraft, Defence and Space company, Dassault and the French defence marketing agency SOFEMA, the announcement was initially met with disbelief.
The timing was personally devastating for at least one Dassault staffer. On the morning of 27 June—
that was the day the government made its announcement—
the company's newly appointed manager for Air 6000 ... arrived in from France to set up a marketing office ... that was expected to last five years.
He got off the plane to set up this office for five years, to be involved in the evaluation program, only to discover that the morning he had arrived the government had made up its mind—before there had been any evaluation whatsoever. The article in the Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter goes on to say:
... [that gentleman] flew home in early July, with Dassault deciding corporately to scrap all plans for a further Australian presence.
That is, as a result of this government's mishandling of this most critical of acquisitions, Dassault decided they wanted nothing to do with us anymore. The same could be said of others who were involved. So bad was the process, British Aerospace first found out about it when they got a phone call from a journalist.
This was a disgraceful way to conduct the acquisition of the most important platform this nation will acquire for the defence of our territory for the next 30 years. JSF may turn out to be a brilliant plane and may turn out to do everything we want; the fact is we do not know. The government does not know and the minister does not know, but they have pre-emptively decided to acquire that aircraft, without any consideration of alternative platforms or the needs that we have as a nation in the two decades ahead. Our defence personnel and our nation deserve far better planning and competence from governments and ministers than they have been receiving from this government since it was first elected in 1996 and from the litany of ministers and department secretaries that have come and gone in that time.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2003-11-24,"—I rise to speak on Mr Ripoll's motion as it appears on the Notice Paper. I concur with the statements by other members of this House that the Australian Air Force does indeed play a vital role in the defence of this nation. The F111 is a very important defence asset to this country, with long-range strike capabilities. The men and women of RAAF Base Amberley are certainly to be commended for their skill and professionalism in maintaining the F111 in a combat-ready state, despite its advancing age. It still is an impressive aircraft, with the ability to carry a heavy weapons load up to 1,000 nautical miles and, as was said earlier, the ability to travel at over twice the speed of sound. With modern electronic systems, it is still a very potent combat weapon.
I note there is some criticism of the new joint strike fighter program. I should hark back to when the F111 was to be acquired, because there was considerable concern then about whether this new plane, this revolutionary F111 with its swing-wing design, would work in practice for Australia. It has proven to be a vital piece of our defence hardware. 
I also participated in the recent Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program with Airlift Group, located at RAAF Base Richmond. The group operates Lockheed C130Hs and Js, Caribous and Boeing 707 refuelling tankers. I would have to concur with other members speaking on this motion that the skills and professionalism of the Airlift Group at Richmond are a credit to the country, just as those of the personnel at Amberley are a credit to the country. Airlift Group have distinguished themselves in a range of operations, including Iraq, where Hercules C130 transports flew 1,180 sorties carrying some 3,600 tonnes of cargo, 8,000 passengers and 600 medical cases.
The tragedy in Bali showcased the capabilities of Airlift Group in responding to an emergency. Operation Bali Assist, which took place between 13 and 15 October 2002, involved five aircraft and aeromedical evacuation teams. During Bali Assist, 11 missions were flown between Bali and Darwin carrying 68 medical patients and 22 other evacuees. Airlift Group also carried 35 patients from Darwin to southern cities for treatment. The nation watched and appreciated the professionalism of Airlift Group in that vital moment of need for so many Australians overseas. In the Solomons the C130s again were active, transporting some 2,000 tonnes of cargo and some 3,200 passengers in support of our operations in that theatre. The Bali evacuation and the operations in Iraq and the Solomons clearly displayed the total professionalism of Airlift Group Richmond and the total professionalism of our Air Force.
The Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program gave me as a member of this House a valuable insight into the day-to-day operations of our military, the high levels of performance expected of our defence personnel and the high level of responsibility placed on very young officers. The fact that they pass with flying colours shows their enthusiasm for the job and their enthusiasm for defending our nation.
The defence experience at Richmond was indeed a varied one. On that defence rotation we had the opportunity to observe the packing of parachutes, the preparation of loads to be dropped from aircraft, vehicle and aircraft repair and maintenance, control tower operation, and logistics and planning. We also had the opportunity to join the night security patrol, accompanying the dog handlers around the base in the very late hours of the night—I must say it was quite cool, being the middle of winter. We met the fire crews and were involved in the PT sessions in the morning. We also had the opportunity to use the flight simulator and had some flying time in both Caribous and Hercules.
I would like to commend all the staff of the heavy lift group at RAAF Richmond. I would especially like to thank Warrant Officer (Discipline) Brewer for his assistance during the week, and the men and women of the sergeants mess at Richmond for their hospitality and camaraderie. I would also like to thank Warrant Officer Roy Eggmolesse, who put together the program at Richmond. The men and women of Airlift Group Richmond could have no greater advocate than their member, the member for Macquarie, who is very proud of their achievements. He has the great honour of representing the fine men and women of the base at Richmond. I would also like to thank the commander of the base. The very fine job that his staff do is a credit to him.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—As a nation we are recognising the importance of ensuring that our river systems are healthy. In Tasmania we are not immune to environmental problems associated with inland waterways. The South Esk River, the state's largest river, located in northern Tasmania, arises in the mountainous country to the north of Ben Lomond before discharging into the Tamar estuary in Launceston. The South Esk is a major source of electricity generation, domestic drinking water, irrigation and agricultural supply and is a major recreational attraction. The South Esk is also a dumping ground for effluent, and there are growing concerns that the river system is under increasing pressure from ageing and inefficient water and sewage treatment plants. As a society we need to better explore the ways we utilise waste water. We must have a sustained effort to reduce the amount of discharge into our river systems. The Esk also presents a challenge when it comes to siltation management. A photo in today's local paper clearly shows silted water in the Tamar yacht basin. The Howard government claims debt reduction as one of its principal achievements; the corollary, of course, is that it has done so through running down spending on key community needs. I call on the Howard government to enhance its support of community efforts to improve environmental infrastructure and, in particular, the quality of northern Tasmanian river systems.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Environment: Tasmanian Rivers</title>,Statements by Members,3,1
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—I move:
That this House give consideration to a new program of infrastructure development in Australia called “Build the Nation” in cooperation with state and local governments and private enterprise and having regard to:
(1)	the primary obligation of States for the maintenance of public infrastructure; and
(2)	a reasonable allocation of available resources between city and country areas.
This motion concerns my electorate and, beyond, it concerns the nation. In his speech on strategic leadership a year ago, the Prime Minister identified as one of the deep-seated values common to all Australians `having a go'. By this motion—and I thank my colleagues for their support—I identify three new areas of policy development in which I propose, at the start of this new century and millennium, Australia should have a go if we are to continue to grow stronger, more prosperous and more happy as a people over time.
There is no question that accepted Commonwealth priorities, such as economic prosperity and national security, remain paramount. But, as nations change and circumstances fluctuate, legislators, I believe, have a duty to identify and lead where they can on new national concerns. The circumstances that make it appropriate to consider such a program in the area of infrastructure development are: firstly, the significant increase in Australia's population over the last 30 years, in which our population has almost doubled, and what can be expected over the next 50 years if Australia continues to be, as I believe it should be, a nation that has a robust immigration program; secondly, the challenges of globalisation, which this government has so successfully taken on since 1996 and which we must assume will continue; and, thirdly, the fact that, through significant fiscal reform, the vertical imbalance that has underscored Commonwealth-state relations in the past and held up significant development has been resolved through the GST and other measures. That last feature, of itself, means that it is now more important than ever that all three levels of government have a precise understanding of the limits of involvement, particularly by the Commonwealth, in infrastructure development. This proposal concerns the country, the city and our national identity. 
Infrastructure change in this country, without doubt, must begin with perhaps our greatest national dilemma, which is water. This motion proposes that through Commonwealth leadership at all levels of government there is developed a coordinated, comprehensive policy on water that clarifies property water rights—as the admirable national water initiative of the Deputy Prime Minister does—and restores water flows to our stressed rivers, as proposed by the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists. This policy on water should also deal with other related concerns, and these are, in particular, but in no special order: the maintenance of adequate water supplies to our burgeoning cities, the eradication of city ocean outfalls that pollute our oceans, the development of sewage treatment works that recycle water and sewage for agricultural and other uses, the development of a desalination program, the more effective delivery of water to our farms, more sustainable irrigation practices, a plan to stop the shrinkage of artesian basin reserves, and retention of the great water collection areas and their natural heritage—such as the Paroo and the Snowy. Such a program will not be developed overnight, but I propose that sufficient funds be dedicated to a research program through the Department of the Environment and Heritage, with all levels of government in agreement, by no later than 2005.
Most Australians live in our cities. This fact gives rise to special problems of amenity and quality of life linked closely to the urban environment. I therefore propose that Australia develop a national urban policy. For example, in my electorate of Wentworth, the most densely populated electorate in the country, there are new challenges not anticipated by planners a century or so ago and beyond the capacity of local level planners to solve. Public transport on many principal roads has almost ground to a halt during peak periods on weekdays and weekends. Basic road and transport infrastructure is under stress and without new ideas, under the leadership of three levels of government working together with local communities, there will be no change.
In Wentworth, a forum of all three levels of government has recommended consideration of alternative transport solutions, such as light rail. Similarly, under the Naturoll Heritage Trust mark 2, we need stormwater and sewage solutions that assist urban communities and the scarce natural heritage of our cities. There is scope through the department of industry to develop centres of excellence, innovation and specialised employment in partnership with universities and TAFEs.
The final objective in this proposal is to revive what I would loosely call `spiritual values' in society. By these I mean something exogenous, something outside ourselves as individuals, such that we can build a society based around communities and community groups, in which our education is based on civic values and in which we build a heritage of respect for the aged, those of different backgrounds and even those of different values and religious beliefs, so long as they are prepared to contribute to growing and improving a great Australian nation. This will be a society in which the vision of our artists is respected and in which bureaucracy is not seen to solve all the problems. Problems will be resolved in local areas through a social infrastructure encouraging volunteerism, conservation and heritage and civic values of pride in family and country. This solution calls on parliament to take steps, to go on and build the nation in our third century. I take pride in joining my colleagues in the proposal before the House.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I rise to speak on the private members' motion moved by the member for Wentworth regarding the need for a new infrastructure program to be called `Build the Nation'. Unfortunately this is only half of a good motion, because it is spoiled by ideology and more than just a hint of hypocrisy. I have spoken on a number of occasions in this place of the need for large-scale, nation-building infrastructure programs, so I can agree with the first point of the motion. I believe that the federal government exists to build and maintain the nation. However, the ideology gives itself away with the talk of handing these programs over to the states and to private enterprise. You cannot `build the nation' on a state-by-state, piecemeal basis. When you leave major national infrastructure programs to the states you end up with three different gauges in the railways. It was only with the passage of 100 years and leadership from the federal Labor government that standardisation across the railways came. National leadership on infrastructure has its responsibilities, and by handing everything over to the states the federal government would be abrogating its responsibilities in this area.
If we are to truly build a nation, it will require not only the leadership of the federal government but also ongoing support and drive to see the projects through to the end and to maintain them after. Just one example of where the federal government has failed miserably in this area is happening now in my own electorate and throughout Western Sydney. I speak of the Western Sydney Orbital—or, as it is now known, the M7. This is the last link in the national highway system that stretches over 18,500 kilometres around Australia. It is wholly within the federal government's jurisdiction to build and maintain, yet this government has completely backed out of its responsibility and forced the New South Wales government and the private road builders to take responsibility for the construction and maintenance of this federal road. As a result of federal government neglect, Western Sydney motorists will be forced to pay a toll of at least $5.50 to drive on the national highway. This government has privatised the national highway.
Major nation-building infrastructure should not be privatised. Nation building and privatisation are two mutually exclusive concepts. Yet that is what this motion suggests we should do: sell off that which builds and maintains our nation. Certainly there is a role for the private sector, but it can be done in a way that does not mean privatisation. The concept of nation building is foreign to the government. If they were truly interested in building our nation or investing in national infrastructure, they would have built the orbital themselves and they would not have slashed millions of dollars from public education. That is why I say this motion has more than just a hint of hypocrisy about it. The motion before us reads:
That this House give consideration to a new program of infrastructure development in Australia called “Build the Nation” ...
Infrastructure is far more than just buildings or roads, and the infrastructure that needs to be developed in Australia in order to build our future includes things like educational infrastructure. What better way is there to build our nation than by investing in the education of our population, like the Labor government did when it created the University of Western Sydney and some 15 other universities during the 1980s? Yet across the tertiary system some $5 billion has been ripped out of higher education since the election of the Howard government. At the primary and high school levels, the failed and discredited enrolment benchmark adjustment system took millions of dollars from public schools, most of which have never recovered. You cannot `build the nation' without investing in the educational infrastructure that will provide the foundation for our country's future. 
This motion has good intentions. It suggests that we need to build the nation with investment in infrastructure, and I could not agree more. Unfortunately, it is also deeply flawed, mired in ideology and hypocrisy. It abrogates all responsibility by trying to hand everything off to the states, to local councils and to privatisation. It says, `We want to build the nation, just as long as we don't get our hands dirty.' It does not work that way. The federal government exists to both build and maintain the nation, and it cannot do this if it refuses to take up its responsibilities because it is too busy passing the buck to somebody else.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Economy: Infrastructure Development</title>,Private Members' Business,16,1
"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—I was very pleased to second the motion put forward by my good friend the member for Wentworth. In principle, he and I face very similar challenges in our electorates. They are challenges that befall what are increasingly popular areas of Australia. The member for Wentworth spoke of how his electorate is the most densely populated electorate in Australia. I speak from the angle that my electorate of Moncrieff is part of a city that has been Australia's fastest growing city for the last 30 years and is anticipated to continue to be Australia's fastest growing city for the next 25 years. This places unique challenges on a city like the Gold Coast. Fifty years ago it was a sleepy hamlet; these days, Gold Coast City is Australia's sixth largest city, with a net population growth of 15,000 per annum. What is more, that growth shows no sign of abating.
This motion addresses a fundamental aspect of what government policy should be looking at. I commend the member for Wentworth for moving a motion whose essence is building the nation in a cooperative sense between state and local governments and private enterprise, to ensure that we develop and maintain public infrastructure, recognising that there needs to be a reasonable balance between city and country areas. All of this must be maintained within the framework that the primary responsibility—not the sole responsibility—for the provision of public infrastructure sits, sometimes uncomfortably and sometimes comfortably, with state governments. I can speak at a local level for my constituents on the Gold Coast when I say that, because of our growing population, the unique challenges we face are now being felt in very real terms.
It is interesting that this private member's motion coincides with the release today of a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration that looks at the revamp that is required between federal, state and local relations following an 18-month inquiry into cost shifting. The report is a unanimous report, which means that it has the support of both the opposition and the government. There are 18 recommendations made in the report, and I would like to highlight a few for the House today. Key among them is the call for an urgent meeting to be held between the Prime Minister, the federal Treasurer, state and territory premiers, chief ministers, treasurers and representatives of local government from each state to develop a federal-state intergovernmental agreement on the roles and responsibilities of local government and to determine funding sources to meet those responsibilities. 
The report also recommends that federal-state specific purpose payment agreements require state governments to report on what responsibilities they intend to hand to local government and the volume of funds to be distributed to local government to perform those functions. It further recommends that local government bodies be required to audit the state of their infrastructure and provide status reports to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The piece de resistance: it recommends a summit on intergovernmental relations be held by COAG in 2005. But the question is: why make these key recommendations as part of the inquiry? In essence, it comes down to one fundamental fact, and that is that there has been increasing cost shifting to local governments, principally by state governments.
To highlight a major problem on the Gold Coast, I will talk about road funding. In the last five or so years, in the period from 1997-98 to 2002, Queensland state government direct spending on council roads fell from $252 million to $234 million—a fall of $18 million—despite the fact that the Beattie Labor government is receiving record amounts of GST and FAGs. What is the federal government doing? I do not believe in throwing barbs unless there is some backup from the federal government. What we see is that federal government spending has increased, from $365 million to $445 million; and, on top of that, the federal government is also providing direct to council funding through the Roads to Recovery program.
There are many pressing concerns in my electorate, and the most fundamental is roads. It is very clear that, when it comes to infrastructure spending, the Queensland government—and it is an analogy for the rest of Australia—is tending to be capital focused on major projects and is not really looking at what local governments need in urban areas.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—Yes, there does need to be more infrastructure programs in Australia, and this was clearly identified in a report of a former House of Representatives committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services, of which I was deputy chair, in 2000. It showed that there was very uneven distribution of funds for infrastructure and that there was a need to identify those needs on a national basis and to have a means by which regions could be connected to opportunities for public and private investment and be provided with information from all three levels of government. We identified that at least $20 billion was needed to catch up on all infrastructure across this nation; that is, merely to catch up on, not to expand. That included all infrastructure needs in regional areas for health, education and economic survival.
One of the recommendations in that report was the establishment of a national infrastructure advisory council to facilitate the provision of national infrastructure and to report through COAG to the ministers responsible for regional development. That sort of body could direct and coordinate a proposal such as that which is being suggested. But to lump responsibility on the states is not the most economic way to achieve goals, and I also do not believe that it is the primary responsibility of the states to maintain all public infrastructure. The honourable member for Wentworth might read this report, as it comprehensively identified many of the current problems and suggested clear and precise ways of dealing with them. His government has had the report since 2000. 
State and local governments can be in a unique position to recommend the best way to approach a particular project but, when it comes to projects such as roads and railways, they have a habit of crossing borders and boundaries—sometimes many boundaries. Then you need federal facilitation to ensure that the whole job is completed. Other recommendations in the report were that the Commonwealth government encourage the states to support regional road planning with all the stakeholders. For example, I am very conscious of some roads that have been developed on boundaries in Tasmania. You get silly outcomes such as a line down the middle of a main road, one side being repaired by one council and the other side by the council next door—and they do not always do the repairs at the same time. Roads have often been used as `carrots' to local government; for example, a state government may say that they will take over road X and do it up if the local government does Y on the other side. I have seen situations where a council road has been done up and the state government have not done up theirs. We need proper guidelines and service obligations to be adhered to by those offering the services to the regions, so that the regions do not become the poor relations of the suburbs.
As for the second part of the motion, on available resources we can only assume that this means that there is an insufficient mix now. I agree with that. We have altogether too few resources allocated to country areas, especially for infrastructure services like Telstra and the ABC, which are suffering from insufficient funds to keep services in the country, let alone expand them.
I was pleased to see ABC NewsRadio extended to Launceston last week, until I heard that it was at the expense of ABC TV reception in the valleys to the west of Launceston in my electorate. That is not good enough. We need more resources allocated to the regions to cope with these changes and allow people to at least keep the services they use and to get access to others—such as broadband, which is limited to the cities in Tasmania.
The honourable member for Wentworth, who moved this motion, comes from a very affluent inner city seat which may not know much about the difficulties that those of us in the bush have to put up with. Even those in the outer suburbs have huge difficulties compared to those who live in the leafy luxury of Woollahra or such places. So what really is the honourable member's interest in this subject that he has taken on? That is also a question to be asked. The nation at the moment is being built in two classes—those that have and those that have not. We have the information here and we should use this report.

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2003-11-24,"—It is my pleasure to speak on this motion as it appears in the Notice Paper. From my perspective as the member for Cowper, representing the North Coast, I am very focused on transport and telecommunications as two of the important areas of infrastructure for my region. Telecommunications is a major driver of wealth and prosperity in the bush, as are road infrastructure and transport infrastructure generally. Without the vital link that is our road system, many of the activities that occur in regional and rural areas just could not occur. Every item that is exported from a regional or rural area generally starts its journey on a local road. The road system is a vital piece of infrastructure. The freight task in this nation is going to double by the year 2020, and the states really need to be looking at the provision of more money for infrastructure. They have received the GST—important growth funding for the states—and they have received a wealth of stamp duty. We would like to see a lot of that money going into vital transport infrastructure, particularly in regional and rural areas. The federal government has been active in the area of transport— 
—The member for Lyons didn't take that into account.
—indeed not—in pioneering AusLink, which is a national strategy for transport aimed at coming up with an integrated approach to total land transport. Also, the federal government has been very active along the east coast of my electorate. The federal government has committed some $600 million to the upgrade of the Pacific Highway for the 10-year period ending 2005-06. Despite the fact that that vital road was designed and built by and is owned and maintained by the state, the federal government has been supporting it.
My focus as a local member is very much on saving lives. Regrettably, on the Pacific Highway there are a number of spots which have claimed the lives of local residents. There is no more important example of that than Wrights Corner, which is near Macksville. Since 2000 there have been some seven fatalities on this very dangerous corner on the Pacific Highway. In the most recent tragedy, on 15 October, two people were killed in a horrific accident involving four vehicles. One of those killed was a local high school teacher, the very much loved and respected Mr Phil Stewart. He was a highly regarded teacher and highly regarded member of the Nambucca Shire community. On 21 October there was a memorial service for Mr Stewart, attended by some 700 people. It certainly highlighted the impact of such tragic road accidents on the families and friends of the victims and on the community generally. I would like to formally record my condolences in the House to the families of those killed in this horrific accident. Following this accident, I held some discussions with Mr Peter O'Neill, the Principal of Macksville High School. He advised me that the Macksville community will soon present a petition to me, which I intend to table in parliament. I understand this petition is going to focus on the need for government at all levels to invest funding in roads with a view to, very importantly, saving lives.
Recently in Macksville there was concern about the issue of the XPT services being cancelled. The state government is again looking at closing down services in rural and regional areas. It is looking at closing down XPT services, bringing more buses onto the Pacific Highway and putting more people at risk on what is a very busy road. But AusLink is looking at improving our general transport infrastructure, removing some of the inefficiencies that currently exist and ensuring that we get cost-effective, efficient transport outcomes that involve not only roads but also a combination of roads and rail. It will certainly be looking at the freight task and the passenger transport task into the future.
I would like to commend the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr John Anderson, for the focus he has maintained on improving our rail network and the ability for rail to transport a higher proportion of the freight task. Getting more freight efficiently onto the rail network will take some of the burden off the Pacific Highway and will make the Pacific Highway less congested by heavy transport vehicles. Mr Anderson has certainly been working very hard, negotiating with the New South Wales government to come up with an agreement by which the federal government will take a lease on that line, look to invest more money in rail and complement the improvements that are already under way on the Pacific Highway. Certainly in my electorate there is a view that the Pacific Highway is a priority.

"Jenkins, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—This motion is very timely in the context of independent analysis by organisations such as Engineers Australia and AusCID which have estimated the backlog for infrastructure to be in the order of $20 billion. This debate is not for some analysis of why we have gotten to this situation. Deputy Speaker Adams, the member for Lyons, in his contribution mentioned the work of a former House of Representatives committee, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services, in investigating infrastructure needs in the rural area. There have been countless inquiries, not only by parliamentary committees but also by a number of other committees, that have indicated this increasing backlog. This backlog arises because we get behind in the renewal and maintenance of infrastructure and because, as the population of Australia grows, we cannot commit resources to the provision of proper infrastructure for that population.
It has to be a shared responsibility. We cannot continue to have debates where there is finger pointing, where there are people saying, `It's the states' fault,' or, `It's local government's fault.' The national government has to understand that it can play a role not only as a leader but also as a provider. I have argued this constantly. I think there is a capacity for a national government to be involved with communities, whether they are inner urban, outer urban or rural—as has been mentioned in this debate—in the delivery of programs that can address some of these infrastructure needs. This has to be done quickly.
I will take my electorate, an outer urban area in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, as an example. This area has been constantly growing over the last couple of decades. It never wins a gold medal for growth but it is always there on the list of placegetters. The continual pressure in outer urban areas, such as those I represent, is tangible. Let us look at road services. Despite the duplication of Cooper Street and the building of the Craigieburn bypass, there are deficiencies. These could be addressed by building new north-south routes, such as the E6 freeway, and by upgrading and further duplicating roads, such as Plenty Road. East-west private traffic could be improved by proper planning for an outer ring-road—an outer orbital which could connect all the growing and new areas on the outskirts of Melbourne.
We should look at public transport. In my local area heavy rail must be taken beyond Epping to South Morang and Mernda, which are now the developing nodes of population. Epping North, a new estate about to be commenced, must be provided with public transport. Light rail must go beyond McKimmies Road, Mill Park. We must remember that light rail was extended from Bundoora to Mill Park under a federal government program, Building Better Cities, which demonstrated not only what could be achieved but also the need to extend it to South Morang and perhaps even beyond. I have raised with the state minister for transport that in Melbourne we should be looking at innovative ways of integrating our bus network with our rail network by using the rail easements, as has been done in both Adelaide and Brisbane. These are things which a federal government can show leadership on.
Telecom infrastructure has been mentioned. Even in a constituency like mine, where we have new estates being built, because of the appalling telecom infrastructure there is uncertain access to broadband services. In terms of utilities infrastructure, we see the need for mains water pipes, waste water services and gas and electricity services. This illustrates the need for not only the renewal and maintenance of that type of infrastructure but also the provision of that infrastructure in new areas. These are all issues that relate, in my case, to urban needs. They should be looked at not just in the context of what the local community needs but also because of their economic, social and environmental impacts, in the context of national and regional problems. 
I stress, therefore, that there is a need for the national government to take on board these issues of infrastructure and realise that there is a need for a population and settlement policy that can be integrated with the way in which we achieve the provision of infrastructure. We can look not only at physical infrastructure but also at social infrastructure—health, education and the like. Only by looking at these in a holistic way and with all levels of government joining together with communities can we move towards sustainable communities. I hope that these issues will be investigated in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage inquiry into sustainable cities 2025. I think that this building a nation program could be a step towards having a proper federal involvement in the provision of infrastructure. (Time expired)

"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	recognises the development and distribution of the tetanus vaccine in developed countries such as Australia has led to the virtual elimination of the disease;
(2)	notes tetanus continues to be a major cause of fatalities in many developing countries, with some 100 million people still at risk of contracting the disease;
(3)	calls for measures to be implemented that will lead to the elimination of tetanus in developing countries; and
(4)	recognises the efforts of UNICEF and its programs in attempting to reduce tetanus in communities around the world.
To start with, I would like to thank my colleague the member for Pearce, Judi Moylan, for agreeing to second this motion so that it could be put forward and discussed in this parliament in a bipartisan way. Tetanus is a disease caused by a bacterium called Clostridium tetani. The bacteria secrete a neurotoxin that affects the central nervous system and causes muscular contractions so fast that they cannot be distinguished from each other and become one continuous spasm. The old-fashioned name for tetanus was lockjaw, from the contraction of and stiffness in the jaw muscles that were characteristic of the disease. Tetanus can be fatal but is preventable by vaccination.
In June this year, along with others from the parliamentary UNICEF group, I met with Dr Francois Gasse, UNICEF head of tetanus immunisation. For people in the industrialised world, tetanus is largely a thing of the past due to routine immunisation. But in impoverished countries the disease remains endemic. Indeed, tetanus is the leading cause of neonatal mortality in the poorest parts of the world. Today, 70 years since the vaccine became available, some 100 million people are still at risk of one of the most painful deaths known to medicine.
Tetanus spores exist naturally in the soil everywhere, and the bacteria can penetrate through the smallest cut or even a simple scratch. If a person has not been vaccinated, tetanus will spread through the body, releasing a potent poison that disrupts the motor nerves and causes severe muscle spasms. There is no cure—only sedation in an effort to minimise the seizures. Because tetanus causes stiffness of the jaw and facial muscles, victims cannot eat and must be tube-fed. Fewer than 20 per cent survive. Newborns in developing countries are commonly infected when their umbilical cords are cut in unsanitary conditions. Yet if a mother is vaccinated, she passes her immunity to her baby, who is protected for the first few months of life. 
Dr Francois Gasse, head of UNICEF's tetanus immunisation programs, graduated from medical school in France in 1973 and then earned a master's degree in public health from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland. Gasse made tetanus his career focus in the early 1980s, when it was a major killer in 115 countries. He worked for the World Health Organisation before joining UNICEF in February 2000 to focus on eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus (MNT) around the world. In his quest to stop tetanus, Gasse has travelled to the farthest corners of 92 countries. Thanks largely to the efforts of Gasse, today tetanus affects the people of only 53 countries. By the year 2010, he hopes to see it eliminated altogether.
UNICEF is committed to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, including the improvement of maternal health. As part of UNICEF's priority strategy called `Immunisation Plus', there is a determination to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus by the end of 2005. It is an ambitious goal but, given the will and the resources, it is possible.
In 2003 UNICEF Australia began its fundraising campaign in support of MNT by pledging to contribute $A5 million to the global effort. While still encouraging and welcoming financial support from individuals and companies, UNICEF Australia in 2004 will also seek funds from the Australian government, through AusAID, to provide project support for routine immunisation, including MNT, to a number of countries in our region including Cambodia, Indonesia, Burma, Papua New Guinea and Timor Leste.
The UN Millennium Development Goals call on all of us to play our part to ensure a more equitable and safe world. UNICEF Australia is doing just that by promoting an opportunity for all Australians to become part of UNICEF's work for children and women by joining the Global Parent program. Members may have already seen the current television commercials that are running nationally, as well as the billboards in several states that urge fellow Australians to play their part in helping UNICEF make a world fit for children. In developed countries such as Australia routine tetanus immunisation has almost eliminated tetanus from the community. However, 70 years since the vaccine became available, some 100 million people are still at risk of one of the most painful deaths known.
Dr Gasse is largely responsible for reducing the impact of tetanus so that it now affects only 53 countries—and he continues to work towards its elimination by 2010. I have brought forward this motion to urge the government to consider providing the assistance that would help Dr Gasse and UNICEF in their work to eliminate tetanus in all developing countries around the world.
 (Mr Jenkins)—Is the motion seconded?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Tetanus</title>,Private Members' Business,17,1
"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—I second the motion. I am very pleased to support this motion put forward by my colleague the member for Charlton, who has shown a continuing effort with these issues. The member for Charlton has well described the horrors of tetanus. The medical fraternity recognises that dying from tetanus is one of the most painful deaths mankind can experience. The bacteria can very simply enter the body through any cut or scratch. It is found naturally in soil everywhere, and it has a most dreadful effect on babies in particular, whose chances of surviving tetanus are virtually zero. 
Fortunately, as the member for Charlton has said, a vaccine was discovered 70 years ago and Australian children are successfully protected from this terrible sickness. For children immunised in the first year of life tetanus is a thing of the past. Certainly this is the case in the industrialised world. In impoverished countries the disease remains endemic. Newborn babies are especially at risk when the umbilical cord is cut in unsanitary conditions. Tetanus is the leading source of neonatal mortality in the poorest parts of the world, according to Dr Francois Gasse, who leads a project to eliminate tetanus by 2010.
As my colleague the member for Charlton has already said, we had the opportunity to meet Dr Gasse. He was introduced to us by Samithra Bala, the UNICEF project coordinator. Gasse is a French physician currently heading UNICEF's tetanus immunisation program. He has devoted his whole career to this disease. Confronting some of the most fearful conditions and putting his own life at risk, Dr Gasse's commitment to eliminating tetanus is indeed an inspiration to all those who have had the privilege of meeting him.
The partnership between Gasse, UNICEF and WHO to eliminate tetanus is working. Tetanus has been a major killer in 115 countries, and the work of the partnership has reduced that risk. Today the target is to eliminate tetanus in 53 countries and to eliminate it altogether by 2010. The project is impressive and it deserves our support. I hope that the government and the Australian public will take this matter to heart, recognising the terrible trauma that it causes to families living in undeveloped countries. This program has the potential to save around 200,000 babies who currently die every year from tetanus, and the tri-part plan to immunise 240 million mothers in developing countries is a very important one. Other aspects of the plan are the improvement of birthing practices through education and the monitoring of highrisk communities.
But the immunisation of mothers is one of the most important aspects of this program, because the antibodies cross the placenta and provide protection for babies before they are born. UNICEF believes that it is possible through this plan to conquer maternal and neonatal tetanus within three years. The importance of this program succeeding was well summarised by leading medical broadcaster Dr Norman Swan, who said:
Tetanus is a horror disease that has long disappeared from Western consciousness. But it mustn't disappear from Western consciences because every day thousands of babies and indeed mothers die of this entirely preventable disease—all for the sake of a $2 immunisation.
Tetanus is an important issue for those living in countries where the disease still prevails. As I said, I hope the Australian public and the government will make a contribution toward completely eliminating this entirely preventable disease.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Tetanus</title>,Private Members' Business,17,1
"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Charlton and seconded by the member for Pearce. Maternal and neonatal tetanus is something that has disappeared from the consciousness of many Australians because it is not something that affects Australians generally these days. Tetanus vaccination is extremely common in Australia, and very few people would have ever known anyone or heard of anyone who had contracted tetanus. But in developing countries, where tetanus vaccinations are not common, it is something that kills many women and children every year. 
Tetanus bacteria is generally present in soil and in human and animal faeces. UNICEF estimates that 100 million mothers and newborn babies are in danger of contracting tetanus. The tetanus spores get into open cuts during childbirth, either through the umbilical cord or the body of the mother. If the mother has been immunised in advance, she passes on her immunity to her newborn. But, if she has not been immunised, the tetanus spores act like a poison and cause spasms, stiffness and arching of the spine. Ultimately, breathing becomes very difficult and the spasms occur more frequently. The member for Charlton said that very few people survive tetanus, and indeed UNICEF's own estimates are that between 70 per cent and 100 per cent of cases end in a very painful, torturous and unnecessary death. Remembering that vaccination costs only a little over $2 per person, it seems immoral not to offer this vaccination as widely as possible. It is one of the cheapest vaccines that we have and, when you know of the number of infections and the pain experienced by people who contract tetanus, it does seem immoral not to offer it as widely as possible.
In 2003, UNICEF Australia began its fundraising campaign in support of maternal and neonatal tetanus vaccination by pledging $5 million of its own money to the global effort. It is fantastic that UNICEF should be able to collect this money from individuals and companies, but it is also important that the Australian government should contribute to this effort. I know that the member for Charlton has had a longstanding interest in this. She is too modest to tell you herself, but she wrote as early as July to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and asked him whether the Australian government could make a contribution to this program to provide tetanus vaccinations to mothers. Unfortunately, while the minister's reply, which came in August, was a very pleasant and polite letter, it was a letter saying no, the government was not prepared to contribute extra money to this very important effort. I hope that the member for Pearce, having said that she believes it is important for the government to also contribute, will be able to approach the Minister for Foreign Affairs again and perhaps suggest that he might reconsider that decision.
To date, more than 33 million women in high-risk countries have received the tetanus toxoid vaccine, and the delivery of this vaccination has been an incredibly impressive effort by UNICEF. The vaccine has been delivered by car, by bus, on foot, on horseback and even by motorcycle. This has set up an excellent infrastructure for the delivery of other vaccines. There are numerous examples that people can look at on the UNICEF web site if they want to see the program in action. I certainly hope, with the member for Charlton and the member for Pearce, that this is something that not only the Australian public but also the Australian government will be able to commit to.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Tetanus</title>,Private Members' Business,17,1
"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—I would like to thank the member for Charlton for making the House aware of the important issue of tetanus. The neurotoxic clostridia tetanus—C. tetani—is an acute disease in which the clinical effects of a potent neurotoxin, tetanospasmin, manifest themselves with generalised rigidity and intermittent intense muscle spasms. C. tetani is an anaerobic gram positive bacillus commonly found in the soil, the intestines of domestic animals and, occasionally, human faeces. Spores are introduced into the tissues after a penetrative injury. After the spores germinate, tetanus toxin is produced by replicating bacteria and is released by cell lysis. Tetanus and botulin toxins are of similar potency and are the most powerful bacterial toxins known. Only one antigenic type of tetanus toxin exists, making possible an effective toxoid for immunisation. 
Tetanus is now rare in industrialised countries, because of the widespread use of active immunisation. The few cases that occur in these countries occur in inadequately immunised persons and persons older than 60 years of age, which emphasises the need to maintain immunity in older adults. All Australians should be revaccinated at the age of 50. Rural populations, immigrants and IV drug abusers are also at higher risk. In developing countries, tetanus is still a major problem, causing the deaths of an estimated one million persons annually—the World Health Organisation thinks the figure may possibly be lower, but these are the figures I was given—of which about half are newborns, mainly due to umbilical stump infections.
Tetanus toxin acts principally on the spinal cord, altering normal control of the reflex arc by suppressing the inhibition regularly mediated by the internuncial neurons. This suppression results in muscle spasm, with opposing muscles of greater strength dominating, resulting in the powerful masseter muscle of the jaw to spasm causing trismus, or lockjaw, and in extension of the lower extremities and flexion of the upper extremities. The incubation period between injury and the onset of symptoms ranges from one to 55 days. The shorter the incubation period, the higher the mortality rate—that is, in patients of less than 50 years of age the mortality rate is almost 100 per cent when this period is only one to two days.
Immunisation with diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus vaccine—or DPT—at two months of age, with two additional doses at four and six months of age, a booster at 18 months of age and again four years later is recommended, with a booster of adult type tetanus and diphtheria toxoids at 16 years of age. Thereafter immunity is maintained by booster injections every decade. In developing countries, immunisation of pregnant woman can prevent neonatal tetanus without teratogenicity.
I would like to acknowledge UNICEF and the World Health Organisation for their programs and efforts in attempting to reduce tetanus around the world. I support fully any measures that will lead to the introduction of universal childhood vaccines to prevent this disease in developing countries. Their target of achieving maternal and neonatal tetanus elimination by 2005 and the sustaining of elimination through strengthened routine immunisation and monitoring is to be commended.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Tetanus</title>,Private Members' Business,17,1
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—Like other speakers today, I would like to commend the member for Charlton for raising the issue of tetanus in the House today. I would also like to publicly acknowledge a deep and long held involvement in issues relating to developing countries. I also note the involvement of all the other speakers here today—we see the same speakers speaking on these issues. I am pleased to be able to speak on this issue and acknowledge the excellent work being done by UNICEF in developing countries. What a time we live in when it is far easier for rich nations to find the money to destroy other countries' vital infrastructure in the search for terrorists than it is to find the money to fund vitally important issues such as the one we are talking about today. It is interesting to note that Australia can find an extra $5 million to give to the Philippines to strengthen their counterterrorism strategies. How much more important it is for this government to increase funding for UNICEF's tetanus program. What a great goal it is to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus by the end of 2005—just 768 days away. 
Thankfully, in a country such as Australia tetanus is a rare disease with only 10 people per year being diagnosed and only one of those dying. However, as other speakers have said, in the developing countries in Asia, Africa and South America the situation is horrendous. Neonatal tetanus on those continents is killing about 800,000 babies each year. Goodness knows how many others suffer from the side effects of this horrible disease. The only effective way to reduce and finally eliminate this toll is to introduce an effective and widespread immunisation campaign—something UNICEF is busy implementing. Globally 100 million people are still at risk of contracting the disease of tetanus. The MNT immunisation commitment is strongly supported by UNICEF Australia. As the honourable member for Sydney said, this year it showed its support by beginning its fund raising campaign by pledging to contribute $A5 million to the global effort—a great effort and a great commitment.
As I said earlier, the target date for eliminating maternal and neonatal tetanus is just 768 days away. Currently the global campaign is going well. Through UNICEF's involvement, health workers are being trained to immunise thousands of women in those countries at risk. Vaccines are being delivered to rural and remote regions—possibly the areas of greatest risk—and public awareness campaigns are being put in place to highlight the dangers of MNT and the crucial importance of immunisation. Success is sweet. So far more than 33 million women in high-risk countries have received the tetanus toxoid vaccine. As well as those 33 million women, the drive to eliminate tetanus has other great side benefits. By assisting with the provision of comprehensive health care services and infrastructure in the fight to eliminate tetanus, other diseases will also be targeted as a consequence. What a great idea.
Like so many issues raised by the member for Charlton and others speaking on this today—people who have a commitment to the Third World and the underprivileged and dispossessed—I would commend this motion and urge all honourable members to keep abreast of UNICEF's great work on this commitment. Wouldn't it be wonderful two years from now to be standing in this House at about this time, congratulating the world community on having finally eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus from the globe, thereby emulating the feat of those who triumphed over smallpox? As I said, it is 768 days away. The task deserves our total support and commitment—the commitment of all the developed nations—and it can be achieved. I urge all members of this House to focus on this issue and to take a real interest in it.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Tetanus</title>,Private Members' Business,17,1
"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—I too would like to thank the member for Charlton for her motion and her interest in this particular area, and I would also like to thank the many members who spoke before me for their contributions. Tetanus remains one of the most terrifying of all diseases, and anyone who has seen a victim die of tetanus will tell you that it is a gruesome death. The face contorts in the dreadful rictus sardonicus, which gave it its former name, lockjaw. The body arches in spasms which rack the victim so terribly that they can actually snap the vertebrae. Most terrifying of all, this disease is not passed from carrier to carrier but from the earth itself, where the toxic spores lie in wait.
In Australia we are very blase about this disease. From childhood we grow up in an environment which, largely due to our climate and society, means we lead an outdoor life in close contact with nature. For our barefoot children a splinter in the foot or a cut to the finger are minor nuisances which are dealt with with a bandaid and a passing reflection: `It's okay; no need to see a doctor.' He or she has had their tetanus shot in primary school, so it is still effective. The worrying type of parent may actually go to their home filing cabinet and look up those old school immunisation certificates to establish whether their child has had all their school shots or whether they should take the child to a doctor for a back-up injection. What a wonderful system we have that gives us all those options. From childhood to adulthood, we Australians have an invisible safety net available. 
How often do we stop to consider that the same safety net, the same preventative security system of immunisation, is not available to a huge proportion of the population around the world? In the developing world, tetanus remains a terrible killer, not through random minor accidents like splinters in the finger but through the most universal of experiences—childbirth. In 57 developing countries, maternal and neonatal tetanus continues to be a major public health problem. Eight of those countries—India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia and China—account for 73 per cent of deaths caused by maternal and neonatal tetanus.
And how does tetanus—a disease which we in Australia are lucky to rarely, if ever, see—become a killer of mothers and their newborn babies? It is a reflection of the amazing good fortune and the quality of life that Australians not only enjoy but also take for granted. We find it so difficult to associate a disease caused by contamination from the soil—effectively it is by a microbe that lives in the dirt—with the pristine, hygienic, germ-free environment of childbirth that we know and expect. Again, it is a reflection of the lucky country we live in that this possibility is so remote from our lifestyle and our land.
In developing countries, women do not have their babies in an environment anywhere remotely like what we have or take for granted in Australia. If we were to see the conditions which those unfortunate women face, we would understand why childbirth is so often a ghastly lottery for women in developing countries which ends not in new life but in death—not only of the baby but also, painfully and lingeringly, of the mother.
Neonatal—newborn—tetanus is the most common form of tetanus in developing countries. It accounts for 14 per cent of all neonatal deaths—that is, deaths of newborn infants. We hear these sinister statistics so often. Infant mortality rates in the developing world read like telephone book numbers and we cannot comprehend what they mean. They may seem meaningless to some of us. `So many,' we think as we shrug and then think again, `By God and by the fact that we live in this country, we are very lucky indeed.'
But it is not luck at all. It is about living conditions that become dying conditions for too many young women and their babies who die terrible deaths that could have been prevented by immunisation programs. Two million children die each year from diseases like tetanus, for which vaccines are already available at low cost. Why aren't those vaccines available to save their lives? Geography, lack of transport, war and the inertia of governments create a climate ready to foster such dreadful diseases. Lack of clean water, health clinics and trained medical personnel increase the morbidity rate.
I am very pleased to be able to have the opportunity to speak to this motion and I thank the member for Charlton for raising it. We should continue to work with organisations such as UNICEF—which has set 2005 as its deadline in the elimination of tetanus—the World Health Organisation, the UN Population Fund, the Gates Foundation and other government and private foundations. I commend the motion to the House.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-11-24,"—As somewhat of a student of inequities in the superannuation process in this country, I have been contacted recently by a number of retired Commonwealth public service employees—both within my electorate and outside of it—greatly concerned by certain inherent inequities in the treatment of their public sector pensions. In their approach to superannuation as a whole, the Prime Minister and his government have frequently stated that the changes made would be made for the benefit of everyone and everyone would be treated equitably and fairly. The expression of `a fair go for all Australians' has been part of this rhetoric. What the PM has failed to say is that the fair go for all Australians excluded the government's own former employees and members of the defence forces who have retired on Commonwealth superannuation pensions.
These pensions, indexed to the consumer price index, have had their value eroded for the last decade or more, and they will continue to erode unless the situation is addressed. The Australian Council of Public Service Retiree Organisations—ACPSRO—has been instrumental in coordinating efforts to bring this issue to the minister's attention, with little response to date. I also wrote to the minister on 29 May this year, complete with copies of correspondence from my constituents, and I am yet to receive a reply.
ACPSRO represent the interests of all Commonwealth, state and territory public sector retirees, including those from the defence forces—a large voting constituency, I would suggest. They want the indexation of their pensions to be changed from a CPI only platform to the higher of the CPI or the male average total weekly earnings index—the MATWE. The CPI is a price inflation measure; it is not a cost of living index. It will never maintain the value of a pension when compared to increases in community living standards that are related to movements in wages. This argument was accepted by both the government and the opposition in 1997 when the age pension and other social security payments were fixed by legislation to the higher of the CPI or the MATWE. Both sides of politics recognised that pensioners should share in increases in community living standards and that the only way to achieve this was to link pensions to wages in the greater community, or increases in those wages.
Since 1997 the Reserve Bank has indexed its employees' super scheme to the MATWE, the Commonwealth Bank staff scheme is indexed to average weekly ordinary time earnings—the AWOTE—while our own parliamentary super scheme is indexed to a mix of indices that also determine increases in serving parliamentarian salaries, which are on the high side of any index used. The effect of this is that, as politicians' salaries increase, so too do parliamentary pensions.
In 2001 the indexing of public sector pensions was considered by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services, which recommended that the government examine adopting a method of indexation that more realistically reflected actual increases in the cost of living. Its report A reasonable and secure retirement? was tabled on 5 April 2001. The government rejected the committee's recommendation on the grounds of increased costs. Every time the public sector schemes—including our parliamentary scheme—are indexed upwards, increases in budget outlays and unfunded liabilities will happen. Governments have faced this fact ever since the introduction of the schemes as far back as 1922. The Commonwealth Actuary's long-term assessment, outlined in the Intergenerational Report last year, showed that the level of unfunded liabilities of the Commonwealth's civilian and military schemes, as a percentage of GDP, is in fact declining. 
Another fact that is also conveniently ignored on both sides is that the vast majority of public sector employees were employed on salaries well below market rates but which were purportedly balanced by their compulsory superannuation as part of their overall remuneration package. I notice this argument is used in relation to the parliamentary scheme, but no-one can argue that the sorts of reasons that the Chifley government used to introduce the parliamentary scheme—the severance of careers and so on—can realistically apply to retired politicians. But they can, I would suggest, apply to public servants who served long and diligently in the expectation of a reasonably comfortable retirement.
These former employees—civilian and armed forces—were not treated generously when working, and it is a flawed argument that says that their superannuation benefits are generous compared to other schemes in the community. Their superannuated pensions are anything but generous when compared to the increases in recent years. The pension received by a married couple, eligible for a full age pension, the pharmaceutical allowance, plus the maximum additional income allowed before their pension is reduced, amounts to $25,318.80. The average Commonwealth public sector superannuation pensions, on the other hand, are $14,830 under the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme; $18,617 under the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme; $19,982 under the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme; and $14,047 under the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. These figures are at 30 June this year. Almost 60 per cent of Commonwealth superannuants receive less than $20,000 a year.
The government response to the first of the Senate committee's recommendations was to pass responsibility to the state and territory governments. It said, `The government understands that the use of the CPI to update pensions is consistent with arrangements that state and territory governments have for indexing superannuation pensions.' This contradicts the heads of government agreement the Commonwealth signed with the states and territories in 1994 in which the signatories agreed to conform with the principles of the Commonwealth's retirement income policies. It is the Commonwealth government that sets the standard for the states and territories to follow. There is no equity in keeping the Commonwealth superannuation schemes indexed to the CPI alone. It certainly fails to deliver the much promised fair go for all Australians.
The government gave some ground in response to one recommendation from the Senate committee: it agreed to index Commonwealth pensions twice yearly to the CPI. But this still skirts the core issue for retired public sector employees—that is, the purchasing power of their pensions continues to diminish and so too their standard of living. At 3.99, the Senate committee reported that the CPI is an inadequate reflection of the `actual rise in the cost of living for retirees relative to community living standards'. At 3.101, the committee went a step further, recommending that, if the government said the cost of changing the indexation method would be too great, rather than simply retain indexation to the consumer price index, the government should investigate introducing an incremental two-tier system. According to the committee, this would ensure that the needs of Commonwealth superannuants are met while containing the cost to the government. 
In comparison to the pension for qualifying ex-members of parliament—which, as I have said, increase as serving parliamentarians' salaries increase—increases based on the CPI only would hardly seem equitable. Over the last 10 years, parliamentary superannuation benefits have increased by 44 per cent, Centrelink pensions have increased by 38 per cent and Commonwealth public sector pensions have increased by 23 per cent—including for retired military personnel. This is a considerable lag for former Commonwealth employees—all of whom were public servants in the true sense, who planned their lives for retirement and who could not jump between the public and private sectors in search of greener pastures and put themselves out in the marketplace as so many can, and do, today.
There is a genuine need for a reality check in superannuation in this country—and that applying to those retired public servants is certainly an area that needs intense attention. Superannuation in this country is a source of deep division between and within various sections of our society. I have pointed that out to some people ad nauseam over the years, but there are inequities that are not being addressed. The treatment of these former public servants who gave so loyally over so many years is a disgrace that needs to be attended to urgently—as, indeed, does the parliamentary scheme about which I introduced a bill in this House which nobody seems inclined to debate.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Superannuation: Contributions</title>,Grievance Debate,18,1
"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—There is a quiet revolution going on in this parliament, and it is being led by the parliament's Procedure Committee under our steady chairman, Mrs Margaret May, and supported by the member for Batman and others. It includes provisions such as the new intervention procedures in the Main Committee, new proposals in relation to second reading speeches and, most particularly—and this is what I want to refer to today—modernisation of the procedures of this House.
This parliament is being asked to support a motion for modernisation not of its procedures so much but of the language by which those procedures are understood. In short, we are being asked to modernise the standing orders which govern our work. I support the measure because it is of the utmost importance that those procedures are accessible to those who work with them—namely, to me and my colleagues in this place. So long as the rules are expressed clearly it seems to me that the use of contemporary language is desirable for the better understanding of our processes.
Let me give two brief examples. Proposed standing order 62 is a compilation of four of the current standing orders. Proposed standing order 62(b) refers to the requirement, when a member moves in the chamber, to bow to the Speaker on entering or leaving. The current provision refers to the need to make obeisance to the Speaker. I suppose we know what that means, but it is not very clear. That is one example of what I think is an improvement.
Many other provisions remain the same. For example, proposed standing order 65(b) is the same as the current standing order 55, dealing with interruptions of debate. There is no change whatsoever in the language. On the other hand, there are some words that have an antique or ancient meaning which continue to have resonance and which should, in the interests of clarity, retain their pristine meaning. In that context, I will use the example of the word `disorderly', which is found in proposed standing order 91 and which remains a valuable word in the English language and for use in this place.
The procedures of this House are of the utmost importance, not just because they enable parliamentarians to carry out their duties but also because at the end of the day they are an important constraint on government in the interests of a free and open democracy. In fact, I would go so far as to say that, for the maintenance of liberty in this great nation of ours, the procedures of parliament are more effective than the Constitution itself. Having regard to their antiquity—and the most basic of our procedures were developed in the Middle Ages, before their use in the Australian context—they are durable and more effective in the maintenance of a representative democracy than any political party or philosophy might otherwise be. Why do I say that? Because, but for the House procedures, the government, with its working majority, would overrule every dissident or opposing voice, whether that be the Speaker, the opposition, a dissident backbencher committed to a different point of view from that of his or her own party, a difficult committee or even a critical media. 
It is the procedures of parliament that guarantee parliament's very autonomy, protected by the rules of privilege. These procedures apply indiscriminately to the most senior minister and the most humble backbencher. They control the flow of business and information to and from government and the representatives in the parliament and, while limiting government, the procedures give legitimacy to government and its actions and ultimately acceptance among the people of this great country of ours of what governments do through this parliament.
Perhaps finally and most importantly these procedures are a guide for every member, becoming part of their inner understanding of our system of representative democracy. It matters not whether the parliamentarian is a ministerial aspirant or simply someone who is happy to be a policy advocate: at the end of the day, it is the procedures which best protect our fundamental freedoms and values. They are the surest foundations of continuing stability and prosperity. I support the proposal.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—It is a pleasure to be speaking in the debate on the Procedure Committee's report on the revised standing orders. As a new member of this parliament and of the Procedure Committee I found the experience of redrafting and reorganising the House standing orders interesting and challenging, because it was an excellent opportunity for me to study the standing orders at a level of detail that I might otherwise not have bothered to reach had I not been involved in this exercise.
I chose to nominate for the Procedure Committee because I thought that as a new member I should attempt something completely outside my comfort zone. The Procedure Committee thus qualified as an area of parliamentary engagement that I thought would be rather perfunctory and even perhaps boring in nature. However, my experiences on the Procedure Committee over the last two years have proved me quite wrong in those estimations. First, let me say that I am part of a committee whose membership is dynamic and varied. It is a committee which works extremely well and in the best traditions of parliamentary committees. We have dealt with issues that have been exciting and challenging. All up, the Procedure Committee has turned out to be one that offers scope for creativity and forward planning.
The task of rewriting the standing orders was a time consuming exercise that stretched our knowledge of the English language in all its nuances. It was very much an exercise aimed at making the standing orders more logical, intelligible and readable. In short, our job was to produce a document that was user friendly and contemporary. It was a timely exercise given that it has been 40 years since the standing orders were written in their current form. As we worked through the text it was pretty obvious that the language and general terminology were of a bygone period. At times we found quaint and old world expressions that were, I thought, literally begging to be brought into the 21st century. 
I believe that we have achieved our objective. After all, language is organic in nature. It is a living form of communication that reflects the nuances and expressions of a particular time. As such, the document in its new form has a contemporary expression. I personally enjoyed the time we spent rewriting the document, particularly because in a former life I was a language teacher and, being a fluent bilingual, I have a particular fascination with language as a means of communication and representation of its historical context.
I must confess, however, that at times I felt a little frustrated when, in search of the most appropriate language, our deliberations were caught up in protracted debates around the meaning of words. This was especially so when the legal eagles on our committee took a somewhat legalistic approach as we tried to settle on the most appropriate words. But at the end of the day it was less about legal terminology and more about simplifying the language for the purpose of making it more demotic in style. As a result I believe we have produced a worthwhile document that the general public can now read with ease, a document that new members and old members alike can better understand and follow. In fact the new index is much improved because it is now much easier to find things. This is a user-friendly document that will stand the test of the evolving nature of the English language in its Australian context for the next 50 years. We have even pushed the boundaries of modernisation by taking full advantage of information technology and making the House standing orders available on the Internet, thus providing instantaneous access.
I want to thank the Committee secretary Judy Middlebrook, our research officer Peter Fowler and our administrative assistant Anna Gadzinski for their amazing work. They certainly put in a lot of effort and they have a lot of knowledge of the standing orders. Finally, my thanks and commendations must go to our chair, the member for McPherson, who was absolutely terrific in the way she handled the tussles over words and phrases from time to time.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—I rise to support the report on the revised standing orders that was introduced by the Procedure Committee earlier today. Members who have already spoken have given the history of the evolution of our standing orders over time, by pointing out that the authority for our standing orders comes from the Constitution. It is quite worthy of comment that for the first time in this document you will find that we record where the source in the Constitution is. 
The task was given to us to make the standing orders more accessible and easier to follow so that when someone is looking for a particular area covered by the standing orders they can expect to find the standing orders in sequential order. As the member for Calwell said, the way the chapters have been arranged makes it much easier for people who are not familiar with the standing orders per se or are coming to terms with learning how they operate, and it certainly will be a much more user-friendly document.
I commend the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for McPherson, on the excellent work that she and other members of the committee did. They worked assiduously, going through each standing order and arranging it into the new order. It was quite a laborious task, yet it was also informative. Sometimes the history behind the way in which a standing order has evolved can be quite informative as to the way it should be interpreted today. As I have said, it was a reasonably laborious task but indeed there was a great deal of amusement and camaraderie among the members of the committee in going through the standing orders. We had interesting discussions on the real meaning of a particular term and the way in which it fits into context and how a simple change can alter the real intent of a standing order. All those things had to be paid attention to as we worked our way through the standing orders.  
When she introduced the document today, the chairman noted that the House operated on temporary standing orders for a long time, despite the fact that there was a recommendation that there should be formal standing orders. It was not until 1950 that they were achieved. In this day and age we could not think that there could be any time delay in accepting the new document, although we want people to read it and to comment upon it. But at the end of the day I think that people will find that the document will be enormously useful to them and far more accessible than the one that currently exists.

"King, Peter, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—There is a quiet revolution going on in this parliament, and it is being led by the parliament's Procedure Committee under our steady chairman, Mrs Margaret May, and supported by the member for Batman and others. It includes provisions such as the new intervention procedures in the Main Committee, new proposals in relation to second reading speeches and, most particularly—and this is what I want to refer to today—modernisation of the procedures of this House.
This parliament is being asked to support a motion for modernisation not of its procedures so much but of the language by which those procedures are understood. In short, we are being asked to modernise the standing orders which govern our work. I support the measure because it is of the utmost importance that those procedures are accessible to those who work with them—namely, to me and my colleagues in this place.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak to the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. This is an important bill that strikes at the core of a major concern in the community—that is, the education of our young children and the education of young Australians. I am very pleased that in this bill there are additional funding measures for capital grants for non-government schools from 2004 to 2007 as well as additional funding for school literacy and numeracy programs and projects for 2003 and 2004.
I had the pleasure of having the Minister for Education, Science and Training in my electorate on Thursday, 20 November. One of the initiatives I took with the education minister was to convene a roundtable of all the school principals in my electorate. I wrote to some 28 schools inviting them to meet face-to-face with the education minister, because I believe it is fundamentally important for there to be an opportunity at grassroots level for the educators to be able to speak with the education decision makers that exist in this parliament. I was very pleased that, out of the 28 schools, some 14 principals were able to come along to my education roundtable and speak with Dr Brendan Nelson for a good period of time about issues of concern to them about education.
A part of that was the discussion of funding. I would be very pleased this afternoon to canvass some of the points that were raised as well as to highlight some of the facts. It has been very clear to me for a long while that there are elements within the education system who believe that in some way they gain by misrepresenting, misleading and twisting the truth about education funding in this country. I have been gravely disappointed that on numerous occasions one of the worst offenders in this regard has been the Queensland Teachers Union. This union does not seem to be concerned at all with informing the community about decisions that the various tiers of government make. Rather, this union seems more concerned with making sure that parents are scared and are misunderstanding the division of responsibility between non-government and government schools when it comes to education funding.
It was very clear to me from my education roundtable that there are a variety of points of view about the best way forward when it comes to education funding. It was very clear to me from the 14 or so people who sat at the roundtable that there are a variety of views—each person cherishing and sincerely holding their point of view but each one divergent in what they perceive to be the best way that taxpayers could invest their money in the education of our young Australians. Some people were of the view that there should be absolutely no government funding flowing to non-government schools. I disagree with that point of view; I see it as a very hardline point of view. Nonetheless, that was one part of the spectrum that was represented at the roundtable. 
Likewise, there are other points of view that are found in the community—for example, that perhaps governments should invest money in education at both government and non-government schools. As the member for Moncrieff, I am very proud to be a supporter of a system that enables parents to make a decision about where they would like their children to be educated. A crucial component of this is recognising that parents who make the choice to send their children to non-government schools do so after they have paid their taxes to the Commonwealth and to state governments, a proportion of which covers the costs of the education of their children.
Yet, despite that, they still make the decision to send their children to a non-government school, believing for some reason that their child might get a better education, that their child might get a more solid grounding in values, that a particular school offers certain facilities that they are after or that a particular school might offer a view on life that they would like to instil in their children. Even though they have paid their taxes they will still make further contributions towards that school to ensure that their child is educated. Some non-government schools charge very little but others, it is widely known, charge significant amounts of money each year for children to be educated.
It seems to me a great shame that there are people in this chamber who, without any hesitation at all, are willing to lift the scab on class warfare. They are willing to make out that what drives Howard government policy when it comes to education is not a belief that parents have a right to choose and not a belief in investing in an education system in government and non-government schools but rather some curious and indeed spurious notion that it is a conspiracy by the government frontbench to reinvest money in their old school system.
I say to all people listening and to the parents in my electorate that nothing could be further from the truth. When you look at the facts and when you turn your mind to the funding that is allocated between government and non-government schools, you see very clearly that the Howard government has increased funding to both sectors of our education system—both government and non-government.
—Where did you get that information?
—When you look at the fact that, for example, this government this year alone is committing $6.6 billion towards the education system, an increase of over 80 per cent since we were elected in 1996, you start to see that this government is truly committed to the education of our young Australians.
—With accrual accounting, we don't even know.
—I hear the interjections that come from the member opposite about how we should be suspicious about the facts that I am receiving. Let us be very clear on one thing. I will talk about a Queensland perspective. At least the Howard government is up front and transparent when it comes to school funding. The great difficulty that I have in Queensland is that I cannot get from the education minister in Queensland actual funding allocations for government schools. I can get it for non-government schools when it comes from the Commonwealth government, and I know how much the Commonwealth government provides to the Queensland state government, but what the Queensland state Labor government will not show is how it apportions its funding not only between the various schools in my electorate but also between the various schools up and down the length and breadth of Queensland. 
I have to scratch my head when I look around my own electorate, for example, and I see schools that have yet to receive a single lick of paint on many classrooms. William Duncan school, for example, has a maintenance budget of about $15,000 per annum; yet 10 kilometres up the road the Queensland state government is investing millions and millions of dollars into P-12 schools. Where is the equity in that? Where is the equity from the state government? The philosophical position that the Labor Party purport to have says that they are so concerned with equity, and yet they will refuse to disclose the reasons some government schools—the P-12 schools in Queensland—get significant amounts of funding, significant computer facilities and significant investments in capital works and yet other government schools receive virtually nothing and they are in a situation where they have to scrape by and prevail upon the school community to obtain funding to try to do basic maintenance within the school grounds. Why won't the Queensland Labor education minister disclose that information? 
The bill today deals with capital grants as one primary aspect. In this budget, we have committed a further $48.2 million for capital grants for non-government schools over four years. There has already been money committed to government schools. When you look at the information, you see that across the country there have been significant increases towards both government and non-government schools from the Commonwealth government. From 1996 until 2001, Commonwealth capital grants totalled $1.85 billion, of which 70.5 per cent was allocated to government schools and 29.3 to non-government schools. So when it comes to capital grants, the Howard government, which the Labor Party would have us all believe is only concerned with funding the old school tie, actually funded $1.85 billion from the period from 1996 to 2001, of which over 70 per cent went to government schools and less than 30 per cent to non-government schools.
Let us also look at our constitutional responsibility. It is important to know the parameters of this debate. There is a reason schools are called state government schools. It is because the primary funding source for those schools is state government. There is also a historical agreement between the Commonwealth and the state governments around Australia that the Commonwealth government will pick up the tab and be the primary funder of non-government schools. I encourage and urge all Australians to be very clear on that fact, to actually slice through the meaningless drivel that comes from education unions—who would openly and willingly seek to misinform the community because they believe there are some politically opportunistic points they can score by doing so—and to actually find out the information. I have been very pleased that, in my electorate, school principals have been proactive in making sure that parents do know the facts when it comes to school funding. I have been very pleased to see a number of newsletters from school principals in which the principals give a breakdown of funding between the various tiers of government and the allocation of not only capital works funding but recurrent funding that is provided to schools.
If we look at funding allocations for schools, for example, we see that in 2004 poor schools will receive funding of approximately $4,534 for primary and $5,987 for secondary. Schools that serve wealthy communities only receive $887 for primary and $1,171 for secondary. This is as a consequence of this government's decision to introduce the new socioeconomic status measure when making decisions about the level of funding that should apply to schools. It certainly is a vast step forward compared to the old ERI system that existed under the Labor Party. It is a system that now says, when we make decisions about the level of funding that should flow to schools, we do so on the basis of what is proper, taking into account the socioeconomic status of the parents concerned.  
Schools in very needy communities will receive 70 per cent of what it costs to educate a student in a government school, compared to a figure of 13.7 per cent for the schools that serve the wealthiest communities. The fact is that, under this government, all schools are getting more money. In addition to that, funding has increased each and every year since 1996. Federal funding for public schooling has been rising in recent budgets more rapidly than state and territory funding and, in 2003, will be 50 per cent higher than when we took office in 1996. Over the same period, the increase in student numbers in government schools has only been 1.4 per cent.
There are some interesting questions that can be asked about this. I speak from a position where the Gold Coast has the highest concentration, on a per capita basis, of private schools. The question can be asked: why are parents, on the facts, appearing to be more willing and are wanting to choose a private school education for their children over the public system? There are some who will recoil from that statement and say it is because the Howard government is not giving enough money to government schools. But I think it is pretty clear that that argument is false.
Perhaps a very significant part of the reason that parents are choosing private schools is one significant and important word in education: values. Increasingly we see parents turning towards private schools because they believe private schools offer a greater opportunity for their children to be schooled in values. They would like their children to have a moral compass that goes with them throughout their lives. An important part of that is of course the fact that there are many schools that share and are built on a Christian heritage, or indeed any heritage, that is available at a variety of schools that offer and teach children the ways of a religion that particular parents might choose to school their children in.
Values in education are something that the government are unambiguously committed to. We believe fundamentally that, if Australian students are going to have a very good start in life, values in education are a significant and important part of that. Likewise, we firmly believe in the importance of quality teaching. That is also part of the reason that the Howard government are making sure that we are providing increased funding for quality teaching and superior professional training for teachers not only while they are at university but also once they graduate in terms of postgraduate education.
This particular bill, as I have touched upon, provides additional funding for school literacy and numeracy programs and projects for the years 2003 and 2004. Improving literacy and numeracy is an ongoing educational priority for the Howard government. National literacy and numeracy goals have been agreed to by education ministers as has the implementation of a national literacy and numeracy plan, the latter including the development of national benchmarks for years 3, 5, 7 and 9, against which student progress is now assessed. I had a discussion on this exact point with Terry Ball, the principal of William Duncan State School. I was very pleased to note that although the children sometimes found the exams daunting—indeed, as they find any exam—they recognised that there was the benefit as a consequence of having something against which they could measure their performances. 
This bill makes additional provision for literacy and numeracy programs, including $33.79 million for the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes program for 2004 and additional funding for the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies and Projects program of $3.46 million for 2003 and $7.4 million for 2004. All states and territories are now testing and reporting against national reading and numeracy benchmarks, and the results are progressively being published through the National report on schooling in Australia. This is an important component of this bill, because it means that parents now have the opportunity to determine the quality of the schooling that their child receives. It came about in response to calls from the community that children were making it right through the education system without, in certain cases, even having a basic understanding of literacy and numeracy. As a way of trying to close that gap and trying to make sure we are actually delivering what we are attempting to deliver, we have introduced these literacy and numeracy benchmarks, something that I fundamentally believe parents are very supportive of, and I know this from speaking with them.
When Dr Brendan Nelson came to the Gold Coast for the third time, last Thursday, he took the opportunity to talk with parents and with principals. It is clear to me that, once apprised of the facts, parents believe and understand that the government believe in empowering them to make decisions about education. Rather than the rhetoric that I am sure we will hear from opposition members, and rather than the kind of false promise that they make about restoring fiscal imbalance—as they would put it—between non-government and government schools, what we need to focus on are the actual educational outcomes that are being achieved.
One thing I have never once heard answered by those who are opposed to the government's spending priorities and the fact that we are giving record amounts to state governments for government schools is the question of what they would do if all of the students in the non-government sector suddenly became dependent on the state for the provision of their education. What would they do if millions of children left the non-government sector and went across to the government sector to obtain their education? The fact is that I will fiercely support and stand behind parents that choose non-government schools, not because I believe they are superior to government schools but because I believe parents have a right to make that choice. When they have already paid their taxes and they reach into their pockets one more time to pay education fees, they do not do so because they are filthy rich; they do so because they are aspirational and they want a quality education for their children. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Sawford, Rod, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—Once upon a time, member for Moncrieff, you could actually work out the cost of education. Once upon a time we could look at the budget papers and everyone in this House could glean, under the system of cash accounting—even you could find out—exactly how much money was spent on education. But we now have a system of accrual accounting, and this information is hidden even from you and from me—from everyone in this House except the executive. When analysed by any country in the world, whether it is Canada, the United States or any of the European countries, it is shown that the privatisation of education costs more and is more inefficient. The information that the member for Moncrieff used today he gleaned from ministers' press releases and executive government. That is where it came from; it did not come from the budget papers. The member for Moncrieff criticised the Queensland government, but he failed spectacularly to admit that there are criticisms of the Howard government which are exactly the same. The truth is he does not know. The truth is none of us know except the executive. That is the great pity of all of this. 
The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003 provides funding for capital grants to non-government schools so as to maintain the 2003 funding level for the next four years and continue funding in 2004 for targeted programs for educationally disadvantaged students and for literacy and numeracy projects. But the legislation should be recognised for what it does not do. The bill does nothing about capital needs in government schools. The bill fails to adequately protect the public interest and the wealth created by the Commonwealth funding for capital investment for both religious and private organisations. The bill fails accountability and public reporting requirements about the allocation of capital funds, particularly against needs criteria. There is no transparency whatsoever.
Without doubt, this additional funding provided for high-fee students under the Commonwealth general recurrent program will lead to increased capital investment in those schools, increasing the resources gap between them and other government and non-government schools. I have a friend who is a principal of a private school—I will not embarrass him by naming him—and they are embarrassed by the amount of money that is coming to their school from the Commonwealth government they are going to waste. They are trying to work out how many more swimming pools or luxuries they can introduce into their school using the money. These issues are made more significant by research findings which suggest that there is a correlation between the quality of school infrastructure and educational outcomes. Labor recognises that the issues involved are complex and sensitive, and they should preferably be considered as part of a comprehensive response to the act as a whole rather than as a partial response to this aspect of the capital grants program.
New legislation for all Commonwealth programs for schools for the quadrennium beginning 2005 is due to be introduced in the parliament by mid-2004 at the latest. That is when the substantive debate will take place. It is exactly on that point that I wish to provide some history. Thirty years ago, in May 1973, the Karmel report on education was published in this country. At the time, it was recognised as a watershed report and was generously praised, and many of its recommendations were implemented. However, in hindsight, the Karmel report had major failings: the first was the failure to recognise the resource needs of primary schools, both government and non-government; the second was the failure to recognise technical education in a nation traditionally short of technical skills; and the third was the failure to appreciate the public acceptance of and support for diversity within the public secondary school system. The educational systems that were favoured by the Karmel report were higher education, senior secondary academic education and private education. I do not suggest that the Karmel report did this deliberately; it did not. It was essentially egalitarian in nature. Nevertheless, that is what occurred.
Primary schools are the foundation of our education system. Integrated secondary or technical education simply does not work, and ordinary parents have voted with their feet on that particular matter. Essentially, for the past 20 years the needs of primary, junior, secondary and technical education have been ignored. As Labor has suggested, there ought to be a comprehensive response to the act as a whole. Australia needs a white paper on all the education sectors, and it particularly needs to address the failure of the past two decades in the primary, junior, secondary, technical and public education sectors.  
The Karmel report's rationale recommended a comprehensive secondary school system, and it was essentially positive and egalitarian, as I said. However, the reality has been that increasing numbers of parents and students have rejected the weakness of a uniform public system, particularly at the year 11 and 12 levels. A diverse and very strong public education system that was one of the best in the world—with academic high schools, vocational and technical schools, selective technical and academic high schools, boys schools, girls schools, agricultural schools and so on—was replaced with a single comprehensive high schools system. Diversity, once the province of the public education sector, became the province of the private education sector. For many parents, the public system at the secondary level no longer met their needs and, slowly but surely, if they could afford it, they walked the walk. Of course, many of the so-called private schools that the member for Moncrieff referred to are funded 95 per cent to 100 per cent by the government. They are public schools, but they just happen to have another name.
It is certainly true that there has been enormous growth in vocational education in the last 10 years, but it is off a very low base. It is largely unfunded and is based on the goodwill of many teachers who will soon retire, and their trained replacements do not exist. But the more significant failure of the Karmel report was the lack of acknowledgement of the resource needs of primary schools. That is why grants for literacy and numeracy are implicit in this legislation. For that reason, I want to put on the public record how that all came about—inadequate as the current guidelines may be. 
In 1978, five years after the publication of the Karmel report, the South Australian Primary Principals Association responded to the failure to resource primary schools adequately, and they organised a campaign called `Primary means first'. The response from the education community in South Australia was unedifying, to say the least. The education department said it was divisive. The Education Union agreed at that time and was not interested. The Secondary Principals Association, TAFEs and universities refused to comment. Similar campaigns began in all other states, and they all failed. As a minor player in that campaign, I was actually shocked at the negativity and the blatant white-anting and spoiling by other sectors of education. I really found it difficult to believe that people in other sectors of education did not share the reality that every primary school student becomes a high school student, a TAFE student or a university student. The lesson was to be learnt again and again, and then some more.
In the early 1980s, I convened the second campaign focusing on the needs of primary schools. It was called `Into the nineties'. I was then the president of the Adelaide area principals association. It was not a polite campaign like the first; it was a bit like me: it was in your face. It is important to note that every primary school staff and school council, bar one—there is always one—supported the campaign. Six hundred schools in South Australia supported the campaign—every one of them. It was revenue neutral, and over a period of five years it aimed to place in each primary school one additional teacher for each 100 children. It was attainable because of falling enrolments in secondary schools. Although unwilling at first, the teachers union came on side. Three prominent secondary principals supported the campaign. The education department seemed to be beside itself—it could find no fault in the accuracy of the data or the research. How could it? It was supplied to me by a senior departmental officer. Being revenue neutral, it was politically acceptable. The department decided to divide and rule. It was agreed that a primary review be set up—the traditional inquiry—and the majority of conservative principals in my organisation thought that was a fair thing. They thought the review was good. And it was good, but nothing happened. Years of energy and belief were blown away. In 2001, a fourth campaign was launched by the Australian Primary Principals Association called `Our futures'. I wish it every success, but I am not holding my breath. 
At a political level, after the 1990 federal election I was elected chair of the Labor caucus education and employment committee. Along with people like Roger Price—who is still here—Carolyn Jacobsen, Elaine Darling, Mary Crawford and others, we convinced the then Labor government to set up an inquiry into literacy in Australian schools. The subsequent federal government report, The literacy challenge, showed that there were literacy failure rates of up to 30 per cent in our public and private schools. The response from the usual quarters was again unedifying. Education departments around the country, as is their wont, denied the problem. Teachers unions unfortunately took the view that it was an attack on teachers, which it clearly was not. It was simply an identification of unmet resource needs and the need for appropriate data. Several academics wrote in the media that there were higher priorities and that they doubted the accuracy of the report. Nothing was more predictable than the response of those three groups. Unfortunately, it has ever been so. Nevertheless, several years on, good principals and good teachers acted upon the findings. They did it because good teachers and good principals always do the right thing.
In the previous parliament, as deputy chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations, I convinced committee members, among whom the government had a nine to four majority, that an investigation was warranted into the funding of education in this country—public and private, primary and secondary, and TAFE and higher education. It has never ever been done. It should be done. The minister refused to allow the inquiry. Education in Australia is funded on the basis of historical traditions, vested interests and privilege. Under this government, even that has been exacerbated. Resourcing education is not based on a sound educational rationale nor on quantitative or empirical research, as it should be. As I said, the minister at the time refused the inquiry. It was too dangerous for the privileged and elite vested interests he tried to advantage and protect, I suppose.
For any market to grow, you need efficiency. Education is no different from anything else in that regard. The fact remains that the government deliberately favour particular groups: one per cent, the elite; 10 per cent, the in-betweens; and 30 per cent, other non-government schools that are really public schools. It is a misnomer to call them private schools; they are no more private than I am. The one per cent are the category 1 and 2 schools, the 10 per cent are the independent system and the 30 per cent are basically the Catholic system. That is not in the national interest.  
Education is different from most markets. It requires equality and freedom—two values that have gone missing under this government. They talk about values. There is no equality in education in this country; there is no freedom. Equality cannot be achieved where a public system is downgraded, where regional and provincial areas are ignored and where need, disadvantage and special circumstances are not taken into account. The national interest is not served when the only freedom that is encouraged is the self-indulgent freedom of choice so championed by this government, based on the ability to pay. True recognition of freedom is based on merit, taking into account all the circumstances of need and disadvantage. Unfortunately, that seems to be beyond the intellectual capacity of the Howard government.
The bill maintains at the 2003 level grants for strategic assistance for improving student outcomes and restores funding to 2002 levels for national initiatives in literacy and numeracy. Essentially, these measures fail to address the bias against public education endemic in this government's intentions. However, it is not only the federal government that is a threat to public education. During this parliament, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training investigated boys education. At the beginning of the inquiry, the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training informed us that over the last 20 years the differential attainments for boys and girls had blown out by almost 20 percentage points. If that were true, that would be alarming. Education departments and teachers union representatives across Australia went into denial. Academia split down the middle this time. But, thank goodness, good principals and good teachers knew there was a problem, ignored the orthodoxies and got on with the job. A public school in a lowly socioeconomic area in Brisbane recognised the literacy and numeracy problems with boys as well as girls and, after four years of hard work, got their attainment levels for boys and girls to acceptable standards. The same was true of an affluent public school in Sydney, as it was for public schools in public housing estates in Tasmania and South Australia.
As federal politicians I guess we all know: it is the economy, stupid. As good principals and good teachers know: it is the quality of the educational program, stupid. At all the good schools, public or private, there were common factors: a good principal, good senior staff, good teachers, supportive parents, active and structured learning programs, regular measurement of attainment and well-organised resources. The orthodoxies promoted by the education bureaucrats during the nineties, some teachers union ideologues and many in academia were ignored and nowhere to be seen in those good schools. But all of those schools implemented their successful literacy and numeracy programs at a cost. Poorer schools had to abandon much of their expressive arts and enrichment programs due to lack of staff and resources; no sport, no art was the name of the game.
Why should disadvantaged schools, in order to meet literacy and numeracy benchmarks, have to sacrifice the more liberal aspects of their education programs? That is what is happening in our state schools. That is what is helping people to walk the walk. One of those affluent schools in Sydney—I think it was in Rose Bay—raised $100,000 through an active parents body. That paid for the salaries of staff and for resources to raise the attainment levels of boys and girls in that school to the expected levels. All this indicates that public education is underfunded. Precious taxpayer dollars should be spent to meet the greatest needs, not to support the already privileged. 
Parents watch the toleration of inadequate public schools, they watch the priorities and they watch the consistency and when they do not find it—and if they can afford it, although there are many occasions when they cannot and they do it—they walk the walk to so-called private schools. Parents are not silly. They are aware of the collapse of state banks, HIH, One.Tel, Ansett, Compass, Impulse, Franklins and AMP. They know what happens when you undercapitalise, when you offer discount prices and poor service and when you give the CEO or senior staff millions while paying staff a pittance. I hope people watching Telstra at least take note.
This government seems to think that we ought to be telling children and parents from low-income or geographically isolated families that they are responsible for making up the disparities between themselves and children with personal laptop computers and category 1 schooled and university educated parents. There are too many blatant attacks on public education in this country. It is time that people who can stand up for public education actually do so. Many prominent Australians will put their name to public education, because they benefited and they want to see it continued because it is the base of our democracy. There are others who need some prodding and there are a few whose arm needs to be held up, but they are there. This country cannot afford to put public education—70 per cent of the education market—at risk. It is what our precious democracy is based upon.
I am afraid for public education; we all ought to be afraid. There are too many educational bureaucrats, too many academics, too much sectoral jealousy and too many ideologues on a course that is weakening public consensus to fund public education. Political will is driven by market forces but it needs to be balanced by social good. It is the task of government to get the balance right. On that the government has demonstrably failed, and this bill does nothing to redress the imbalance. If the various education sectors keep on contradicting, spoiling and white-anting each other, governments are given excuses not to act. It is time to draw a line in the sand for public education, and there is no better place to start than by redressing the bias against primary, junior secondary, public and technical education which has occurred in the past 20 years.
It is time to conduct a major educational review. It is time to collect the quantitative and empirical research and to commission the longitudinal studies. It is time for the supporters of public and technical education to get the political smarts. If the Anglican diocese of Melbourne can get it right, so can everybody else. It is time that the teaching profession—and the various state teachers unions—not only got the political smarts but developed the courage to carry out in schools what it knows to be right and take a stronger stance to ignore all the silliness that engulfs education from time to time. In conclusion, I simply state the obvious: the great pity about this bill is that it is nothing more than perfunctory and reflects badly on a government that does not have the intellect or the wit to progress and grow education.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—It is with some pleasure that I follow the member for Port Adelaide—as I seem to have on a number of occasions relating to training, higher education and general schooling—in this debate on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. The thing that stands out most, and it is probably fortunate that the previous Deputy Speaker is no longer in the chair, is that there was very little to do with the bill before the House canvassed in the member for Port Adelaide's speech. That is fair enough—he is entitled to have a chat about things that are remotely germane to the bill itself—but the irony is, as he himself recognised, that this bill has some rather particular purposes and there are ample opportunities at the upcoming renegotiation of forward financial commitments for the public education system for many of the issues that he canvassed to be discussed. 
I do not doubt for one minute—in fact I admire and welcome—the passion of the member for Port Adelaide when he talks about education. But what interested me most though was that in doing so he did highlight the very factors that seem to contradict the outcome he is trying to achieve. He talked about the great energy and belief that has not gone anywhere. He reflected on the frustration that the commitments made by good, able, talented, visionary people in education have not always amounted to the outcomes that he and I—and I am sure many in our community—could have hoped for. I think that to highlight why that is the case is to simply embrace the member for Port Adelaide's contribution. It was so heavily laden with dogma and prejudice and a very philosophically skewed perspective on what was good and what was bad that many of the insightful comments that he made will never get a chance to be ventilated. I say that because, to enable those ideas, that passion, that belief and that energy to be given its best expression, one should not start at the very beginning by putting a fence around that very thinking, that very commitment and that very input.
I am quite receptive to some of the ideas that the member for Port Adelaide has put forward. I do not think you could ever discredit the need for a thorough examination of the way our education system in general is funded. It is cursed by our federation and the shared responsibilities for many of the funding arrangements and it is nobbled by the limited jurisdictional influence of, in this case, the Australian government, which has to keep providing more and more cash but has very limited influence on what happens with it. But it is brought to a halt, it is grounded and rubbed into the dirt by the kind of dogma that the member for Port Adelaide spoke of. When one looks at some of his comments about the need for empirical data to shape the way funds are made available, one notes that one of the criticisms of the SES funding model—being the way in which funding is made available to non-government schools—is that it looks only at the neigh-bourhood from which students are coming. It looks at an average of their socioeconomic circumstances to determine what is a reasonable level of subsidy towards the cost of the child's education.
Some would say that is not good enough; that, if you are a poor person living in a wealthy neighbourhood, you are going to be cursed by the wealth of your neighbourhood and the funding that you attract that then goes on to your non-government school will be reduced because of it. Some would say the family of a very wealthy person living in a modest suburb would attract a greater proportion of funding than they would be entitled to if you looked at that family's particular circumstances. But, if you take the member for Port Adelaide's point through to its logical conclusion, you get right back into an area of dogma that the ALP is so offended by: the notion of an educational voucher where the funding and the resources that are made available, based on empirical data, are determined by a particular specific assessment of the means, the income and the resources of the family and from that is derived an amount of funds which goes into the educational institution that they choose. That seems the logical conclusion of the member for Port Adelaide's contribution, but I am sure he would be aghast at the suggestion of an education learning entitlement voucher, or something like that, because it runs against the very things that he believes in. That takes us right back to the problem that he illustrated more than ever: dogma is dogging innovation in education. So the greatest advocate of reform, regeneration and enthusiasm actually nobbles all of his contribution by the very single factor that has dragged many good ideas down to their knees. 
He went on to talk about equality and freedom, but wishes to deny people, families and students the right to choose the educational pathway that they feel most suits them. I thought that was a freedom—a freedom to exercise that judgment. In the case of many non-government schools, it is a freedom to not only pay your taxes but also then find additional resources from your family budget to support that educational choice, to assign a priority to life's needs and to invest in a child's future. That sounds like a freedom.
He also spoke of equality. Again, in effect, you could argue that many parents sending their children to non-government schools would love equality with the funding made available for the children of a similar circumstanced family going to a government school. In fact, there is no case or example of a student from a real-life family, no matter how poor they are, attracting more money for a non-government school than the wealthiest student from a household of quite significant means going to a government school. I am sure that the person of modest means supplementing their tax money with some additional funds to send their child to a non-government school would have a view about how equality is playing out for them, and they probably would not be that impressed.
Again, the evidence which the member for Port Adelaide almost cried out for undermines his argument, and that is the problem with the Labor Party's education policy. It is hugely rich on slogans but bereft of ideas. In reality, Labor show no demonstrated capacity to implement these ideas that are shouted at members of the government and at anyone interested in the community, but these ideas would never be able to be implemented because some of them are so internally inconsistent with each other that we would end up with an absolute shemozzle.
This bill before the House that we are discussing today will amend the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 2000, implementing the Australian government's 2003-04 budget initiatives for schools. There are a number of elements to the bill, and the joy of Labor speakers has been to say, `In this bill there's no great mention of public education funding streams.' But, as the member for Port Adelaide confessed himself, that is handled in another piece of legislation. So it does not take a rocket scientist to work out why there is not a huge amount of debate and discussion around public school funding in the text of the bill itself. That is not the purpose of the bill and that is why it is not strongly reflected in it.
The purpose of the bill is to provide additional funding for capital grants for non-government schools in the years from 2004 to 2007 and to put in an additional funding boost for school literacy and numeracy projects and programs for 2003-04. It also seeks to maintain a commitment to a capital grants program that supports non-government schools, and to do that a sum of money is being set aside through this bill: about $48.2 million for capital grants for non-government schools over those four years. There is an additional $210 million for literacy and numeracy programs. In essence, that is what the bill is about and that is why it does not canvass some of the issues that the member for Port Adelaide discussed, because it never sought to canvass those issues. 
The government's primary objective, which has been talked about here before, is to provide funding that will achieve a quality education for all Australians, whether it be through the government public school system—the system I very happily passed through—or through the non-government system. The fundamental principle underlying the government's role is that education matters, and it is an appropriate use for and target of government taxes. We want to support the rights of parents to choose the educational environment that they believe best suits their child and best supports the future development and life opportunities of that child. That could be a government or a non-government school. To suggest that there is some bias against one in favour of the other, as the member for Port Adelaide suggested, is simply not borne out by the facts.
In terms of total enrolments, government schools attract about 68 per cent of the available student population but attract about 76 per cent of the public funding. Again, that is a crashing blow against the claims made by the member for Port Adelaide. If you look through that data and at the choices that families are making, you see that the funding programs, if anything, are skewed in favour of government schools and will continue to be so. It has been that way for many years. The family choice, their independent choice, to send their children to a non-government school is something that this government still looks to the family to support. It is not as if it is a complete opt out. Those families still pay their taxes, and we return a portion of them to the school community where they have chosen to send their children.
The Australian government at the moment has the highest level of spending ever on government schools. In 2003-04, it will spend $935 million more on government schools and their students than Labor did in 1996, which represents a 60 per cent increase over what it was in Labor's last year in government. All states and territories receive increased funding every year for their government schools. As has often been canvassed in this place, no state or territory government has kept pace with the funding growth that the Australian government has offered. Again, it undermines dramatically the claims made by the member for Port Adelaide. But clearly there is scope—and this is the frustration—for state and territory governments to match the funding increases of the Australian government. With the GST revenue that comes their way and the flood of revenue, particularly in the state of Victoria, from stamp duty, speeding fines and what seems to be the fire sale of government land, which was reported recently in a metropolitan newspaper, there is clearly scope for Victoria and in fact all state and territory governments to increase their funding commitments. But they have not; they have chosen not to. It is a choice—a choice about where to direct those resources.
The member for Port Adelaide laments the role of the Australian government; yet, on his own criteria—that is, on the evaluation framework that he put forward during his contribution—the Australian government is clearly outperforming any other government when it comes to support for government schools in this country. These facts are not ones that can be dismissed; they represent the reality, and they also illustrate the genuine commitment of the Howard government to public schools.
In the background, though, things are changing. Non-government school funding is rising because the student numbers are rising. If you look at the enrolment rates between 1996 and 2002, enrolments in non-government schools have increased by 13.3 per cent. Over the same time, enrolments in government schools have gone up 1.6 per cent. So something is going on. Funding is not being taken away from government schools. Funding is being allocated in greater amounts to government and non-government schools, but parents are making choices. I think the member for Port Adelaide touched on some of the reasons why that might be the case. But it would be wrong and entirely inappropriate to be critical or attack parents for making that choice, as the member for Port Adelaide seeks to do. They are making a judgment about what is in the best future interests of their children. 
In this package, you are seeing some funding for capital works for non-government schools. Again, in contrasting the level of commitment that the member for Port Adelaide seeks to talk about, we can have a look at the situation in my own electorate. Since 2001, schools in the Dunkley electorate have attracted about $5.3 million worth of capital expenditure. That is not a bad effort. But you know me, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay—I would always like some more. I could give you a list of about 20 projects where funding would be extremely virtuous and welcome.
But, of that amount, let us just run through what has actually been spent. We have $2.4 million to build a new school—an excellent facility called Benton Junior College—in Mornington East; $650,000 for Langwarrin Park Primary School; $950,000 for the final two stages of the Kunyung Primary School redevelopment, which I was delighted to open on Friday; half a million dollars for Mt Eliza Primary School, and their work is proceeding very well; and $400,000 to complete the Mt Eliza Secondary College arts, technology and crafts facility. So that is the picture.
While that has been going on, there has been $170,000 provided to St Anthony's Coptic Orthodox College—you might recognise that as a Christian Egyptian faith—which draws into my community students from right around the east and south-east of Melbourne. It is hardly a campus swimming in cash. It is hardly a case study of an upper elite swimming in pools and having all sorts of terribly luxurious things that the member for Port Adelaide would have you believe. They have actually redeveloped a disused primary school in Frankston North to cater for their students' educational needs and to support their curriculum expanding to include a VCE program for students.
In Frankston North, a campus of Flinders Christian College opened last year and Brendan Nelson and I visited there. What a place of great vitality! They have had some assistance to open a second campus. The only criticism they would have is that, because it is the second campus of an existing school, they were not entitled to the establishment grant. You do not hear the Labor Party saying that that seems a little inequitable. When a new government school—that is, another campus of a government school—opens up, they are ready for the cash. But here is a non-government school that has simply opened another campus, relying on and building from the base it has established at another already operational campus to open a new facility in my electorate. With the help of $300,000 from the federal government, I was also delighted to support the Bayside Christian College arts facility, general learning extension and library refurbishment last year.
So there has been some good education activity and investment going on in the community that I represent, but you could hardly say that it has been skewed unreasonably towards non-government schools. It is quite the opposite. There is an appropriate level of investment in government schools. So, in this package, we are seeking to carry forward that opportunity for capital grants. I would just like to put on the record that John Leaver, the executive officer of the block grant authority in Victoria, is a remarkable individual—he is doing a lot of good work with the ecumenical school community. I admire his commitment and passion and the talent and experience that he brings to supporting communities of the Christian faith in developing their own non-government schools. That is a great credit to him. 
In the package, in addition to continuing with the capital grants, there is funding for literacy and numeracy programs. This matter is terribly significant. It is a shame that some of the speakers opposite have not touched upon the importance of it. When you look at the need for sound literacy and numeracy skills and you have one moment to think about it, it has to dawn on everybody that they are the foundation capacities of all young people moving forward with their lives. If you are not competent in those areas, how are you going to gain from further education? In your secondary years, for instance, or if you are a senior primary school student, how are you going to canvass other training opportunities if you are not able to partake in reading safety instructions and if you are not sufficiently numerate to be able to work in the retail sector? These are basic building blocks for future opportunities for people.
It is entirely appropriate that the government seeks to continue that work. We are now seeing a full cohort of assessment for literacy and numeracy at years 3, 5 and 7. The governments of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT are supporting individual student reports in relation to a child's performance against national benchmarks. We are told that the Victorian government is going to do likewise, but we will wait and see, because they have not ordinarily been that attracted to those kinds of ideas which give parents an understanding of how their student is travelling.
The national literacy and numeracy strategies and projects that are being funded through this allocation focus on research and initiatives to support the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan. There are other elements to the package, such as middle year literacy and numeracy. That transition from primary school to secondary school is difficult enough. But, if it is undermined by poor numeracy and literacy skills, moving into a new educational environment where you are feeling that you are not able to cope can have a devastating impact on a young person's educational opportunities.
There is also support for students with disabilities and learning difficulties, and also some work on Indigenous English literacy and numeracy strategy. I would like to thank Melody Rewakowski from my office for pulling out some research on that. It shows that, in terms of adequacy of numeracy benchmarks for year 3 students in Australia, about 92.7 per cent in the year 2000 were meeting those year 3 benchmarks, but 73.7 per cent of Indigenous people were. So there is a gap there that needs to be addressed and there is funding being made available through this bill to support that.
In the time that is available to me, I would like to encourage those with a passion for education, as I have, and which has clearly been demonstrated by the member for Port Adelaide, by saying that, for things to change, we need to be open to them, rather than using dogma, putting up boundaries and ruling out of bounds ideas that might make a very beneficial contribution to our community. These things should be canvassed. Education is ripe for that. We have to work out how to attract the best teachers, how to retain them and how to do the very best for our kids.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I rise to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. This billwill maintain the 2003 funding level for capital grants to non-government schools for the next four years and will continue funding in 2004 for targeted programs for educationally disadvantaged students and for literacy and numeracy projects. Investment in education is the best way to address inequality in our society. Education is the greatest leveller when it comes to opportunity and is one of the key elements of our democratic tradition. We will have a debate about the government's bias in providing substantial increases in funding to category 1 schools when the bill dealing with all Commonwealth programs for schools is introduced next year. It will be an important debate about the growing resources gap between high-fee paying schools and other government and non-government schools. 
Whilst I support the extension of funding contained in this bill, I have some reservations about the government's education policies and where they are taking us in relation to opportunities, particularly for those young people at the margins of our society, to participate in work and in a modern democracy. The debate in education has become somewhat skewed of late. Government policy has focused obsessively on the individual rights of those who can afford to choose between schools. This has been at the expense of a debate about the role of education in providing opportunity and in developing our democracy and developing the citizens who can play an active role in that democracy. In order to do that, you have to have an education policy that fosters and develops public education and which ensures that non-government schools that receive government funds utilise those funds to the best advantage of people on low incomes.
Unfortunately, that is not what this bill does. Whilst maintaining the capital works funding levels for non-government schools in 2004, the bill fails to ensure that the funding allocated in the bill is publicly reported; that a transparent process exists for the allocation of funds; that funds are allocated to non-government schools on the basis of educational and financial need; and, again, that they are publicly reported.
Our understanding of the link between capital investment in infrastructure and educational and other outcomes is growing. In a recent opinion piece in the journal Practising Administrator, it was claimed that researchers in the US found:
Students in a new facility scored significantly higher in reading, listening, language and maths than the students in an older building. The newer school also needed to use less discipline, had better attendance and students thought more positively of themselves.
The opinion piece also found:
Poor working environments were perceived as contributing to poor learning outcomes, reduced classroom effectiveness and lower morale and job satisfaction among teachers and administrators.
A recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report, commissioned by the New South Wales Department of Education and Skills, entitled Building better performance: an empirical assessment of learning and other impacts of school capital investment, had a more complex view. Whilst PricewaterhouseCoopers argued that the evidence in their study supported the link between improved learning outcomes and capital investment, there were several qualifications.
The first qualification was that different types of capital investment had an impact on results. According to the report, expenditure targeted at developing specialist areas for science, technology and ICT was generally considered by most head teachers to have the greatest positive impact on pupil attainment. In addition, replacing or modifying classrooms whose design inhibited desirable teaching methods was also reported to have a significant impact on the ability of pupils to learn. The second qualification in the report was the finding that head teachers in schools with either extremely low or extremely high levels of attainment reported a weaker link between capital and performance than those with average attainment. In schools with relatively poor attainment levels, head teachers struggled to see how capital investment on its own could help improve pupil performance. In schools with high attainment levels, head teachers could not always see the direct relevance of the capital-performance relationship. Both qualifications in the report point to the fact that the relationship between capital and educational outcomes is important but more complex than just providing blank cheques to schools regardless of what they are going to spend the money on and what their level of need is—and in the absence of other programs designed to assist the communities in which the schools with lower attainment levels operate. 
This bill, in maintaining funding for capital works to non-government schools, is important in that it provides the opportunity for non-government schools to improve educational outcomes. However, the bill is unclear about the basis on which funds are to be allocated and, in the absence of any public reporting about what the funds are to be spent on, it is difficult to determine that. With finite government resources and with many schools across Australia experiencing declining capital stock, it is incumbent on the government to be transparent about what the policy objective of this program is. It should be about improving the learning outcomes for students. The government needs to be clear about the basis on which the funds in this bill are to be allocated, and the way they are spent should be reported.
Many schools across Australia, both government and non-government, have declining capital stock. In my electorate, I have been to a number of 125th anniversary celebrations of schools—and recently I went to the 150th anniversary celebration of one of my non-government schools. These anniversaries have highlighted not only the importance of these schools in their local communities but also the need for the upgrading of buildings and classrooms that were initially designed for meeting the learning needs of 19th century children. With the changing delivery of education, there are many schools in my electorate that clearly need a capital upgrade and clearly need to focus those capital upgrades on areas where there are going to be learning outcome improvements. They include government schools such as Darley Primary School and non-government schools such as St Alpius. Both of these are projects in need, and there are of course many others.
Australia currently ranks 19th out of 30 OECD countries for upper secondary school completion. Australia also has one of the highest proportions of 15- to 19-year-olds who are not in education or work, ranking us in the bottom half of the OECD. In my own region, estimates place the number of 15- to 19-year-olds who are out of work and not engaged in school or other education or training at around 23 per cent. We have an enormous responsibility to these children to ensure that they are able to meet the challenges of the 21st century and are able to move on to tertiary education, New Apprenticeships or employment.
Investment in education is fundamental to ensuring that these young people have the foundations and the ability to seize opportunities in the future. VET in Schools has been an important step in assisting young people, but many schools are finding the capital investment required to expand VET in Schools is well beyond their reach. This is one of the reasons it is disappointing that this bill is focused solely on capital investment for non-government schools, while not focusing on those areas of capital investment in non-government schools that might actually improve learning outcomes. Whilst it is important to invest in education, there must be greater transparency. I want to know that the money is going to schools on the basis of need—not going to build a new hockey pitch at an already well-resourced school but genuinely helping to improve learning outcomes for students in non-government schools. There must be some accountability, with an easily accessible record of which school received which money for which project. There used to be in existence a large book that documented where funds went in relation to capital grants to non-government schools. This sort of accountability has disappeared under the Howard government. 
The government, despite all the spin, has in my view a bias towards resourcing private schools. The government does seem to want to focus the debate on a two-tiered system around choice—the choice between government and non-government schools. Perhaps it is not surprising to note that only 20 per cent of government ministers attended government schools and a substantial number attended some of the wealthiest schools in this country. On our side, over 50 per cent of the shadow ministry attended government schools, and if you add Catholic parish schools, such as the one I attended, it rises to well over 60 per cent. I am certainly not saying that by attending wealthy private schools ministers had a better education; in fact, I think that is questionable in the case of some ministers. I am saying that their very experiences mean that they have little regard for, or understanding of, or interest in, the needs of government or Catholic parish schools. They are often so keen to support their own alma maters—by ensuring an allocation of a greater proportion of funding dollars to schools with excellent facilities and resources—that there is often little left to assist government schools, Catholic parish schools and other non-government schools in need.
This bill also focuses on the issue of numeracy and literacy. An increasing level of numeracy and literacy skills is required to function in our society. It is pleasing to see that the government recognises this by providing in this bill additional funds for national initiatives in 2003 and 2004. One could view this increase with a degree of cynicism, though, when realising that it will only restore funding to the levels of 2002. As with the capital grants to non-government schools, there needs to be more accountability about the expenditure of literacy and numeracy grants. Guidelines need to be tightened, requiring evidence of improved learning outcomes for students from schools receiving funding. Funding of conferences, publications and small research projects is all very well, but only where it can be demonstrated that literacy and numeracy skills have actually improved because of the expenditure.
Research has shown that there have been some improvements against the national reading benchmarks for students in years 3 and 5 in 2000. The performance of Indigenous students, however, is particularly concerning, with research showing results below the national benchmark. Indigenous students, as well as boys, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, students from rural areas and students with backgrounds in languages other than English also record poorer results in relation to reading literacy. These are the areas that need to be targeted specifically, where there is funding available for numeracy and literacy programs.
I am proud of the achievements of the students and teachers of Darley Primary School in my electorate, who won a 2003 achievement award in the National Numeracy and Literacy Week. The award demonstrated the commitment of the teachers of Darley Primary School to improve the literacy and numeracy of their students in preparing them for their future lives. The teachers have achieved some fantastic outcomes in a poorly resourced school with outdated buildings—in fact, over 90 per cent of the buildings at the school are still portables—and poor infrastructure. One can only imagine what achievements might have been possible if the school had been better resourced. 
Finally, while supporting this bill, I want to reiterate that education is a fundamental equaliser. It is fundamental to achieving a fairer and more equitable society. The federal government does not have responsibility only for non-government schools, as many of the speakers on the government side of the House would have us believe; it has responsibility for all schools, whether they are government or non-government schools. More importantly, it has responsibility for all students, and that means it has to look very seriously at where it spends scarce resources—for the benefit of all students and particularly for the benefit of those who are least advantaged by wealth.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hunt, Gregory, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—In rising to address the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003, I want to start by concentrating on three different schools within my electorate of Flinders. The first is Westpark Primary in Hastings. Westpark Primary, under the principalship of Brian Forward, backed up by a magnificent staff, is in an area which, by all indicators, has significant disadvantages. The school has challenges for students and challenges for parents. It has one of the highest levels of single parenting in the state. Yet, despite those disadvantages, I am very proud to be able to say that, through an education innovation grant provided by the Commonwealth, they have been able to prepare a literacy program—which initially started with grade 6 students but is now working with prep students and grade 1 students—developing a concept, a base and an ability in literacy. Working with Monash University, this program has brought the school community together to focus on the very basics—the absolute building blocks for knowledge, learning and self-confidence, which will see the little prep students and the little grade 1 students right through their educational career into adulthood.
This program is an example of the sorts of things that I believe we should be doing throughout the electorate of Flinders and throughout Australia. It has a targeted focus on literacy and the very basic building blocks. Even though they are a responsibility of the states, I do not shy away from the fact that we set out consciously to deal with literacy issues. Those broader questions are raised and addressed directly in this particular bill.
The second school that I want to focus on is Cranbourne Christian College. Cranbourne Christian College, unlike Westpark Primary, is not a primary school: it runs from prep right through to year 12. It is a private, low-fee Christian school. It was established just over a decade ago by a group of far-sighted and forward-thinking people who had a commitment to private Christian education in a low-income area. It is in a low-income area and it is for low-income families.
Along the way the school has received a succession of Commonwealth grants. I was fortunate to attend the recent opening of the school's newest facility: a new arts facility, largely provided by Commonwealth funding, but with a significant contribution from the school community. I was able to see a school which would not have existed but for Commonwealth contributions. I saw the work of the school community in creating a magnificent learning environment. 
Both Westpark in Hastings and Cranbourne Christian College are full of committed teachers. Each of them has worked, on the basis of funding contributed by the Commonwealth, to try to expand the literacy and general opportunities available in order to give their children a chance of a real future where they would have the basic skills, a basic understanding of society and the knowledge and opportunity to live rich and fulfilling lives. Those schools have benefited from the two core elements of this bill: literacy funding and capital funding. Those are the essential elements of this bill.
The third school I want to mention is Somerville Secondary College. Somerville Secondary College has not come into being yet, but it will. It will come into being as a result of a concerted campaign by the Somerville community. This large town had no secondary college. It had a significant education gap, and it had social problems as a result of that. As a consequence of a focused, directed and absolutely unyielding campaign by local residents, parents and students, we were successful in winning the battle for a secondary college.
That college will come into being in 2005. I am delighted that it will come into being. It will come into being with a mixture of state and Commonwealth funding. We are pushing to ensure that if the Commonwealth provides funding—and I hope that it will provide some millions of dollars—that will not be used to decrease the state proportion of funding. If that happens, two of the core projects within the school—creating the playing fields and the arts and drama centre—may not be able to go ahead. I believe that we will be successful in receiving Commonwealth funding. We have made the case and the funding is likely to be the outcome. However, I hope that that will not lead to a consequent decrease in state funding. Indeed, I have been working with my colleague in the state parliament, who is from the other side of the political divide, because we both believe that it would be a tragedy if the Commonwealth provided funding and the state consequently decreased its own funding. We want to see a fully resourced school in its educational and extracurricular facilities. That proposal is on the table and we believe we should be able to achieve it.
In looking at the bill, I want to address its two core elements—firstly, the notion of capital funding and, secondly, the notion of support for literacy. In looking at capital funding, we find that it builds on a pattern and a process of increased government funding over the last seven years. The government's current budget allocates a record $6.9 billion to Australian schools and students for 2003. That is an increase of approximately $528 million or 8.3 per cent over the last year. That is significantly and dramatically higher than the rate of inflation. So there have been real increases over the last few years.
In addition, since 1996 the total Commonwealth funding for schools and students has grown by more than 93 per cent. Again, that is well in excess of the rate of inflation and well in excess of the rate at which state funding has grown. In that situation, we can see that, over the 2001 to 2004 funding quadrennium, schools will receive over $1.3 billion in Commonwealth funding under the capital grants program. Of this funding, approximately $950 million will go to government schools—72 per cent of funding to a sector with 68 per cent of enrolments—which does redress some of the claims made by critics of the program. In addition, approximately $373 million will go to non-government schools.
It is interesting to understand the philosophy behind this program. Funding is given to non-government schools for two reasons: firstly, many of the students at non-government schools have a much lower socioeconomic background than many of the students at government schools; and, secondly, across the board, for each student in a non-government school the net cost to government of having them there is far less than the net cost were they all to transfer back to government schools. That means more money for each student in government schools. That is a very important notion. Every student whose parent chooses to make a contribution is actually saving the government money, so it can put more into government schools. In a sense that may be counterintuitive, but it is empirically and demonstrably the case. 
In that context, the capital allocations made under this bill are critical, because they allow us to go forward. It means that if money is available for schools like Bayview Christian College, Flinders Christian College, Hillcrest Christian College and Cranbourne Christian College, at the same time, through other provisions, there will also be significant amounts of funding for Somerville Secondary College and for capital works such as those at the Rye Primary School and also the Dromana Secondary College, which has just received a significant additional grant, bringing to almost $2 million the amount of Commonwealth funding that the Dromana Secondary College, under the admiral principalship of David Barclay, has received over the last couple of years.
The second great item in this bill is a simple one: funding to assist with literacy and numeracy. We are all in agreement that literacy and numeracy are the most important foundation skills our children need during their education. When we look at the joint program at Westpark Primary School and Hastings Primary School we see the impact on children of dedicated, focused literacy education. That program has a real impact. The money which is made available in this bill to assist with literacy and numeracy plays a very important role. By supporting the improved literacy and numeracy program for all Australian students, we are providing a foundation. But there are significant steps still to be taken. As a country we are not as far forward as we should be on this issue. There have been gaps. At times there have been education fads which have taken the focus away from the bases of literacy and numeracy. 
I am an unashamed, unequivocal supporter of literacy and numeracy programs as the absolute sine qua non—the absolute base—of all education in our primary schools. Where there is an attempt to divert from literacy and numeracy because in some way they are seen as unfashionable, old hat, conservative or traditional I will oppose any move away from literacy and numeracy. They are the basis upon which all our primary and secondary education should be founded. This bill adds to those bases. I am delighted to commend to the House the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. Above all else, I commend to the House the two notions within it: firstly, capital funding for contributing to and building upon education resources; and, secondly, the focus on literacy and numeracy.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I rise to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. We in the electorate of McMillan are fortunate to have some outstanding non-government and government schools in both the primary and secondary sectors. I want to mention an important point: the need to have some flexibility in what you do with school funding when there are particular issues. Some members in the chamber today are Victorians. They would recognise that in country districts in particular it is possible to have student outcomes which are vastly different from the general trend. All of Victoria might be heading in one direction but it is possible to have a region, be it an outer metropolitan region or a country district, which is heading in another direction. It is important to have flexibility in how we fund schools and in what money is generally available to meet the different needs that sometimes exist in country districts or outer suburban areas. 
It is well known that the Gippsland region was hit hard during the early part of the 1990s. Probably until a couple of years ago you would have said that we were identified as one of the most disadvantaged regions in the country. One of the ways in which that manifested itself was a fall-off in retention rates to year 12 and marks which were not as high as we would have liked to have seen. In recognition of this, the Victorian state government took the bold decision to intervene in the circumstances and to fund an initiative which has come to be known as the Gippsland Education Precinct. That initiative brings together under one banner a number of public secondary colleges in the Latrobe Valley, the local group training provider, Gippsland Group Training Ltd, which is one of the best group training providers in the country, and what has come to be known as GippsTAFE—what we have always known as the Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE—to be located at a shared campus at the site of Monash University's campus at Churchill. It brought together all those disparate elements of higher education and it was seen as an idea which had the great potential to break the pattern that we in the Gippsland region were in—that is, marks that were not as high as they should have been and, sadly for us, falling retention rates at year 12.
I am pleased to report that there has been steady progress, in particular around the organisation and work which have been needed to be done to get the initiative in place. We are well advanced. A new campus principal has been appointed for what is going to be called the education precinct campus. Kurnai College has agreed to put its year 11 and 12 campus wholly out at Churchill, which is a courageous decision on behalf of that school. The other secondary colleges, Traralgon and Lowanna, will be participating in the education precinct using audiovisual and Internet connections as part of what is known as the ICT hub, which is administered from the campus to those remote locations where people will be able to benefit from the initiatives offered by the education precinct project.
A lot of good work is being done. It is important that we in this place recognise the hard work of Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE under the leadership of Jeff Gunningham, Gippsland Group Training under the leadership of Kevin Kennedy its CEO, and Kurnai College under the leadership of Margaret Corcoran. They have worked with Professor Brian McKenzie, the Pro Vice Chancellor of Monash University, Gippsland, in getting together this incredible initiative and getting us to the point now where we are very close to taking our first enrolment of students at that campus. 
You need some flexibility in meeting the circumstances. To their credit, the state government have done the right thing in supporting this initiative at a cost of some $15 million. Through the Australian National Training Authority, $1 million of federal government money has also gone into the project. We are talking about having the flexibility to respond to these circumstances to make sure people do not fall behind or get left behind in education more generally.
In my electoral district we are very fortunate to have an unusual high school program offered at Trafalgar High School. It is a program I have had cause to be involved in quite a bit over the years. It is the accelerated learning program run at Trafalgar High School. It is not that big a school—there are probably 500-odd kids—but it runs the program which it administers for the entire subregion of the Latrobe Valley. There are about 120 kids who participate in the accelerated learning program. There are incredible benefits for them in that they are able to participate in a program that would not be offered to them in the public system anywhere in the entire Gippsland region. 
 (Mr Lindsay)—I will just point out to the member for McMillan that the chair is having difficulty relating this to the substance of the bill.
—Fair shake of the sheep's dag! If the member for Flinders was in order I think I probably am too, but I take your point, as I always do.
—I thank the member for McMillan and I thank him for recognising the standing orders.
—Trafalgar High School's program is an important program to talk about because it points to the incredible diversity that we have in schools within the public system and also within the non-government system. Trafalgar High School is an excellent school. It operates in a small town. Trafalgar is not a big town; there are about 3,500 people there. It is a great little community and there are a lot of very good people there. But if we were just talking about meeting the needs of the people of Trafalgar you would never be able to run an accelerated learning program. There are some 120 kids who participate in that program. All the people of the Latrobe Valley get to benefit from having that program because of the leadership of Trafalgar High School in providing that program and offering it to people right across the Latrobe Valley.
—That might be enough on the Trafalgar High School accelerated learning program. Could we move on?
—It is an excellent program.
—I said that would be enough.
—It is an excellent program. While we are talking about schools more generally, I had cause the other day to visit the Poowong and district primary school, which is, not surprisingly, in Poowong in the southern part of my electoral district. I participated in a mock parliament, which was organised by the teaching staff and students at Poowong and district primary school. I have been to a lot of schools, as I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other members of this place have too. I have never seen a place so well set up as this school classroom was for grades 4 and 5. The grade 6 kids came and joined us as well. I am sure the clerks would be interested to know they had a place for the clerks set up in their classroom and they had gone to a lot of trouble to even have the people who record the proceedings identified as well. They did a very good job.
We are very fortunate to have at the schools the staff that we do. They are creative and are prepared to put in the hard work and go that extra mile in doing the research that is involved in making something that might be not that special into something that is special. We are fortunate to have the teachers that we have in the schools in our state system and also in the non-government system. The teachers at Poowong and district primary school obviously take a great deal of pride in their commitment to their students. People in country districts are often very fortunate indeed to have such committed and professional staff, who are working in very difficult circumstances where people have to travel large distances to get to school. Often country schools are not as well resourced as they should be. 
—It would assist the chair if the member for McMillan could refer to the bill from time to time.
—I am happy to refer to the bill. Far be it from me to make any reference to the importance of the chair in being fair in how he enforces the standing orders but—
—If the member for McMillan does not return to the bill I will sit him down. I have given him ample opportunity to return to the bill. I ask him to assist the chair.
—The bill is about a couple of very basic things. It is about literacy and numeracy and it is about making sure there is funding for schools. I do not see how it could be more relevant. I will come back to the point that I made before: if I am not in order then the member for Flinders was not in order. If we are going to have a fair dinkum debate, let us have a fair dinkum debate about an important issue in our community. People are concerned about whether or not there are programs available to them in their community like the Trafalgar High School's accelerated learning program. They are concerned about the state of funding that exists for small schools in struggling areas like Poowong.
These are all things which have to be talked about in a debate about schools in the secondary and primary systems. If we cannot talk about this maybe we should not have a debate. These are things that matter to people who live in electorates like mine and in the electorate of the member for Corio, who is here beside me, and to just about everyone else in here. If we are going to have a fair dinkum debate we have to be able to talk about these things.
I picked up a point that was made earlier by someone in relation to flexibility and making sure that we had a creative response to different types of educational situations. Literacy is one of these things too. Literacy is one of those things where you have to have programs in place to make sure that people do not get left behind and do not get left out of the educational opportunities which are available to people in schools. One of things I want to take the opportunity to mention is how proud I was that, in the electorate of McMillan, there were two schools which received National Literacy and Numeracy Week awards this year. Both of these schools were in the Latrobe Valley—Grey Street Primary School in my beloved old home town of Traralgon and also Saint Keiran's School in beautiful Moe, the town I have my electorate office in.
—A beautiful place; I've been there many times.
—The member for Corio is telling me that he has been there many times. He has been, over the years, and he knows just how wonderful a place the Latrobe Valley is. We are fortunate to have in the Latrobe Valley, in the electorate of McMillan, two high-performing schools which have both won National Literacy and Numeracy Week awards. I make the point—and not many people know this—that only 50 of those awards get given out every year. There are 150 members of the House of Representatives, so you would reasonably think that one in three members might be lucky enough to have one of these awards given out in their electoral district. So imagine how fortunate we are, in the electorate of McMillan, in the Latrobe Valley, to have got not one but two. Saint Keiran's in Moe and Grey Street Primary School in Traralgon have really done us proud. They have been great achievers and great contributors to education in the Latrobe Valley region. 
On Thursday night I was invited to attend and took great pleasure in attending the Drouin Secondary College annual presentation night. It was a great event. Drouin Secondary College really is a remarkable school, an excellent school. It is very fortunate to have outstanding leadership. The principal, Rod Dunlop, is a good man and a fine leader and he is very ably supported by two assistant principals. But I particularly want to mention the important role that Lois Juratowitch has played at that school for more than 20 years. Excellent leadership at Drouin Secondary College is producing some outstanding results and is producing some students who are very community minded and who have a real commitment not just to themselves but to their community as well. It was an excellent occasion.
One of the things that people who get cynical about life and who get worried about our young people need to do from time to time is to go to a year 12 presentation night, because it really is an inspiring thing to see how many outstanding young people are being produced from schools like Drouin Secondary College—people who are well equipped to take on the challenges that the world has for them and well equipped to deal with more than just matters to do with work but also matters to do with their community involvement over the years ahead and also to deal with some of the other challenges that come up in life. Drouin Secondary College is a remarkable school and very ably led. It was a very positive occasion and a great celebration of a lot that is good about Drouin Secondary College.
I have a number of very small schools in my electoral district. One of the schools which I want to take the opportunity tonight to mention is Noojee Primary School. Noojee Primary School is a beautiful little school. It is probably one of the most remote schools in the electoral district of McMillan. It has 24 students this year. The school is nestled on the south side of Mount Baw Baw. It really is an incredible school community. I remember speaking to the principal, Ron Gillchrist, shortly after he had taken on his posting there. He was talking to me about how he had organised his first school working bee. He had 24 kids at the school, and at his first school working bee 24 sets of parents came out. That is not a bad percentage, you would have to agree. It is hard to beat 100 per cent. That is the sort of place Noojee is.
Noojee Primary School is a special place. Recently, with the community I celebrated an important milestone for the school—it had been in that community, serving that district, for quite some time. It was incredible to see how far people had come to celebrate Noojee Primary School's proud achievements. People had come from Western Australia and from Queensland. People who had grown up in the tiny village of Noojee and were living in Melbourne had made the trek all the way back down the Princes Highway, north of Warragul, to Noojee to participate in this occasion.
This is the importance of schools. They are something that people remember forever and they play an incredibly important role in people's formative experiences and often in their outlook on life as well. It was fortunate for us that in our district we have had such a large number of excellent schools which have been doing incredible things in our district and really adding a lot to the quality of life that we have in our region. We have schools which are responding to the contemporary challenges in education, such as people dealing with issues of disadvantage. We have some schools in our district which have a very high proportion of students who are from families in receipt of education maintenance allowance, which as most people—at least the Victorians—would be aware means that in large part they are from families who are in receipt of welfare benefits. We have a number of schools which are coping with difficult issues of isolation. We have a number of schools which are coping with substantial changes to the region in which they have always operated. I speak particularly of those schools in the Pakenham region, where there has been an explosion of enrolments over the last five or six years. There have been massive enrolments as a large number of people have moved into the area. Schools of course need to keep up with the demand to be able to meet the needs of communities and parents. 
We are fortunate, in the electorate of McMillan, to have so many outstanding schools, so many excellent educational leaders and so many teachers and parents prepared to do the hard work that is required to make a school a success. We are fortunate, and I want to place on the record my admiration for all those people who have been involved for so many years in working hard to make our schools as good as they are.

"Pearce, Christopher, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—We have just heard 20 minutes of the member for McMillan doing what he should have done on the adjournment debate. He has obviously forgotten about that. The bill before the House is the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. I do understand why the member for McMillan would not want to talk about this bill: this is a good news bill. This is more money to Australian schools, so, naturally, he would not want to talk about the bill. Rather, he has taken 20 minutes of the chamber's time doing something that he could have done in about a quarter of that time in the adjournment debate later on this evening.
The Howard government has a strong and continuing track record of significant investment, both financial and intellectual, in the delivery of better educational opportunities and outcomes for all Australian students. This bill, the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003, implements important initiatives from this year's budget which add to that proud record of achievement. The bill also demonstrates the government's dedication to the task of continuing to build on what has been achieved and to make further improvements to our nation's education system.
One of the major achievements to date which it is continuing to build on is the government's delivery of improving resources for all schools, government and non-government. All schools get more money from this government. In every budget and in grants to every state and territory for every year since 1996, funding for schooling has increased. In recent budgets the rate of federal funding for public schooling has risen more rapidly than state and territory funding. This year's budget allocated a record $6.9 billion to Australian schools and students, which represents an 8.3 per cent increase on last year. That equates to over half a billion dollars more investment in Australian schooling and adds to this government's strong track record on schools. That record is best demonstrated by the fact that, since 1996, Commonwealth funding for schools and students has grown by more than 93 per cent. Also consider that, over the next four years to 2006-07, Commonwealth funding for Australian schools will total over $30 billion.
As I mentioned earlier, that record stands in stark contrast to the states and territories, particularly in my home state of Victoria. The people of Aston have begun to see first-hand the broken promises and empty rhetoric of the Bracks government, which have been exposed by their betrayal on things like the Scoresby Freeway. Education funding provides another pointer to the fact that, as the Commonwealth Treasurer points out, one should not listen to what Labor say but rather look at what they do for a true indication of reality. 
The states and territories have the temerity to claim that the Australian government is not supporting their efforts and investment in government schools. This is plainly untrue. This government has provided more federal funding directly into government schools and has provided the states and territories with improved tax arrangements, particularly in terms of revenue growth. Despite the states and territories having constitutional and primary responsibility for funding government schools, this government—the federal government—has increased funding to these schools by almost 60 per cent since 1996. In that time, enrolments in government schools nationally have increased by only 1.6 per cent.
The Commonwealth's tax reform process has provided the states and territories with a growth in revenues tax from the GST, which is aimed at helping them meet their funding responsibilities. In Victoria, for example, the GST will deliver $6.4 billion in revenue in this year alone. Yet despite this, and despite their claimed focus on education, the Bracks government has failed government school students and their parents not just in my electorate but across the whole of Victoria.
In this year's Victorian budget, the Bracks government increased funding to government schools by only 2.3 per cent. That is a net decrease in real terms. That stands in stark contrast to the Australian government, which increased funding to Victorian government schools by 6.1 percent. So you have to ask the question: what does that mean in practical terms? It means that, by failing to match the Commonwealth's funding increase, Victorian government schools like Kent Park Primary School in Knoxfield and, most importantly, their students are being short-changed by the Bracks government to the tune of $179 million. So, as you can see, while Labor may claim to care about the education of our children, the reality of their actions is very different.
This year's budget continued the government's commitment to the capital grants program, which supports local non-government schools like those in my electorate. Capital grants assist schools with the provision and upgrading of important school infrastructure. This infrastructure includes such things as land, buildings, water and electricity, equipment, library materials and cataloguing services, and furniture. In fact, since I became the member for Aston in 2001, the capital grants program has had a real impact on local schools and school communities in my electorate. Capital grants have benefited both non-government and government schools. For example, grants have included over $700,000 to St Simons Primary School, over $200,000 to the Waverley Christian College in Wantirna and over $450,000 to Heathmont College in Heathmont for the upgrading of existing facilities.
This bill implements the government's commitment of a further $48.2 million for the non-government schools program over the four years from 2004 through to 2007. This will mean that Commonwealth funding for the non-government capital program is maintained in real terms. This is important, because without this appropriation the level of capital funding for non-government schools from 2004 to 2007 will actually fall by more than $11.7 million each year below the current level. This would adversely affect schools serving the most educationally disadvantaged students. 
As I mentioned, this funding is part of the government's ongoing commitment to help provide the infrastructure that is needed to create the best learning environment for all of our children. Over the four years from 2001 to 2004, Australian schools will receive over $1.3 billion in Commonwealth funding under the capital grants program alone. Of this funding, almost $950 million will go to government schools and over $373 million to non-government schools. Looking ahead, from 2004 to 2007 government schools will receive capital grants funding of over $222 million each year and non-government schools will receive over $87 million each year. This is a significant investment and will be supplemented in line with movements in non-residential building costs as measured by the ABS.
Commonwealth funding for all schools is focused on achieving agreed national standards, particularly for literacy and numeracy, to which a further $210 million was committed in this year's budget. Literacy and numeracy are important foundation skills our children need during their education. The government values the development of proficiency in these skills because they help young people to better reach their potential and, of course, to take advantage of education, training and employment opportunities throughout their entire lives. The government remains committed to continuing its efforts to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes for Australian students by providing support for the implementation of the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan. The plan is aimed at achieving the national goal, which is that all students should have attained the skills of numeracy and English literacy such that every student is numerate and able to read, write, spell and communicate at an appropriate level. I am pleased to say that schools in my electorate are helping to lead the way in delivering on these objectives. These schools include Holy Trinity Primary School in Wantirna South, which was recognised with an achievement award as part of the government's National Literacy and Numeracy Week celebrations.
The bill provides additional funding under the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes program of over $33 million for 2004 alone. This funding is used by the states and territories to support critically important and sensitive programs in schools for those students requiring additional assistance. The bill also provides additional funding under the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies and Projects program of over $10.8 million for this year and next. This funding is used to support the development of national standards and comparable national reporting, including reporting against performance measures. The continuation of these two funding streams will support improved learning outcomes for educationally disadvantaged students, particularly in the key areas of literacy and numeracy. The funding will also support strategic literacy and numeracy research and development. 
The government's significant investment in literacy and numeracy has indeed already delivered very good progress. According to results from the OECD Program for International Student Assessment, only one country performed better than Australia in reading literacy and only two countries performed better in mathematical and scientific literacy. As a result of this government's leadership, Australia now has its first national reporting and assessment of literacy and numeracy standards, which are currently at years 3, 5 and 7. The government has also helped to secure greater reporting to parents of their child's skills in literacy and numeracy.
The education measures in this year's budget, including those implemented through this bill, strengthen the government's leadership role in demanding the best for all of our students. That role is multifaceted. It is about providing the necessary resources to help deliver a better learning environment for all of our students. It is also about making that investment work smarter by putting the right frameworks in place, like the National Literacy and Numeracy Plan, to ensure we achieve the outcomes that are best and that we indeed expect for all of our children. This bill is an important part of that ongoing effort, and I therefore commend it to the House.

"Hoare, Kelly, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—I rise tonight to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. The purpose of this legislation is to provide funding for capital grants to non-government schools to maintain the 2003 funding level for the next four years, and to continue funding in 2004 for targeted programs for educationally disadvantaged students and for literacy and numeracy projects. The bill provides funding of $41.8 million over four years, from 2004 to 2007, for approved projects in non-government schools. The effect of the bill is to maintain the 2003 funding level for the years from 2004 to 2007. Funding for non-government schools' capital grants in 2003 is $87.4 million. The current legislated allocation for 2004 and beyond is $76.94 million, a reduction of $41.84 million over four years. This reduction results from the termination of a previous government commitment.
The government is now proposing to extend that commitment for the period 2004-07. This would enable the capital grants program to be offered to approved projects under advanced approval arrangements, which have been in place for many years to enable schools to plan their capital projects prior to receiving public funds. But, as the shadow minister has outlined, the legislation raises a number of important issues. This bill does nothing about capital needs in government schools. On a recent visit to Edgeworth Public School in my electorate of Charlton, I was told how badly they needed a school hall. This bill does nothing to address that need. While I was a guest at West Wallsend High School, it was made clear to me that there are senior school students studying for their higher school certificate who have to share textbooks because there are not enough to go around. This is a disgrace, and there is nothing in this bill to address such an appalling state of affairs. Yet expenditure from all sources in non-government schools of $1,073 per student is well above the $355 per public school student.
The current arrangements do not adequately protect the public interest in the wealth created by Commonwealth funding for capital investment for churches and private organisations. Accountability in public reporting about the allocation of capital funds, particularly against needs criteria, is unclear and lacks transparency. The additional funding provided for high-fee schools under the government's general recurrent program could lead to increased capital investment in those schools, increasing the resources gap between them and other government and non-government schools.
The bill also provides for an additional $10.87 million in 2003-04 for national initiatives in literacy, which restores funding to the 2002 levels. This is of course welcome. However, the existing guidelines for national projects in literacy and numeracy are loose. Funding is used to promote conferences and publications, as well as a range of small research projects. These guidelines must be reformed and tightened and they must show evidence of improved learning outcomes for students in accountability for these projects. In one-third of OECD countries, including Australia, between 67 and 79 per cent of 15-year-old students are proficient at least at level 3 on the reading literacy scale. Although in Australia there are many students whose literacy is at the highest level on the scale, over 10 per cent of Australian students still have a literacy level at or below level 1. The government must address this serious issue. It should be addressed in this legislation. 
We welcome the additional funding of $33.79 million for grants for Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes. This program is for schools and students in disadvantaged areas and for students with disabilities. Remembering the disproportionate funding from this bill that is being poured into private schools, it is very important to note that nearly 88 per cent of Indigenous students attend public schools. Some 4.5 per cent of students in public schools are Indigenous, compared to the 1.4 per cent who attend private schools. Around 82 per cent of students with disabilities attend a public school. Two per cent of private school students have a disability and over four per cent of students in public schools live with a disability. Of students attending public schools, 3.2 per cent live in remote areas, whereas the number attending private schools is 1.2 per cent.
It seems that once again we are having the state aid debate. In 1973 the Whitlam government established a system for funding non-government schools based on relative needs. The Education Resources Index operated successfully over the next quarter of a century, with various modifications. In 2000 the state grants bill changed the way the Commonwealth provided funding to schools. Those changes allowed the 62 category 1 schools around Australia to share up to $50 million per year in extra Commonwealth funding. That new scheme proposed the use of a socioeconomic status model and based federal funding for private schools on an estimate of the wealth of the parents of the students. This was based on the average income not of the parents of the students attending those schools but of the region in which they lived. Absolutely no account was taken of the individual wealth of the parents or the schools or any private support received. Of course, many kids attending the King's School come from rural New South Wales, where the average incomes are generally low.
A good example of how inequitable and plainly unfair this model is can be illustrated by Victorian media reports of the fact that in 2001 when the system was introduced the Worowa Aboriginal College in Healesville received an additional $23 per student, whereas Wesley College in Prahran in Melbourne was granted an extra $249 per student. Geelong Grammar was granted $402 and Haileybury College received an additional $452 per student. This comparison gets worse when we put it beside most non-government schools in Melbourne's western suburbs and country Victoria, and most of the state's Jewish schools, which received no additional funding at all. Queensland's Courier-Mail recorded in June that the state's eight grammar schools, which charge up to $10,000 a year in fees, collected more than $25.8 million in public money last year. It further reported the elite Brisbane Grammar School received $2.4 million from the federal government, which will increase to $3.2 million by 2004.
At their meeting in July this year, all state and territory education ministers demanded that the Howard government scrap the socioeconomic status funding index, which they said was delivering massive increases to the wealthiest private schools at the expense of many public schools. Commonwealth funding to private schools increased by an average of $996 per student from 1999 to 2003. That was more than seven times the increase to government schools. By 2007 government schools will be getting $828 per student and private schools will be getting $4,531. This is yet another reason for the Australian people to toss out this government for the rich and replace it with a Labor government, who will govern for all. 
Figures indicate that, since the budget for 1995-96, Commonwealth specific purpose payments for schools have increased. However, this increase has been greatest for non-government schools, with an increase of 134.6 per cent, compared to a 66.7 per cent increase for government schools. The current budget papers show total Commonwealth expenditure by function and sub-function and indicate that by 2006-07 total Commonwealth funding for non-government schools will reach $5,425 million, compared to $2,647 million for government schools. Government schools will get less than half the money. In percentage terms, by 2006-07 non-government schools will be receiving 67.2 per cent of all Commonwealth funding for schools. We should also remember that from this financial year the federal government's funding for non-government schools will surpass its total expenditure on higher education. And this is a government that denies that there is a crisis in Australia's education system.
Forward estimates indicate that by 2006-07 the Howard government will spend nearly $5.5 billion on private schools, $5.3 billion on universities and only $2.6 billion on public schools. I would like to note that the proportion of Commonwealth specific purpose payments for schools in 1995-96 was 55.6 per cent for non-government schools and 40.4 per cent for government schools. That has changed dramatically with this government's policies. Now, in 2003, 66 per cent of specific purpose payments are directed at the non-government sector. Public schools get a paltry 34 per cent of that funding.
I would like to take a moment to showcase a couple of public schools in my electorate of Charlton. Over the past month I have had the privilege of attending the 50th birthdays of two local primary schools: Argenton Public School and Blackalls Park Public School. I attended Blackalls Park's on Saturday. Both of these schools, along with all other schools in my electorate, have a fine tradition of delivering good education and good values to the children in my electorate. I congratulate both Blackalls Park Public School and Argenton Public School on achieving this magnificent milestone. I congratulate all the teachers, students, support staff and the whole communities of those schools on achieving this great milestone and I wish them all the very best for the next 50 years. I am looking forward to supporting those schools and all other schools in my electorate over the coming years.
Another school in my electorate, Speers Point Public School, topped the nation this year in receiving an award in the 2003 National Awards for Quality Schooling. Speers Point School was selected to win a prize of $24,000 for outstanding achievement in the area of safe school environments. Apparently the quality of applications received for the awards was of an exceptionally high standard, so I was able to commend Speers Point Public School for its considerable achievement. I think its prize was one of only 16 prizes awarded for outstanding achievement right across the nation. It is great and deserving as well that it went to a public school in my electorate. I had the opportunity to host the principal of Speers Point Public School when school members came here in the last parliamentary sitting to receive their prize. They were justifiably proud, as were the other teachers, staff, students and members of the whole school community that worked together on this project. Once again I congratulate them on it. 
We on the Labor side of parliament will support this bill, but we have moved amendments relating to the capital funding of non-government schools. These concern the explicit provision within the act that eligibility for capital grants requires schools to demonstrate education and financial need and that evidence for this be made publicly available through appropriate accountability arrangements. Labor's amendments also seek to address provision for the tabling of annual reports in the parliament on all projects supported by this capital program.
In 2002 an independent report was released following an inquiry into education which was conducted by Professor Tony Vinson. Professor Vinson noted the following conclusions from his independent inquiry. Australia's investment in education now ranks in the bottom quarter of OECD countries. Federal funding to private schools, however, has increased by 128 per cent. Australia appeared to be the only OECD country in which school participation rates had been falling in the 1990s, yet we lavishly funded those private school systems with high participation and retention rates. Public schools educate the vast majority of children with special education needs, children from Indigenous communities and those who are socially disadvantaged. The great bulk of federal schools money now goes to private schools. Some private schools `operate at levels of recurrent expenditure that is more than double that of many government schools', yet still taxpayers' money pours into them. The federal government spends 0.75 per cent of GDP on schools but expenditure on public schools within this has declined to 0.26 per cent as the private school share has risen to 0.49 per cent.
I think this is a pretty telling picture. Public education has suffered considerably at the hands of the government, whereas rich elite private schools—such as the King's School with its rugby and soccer fields, cross-country tracks, 50-metre swimming pools, cricket facilities and indoor shooting range—have seen extraordinary increases in funds provided by the taxes of my constituents in Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. We will be emphasising and reiterating these facts in the lead-up to next year's election. We will be reminding the Australian people and government marginal seat holders that there are over 2.2 million students in public schools and over 190,000 public school teachers. There are nearly 200,000 public school staff, over 1.3 million TAFE students and nearly 46,000 TAFE teaching staff. Coalition members need to remember that public education is now the largest institution in Australia as we embark on the debate as to the direction for education in this country.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2003-11-24,"—I rise to speak on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003. It is a bill that reflects the ongoing commitment of the Liberal-National coalition to delivering improvements in educational standards and choices. This bill follows on from the important allocations made by this government in the recent budget for a further $48.2 million, over the term 2004-07, for capital grants for non-government schools and $210 million extra for literacy and numeracy programs—very important programs indeed. There is also an additional $44.6 million for literacy and numeracy in the current 2003-04 year. It is a bill that when enacted will enable ongoing federal assistance to capital works projects for government and non-government schools for the period 2004-07, carrying on the program of the current act, which provides for funding until 2004.
The debate on this bill provides a timely opportunity for me to speak on education issues. I would like to say something about the coalition's policies on school education. During the last federal election, the Labor Party's campaign tried to attack the coalition's policies on this issue. The Labor Party generally, at both state and federal levels, seems to occupy much of its time in the education debate trying to generate an untruth that the coalition parties do not concern themselves enough with public education. Nothing could be further from the truth. The reality is that many of us who sit on the conservative benches in parliaments throughout Australia received our education in the public system. We know and understand the importance of having a system that gives young people and their parents a choice in education. The coalition is very focused on the desire for choice—choice for those who choose to send their children to a government school and choice for those who choose to send their children to a non-government school. That notion of choice is very important. It is choice for government schooling or choice for non-government schooling. 
While school education is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments, the Commonwealth has demonstrated its interest in and commitment to this area through capital grants programs and other policy initiatives. Providing a progressive education system for our young is fundamental to the future of our nation, and public education forms a core part of any debate on the most effective approach. Currently 2.2 million students attend state schools in Australia, and they receive more than $14 billion in funding each year. One million students in independent non-government schools receive about $4 billion each year. Any additional resources accruing to non-government schools come out of the pockets of parents over and above the taxes they have already paid—and that is an important point. They are paying quite substantial school fees in many cases over and above the taxes they have already paid. Those who choose private education are making a significant contribution to subsidising the cost of education in this country.
The coalition increased Commonwealth funding for non-government schools because it recognised that families have different capacities to support schools. What seems to have escaped the notice of many commentators is that there has also been a significant increase in federal funding for government run schools. Since being elected to government in 1996, the coalition has increased funding to state schools by some 52 per cent—an increase of around $811 million. That is almost $1 billion. This is despite the fact that enrolments over that period have increased by only 1.4 per cent. In the most recent federal budget, federal funding for state schools increased by 5.7 per cent. When we compare this to the New South Wales state Labor government's funding for education, which has increased by only a fraction of this amount, this paints a much more complete picture about who is making public education a priority.
Federal capital grants for schools are an important financial source of both government and non-government primary and secondary schools. They assist with capital projects at schools and thereby improve the opportunities available to students and provide for a higher quality of education in this country. The current act will see almost $1.3 billion directed through Commonwealth capital grants into schools by 2004. The breakdown of allocations between private and public schools reveals that over 72 per cent of the 2001-04 funding will go to government schools, despite the fact that this sector has only about 69 per cent of total enrolments. I think this figure clearly points out that the government has been working in the interests of both the government and non-government sectors in education. 
I am proud of the fact that the commitment made to capital projects in both government and non-government schools has been reflected in some recent commitments to our region. For example, earlier this year I announced a $925,000 grant for the Boambee Public School. Boambee is an area in my electorate which is enjoying excellent ongoing growth, and the federal government will provide assistance so that that school can build a new hall. More recently I confirmed funding of $632,000 to assist four local non-government schools with capital works projects. Last month I had the pleasure to meet with the principal of St Mary's Primary School in Bellingen, John Fletcher, the deputy principal, Jenny Triglone, and Father Jim Reilly. They took the time to show me how a federal grant of $172,709 under the capital grants program was going to assist them in the construction of new learning rooms and a library plus a new administration area. St Mary's will commence work next year.
The federal government recently announced additional funding for a number of other schools in my electorate. Bishop Druitt College at Coffs Harbour will receive $300,000 for a major project which will see a multipurpose hall and three general learning areas constructed and improvements made to administration and pupil areas. At Coffs Harbour, the Casuarina Steiner School will receive $140,000 so that they can construct two new learning areas and improve the surrounds where buses pick up and drop off students. We would all have to agree that, in the interests of safety, we have to have quality areas where buses can pick up and drop off students, regardless of whether it is a private school or a public school. Bowraville's Tallowood School will receive $20,000 so that adequate shade can be provided to students whilst they are playing on outdoor play equipment.
The federal government is investing in capital works at both government and non-government schools in my electorate. Facilities are being improved and parents are being given a genuine choice in the education they want for their children. The passing of this bill will allow schools to continue to offer attractive options in education to parents and students. Capital project funding, which will follow as a result of this bill, will assist in achieving an outcome that offers continuing choice in education.
As I have said previously, this government is about offering parents and students choice in education. In this year's budget, $6.9 billion was allocated for education—a record amount. It is 8.3 per cent more than last year. The economic policies of this government have provided an added boost to schools' capital projects this year with historically low-level interest rates, meaning that schools that desire to go out into capital markets and borrow have been able to do so, taking advantage of lower interest rates rather than having to borrow at the horrendous interest rates that existed through the Labor years.
Another economic policy of this government that I would like to touch on is the introduction of the A New Tax System. As members would be aware, under the A New Tax System state governments are provided with all the revenue—that is, 100 per cent of the revenue—collected under the GST. The growth that exists through the GST enables state governments to divert extra money into education, but it seems they are still not matching the federal government in the area of education. The amount of revenue collected under the GST is set to grow over time. Not only does the GST provide extra funding, as I said; it also provides growth funding which will allow greater investment in education, improved educational outcomes and a better state education system. 
Improvements to literacy and numeracy levels in our schools are an important priority. The government has been instrumental in establishing with the states and territories a national literacy and numeracy plan, setting goals and developing benchmarks for standards for years 3, 5 and 9. One of the important components of the action in Australia on literacy and numeracy is the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes program, the SAISO program. This program aims to help lift the learning outcomes for educationally disadvantaged students. It also helps lift levels of participation in education for students with disabilities, and it is particularly focused on literacy and numeracy. Under this bill, SAISO will receive $33.79 million more in funding for 2004. The National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies and Projects program has received $3.46 million for 2003 and, under this bill, will receive $7.41 million more for 2004.
Literacy and numeracy levels have been improving. Historically, it has been difficult to ascertain information and data on how young Australians are going in this area across the nation. This government was instrumental when it came into office in laying foundations to measure literacy and numeracy skills nationwide. It is good news that all Australian education ministers agreed to move towards a system of reporting of children's performance in this area to parents against national benchmarks. It is important to be able to compare the performance of students in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, the ACT and Western Australia. It is vital that parents receive information on how their children are progressing with their education at school against agreed benchmark standards. Reporting will also help to identify particular children in need of further educational assistance. Compared with other countries, it is encouraging for us that 15-year-old Australians are ranked by the OECD amongst the highest performers. Research results indicate that our mean performance for reading and literacy is the fourth highest in the OECD. We also achieved good rankings in science and mathematics.
Earlier this year I had the privilege to visit Willawarrin Public School and present the school with a cheque for $2,000. Willawarrin Public School is a school of approximately 100 students in the relatively isolated hills of the Macleay Valley. The school received the cheque after being named one of 60 schools in Australia to win an achievement award under the federal government's literacy and numeracy awards program. The contribution of parents to the education of their children is realising excellent rewards at Willawarrin Public School. Willawarrin is a shining example of a school working with parents in order to get great outcomes for its students. I know that a number of the parents have freely given their time so that the school's overall literacy and numeracy skills have been raised. The students at the school are to be congratulated for their efforts, but we should also acknowledge the commitment of the parents and teachers, which is producing results at Willawarrin.
In addition to involving parents, the school also produced a video of their literacy and numeracy initiatives. That video has been circulated extensively across New South Wales so that other schools can be aware of what Willawarrin is achieving. I would like to recognise the contribution of all those who are participating in the literacy and numeracy program in Willawarrin. In particular, principal Peter Wells, teacher Jenny Young and parents such as Jenny Smith and Rhonda Mossell have played a leading role. But I think it has been the overall partnership between the school and parents which has created such a great result.
There are also high schools in my electorate which are leading the commitment to improved numeracy and literacy standards. On 3 November my government colleague and federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, announced that Nambucca High School had been awarded $24,000 as part of their outstanding achievement in the federal government's National Awards for Quality Schooling. I had the pleasure of congratulating the representatives of the school, Graham and Christine Beatton and Mark Holdsworth, who attended the presentation here in Parliament House. 
Despite the improvements in recent years, we need to do more. We need to keep our eye on the ball and keep ensuring that we aim for higher educational outcomes to give our Australian students the best possible opportunities. Young Indigenous students remain an area of concern—they are 20 to 30 points under the averages for other students. There are other areas of continuing concern that would reinforce the fact that we need to keep striving in the areas of literacy and numeracy. The increased spending in this bill will allow such programs to enable children to achieve their potential.
I would like to take the opportunity to refer to APC Review,which is a publication of the Australian Parents Council. In a recent edition, the publication published a table detailing the commitments of both Commonwealth and state governments. It produced some interesting results. It is interesting to note that, for instance, in New South Wales, Commonwealth funding for education was increased by 5.7 per cent, but the comparable increase by the state government was only 0.8 per cent. If the state government in New South Wales had matched the federal government's commitment to increased funding, it would have provided an additional $292.5 million for education in New South Wales.
Likewise, if we look at Victoria, federal government expenditure was increased by 6.1 per cent. How much did the Victorian state government and Mr Bracks increase expenditure? Only 2.3 per cent. If Mr Bracks had matched Dr Nelson, there would be $179 million in additional funding for education in Victoria. Let us look at Queensland. The federal government increase was 5.4 per cent. The Queensland government increase was 2.4 per cent. If the Queensland government had matched the federal government, $116 million extra would have gone into Queensland schools. In South Australia the federal increase was 5.3 per cent. The South Australian government did not do quite as badly as its counterparts at 4.9 per cent. That is a $5 million shortfall in South Australia.
With regard to Western Australia, the federal government increase was 5.1 per cent, versus 2.8 per cent by the Western Australian state government. That is $52.9 million that the Western Australian government could have provided to schools if it had kept parity with the federal government. In Tasmania, the federal government increase was 5.6 per cent, whereas the Tasmanian state government increase was 2.9 per cent. It is a pretty sad story. The state Labor governments moan about the need for public education and the members opposite moan about the need to support public education but, when it comes to the crunch, their own state colleagues do not match the federal government's increases and they do not support public education generally to the same extent that the federal government does through increases in funding. I would like to reaffirm the federal government's commitment to the notion of choice in education and the notion that parents should be able to choose the type of education that they provide their children. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"George, Jennie, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—In discussing the allocation of capital grants to non-government schools as encompassed in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003, I think it is appropriate to reflect on what I consider to be obvious inequities in funding that we are witnessing under this government. Australia's top shelf private schools are reaping a bonanza from very generous funding allocations from the Howard government. The bonanza is the outcome of the government's SES system of funding, which, as we know, takes no account of schools' existing facilities or the tuition fees that are charged at these very elite schools. 
The amendments moved to this bill by our shadow minister the member for Jagajaga are timely, as they attempt to inject more accountability and transparency into the process of capital funding. It is not unreasonable that schools should demonstrate both educational and financial need as part of the test for capital grants. This is evidence that we believe should be publicly available. Further, annual reports should be provided to parliament on all projects supported by the Commonwealth's capital program allocation. I think it not unreasonable that there should be minimum standards and tests, particularly in the context of a significantly underresourced public education system, which continues to cater for around 70 per cent of Australia's school students.
The recent Vinson report, which looked into public education in New South Wales, found substantial substandard school infrastructure and other substandard physical conditions in government schools—so much so that it drove Professor Vinson, the independent chair of that inquiry, to comment:
In so many instances, the fabric of the public schools is simply unworthy of what is being attempted within them and fails to honour our society's obligation to its children.
Contrast that statement with a recent newspaper article that talked about the new communications network that is to be installed at Barker College at Hornsby, a level 2 school that is due to receive $3.1 million from the federal government next year. The communications network that has been installed at that school is one that public schools—certainly those in my electorate—could only ever dream of. The Sydney Morning Herald article entitled `Tax dollars at work for private schools' said:
Barker College in Hornsby installed a new communications network this year, bringing state-of-the-art networking to the private school's 200 teachers and staff and 1,870 students.
The company which installed the network, estimated to have cost around $250,000, boasted it would give faster access to the internet and allow students simultaneous access to the school's growing library of digital educational videos.
Teachers would now be able to use their laptops as “soft phones” on the network. Voicemail messages come up as email while teachers and students will be able to plug in to one of 2,132 network points around the school's 20 hectares of well-kept buildings and rolling playing fields.
That is certainly an eye-opener. At one of my local primary schools, I was recently told that they had one computer per 14 students, yet we have this largesse continuing to be handed out to schools like Barker College which have facilities that students and staff in the public schools that I represent could only ever dream of. So I do not think we can divorce the issue of capital grants from an overall consideration of the federal government's funding policies.
I believe that the non-government sector continues to be funded generously at the expense of the public education system, which, as I said earlier, continues to look after the needs and interests of about 70 per cent of our students. I specifically point to the 58 level 1 schools that will receive around $122 million in subsidies next year. That is an increase of almost $75 million on the funding levels of 2001—a 154 per cent increase in funds for these 58 elite level 1 schools. By 2006 the estimated contribution by the government to the funding of non-government schools will be in the order of $5.4 billion. It is interesting to look at that figure in the context of the current debate about the funding of our university sector. Under this government, it is reaching the stage where non-government schools are receiving as much federal government funding as is spent on the whole university sector. 
The inequities in funding are perpetuated by the very inequitable SES formula. As we know, that formula takes no account of a school's assets—its buildings and its land—nor does it take into account the fees that a school receives from its student population. Those fees are estimated to be growing at about seven per cent every year. The concept of funding on the basis of need was destroyed by this government and replaced by the SES system, which uses a very crude measure—the students' postcodes—to determine the amount of funding that a non-government school will receive.
It is no wonder that the elite schools are doing so well. Let me refer to a few in my state. Trinity Grammar is due to receive $5.48 million next year from the federal government, an increase of 247 per cent since 2001. Newington is due to receive $3.65 million, an increase of 175 per cent. The King's School is due to receive $3.23 million, an increase in funding from this government of almost 200 per cent since 2001. It is ironic, is it not, that the principal of the King's School recently acknowledged, in a newspaper article, that it `costs a fair bit to run' his 140-hectare site. After all, the King's School does have 15 cricket fields, five basketball courts, a 50-metre swimming pool, an indoor rifle range and a gymnasium. Contrast that with the system that caters for 70 per cent of our school students, who continue to be educated in a very underresourced public education system.
As Professor Vinson found in his inquiry, less than 10 per cent of students from the poorest 50 per cent of families attend independent secondary schools. So this bill has to be seen in the wider context of the continuing inequities in the funding of both sectors and the increased funding of the elite schools, which I believe comes at the expense of the great needs that continue to exist in the public education system. Those needs do not exist just in the public education system, because, as Professor Vinson also found, substantial substandard school infrastructure and physical conditions exist in some of the systemic Catholic schools as well as in the public school system. Again that points to the basis of our belief that the needs based principle should continue to be the principle that guides the allocation of funds to both sectors.
Professor Vinson's words about the fabric of the public schools being simply unworthy of what is being attempted within them does not bode well for a generation of Australian school children currently being educated in often rundown schools and, in many cases, in substandard demountable accommodation. Shellharbour Primary School in my electorate is but one example. Its student numbers doubled between 1997 and 2002, but until recently half of the school's 736 students in 26 classes were being educated in demountables. They were educated in demountables, but the government was able to find an additional $3 million for the King's School, with its splendid facilities. Those kinds of obvious inequities in the system are a cause of great concern throughout the educational community. The situation at Shellharbour Primary School has been rectified to some extent by the decision of the New South Wales government to build a new school at Flinders. However, roughly a third of students at the school continue to be taught in demountables. 
What we are seeing in our government schools and our less well-off non-government and Catholic systemic schools is an increasing burden being shifted onto parents to meet basic educational needs, including the cost of new buildings, sports grounds, covered shelters, equipment and computers. What is more, parents are being put in a position where they are donating thousands of hours of voluntary labour to carry out simple yet vital school maintenance such as cleaning toilets, maintaining gardens and repairing playground equipment. P&Cs are increasingly being used as the revenue source to pay for new infrastructure projects. In a recent article, published in one of the daily newspapers, it was estimated that funds raised by individual parents and citizens groups now average about $20,000 per school per year. I know of a local school where the P&C was raising funds for covered walkways so that kindergarten classes would not be forced to get wet by walking 100 metres to the library when it rains. In another school the P&C recently raised $10,000 for very basic necessities such as sports equipment, library resources and computers. Again I make the point that the underresourced physical infrastructure of many of the schools in the public education system is being neglected while largesse is being delivered to schools whose facilities are such that people in the public sector can only ever dream of having access to them.
It is not only students and their parents who are suffering due to poor maintenance and lack of facilities in many of our schools; staff—particularly teaching staff—report increasing stress as a result of dealing with overcrowding in their classrooms due to large class sizes and also stress relating to the general devaluing of the role and position of educators in our society. As one frustrated and angry teacher told the Vinson inquiry:
The physical conditions teachers are expected to work in are demeaning and downright insulting ... why would young, up-and-coming professionals choose to work where they don't have their own computer and where their personal work space to organise the learning of 150 to 180 students is little bigger than a small broom cupboard?
You can imagine how this teacher would react to the largesse afforded to Barker College, with its state-of-the-art communications network, which I have just described. Next year, on top of what it already has, Barker will get $3.1 million in Commonwealth funding.
In conclusion, I reiterate my support for the amendments that have been moved by the member for Jagajaga. Financial transparency and accountability are the norm for schools in the government sector. All schools regularly face performance audits and reviews of programs, management and school leadership. Regrettably, to date, financial accountability does not operate in the same open and transparent manner in the non-government sector. While non-government schools do provide the department with financial information, it seems that a lot of this is not on the public record because that information is restricted by inappropriate confidentiality clauses. Senator Carr discovered this when he recently requested specific information on the private income of private schools in an estimates hearing. In response to his inquiry, the departmental official on that occasion said:
There are privacy arrangements about the Commonwealth collecting information from schools so we would not be in a position to be able to provide [the information requested]—
I think that is a totally untenable position. At present taxpayers are expected to contribute, and do contribute, more and more to the non-government school sector. So it seems logical in this context that the financial operations of the non-government school sector should be open to public scrutiny, greater transparency and accountability. It is for those reasons that I am firmly in support of the amendments that have been moved, which—at least in my judgment—would provide a much greater level of accountability and transparency in the provision of capital grants to the non-government school sector.

"Smith, Anthony, MP",LP,2003-11-24,"—The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003 is an important piece of legislation for young students and all schools right across Australia. It allocates Commonwealth money to provide additional capital funding for non-government schools and additional funds for important literacy and numeracy programs. It includes over $48 million for building projects over the years 2004 to 2007 and it also includes funding of over $54 million for 2003 and 2004, to continue the Howard government's commitment to improving the literacy and numeracy educational outcomes for millions of young people around our nation and for more than 22,000 primary and secondary school students in the electorate of Casey.
These allocations are just a fraction of the total dollars being spent on Australia's schools by the Howard government. In 2003-04, $6.9 billion is being spent on schools and their students. This is an increase of $528 million on the previous financial year. Whilst dollars being spent do not guarantee that a particular program is always a success, growth in Commonwealth funding for Australian schools of 93 per cent since 1996 is still a significant achievement. The government is delivering on its commitment to provide a high-quality education for young Australians, and our youth deserve all that our nation can possibly afford.
High-quality school education is, in conjunction with apprenticeships and a robust university system, lifting the education levels of young people in the 21st century to a standard that previous generations could only dream of. The capital funding the federal government provides helps government and non-government schools with the provision and upgrading of infrastructure. This includes projects like new classrooms, libraries, music and computer rooms, multipurpose halls and staff and administration facilities. Between 2001 and 2004, schools are to receive over $1.3 billion in capital funding. Of this total, $950 million will go to government schools and over $370 million to non-government schools. To put these large national funding amounts into perspective, around 72 per cent of capital funding goes to government schools, a sector that educates 68 per cent of Australia's school students. Some $415,000 in capital funding has been allocated to non-government schools in Casey since 2001. Since the election of the Howard government in 1996, just over $1 million has been allocated to independent schools in our area.
It has been a privilege to regularly visit local schools right across my electorate. According to my observations, the principals and teachers are thoroughly committed to their work and to their respective school communities. It is clear that they are strongly focused on the wellbeing and advancement of their students. At the same time, the majority of young students are keen learners, always thinking seriously about the important issues of the day and, as most members in this House would know, only too ready to ask the tough questions.
From the school functions I have been part of, it is clear that many parents are just as strongly committed to ensuring that their local school offers the most positive and caring environment, focused on student wellbeing and learning. One tangible example of the interest and commitment of parents is the amount of fundraising done these days by many school communities as they undertake building works and other school improvements. Earlier this year I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of Mooroolbark East Primary School's two new classrooms, music room, canteen, staffroom, conference room and resource centre. It was a great day for the school community and its more than 400 students. The federal government contributed $470,000 to the project's total cost of over $1.2 million. Significantly, the school community itself raised $78,000 for the project, to ensure that additions could be made to the original project so that the students there could have the best possible learning and play environment. 
Like any long-term project these building works have involved many people working over a long period of time. The plans for this project, which still has one stage to go, were first developed in the mid-1990s. Since that time the school has been planning for increased student numbers as families move into surrounding new suburbs and new housing estates.
Other schools in Casey have recently completed building projects. These include Lilydale's Edinburgh Adventist Primary School, which received $90,000 towards a total project cost of some $200,000 for a new classroom, furniture and equipment and basketball court. Officially opened in February, the combined grade 4 and 5 students have enjoyed their new much larger classroom throughout this year. The whole school, including its teams in the local basketball competition, have also appreciated the new court, which is used regularly for training at lunchtime and after school.
Similarly, Luther College in Croydon has received funding of $100,000 for the refurbishment of its science laboratories and other building modifications. The total project was worth almost half a million dollars, with the school itself providing the bulk of the money—$400,000. Another Casey school, Yarra Valley Grammar in Ringwood, has completed a building project worth $425,000, of which the federal government provided $125,000. That helped refurbish six classrooms, plus student common rooms and administration centres.
Government schools in Casey have received considerable federal capital funding—over $10 million—since 1996. Since 2001, five schools have received just over $3 million. Chirnside Park Primary School's eight new classrooms and extended general purpose room cost over $1.3 million. The federal government provided $450,000 towards this cost. Importantly, the school community, like the Mooroolbark East Primary community, made a significant contribution. The school fundraising committee worked tirelessly to raise $118,000 toward the project and similarly ensured that the project was able to incorporate a number of additional developments that had not previously been planned.
Likewise, Croydon Hills Primary has in the last 12 months built new classrooms, upgraded its library, staff administration and amenities. The cost of this project was around $1.3 million, of which the federal government contributed $1 million. The Howard government, through the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, is committed to improving educational standards. As I said at the outset, this of course includes a focus on literacy and numeracy.
Two federal government programs aim to improve young people's ability to read and write. One concentrates particularly on disadvantaged students whilst the other funds projects in the early to middle years of schooling, along with the links between literacy and numeracy and the pathways leading from school into the work force. While many people have adequate literacy and numeracy skills, there are some who unfortunately do not and who struggle. 
Not being able to read, write or count sufficiently well affects too many people in every aspect of their daily lives—at the supermarket, on public transport or, more particularly, through their working lives generally. Illiteracy reduces work force productivity, and people who are self-conscious about their lack of education and abilities are likely to want to avoid certain activities simply to hide their lack of writing, reading and numeric skills. This disengagement is undoubtedly a negative influence on them as individuals and it has a detrimental impact on our community. As a nation, it should be our goal to improve everyone's literacy and numeracy levels. For children, this bill is very much part of the solution.
It is an obvious point, but young children should be getting help in their early years, at the time when their skills are being developed and when their problems can be first noticed, dealt with and fixed. It is clear that some literacy and numeracy problems arise in the early years of school. Unfortunately, not all students are able to advance their learning in the classroom without the additional assistance that is required. If literacy and numeracy problems are not detected and overcome in the crucial early years of primary school, students' learning is affected almost immediately, and ultimately it can mean that individual students do not go on to achieve their full potential over the coming years. Everyone knows that we have to solve these problems early, for to go on to the secondary school level with a learning disadvantage can only compound the problem. Depending on how literacy and numeracy problems are handled in the classroom and, most importantly, at home, learning difficulties only worsen as more is expected and as people enter the work force. 
A local parent recently told me that 10 weeks of reading recovery has made a massive difference to the reading levels of their grade 1 child. As reading levels improved so did the child's confidence and general level of achievement at school. It is commonplace for primary schools to have reading recovery programs for young children in the first couple of years of school and for older primary school students. It appears that these programs are working well and making a noticeable difference in the learning of young students. Individuals are learning more, which in turn improves the overall classroom environment. 
Around our nation, all schools are now testing and reporting against national reading and numeracy benchmarks. The benchmark statistics indicate that students are attaining improved levels of ability. Funding for literacy and numeracy programs and for school facilities is only part of the total expenditure on schools and students around our nation. Whilst the federal government does not run schools—they are the responsibility of the states and territories—it does provide a significant amount of taxpayers' money each year to help pay salaries and to provide programs. As well as partially funding government schools, the Howard government is committed to allowing parents to have the choice to send their children to a private or independent school. The tuition fees paid by parents are reduced due to the recurrent funding received by Casey's 19 independent schools. Reduced fees have the effect of making schooling at an independent school a real possibility for many families who otherwise would not have that choice. In 2002, almost $27 million was spent on local independent schools. This year it is anticipated that $27.2 million will be allocated. It is a fact that every child being educated privately actually saves taxpayers' money across the nation.  
Elsewhere within the education and training portfolio the Howard government, through a number of programs, is making a difference in schools, their communities and in young people's everyday lives. Recently, I attended a special assembly at Croydon Primary School. Along with school captains, Kate Coppus and Aaron Liebelt, and the principal, Peter Ridgewell, we officially launched the school's new flagpole—a simple thing, one may think but, surprisingly, as members on both sides will know, some schools either do not have a flagpole or have lost their flagpole through a range of factors, including vandalism and building works. Over the years flagpoles have not been replaced. In a small number of cases, as I said earlier, it appears that some newer schools have never had a flagpole installed in the first place.
Through their participation in school assemblies, when the flag is raised and the national anthem is sung, students can learn about and come to understand our national symbols. Croydon Primary School's new flagpole and those of others around the nation have been made possible with funding up to a maximum of $1,500 per school through the Discovering Democracy program. This program offers young Australians numerous opportunities to become informed about our nation's rich democratic traditions and values. Through the Boys' Education Lighthouse Schools Program $3.8 million is being used to identify and showcase successful practices in the education of boys. A cluster of schools in the Yarra Valley, one of which is located in Casey, are sharing $20,000 funded through the Australian Government Quality Teacher Program. 
Having focused on school education, I wish to highlight other examples of some of the good work that is occurring in Melbourne's outer east. As parents know, the links between school and the work force are vitally important. The better the links the easier it is for young people to move from school into further training and the wider work force with success. The Eastern Industry Education Partnership is delivering vocational education opportunities and it ensures that there are effective partnerships between schools, industry and the wider community. Schools located in Casey providing vocational education opportunities include Billanook College, Croydon Community School, Croydon Secondary School, Lilydale Adventist Academy, Lilydale Heights Secondary College, Lilydale High School, Luther College, Maroondah Secondary College, Monbulk College, Mooroolbark Heights Secondary College, Mt Evelyn Christian School and Oxley College.
KYM Employment Services operates the federally funded Jobs Pathway Program. The dedicated team at KYM is assisting 14- to 19-year-olds make a smooth transition between school and work. One of the largest in Australia, the program in our region is working to ensure that young people leaving school do not get left behind at a time when they are making critical decisions about their careers and adult lives. The assistance provided varies depending on the individual need, but it may include personal development, support to remain at or to return to school, career counselling, job search preparation and referral to vocational education and training. KYM has also delivered a careers and transition pilot program operating in a number of secondary schools in Mt Evelyn, Mooroolbark and Lilydale and it has focused on helping young teenagers to make the right choices as they move into the work force. 
Another program is working more broadly and it is known as the Real Game Series. It has operated or continues to operate in a number of Casey's schools, such as Croydon Secondary College, Pembroke Secondary College, Lilydale Heights Secondary College, Mooroolbark Heights Secondary College and Birmingham Primary School. The Real Game Series helps students to make the connection between school and their future life so that they understand the impact that choices and decisions made now can have on their working career and quality of life as adults.
The Howard government is delivering on our commitment to young Australians and their schools. Increased funding is helping to deliver quality programs and new facilities. Combined, these can only mean improved education outcomes into the future. Young Australians deserve every chance to learn and to get ahead. This bill is very much part of the Howard government's plan for them and I commend it to the House.",REPS,<title>STATES GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—Obviously I will not have an opportunity to complete my remarks on the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 2003 this evening, but I did want to pick up on a point that flows from the observations of the member who spoke previously: if choice means that people have the right to choose schools on the basis that they are underfunded and of poorer quality, that is no choice at all. Unfortunately a lot of the rhetoric of the current government is based around the idea that people should be able to afford a higher standard of education and better funding that applies in some of our independent schools. In my view, that is no choice at all.
As a member of the Labor Party, I have always been passionately committed to the idea of egalitarianism: the notion that each person is of equal worth and that any limitations on their achievement and their ability to share in society's goods should be systematically broken down. Unfortunately this government is not doing that. Breaking down that disadvantage requires public action and investment. The conservatives embrace—if they do at all, as we have heard from the previous speaker—a pallid version of equal opportunity. They think it is enough to let people step up to the mark and do as well as they can no matter what handicaps they start with. They speak from a vantage point of privilege, often blind to their advantages. They fail to understand that promoting equal opportunity requires active intervention to minimise disadvantage and to ensure that people's life chances are more equal so that the accident of your birth does not cripple your future.
Most Australians will tell you that they still hold firm to the view that ours is an egalitarian society. Indeed, there are some who would argue that egalitarianism is the value that defines us as a nation. While a lot of us are uneasy about the widening income and wealth gaps we see, many still appear to accept the boast made by our leaders, including the Prime Minister, that ours is a nation of equals where the ethic of a fair go is the norm that governs our private and public relations. But it is important to ask, particularly in the context of this bill: is it really so? There is a lot of evidence now which challenges this very comfortable assertion. While researchers may disagree about the extent of the problem, they generally agree that inequality amongst Australians is increasing and that egalitarianism itself may be under threat as a defining social objective. Importantly, they all agree that it matters, and so do I.
I was recently asked to review three new books on the subject of inequality and poverty and was struck by the fact that, although they use different data sources and different levels of analysis, all three reached the same conclusion—that is, we are a less equal society than we have ever been. Fred Argy, in his book Where to From Here?, argues that Australia's distinctive form of egalitarianism evolved over 70 years through institutional, regulatory and policy mechanisms, described in his terms as a form of state paternalism and defined by a commitment to a strong role for government in advancing human wellbeing. 
The historic roots of our egalitarian ethic—and it is important to look at it in the context of education—lie in a pragmatic commitment to sharing the wealth of the country and the benefits of productivity, particularly through the award and wage fixing system—the so-called wage-earners welfare state. One of the features of this settlement was a recognition that government could be and should be a major player in achieving equality.
Argy details what he calls the seven pillars, which were deliberately created by government action. They are the virtual guarantee of full-time employment; the protection of wages and conditions of workers; an unconditional needs based welfare safety net; a strongly progressive tax system; generous government provision of non-cash benefits, such as education, health and housing; a balanced distribution of regional economic opportunities; and the capacity for people to be involved in workplace decisions affecting their wellbeing. Argy's analysis of the extent of the erosion of these pillars and the reasons for the decline makes sobering reading indeed.
There is a lot of data now on Australian incomes that show a widening gap between citizens. As Stephen Long has observed, a map of Australia depicting the distribution of income and employment would show `a nation fracturing along class, residential and ethnic lines'. As he indicates, the gap is not just between the rich and the poor but also between the rich and the rest of us, and education is vital in this.
The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling calculated that in 1990 the richest 10 per cent of Australian families received 23 per cent of the national income, which was an increase from 1982, while the poorest 10 per cent received less than three per cent, which was a decline. Income movements are reinforcing these differences. Between 1993-94 and 1998-99, 2.2 million Australians in the lowest 20 per cent received an average weekly increase of $9 while the top 20 per cent received $343—and the current government is talking about more tax breaks for the wealthy. Similarly, NATSEM recently reported that the number of low-wage earners doubled between the mid-eighties and the mid-nineties and that over the last decade, especially since the mid-nineties when this government took control, income inequality has been increasing.
Despite our myth-making, Australia has relatively high levels of inequality by international standards. Incomes after taxes and transfers—including benefits, rebates et cetera—are more unequal in Australia than in all but a few of the OECD countries, which points to a tax transfer system which is less effective than other developed nations. As Argy points out, while Australia has a relatively progressive tax system, it spends less on redistribution than other countries. We have even greater disparities in wealth, with the top 10 per cent owning 52 per cent of the nation's wealth. Since 1993, the share of the nation's wealth held by the richest 10 per cent has increased by almost five per cent. The increase since 1996, when this government took over, has been even more concentrated. The richest one per cent—the friends of this government—increased their share of wealth from 12 to 15 per cent, and this has been made at the expense of those on middle incomes. 
I am aware that inequality has many different faces apart from those captured by these aggregate figures on income and wealth distribution. There are inequalities in Australians' working lives, reflected in lengthening working hours for some and too little work for others, fewer full-time jobs, unequal job opportunities, greater job insecurity and increasing numbers of long-term unemployed and marginal and discouraged job seekers. Australian workers have not received their fair share of the rapid productivity growth of the nineties, and the dispersion of income has become more unequal. Earnings growth has been much faster for managers and those in professions and trades than for labourers and clerical and service workers. I will make it very clear why education is so important to these inequalities at a later stage.

"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-11-24,"—Mr Speaker, tonight, along with dozens of my colleagues, we enjoyed your hospitality at your annual Christmas barbecue, for which we thank you. Christmas decorations are busily being put up in the offices here in the House of Representatives. Most of us are dragging out last year's Christmas card list and are busy trying to think of what we might say inside the cards for this year. Sadly, some of our friends have died and will no longer be around this Christmas. Other friends and acquaintances are doing it tough and are battling illness and family crises.
In 31 days, most if not all of us will be sharing Christmas Day with our close family friends. Our presents will be opened and strewn around the lounge room floor or else put away from the prying fingers of the youngsters in our family celebration. Thoughts of yet more to eat for the Christmas evening meal will be pushed far into the recesses of our mind as we progress through Christmas Day. Some of us will also be thinking of our loved ones who are living overseas—in many cases our children. We will be wondering what they are up to as they prepare for their usually wintry festive season in Europe. Perhaps they might even experience a white Christmas.
I have a brother living in New Jersey, a sister in Pershore in the United Kingdom and a sister in Victoria. My eldest daughter, Sarah, and her husband, Michael, are living in London. Christmas for my family is one of long-distance calls and emails, usually the day before because of time zone differences. Yet despite the hassles, time zones, distances and absences, we can get together at this special time, this Christmas 2003—a time of family oneness, a time of sharing and a time for reflection.
Many in our community unfortunately will not be so lucky, so happy, so fortunate, so blessed this Christmas 2003. For them the season of goodwill, of gift giving and of plenteous food on the table is not theirs to enjoy. I am not talking here about the thousands of Australian families who yearly rely on the Smith Family, the Salvation Army, Anglicare, Centacare or the many other agencies for their Christmas good cheer. Sadly, in our great country—the lucky country—many will spend Christmas 2003 behind razor wire fences and, in some cases, behind electric fences. 
Christmas supposedly is a time of goodwill to all mankind. Disappointingly, Australia will see 94 children in detention in this lucky country of ours and will be responsible for another 90 children in Pacific island detention centres. At this time of year we hear that uplifting and inspiring music from Handel's Messiah and sing those words from Isaiah:
For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
And at this time of year these 184 children are living out their Christmas behind these fences—fences similar to those I saw when I walked inside Auschwitz during my trip to Poland in 2000. Not only are these 184 children spending this Christmas behind razor wire; some have spent more than one Christmas in these detention centres.
Detention of children at Christmas 2003 is in several instances part of the enforced separation of families. I feel a real emptiness when I realise I will be separated from my family this Christmas. I like to have my family around me and to share in the generational joy that abounds at Christmas time. As Christmas 2003 nears, is the detention of these 184 children how we as Australians want to treat families in this country? I would urge this government to release these 184 children and to let them share in the joy and celebration that Australians will be experiencing throughout this country this Christmas.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Christmas</title>,Adjournment,26,1
