Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (09:01):  by leave—In November last year the government established an independent review of Australia's aviation safety regulatory system to ensure that it is well positioned to meet Australia's future aviation demands. The review was conducted by an independent panel headed by Mr David Forsyth AM, a respected figure in Australian aviation through his previous senior managerial roles in Qantas and as Chair of Airservices Australia. Mr Forsyth was joined on the panel by two eminent overseas aviation safety experts—Mr Don Spruston from Canada and Mr Roger Whitefield from the United Kingdom. On 3 June 2014, I tabled the panel's Aviation safety regulation review report in parliament.


Since tabling the report, the government has given careful consideration to the 37 recommendations and other matters raised in the report. This consideration has been informed by close consultation with our aviation agencies and by 69 industry and public comments on the report.  I am pleased today to be able to table the government's response to the report. The report confirms that Australia has an advanced aviation regulatory system in place and one of the safest regular public transport systems in the world. Australia also has sound safety governance arrangements which ensure that the regulatory, investigative and service provision roles of our key aviation agencies are properly separated.


However, given the speed with which the global and domestic aviation industry is changing, we need to look for continuous improvement in our aviation safety regulatory system. We need to update our system to reflect the growing diversity of our aviation industry. The report has identified areas where our present arrangements, structures and relationships can be improved to ensure that Australia remains a leading aviation state. The report made 37 recommendations, many relating to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, but others have implications for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, Airservices Australia, my department and the Department of Defence. The government has fully agreed to or agreed to undertake a more detailed examination of 36 of the 37 recommendations. 




Key aviation safety principles



In responding to the report the government has endorsed a number of key principles that should continue to underpin our future aviation safety system:


safety should be the primary consideration of CASA, Airservices, the ATSB and the industry in the performance of their functions;


the highest safety priority should be afforded to passenger transport operations;


Australia's regulatory approach and responses should be based on a sound assessment of the level of risk associated with particular aviation operations;




aviation agencies and industry should work closely together to identify aviation safety risks and ensure that the most appropriate methods, practices and technologies are adopted to address and reduce these risks;





a strong 
'
just culture
'
 approach must underpin better information sharing between industry and safety agencies as information sharing assists in preventing future safety events and reflects international best practice;



recognition that Australia's safety regulatory system plays an important role in ensuring that Australia has a safe, efficient and competitive aviation industry;


Australia's aviation regulatory procedures, processes and approach to regulation should be fair, transparent and promote nationally consistent operations; and


active and ongoing engagement by industry and CASA will help inform future regulatory priorities and the development of simpler regulations, standards and orders.


These principles and the actions which flow from them will be contained in an enhanced state safety program, an SSP. The SSP will outline short, medium and long term objectives for our aviation system including planned major regulatory, infrastructure and service changes. In addition, the respective policy, regulatory, investigative and service provision roles and coordination between government aviation agencies will continue to be clearly set out in the SSP and how they should work cooperatively on major initiatives. The government recognises that our agencies and industry are already operating to some extent in accordance with these principles but believes it is important that they be set out to help guide the future direction of our aviation safety system.




The r
ole of the aviation safety regulator 



CASA is a critical element in our aviation safety system. CASA is first and foremost the regulator for civil aviation with the increasingly challenging task of implementing and oversighting a range of aviation regulatory arrangements. Additionally CASA plays a key role in developing new regulations and amending existing regulations to take account of industry changes, emerging safety issues and meeting international standards and practices.


In establishing this review the government was conscious of complaints that it had received from industry about CASA's regulatory approach and the perceived insufficient regard to the impacts of regulatory actions or proposed new or amended regulations on industry operations. Problems with the implementation of new regulatory standards have also been raised by industry as an issue. The review panel has clearly received submissions that have raised similar concerns.


The role of the regulator is a difficult one. CASA serves not only the industry but the public more broadly. CASA is part of a system which is charged with protecting all passengers, their crew and the community. Members of the travelling public are not usually able to make their own individual assessments of all the safety issues and rely on the regulatory system for assurance.


Aviation services can be complex and expensive operations. The business environment in which aviation operates is a challenging and often highly competitive one with fluctuating market conditions. Even well-established and well-intentioned aviation operators can encounter problems. In such a complex environment the government expects the regulator to be firm but fair in how it conducts its role. The regulator also needs to be well-informed about the industry context, conscious of the impacts that its actions have on operators and open to approaches which achieve safety outcomes without unnecessary impacts on industry.


This approach calls for effective and ongoing engagement and communication with the industry, both at a strategic and working level. As the Aviation Safety Regulation Review recommends, we need to create an 'effective collaborative relationship [between CASA and the industry based] on a foundation of mutual understanding and respect'. 




CASA Governance



As a key part of our aviation safety system, the government expects the CASA board to take an active role in setting directions for CASA and overseeing its functions. Critically the government also expects the board to maintain an effective dialogue with industry at a strategic level. The government has already moved to enhance the aviation skills and experience on the board, with amendments passed earlier this year to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to expand the board to seven members.


The government has appointed Mr Jeff Boyd as Deputy Chairman of the board, who brings valuable experience in working with different parts of the diverse Australian aviation industry. Today I am pleased to announce the appointment of three more members to the CASA board to fill the current vacancies. The new members are: Anita Taylor, a chartered accountant, experienced company director and a long-term member of the sport-aviation industry who has been gliding since she was 16; Captain Murray Warfield, a former Qantas general manager of regulatory and industry affairs; and, finally, Mr Ian Smith, who has had a long and distinguished career in the aviation insurance industry and earlier this year was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his work in the promotion and development of aviation.


The government also welcomes the appointment of Air Vice Marshal (Retired) Mark Skidmore AM to the position of the Director of Aviation Safety. This appointment will bring a further wealth of aviation experience to the board. 


The government will also be issuing a new Statement of Expectations (SOE) to the revamped board to give effect to the recommendations in the report. The board will appropriately have the opportunity to set out in an implementation plan their response to the new SOE. The government looks forward to working with the new board and director in the delivery of all of these recommendations. Consistent with the government's broader agenda in deregulation, the government also expects CASA to continue to look for ways to reduce regulatory costs on the industry without compromising safety.




ATSB Governance



The government fully supports the vital role of the ATSB. Independent investigation of accidents or incidents remains a crucial element of the safety system, helping us understand the causes and hence the sources of risks to safety. This helps to avoid future accidents. If the system is to work well, industry must cooperate in providing information during accident and incident investigations and in reporting incidents generally. The government will take a number of actions to give effect to this commitment including:


the appointment of an additional ATSB commissioner with aviation experience; and


issuing a new Statement of Expectations to the ATSB once the commission and the government has had an opportunity to review the findings of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board review of the ATSB, which was publicly released in Canada yesterday.


Yesterday the Canadian Transportation Safety Board released its independent report into the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. The ATSB tasked the Canadian TSB to undertake an independent review of their investigation methodologies and processes; how they are applied in specific cases and how this compared to international best practice standards. The TSB review looked in detail at three separate investigations, one of which was the Pel-Air inquiry—which, as members may recall, was the subject of a report by the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. 


While the Canadian TSB found that ATSB investigation methodology and analysis tools represent best practice and have been shown to produce very good results, they found in the case of the Pel-Air investigation there were errors made. I am concerned that the TSB report raises some concerns about the application of ATSB methodologies in the investigation of the ditching of the Pel-Air aircraft off Norfolk Island in 2009. As a consequence I have asked the ATSB Commission to give serious consideration to re-opening the investigation.


On a related point, I have just announced that I will shortly be appointing a new commissioner for the ATSB with a specific background in aviation. This will fulfil an undertaking made by the coalition prior to the election and also one of the recommendations of the report. I have asked that a fresh review of the Pel-Air accident take into account the findings of the ATSB report.




Policy and Coordination Role of the Department





The government has carefully considered the policy and coordination role of the Department of Infrastr
ucture and Regional Development
 in the future aviation safety system.

The government expects the department as the chair of the Aviation Policy Group to lead work between agencies to ensure coordinated planning and action on the development of the aviation safety system.


While each agency has its own legislative charter and priorities, planning needs to be coordinated across agencies. The department and the three other members of the APG—CASA, Airservices and the Department of Defence—should use that forum to coordinate and steer improvements in our aviation safety system. APG should also take the lead in guiding the development, monitoring and maintenance of the SSP.




The government has also identified a number of important aviation safety policy issues which it believes the department is well placed, in close consultation with other aviation agencies, to progress final policy advice for the government
'
s consideration.


These policy issues
 cover aviation rescue and fire
fighting se
rvices and airspace protection.





Other Agencies and Departments



Airservices Australia and the Department of Defence play significant roles in our aviation safety system. The current OneSKY Australia program is aimed at establishing a nationally harmonised air traffic management system. The program represents an exciting opportunity for both civil and military aviation to receive a better, seamless national air traffic service in the future. It should also be acknowledged that increased civil aviation demand at several locations around Australia continues to place pressures on military aviation facilities and services. While not specifically highlighted in the report, the government also recognises the key role the Bureau of Meteorology plays in our aviation safety system, and this role will be reinforced in our state safety program.




Aviation Industry Role 





The government expects all of our civil and military avi
ation agencies to work together,
 and in close consultation with industry, to implement the government
'
s response to the report.

But it is just as important that industry works collaboratively with aviation safety agencies to produce the best safety outcomes. Successful implementation of these recommendations will need the active and constructive participation of our aviation industry, working openly and positively with our agencies.  We are aware that relationships have not been as good as they need to be and there are diverse views even within the industry on some issues.


We also understand that industry commitment to work constructively with government agencies on aviation safety issues requires industry members to dedicate scarce time and resources. The government strongly urges industry representatives and aviation agencies to work together across the broad range of issues, including the development of future regulatory priorities.


I also acknowledge the bipartisan approach that has been adopted by governments on both sides in dealing with this issue. It has been a difficult industry for the previous minister and for this one and for all of our predecessors now for a very long period of time. There needs to be goodwill from all parties. I have no doubt that the government and opposition will be able to work constructively to develop a better atmosphere within the sector. But we certainly also need the industry to be willing to do what it can to make the aviation system work and work well. It is time to reset the relationship between industry and agencies and move onwards, recognising our strong aviation safety record and the potential improvements that can be made in line with the report's recommendations.


On the basis of the strong response to the review and the release of the review's report, the government is confident that industry and our regulatory agencies will positively take up these opportunities. I look forward to holding the first Aviation Industry Consultative Council meeting before the end of the year. This will provide a great opportunity to discuss matters of broader concern to the aviation industry and ensure that industry has a forum for putting forward their views.




Conclusion



Australia has worked hard to have one of the most respected aviation safety systems in the world, but like any system it should be subject to continuous improvement, and works best when all of those engaged in the system are working closely together. The report has offered us recommendations which will help with Australia's continuous commitment to improve our safety system. The government's response is clearly to set out aviation safety policies, principles and priorities to our agencies, and to the industry and the community to help with this process.


The government looks forward to working with our aviation agencies and industry in the implementation of the recommendation of the report. I commend the government's response to the Aviation Safety Regulation Review report to the parliament. I seek leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Grayndler to speak for 19 minutes.


Leave granted.




Mr TRUSS:
  I move:


That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Grayndler for speaking in reply to the minister's statement for a period not exceeding 19 minutes.


Question agreed to. 

",HoR,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Aviation</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,0,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (09:20):  Can I begin by saying that it is good to see the Deputy Prime Minister back in the chamber. Everyone in the House wishes him well on the personal level, if not the political!


I have always said that aviation safety is an issue that is well above politics. I am pleased to say that for the many years that I have been first a shadow minister, then a minister, then back again as a shadow minister, the current minister for transport has had the same view. I respect that. That is as it should be.


If there is any area that is above politics it has to be this one, because the whole of the parliament has an interest in working towards ensuring that aviation safety remains an issue of which Australia can be rightly proud. Road accidents, of course, cause much more trauma to Australians, and there would not be a single member of the public who has not been touched by an incident on our roads. Fortunately, in this House I can say that Australia's record on aviation safety is the envy of the world; we need to make sure that that continues to be the case.


As elected representative we need to make sure that we have a considered and very precautionary approach to aviation safety. We cannot take it for granted, because if there ever were to be an incident, particularly an RPT incident, the consequences for the travelling public would be severe. But the consequences for the national economy would also be catastrophic. 


The safety of travellers must be put above everything. When the minister announced the Aviation Safety Regulation Review conducted by David Forsyth, as well as Don Spruston from Canada and Roger Whitefield of the UK, the opposition welcomed it. We remain proud of our own record in government when it comes to aviation safety, but you can never be too careful. We must always be prepared to look, look and look again to ensure that our safety arrangements respond to changing circumstances. Indeed, I believe that an incoming minister responsible for aviation has a duty to satisfy himself or herself that existing safety arrangements are adequate. And that is why—even though the minister was returning to the portfolio, rather than being new to this issue—I believe it was appropriate for the minister to convene this review.


The review was finalised in May and it included 37 recommendations. Today's statement by the minister seems to indicate that our system was in good shape, but I welcome the government's announcements today that it will appoint three new members to the CASA board, and that it will issue Statements of Expectations to CASA and to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. I wish the best of luck to the new CASA board members, Anita Taylor, Murray Warfield, and Ian Smith, just as I welcome the appointment of former Air Vice Marshal Mark Skidmore to the position of Director of Aviation Safety.


I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to John McCormick. John McCormick did an outstanding job. He was someone who was recruited after an international search for the best person. He brought decades of experience, not just in the Australian aviation industry but also particularly in Hong Kong, for Cathay Pacific, and in the international sector. I think he provided a rigour that was needed at the time. When John McCormick made the decision to ground Tiger Airways, that decision to ground an RPT service for the first—and hopefully the last—time in Australia's history was not only a courageous step but one that was entirely appropriate and needed. When Mr McCormick had advised me of the decision, I remember speaking to Prime Minister Gillard and informing her of what was about to occur—because, by definition, you cannot make a decision that an airline is unsafe and then say, 'we will ground them in a couple of days' time'. What it meant by definition was that people got stranded. There was a real-world impact on the travelling public, particularly given the nature of Tiger; and on many families who were able to travel by air for the first time, because it was a budget airline. That was a courageous decision by John McCormick. The fact that Tiger has now been taken over by Virgin Australia and is now functioning in a way that satisfies all the safety concerns shows that that was not just a courageous decision but a correct decision.


In the report, the review panel expressed concern about relations between the industry and the regulator. It said this:


In recent years, the regulator has adopted an across the board hard-line philosophy, which in the Panel's view, is not appropriate for an advanced aviation nation such as Australia. As a result, relationships between industry and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) have, in many cases, become adversarial.


It went on to recommend a new strategic direction for CASA, calling for a more 'collaborative relationship on a foundation of mutual trust and respect'. It is here that I would respectfully sound a note of caution to the minister. I certainly agree that it is important for a regulated industry, like aviation, to have constructive and respectful relations between the regulator and the industry; but I would be very concerned if the relationship between CASA and aviation operators became too close. I expressed this concern to David Forsyth, who the minister ensured—and I thank him for this—gave me a verbal review as well, and we were able to have a very constructive discussion about it. If I could, I would like to express some caution. I think that, by definition, a regulator must have a bit of tension with those people who it is regulating, particularly in aviation.


The term 'trainspotters' is pretty familiar to people; in aviation there are 'plane spotters'. They think that they know best, and they do not want to be told by any regulator that they do not know how to keep their plane safe. But the truth is that the incidents that have occurred in this country have occurred particularly with small planes, which are involved in incidents all too regularly. I think one of the worst parts of the job of being the aviation minister in this country is the fact that you get notified in real time. Except for the minister, people are probably unaware of that. I have had phone calls at all hours telling me that a plane with two or three people on board has gone missing. When the departmental head rang, or in the case of Mr McCormick there was often direct contact, you really did not want to receive that call.


If I could sound that cautious note, as I expressed to David Forsyth: the customers are not the people who own the planes; the customers of CASA and aviation safety are the people on the planes and the people who would be impacted if there were an incident. Planes fly over my house at far too regular intervals. My electorate is the second smallest geographically; Wentworth is the smallest. These areas have highly dense populations. If there were an incident in these most densely populated areas of Australia, it would have an impact not just on people on the planes but on people in the vicinity of an airport. If I could express that concern—that we must never sacrifice rigour for harmony.


I agree with the minister that the actions of the regulator must be firm, and they must also be fair. But the minister has a responsibility to hold the line against industry pressure. We must maintain the necessary tension between the regulator and the regulated to keep all parties on their toes. If they are on their toes then they are focused on what matters: the safety of the travelling public. If they were allowed to operate too closely and without appropriate distance, the public would be the loser. So, while doing all we can to promote professional dealings among all participants in the industry, our overriding responsibility is to make accident prevention and proper safety standards our primary concern. All other concerns must be further down the ladder. 


I note the minister's comment that he is considering asking the ATSB to reopen the investigation into the Pel-Air incident of 2009. This follows the findings this week of the delayed report of the inquiry that I commissioned as the minister, which was conducted by the Canadian Transportation Safety Board. I note that the TSB found that the ATSB investigation methods were best practice, but I certainly welcome, as I previously said, the principle that, if there is any doubt at all, there is a need to take that precautionary principle into consideration.


I am concerned that the government has required aviation operators to cut about $12 million from their costs as part of its push to reduce so-called red tape. I also note that the government has made a similar demand of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. You cannot have organisations like CASA and AMSA, which perform such an extraordinarily important role in this country, and continue to put pressure on them to cut costs. AMSA has a critical role to play, as we have seen with the issue of the Malaysia Airlines search and rescue. AMSA looks after about one-third of the world's surface, so it is an absolutely critical agency. I do believe that there is a real case for quarantining it from cuts for aviation safety.


I will conclude by indicating publicly, as I have privately to the minister, that the opposition is firmly committed to working in a constructive and bipartisan way on these issues. I note that the minister has been exemplary in ensuring appropriate briefings and in ensuring that this issue continues to be where it was when I was the minister and, previously, under the Howard government. It is absolutely critical that we deal with this. Given the short period that the opposition has had the government's response to the report, it is not for me today to comment specifically on the government's response to each of the 37 recommendations. I indicate to the minister that, should there be any concerns, I will express them to him directly, because we have just received the response to the report. I note that the government has accepted in whole or in part all of the recommendations, with one exception, but we reserve our right to comment further on those matters, based upon a proper, closer analysis and proper advice. I indicate that that should not be seen in any way as a suggestion that we will operate politically on this issue, because we will not. We will deal with these things on their merits. I thank the minister for his response and conclude where I began: it is good to see him back in the House.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry) (10:04):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


Australia's success in the offshore petroleum investment market is underpinned by its comprehensive and well-established regulatory framework. Central to this framework is the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), a national regulator with the experience and technical capacity to effectively regulate in relation to matters of occupational health and safety, structural integrity, and environmental management.


In February 2014, the Commonwealth government announced a new streamlined approach for environmental approvals for offshore petroleum activities. The approach makes NOPSEMA the sole environmental regulator for these activities in Commonwealth waters. 


Streamlining has significantly increased regulatory efficiency in respect of petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters, as well as delivering clarity and certainty for industry participants.


Recognising these significant gains, the Commonwealth government is seeking to streamline regulatory arrangements in respect of all offshore petroleum activities. As part of this process, the states and the Northern Territory are being encouraged to confer occupational health and safety, structural integrity and environmental management functions and powers upon NOPSEMA under their respective legislation in respect of those waters of the sea within their jurisdictional reach.


This would permit the states and the Northern Territory to benefit from the expertise and experience of an established national regulator, and increase the efficiency of the administrative process by minimising the number of regulatory agencies with whom industry participants must deal.


However, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act in its present iteration includes a number of legislative impediments to conferral. For example, there is a requirement to conclude an intergovernmental agreement before conferral is permitted in respect of certain areas of the sea. In relation to others, conferral is not permitted at all.


The amendments in this bill seek to remove these impediments, thereby permitting conferral across as wide a geographic area as possible. 


This represents an important step towards the establishment of a single national regulator for all safety, structural integrity and environmental management matters in the offshore petroleum sector. Moreover, it underscores this government's ongoing commitment to the maintenance and improvement of a strong and effective regulatory framework, and to a cooperative approach to the regulation of offshore petroleum activities.


The bill further makes a number of technical amendments to the administrative framework relating to the taking of particular voluntary actions under the Act and regulations by multiple registered holders of a single petroleum title.


Due to the high cost of offshore petroleum operations, petroleum titles are often held by a consortium of companies. The act at present provides a mandatory process by which titleholders may take an action, such as submission of an application or nomination, that is permitted, but not required, to be taken under the act or regulations, where there is more than one registered holder of the relevant title. Such an action is defined under the act as an 'eligible voluntary action'. The process requires the holders of the title to nominate one of them to take eligible voluntary actions on behalf of the group, and only the nominated person can take an eligible voluntary action. 


However, application of the process in practice has created some confusion among titleholders, particularly in relation to the mandatory nature of the process, and also identified several unintended consequences.


The amendments in this bill seek to clarify the operation of the process relating to the taking of eligible voluntary actions and, importantly, provide an alternative process for the taking of eligible voluntary actions that titleholders may elect to use instead of the current nomination process. The alternative process would require all of the registered holders of the title to take the action jointly, such as by all signing the relevant application or nomination. The current nomination process will also still be available for use where a group of titleholders prefer this option. I commend this bill to the House.


I would now like to take the opportunity to foreshadow another significant amendment to the act. As all present are no doubt aware, Australia's exploration and mining success is underpinned by its highly prospective geology, up-to-date geoscience data and comprehensive information systems. The custodian of Australia's geographic and geological data is the national geoscience agency, Geoscience Australia. As part of its core functions, Geoscience Australia has an ongoing responsibility to define the limits of Australia's maritime jurisdiction. Most recently, this work has resulted in a change to the boundary separating Commonwealth waters from the coastal waters of Western Australia. These changes, centred on the North Scott and Seringapatam Reefs, took effect from May this year. The revised boundaries around these reefs intersect three existing Commonwealth titles: one retention lease operated by Woodside Petroleum on behalf of the Browse joint venture, and two exploration permits operated by ConocoPhillips on behalf of the Poseidon joint venture. The maritime boundary changes mean that certain blocks previously falling within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth now fall within that of Western Australia.


Our department is working closely with the Western Australian government to ensure the stable progression of the Browse and Poseidon joint ventures and to ensure the seamless and efficient transition of affected blocks from Commonwealth to Western Australian waters. This work has uncovered a gap within the Commonwealth offshore petroleum regime administered under the OPGGS Act. The gap will be of particular concern should a change to maritime boundaries in future cause an area presently within the jurisdiction of a state or the Northern Territory to fall within Commonwealth waters.


At present, there is no legislative mechanism enabling titles over affected blocks to transfer, with continuity of tenure, from the jurisdiction of the states or the Northern Territory to that of the Commonwealth following a boundary change. Instead, affected blocks become vacant acreage in Commonwealth waters and existing titleholders will lose title over those blocks. These titleholders may have already spent considerable sums of money and effort undertaking exploration activities under their title, and therefore titleholders should have continuity of tenure in the event of a boundary change.


While this will not impact current efforts in Western Australia, it is necessary to amend the act to anticipate those circumstances in which a future boundary change results in a gain of Commonwealth jurisdiction over the blocks. Given the ongoing nature of Geoscience Australia's effort to define Australia's maritime border, changes of this type are a realistic prospect. The proposed amendment will provide for the automatic grant of a Commonwealth title over affected blocks to the existing holders of a state or Northern Territory title at the time at which the state or Northern Territory title ceases to be in force.


The amendment is generic in nature and it is intended that it will provide a workable model for other jurisdictions to adopt. This will allow for consistency across Australia's offshore petroleum legislative framework, eliminate the sovereign risk created by future boundary changes, and ensure continuity of tenure for existing titleholders. I commend the bill to the House.

This Department of Finance proposes to fit out the new leased premises at 1 Canberra Avenue, Forrest, in the Australian Capital Territory. The department currently owns and leases space in seven tenancies across the ACT. It is desirable that the department be located in, or close to, the Parliamentary Triangle so that it can provide crucial support to its minister and the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet in the budget process.

Non-contaminated material will be recycled, as appropriate, at existing facilities in the Northern Territory. The project will address the risk of contamination to local bore water, which supplies the local population at Wagait with drinking water. Once concluded, the project will enable the land to be transferred to the traditional owners, as part of the long running Kenbi land claim, lodged in 1979.


It will also minimise Commonwealth liability for contamination on Commonwealth land, which has resulted from its use over 70 years. The estimated cost of the project is $31.5 million, excluding GST.

 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (10:53):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.




Introduction



Today I introduce the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 to secure the passage of essential reforms to higher education and research, which have at their heart Australia's future economic security and opportunities for students. 


This bill implements reforms to higher education and research announced in the 2014-15 budget, which seek to spread opportunity to more students, especially disadvantaged and rural and regional students; equip Australian universities to face the challenges of the 21st century; and ensure Australia is not left behind by intensifying global competition and new technologies. 


Naturally, I am disappointed about the outcome of the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014, which was defeated yesterday in the Senate following a sustained, baseless and irresponsible scare campaign.


We should all be disappointed. That bill, in amended form, would have shown the worth of our democratic process, representing, as it did, the outcome of many months of consultation and negotiation on the detail of the reform package. 


I am therefore introducing a new bill, the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014, which preserves essential elements of the government's higher education reforms with the following changes:


The government has withdrawn the proposal to change the indexation to the 10-year Treasury bond rate. I accept that there were concerns about the impact of the previously proposed measure on some graduates, including those who take time out of the workforce to raise children or for other reasons, and those who work in low-paid employment. Senator Day and others argued cogently for this change, and we have responded to their concerns.


I have also listened carefully to Senator Madigan's arguments for a pause on HECS indexation for primary carers of a child under five. This bill, the Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014, contains this measure. It will provide real benefits for new parents.


This bill also provides for a structural adjustment fund to assist universities to transition to a more competitive market, particularly those in regional areas. 


The bill also introduces a new scholarship fund within the Higher Education and Participation Program for universities with high proportions of low-SES students.


The bill will also guarantee that domestic students' fees are lower than international students' fees.


Through returning the indexation rate for HECS debts to CPI, providing the indexation pause for new parents and abolishing the unfair loan fees imposed on some students but not others, this reform bill makes the HECS system fairer and more generous. Through the provision of support—for the first time—for all Australian undergraduates, wherever they study, in diploma courses through to bachelor degrees, we will be supporting far more students than ever before. The reform bill spreads the money slightly thinner so as to spread opportunity much wider. 


Through freeing up our universities, we will enable them to offer students the very best education they can, and HECS guarantees that this will remain affordable and accessible for all. In fact, the Commonwealth Scholarships will support tens of thousands of disadvantaged students to go to university. This is not just a budget measure. This is great reform. It is some of the most important reform in generations.


I am, of course, open to further negotiations with members and senators on the details of the bill. Contrary to some of the irresponsible negative commentary from those opposite, the government has been consulting extensively before and since budget night and has demonstrated already our bona fides in responding to constructive, positive suggestions.


The government has made the changes I have mentioned to its proposed reforms because it has listened carefully to the views of those in the higher education community—universities, non-university higher education institutions, students, their parents, employers and professional organisations. 


I have taken careful account of the recommendations of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee following its inquiry into the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014.


I have consulted with members and senators, who have relayed the views of their constituents as well as their own thoughts on the proposed reforms.


I have said many times that I was prepared to make changes to the reform package to secure its passage through the parliament. 


I believe that these reforms are nothing short of essential to the wellbeing of Australia's future economy. Without them, Australia simply will not prosper.


I am not alone in this view. This has been the clear message from higher education institutions across the country. 


It is what they want.


It is what universities, TAFEs and colleges know isneeded for the future of higher education and for the future of our country.


Universities Australia, the Australian Technology Network, the Innovative Research Universities, the Regional Universities Network, the Group of Eight, TAFE Directors Australia, the Australian Council of Private Higher Education and Training and the Council of Private Higher Education have all supported the government's reforms, with amendments.


As Universities Australia said:


Either the status quo of ongoing inadequate investment or further cuts without deregulation will condemn Australia's great university system to inevitable decline, threaten our international reputation and make it increasingly difficult for universities to meet the quality expectations of our students …




Overview of the reforms



The Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 does not contain any tricks. It is much the same as the bill I introduced a few months ago which was yesterday defeated in the Senate, with the important amendments I outlined just a moment ago. 


As such, this bill has the same objectives as its predecessor. It provides a basis to transform Australia's higher education system and allow it to be the best in the world.


There are four key elements.




Spreading access to higher education



This bill will expand access to higher education by removing current limits on Commonwealth supported sub-bachelor places. Any Australian student who wishes to study an accredited undergraduate qualification will be able to do so with Commonwealth support.


We will no longer discriminate against students who seek to enrol at private universities and at non-university higher education institutions, including TAFEs.


We are also providing unlimited places for diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees—pathways into higher education for less-prepared students, and qualifications for jobs in their own right.


This government believes that engineering technologists, paralegals and construction managers are as deserving of taxpayer support to undertake their training as engineers, lawyers and architects.


This reform allows an additional 80,000 students each year to receive Commonwealth subsidies by 2018. This will include more people from disadvantaged backgrounds, from rural and regional communities and those who need extra assistance to complete their studies.


Member institutions of the Council of Private Higher Education (COPHE) have confirmed that 'whatever they receive in Commonwealth support for students will be passed on to students' through reduced tuition fees.


Equitable access will be further supported through the new Commonwealth Scholarship scheme. The Commonwealth Scholarship scheme will provide what is likely to be the largest scholarship support in Australia's history for students from disadvantaged backgrounds, which will enable many students from rural and regional Australia to get the education that they wish to have. These scholarships will assist students with the cost of tuition fees and also with the cost of living, textbooks and materials.




Fee deregulation



Second, the bill gives institutions flexibility in how they set their fees.


The government does not believe it should tell institutions how much they can charge for a course. Government control of fees means that institutions are operating with one arm tied behind their back.


The government does not have adequate information about how much it costs an institution to deliver a course, so why should it dictate the price?


No other business in Australia would stand for this degree of interference.


The government wants universities and other higher education institutions to compete with each other, including on price. We want each institution to be accountable to students for the type and quality of courses they offer. They need to deliver what students and employers want.


When higher education providers compete, students win. They win on:


the range of courses offered


the quality of teaching


other student support


scholarships


value for money.


Fee deregulation is essential to drive greater competition, innovation and quality. It will enable our institutions to set their own direction, serve their students and communities as well as they can, and compete with the best in the world.


And the bill provides this flexibility without reducing access or affordability. Every Australian student will continue to be able to defer their tuition fees through HECS so they do not have to pay a cent up-front or pay a cent back until they are earning more than $50,000 each year.




A fairer higher education system



This brings me to HECS.


HECS is critical to ensuring that no student is denied the benefit of a higher education. Providing assistance to students through HECS comes at a cost. This year the government is providing more than $5 billion in HECS loans, and this will increase to $10 billion in 2017. The government sought to introduce a fair interest rate on loans to alleviate taxpayers of some of this cost burden. However, as I indicated earlier, I have removed this proposal from the package, and as a consequence it is not contained within this bill. HECS indexation will continue to be based on the CPI.


As I have indicated, the bill also reflects Senator Madigan's proposal to freeze interest charges for the primary carers of a child under five. This family-friendly proposal joins with Senator Day's proposal in taking us back to CPI for indexation of HECS debts, and goes further. It provides a wholly new benefit to graduates caring for young children.


Again, the important thing is, HECS is here to stay, so no Australian student need ever pay a cent up-front for their higher education course.


Our HECS system is the envy of the world—introduced by the Hawke-Keating government, in fact. But one thing that is clearly wrong with the student loan system is the 25 per cent additional fee that is imposed on students who choose to study in a non-Commonwealth supported place, and the 20 per cent on students studying with the support of VET FEE-HELP.


So the government is acting to make the system fairer by removing inequities in the treatment of students and institutions under the HECS scheme. Consistent with the budget announcement, the bill removes the 20 per cent loan fee for VET FEE-HELP and the 25 per cent loan fee for FEE-HELP. These loan fees are an unfair cost on those students who are not receiving a Commonwealth subsidy.


Removing the loan fee makes the system fairer and will simplify and improve the consistency of loan arrangements for students and institutions.


It will also remove price inequity between public universities and other institutions. It will particularly benefit students who elect to undertake higher-level courses at institutions such as TAFEs.


Over 80,000 students undertaking vocational education and training and 50,000 higher education students will benefit each year from the removal of the loan fee. In 2013, the average cost of these per student was around $1,600 for VET FEE-HELP and $2,600 for FEE-HELP.


The lifetime limits on all HECS schemes are also being removed as they result in students paying up-front costs which can provide a significant barrier to access. As a result of this change, no student will need to pay their fees up-front in order to access higher education.




A strong competitive research system



Lastly, the government is committed to ensuring that Australia has a strong, competitive research system.


As part of the higher education reform package the government will invest $11 billion over four years in research in Australian universities, including $139 million for the Future Fellowships scheme and $150 million in 2015-16 to continue the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy.


Labor left funding cliffs for both of these vital research programs.


The government's commitment to ARC funding for Future Fellowships means that ARC funding is increased by this bill well above what was proposed by the previous government in the forward estimates.




Consequences of the b
ill not passing



For our universities, the funding system will continue to operate like a straitjacket. There will be little scope or incentive for them to develop and market new and innovative courses to Australian students; much less the capacity for them to shine internationally if this bill is not passed.


Australian universities will be forced to deal with the continuing instability and uncertainty of the current funding system. If evidence of this is needed, look no further than the $6.6 billion of cuts that Labor announced from 2011. This is hardly the way for Australia's third biggest export industry to run.


And let us not forget that what Labor did not cut, they left unfunded. If the bill does not pass, the Future Fellowships scheme will cease, and many of our best researchers will be forced to leave. The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy will cease, putting 1,500 researchers out of a job. The loss of these two programs alone will do irreparable damage to our capacity to support high-quality research.


For the higher education activities of our TAFEs and private colleges, we will be closing the door in their face. 


If the bill is not passed, students will continue to be locked out of pathways qualifications—qualifications which, as identified by Dr Kemp and Mr Norton in their review of the demand-driven system, have a significant impact on the dropout rates of students with low ATARs. 


If the bill is not passed, 80,000 Australian students a year will miss out on receiving Commonwealth support to study. 


And if we do not pass this bill, we will forgo the largest scholarship scheme for disadvantaged students that Australia has ever seen.




Conclusion
—
no credible alternative



So the Australian parliament again has an opportunity to support some of the greatest higher education reforms of our time, and it is clear that there is no credible alternative.


As Mike Gallagher, one of the most experienced figures in Australian higher education policy, has said:


The 2014 higher education budget reforms are necessary. They are logical, coherent, sustainable, equitable and inevitable … My guess is that the detractors of micro-economic reform in Australia's higher education industry will find themselves on the wrong side of history in resisting efficiency improvement and innovation, as they will be in opposing the redistributive measures of the package and, curiously, supporting socially regressive subsidies from general taxpayers to more advantaged segments of the community.


The Higher Education and Research Reform Bill 2014 will allow our higher education system to be the best in the world. It will ensure that future generations of Australians can get a world-class education to support them in the jobs of the future. It will provide the backbone of our future economy.


I urge members and senators to support the bill and I move:

Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga) (13:30):  Today, thousands of Australians celebrate International Day of People with Disability. I want to share the inspirational story of Anna Russ. Anna has cerebral palsy and has limited ability to move her arms. She has always had a passion for art, but her disability meant that her capacity to participate in the creative arts was limited. All this changed when Anna was given access to an iPad at Araluen, a disability support service in my electorate of Jagajaga. For the first time, the artistic expression that had been locked in Anna's mind was unleashed. A flurry of artistic expression poured from Anna's mind onto the digital canvas. Today Anna's paintings are reproduced from the iPad onto metal and sold at galleries across Melbourne. I congratulate Araluen for their Imagining Better program that explores opportunities for people with disability to use technology.


The theme for this year's International Day of People with Disability is Sustainable Development: The Promise of Technology. Anna's story provides us with a perfect example of how technology is enabling people with disability to be defined not by their disability but by their skills and their ability to contribute so much to our society. Happy International Day of People with Disability to Anna Russ and to all Australians.

Why have we reintroduced a Higher Education and Research Reform Bill today? Because it is the right thing to do for Australia, for students, and for the university sector. Labor cut $6.6 billion from our university sector and gave universities no prospects of replacing that revenue. That $6.6 billion cut has damaged the university sector.


The university sector themselves, led by Brenda Robinson at Universities Australia, have said that universities are in decline and they risk stagnation without reform. Every university representative organisation has called on the parliament to pass these reform bills with amendments. Because of Labor's $6.6 billion of cuts we are making the decisions that are necessary to give universities the opportunity to replace that revenue by asking students to pay 50-50 for the costs of their education when they are currently paying 40 per cent and taxpayers are paying 60 per cent. I think that is fair, and I think that most students would be happy to pay 50-50 for the cost of their education.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr PYNE:
  I do note that it is Phil Hughes's funeral today, and I would ask the opposition to at least consider, today of all days, their behaviour in the chamber. I would also remind the opposition that today—



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be silence. The minister will resume his seat. There will be silence in the chamber and we will listen to the answer. The Minister for Education has the call.




Mr PYNE:
  Let me quote the Vice Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, Professor Greg Craven, who said:


Rejecting the package wholesale is not a vote for university equity. It is a vote against reality.


That is what Labor and the Greens and four of the crossbenchers did yesterday. They voted against the reality, the inevitability, of reform. If revenue is not able to flow to universities from the students, then Labor are obviously proposing it flows from the taxpayer. That means they are proposing more taxes or to take the money from other parts of the portfolios of the government to give it to education. That is the inevitable consequence of the Labor Party's position. It is either higher taxes or it is cuts to other services to fund universities.


The Regional Universities Network put out a press release today which says:


The new bill is a big step in the right direction and we acknowledge the efforts of the cross-bench Senators and the Government in progressing this,


The chair of RUN, Professor Peter Lee, said that the new bill introduced today shows that many of the issues raised by RUN have been listened to by the Senate and the government.

Ms RISHWORTH
 (Kingston) (14:16):  My question is to the Minister for Education. Does the minister think that forcing Senator Lazarus to change his mobile number will make him change his mind on $100,000 degrees, or will he start listening and take his unfair university changes back to the drawing board?



The SPEAKER:  I am going to give the question to the Minister for Education, but I fail to see how he is responsible for Senator Lazarus's telephone.

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (14:17):  I thank the member for Kingston for her question—



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  There will be quiet.




Mr PYNE:
  because its broadness gives me the opportunity to continue in the vein that I was answering her previous question in. I am not going to take the reform off the table, Member for Kingston, because, in case you have missed it, I have reintroduced a new reform bill this morning. It is possible that you might have missed the detail, being in the opposition, but can I just explain a lot of the support that we have for these reforms around Australia. The member for Kingston asked before why we were not listening to the sector and quoted one vice-chancellor. Universities Australia said:


The peak body representing Australia's universities calls on the Parliament to support the deregulation of Australian universities …


Regional Universities Network said:


… RUN considers that the only way that the sector can maintain quality and remain internationally competitive is through the deregulation of student fees.


The Innovative Research Universities said:


The IRU urges the Senate to pass the Bill with the necessary amendments by the end of 2014.


The Australian Technology Network of Universities said:


Deregulation is a threshold issue for the sector and its passage through the Senate is crucial to protect the international reputation for quality higher education, representing around $15 Billion in export earnings for Australia.


And, finally, the Group of Eight said:


These historic reforms reconcile access and quality, and make growth affordable.


You see, everyone in the sector knows that this reform is necessary to protect Australian universities and to protect the quality of education for students. There are some in the Labor Party who know that, including the shadow Assistant Treasurer, and there are former Labor leaders, like Gareth Evans, who recognise that. But Labor is not interested in good quality education at our universities. Labor is not interested in research outcomes at our universities. Labor does not mind if our universities stagnate, as long as they can play the politics of an issue, day in, day out. Good luck to them. The only problem for Labor is that the Australian people can see through a political party that always plays base politics and never thinks about policy, and never thinks about what is good for Australia.



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Perth! 




Mr PYNE:
  We know on this side of the House that what is good for Australia—



Ms MacTiernan interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Perth will desist!




Mr PYNE:
  is great universities, world-class education and as many students as possible in Australia having the advantage of that education.

Mrs McNAMARA
 (Dobell) (15:01):  My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the Green Army? How has delivering this initiative provided young Australians with practical skills and training whilst improving the environment?

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2014-12-03,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (15:02):  Only a month ago I was on the shores of Tuggerah Lakes with the member for Dobell, and we visited The Entrance where a Green Army team of young people was in the field. They were clearing away lantana.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Hunter! He may have to get his own canoe soon.




Mr HUNT:
  They were clearing away blackberry. They were rehabilitating the area, planting native species and restoring the foreshore. There was a great sense of purpose and satisfaction in what they were doing. We also travelled a little way up the road to where there was a foreshore which, a year ago, was covered in wrack and was putrid. As part of the coalition's Tuggerah Lakes recovery program, it is now free of weed, is open for the public to attend this summer and is going to make a real difference to the environment as well as a real difference to the local economy.


This is part of a broader program that we have seen over the last year. We have gotten rid of the carbon tax, we have passed the emissions reduction fund into being, we have put in place one-stop shops across the country, and we have cleared $1 trillion of backlogged Labor projects which they would not say no to and they would not say yes to. But, perhaps, right at the heart of what I do, I take most joy in what the Green Army is doing. They are young people in the environment having a tremendous sense of satisfaction.


Already the army is well ahead of schedule. We have 62 teams in the field around the country. We have young people who are taking great pride in it. We have Jade from the Barossa Valley who says, according to ABC News:


I've always wanted a career in conservation or animals, anywhere, zoos or something like that … So this has been a great experience and it's going to give me a lot of life lessons for later on.


More than that, though, these projects are around the country. They are in coalition seats. They are also in Labor seats. They are in Maribyrnong. They are in Throsby. They are in Hunter. Unlike the Labor Party, we can see that the whole of the country should benefit. As opposed to what they do, the whole of the country benefits.


On that front about fairness in grant allocation, I just happened to be reading page 124 of the ANAO report into RDA funds rounds 3 and 4 today.




Mr Burke:
  I rise on a point of order regarding relevance. There is an understanding which is consistent with what you said at the beginning today, and I would ask for direct relevance to be strictly applied.



The SPEAKER:  The minister has the call. I did pass some observations at the beginning of question time.




Mr HUNT:
  Thank you very much, Madam Speaker. I have been reading it and I am happy to read more of it tomorrow. But the point is that we have—



An opposition member interjecting— 




Mr HUNT:
  You are kidding! We have been fair and make sure that right around the country young people from whatever electorate have the opportunity to be part of these programs. Whether it is Lalor, whether it is Newcastle, whether it is Throsby, there are young people helping the environment in a way which is good for them and good for the country, and that is how it should be.

(f) the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has encouraged the international community to share the burden of supporting Syrian refugees, having a target for resettlement of 130,000 by the end of 2016, but has received a minimal response to date with less than 2 per cent of the registered refugee population having secured a resettlement place;


(g) while the regional response to the crisis should be commended, the global response has been relatively weak;


(h) the United Nations issued its largest appeal in relation to a single crisis in December 2013, stating that $6.5 billion was vital to adequately support Syrians inside and outside of the conflict-ravaged nation, but to date the appeal has only raised 62 per cent of that target; and


(i) in December 2014 the United Nations World Food Programme announced that it was suspending its food aid program for Syrian refugees for lack of funding, leaving 1.7 million refugees to go hungry during winter, and has called for US$64 million in immediate assistance to allow the recommencement of this essential aid; and


(2) calls on the Australian Government to:


(a) reconsider the level of Australia's existing humanitarian support and funding to assist those affected by the Syrian crisis with a view to making a significantly larger contribution;


(b) offer direct support to neighbouring countries, including through funding and arrangements to receive additional refugees in Australia by expanding the existing quota of asylum seekers and focusing resettlement on those Syrian refugees recommended by the UNHCR on the basis of vulnerability; and

Great Barrier Reef Marine Park: Resumption of debate (from 24 November 2014) on the motion of Mr Entsch—That this House:


(1) acknowledges that Marine National Park (Green) Zones as defined in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003 serve to better protect the biodiversity within the Marine Park and help to ensure:


(a) the continued existence of the unique marine animals, plants and habitats that are found only in the Great Barrier Reef and provide additional protection for threatened species such as dugong and marine turtles;


(b) those industries that rely on the health of the Marine Park are able to continue, providing social and economic benefits to local communities and the wider economy;


(c) a diverse range of other benefits and values of the Marine Park, including recreational, cultural, educational and scientific values, are protected;


(d) that future generations are able to continue to use and enjoy the Marine Park;


(e) the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage values are protected; and


(f) the ecologically sustainable use of marine resources by traditional owners consistent with their traditional practices, are provided for;


(2) accepts that Marine National Park (Green) Zones can be beneficial in:


(a) protecting spawning areas and nursery grounds;


(b) minimising damage to important habitats;


(c) providing refuge for protected species, such as turtles and dugongs;


(d) boosting species numbers, which helps the food web as a whole;


(e) increasing the abundance of fish; and


(f) building the resilience of the reef against threats such as climate change and water pollution;


(3) affirms the Native Title Act 1993 which recognises the right of certain traditional owners to hunt and gather in their sea country and that native title holders may undertake traditional use of marine resources;


(4) recognises that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is working with traditional owners for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, by expanding the Traditional Use of the Marine Resources Agreement program and strengthening communications between local communities, managers and reef stakeholders;


(5) acknowledges the value of the Ranger Program in providing job opportunities for Indigenous people to care for their country, take on important skills, develop career pathways, protect dugongs and turtles and manage environmental threats stemming from feral animals, among other benefits;


(6) calls on the:


(a) Australian Labor Party and the Greens to pass the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 which will enable a tripling of penalties for those poaching turtles and/or dugongs; and


(b) relevant parties to work, as a priority, with traditional owners to progressively increase the protections afforded to threatened species, such as turtle and dugong, through traditional use marine resource agreements and other appropriate means, seeking to:


(i) where traditional rights under the Native Title Act 1993 apply, seek agreement with traditional owners to prohibit the capture and killing of any species from designated Green Zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area;


(ii) continue to allow certain activities to take place with a permit, such as research and management programs for fauna and flora where they pose a threat to humans or the environment, as per existing regulations; and


(iii) introduce legislation to prohibit the taking of marine species, including seabirds, in designated Green Zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Area, where other efforts have proven to be inadequate;


(7) in the interest of supporting the policing of turtle and dugong product that is transported for commercial purposes, prohibit the movement of native species, taken under the Native Title Act 1993 outside the area in which it is caught; and


(8) recognises that these initiatives would complement a range of measures already being implemented under the Government's Turtle and Dugong Protection Plan and Community Management Plans, which will enhance the protection of marine turtles and dugongs in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait.

That this House:


(1) notes that:


(a) February is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, which aims to raise awareness among Australian women of the symptoms of ovarian cancer; and


(b) each year 1400 Australian women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and more than 1000 will die from the disease—that is one woman every 8 hours;

(3) acknowledges that there is no screening program or detection test for ovarian cancer, and that the Pap smear will not detect the disease;


(4) recognises that:


(a) ovarian cancer is not a silent disease and that all women experience symptoms, even in the early stages of the cancer; and


(b) the four most common symptoms are:


(i) abdominal or pelvic pain;


(ii) increased abdominal size or persistent abdominal bloating;


(iii) needing to urinate often or urgently; and


(iv) difficulty eating or feeling full quickly;


(5) understands that every Australian woman needs to know the symptoms of ovarian cancer; and


(6) notes the need for greater focus on education and additional research funding to help Australian scientists to find early detection markers and more effective treatments for this disease.

1 
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park: Resumption of debate (from 24 November 2014) on the motion of Mr Entsch—That this House:


(1) acknowledges that Marine National Park (Green) Zones as defined in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Zoning Plan 2003 serve to better protect the biodiversity within the Marine Park and help to ensure:


(a) the continued existence of the unique marine animals, plants and habitats that are found only in the Great Barrier Reef and provide additional protection for threatened species such as dugong and marine turtles;


(b) those industries that rely on the health of the Marine Park are able to continue, providing social and economic benefits to local communities and the wider economy;


(c) a diverse range of other benefits and values of the Marine Park, including recreational, cultural, educational and scientific values, are protected;


(d) that future generations are able to continue to use and enjoy the Marine Park;


(e) the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage values are protected; and


(f) the ecologically sustainable use of marine resources by traditional owners consistent with their traditional practices, are provided for;


(2) accepts that Marine National Park (Green) Zones can be beneficial in:


(a) protecting spawning areas and nursery grounds;


(b) minimising damage to important habitats;


(c) providing refuge for protected species, such as turtles and dugongs;


(d) boosting species numbers, which helps the food web as a whole;


(e) increasing the abundance of fish; and


(f) building the resilience of the reef against threats such as climate change and water pollution;


(3) affirms the Native Title Act 1993 which recognises the right of certain traditional owners to hunt and gather in their sea country and that native title holders may undertake traditional use of marine resources;


(4) recognises that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is working with traditional owners for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, by expanding the Traditional Use of the Marine Resources Agreement program and strengthening communications between local communities, managers and reef stakeholders;


(5) acknowledges the value of the Ranger Program in providing job opportunities for Indigenous people to care for their country, take on important skills, develop career pathways, protect dugongs and turtles and manage environmental threats stemming from feral animals, among other benefits;


(6) calls on the:


(a) Australian Labor Party and the Greens to pass the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 which will enable a tripling of penalties for those poaching turtles and/or dugongs; and


(b) relevant parties to work, as a priority, with traditional owners to progressively increase the protections afforded to threatened species, such as turtle and dugong, through traditional use marine resource agreements and other appropriate means, seeking to:


(i) where traditional rights under the Native Title Act 1993 apply, seek agreement with traditional owners to prohibit the capture and killing of any species from designated Green Zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area;


(ii) continue to allow certain activities to take place with a permit, such as research and management programs for fauna and flora where they pose a threat to humans or the environment, as per existing regulations; and


(iii) introduce legislation to prohibit the taking of marine species, including seabirds, in designated Green Zones within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Area, where other efforts have proven to be inadequate;


(7) in the interest of supporting the policing of turtle and dugong product that is transported for commercial purposes, prohibit the movement of native species, taken under the Native Title Act 1993 outside the area in which it is caught; and


(8) recognises that these initiatives would complement a range of measures already being implemented under the Government's Turtle and Dugong Protection Plan and Community Management Plans, which will enhance the protection of marine turtles and dugongs in Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait.

"Bishop, Bronwyn, MP",LP,2014-12-03,"



The SPEAKER
 (15:15):  I have received a letter from the honourable member for McMahon proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: 


The adverse impact of the budget on jobs and the economy.


I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

"Bowen, Chris, MP",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Mr BOWEN
 (McMahon) (15:15):  It has been quite a week in this chamber. It has been quite a week in Australian politics. But the overriding impression left, by this government—for the Australian people—by their behaviour in this chamber and outside it, is their level of delusion, their level of denial and their level of misunderstanding of the impacts of their own actions. They just do not get it.


Perhaps the most spectacular example has been the rather special performance of the Minister for Education over the last 24 hours—but he does not have the prize all to himself. In no area is their level of delusion and denial more worrying, more concerning, than when it comes to the management of our economy. One of the most important responsibilities given to a government is the management of the national economy, to ensure strong growth of our economy and to ensure that our finances are in good shape.


We have seen the impact of their denial over the last 48 hours. We had the Prime Minister hold a press conference, where he said: 'Confidence is returning to our economy.' There is only one little problem with that—it is not. The figures are very clear. We saw it with the Treasurer today. He denied that the previous Labor government had achieved three AAA ratings from the three major ratings agencies. He just denied it had happened. I have news for him: it did, I am sorry to inform the Treasurer. He also made a mistake when it came to the unemployment rate, but we are not going to quibble over details. That would be unfair to the Treasurer, because he is not very good at details when it comes to the Australian economy.


They thought it would all be easy. That is the fundamental dynamic we are seeing played out in their management of the economy. We know that because they told us. The Prime Minister, when he was Leader of the Opposition, said: 'There will be an instantaneous adrenaline charge in our economy.' If only it were that easy. Let's have a look at how that adrenaline charge is going. We have seen Westpac's consumer confidence index show a 13 per cent reduction since the election. We see the Treasurer clinging onto a bit of hope in the ANZ index. He said, 'Don't worry about the Westpac index. What would Westpac know about consumer confidence? Let's have a look at the ANZ index.' 


There is a little problem for the Treasurer in the ANZ index as well. If you look at the ANZ index, the annual average on that index is 111.4. But 111.4 for this year is not a great result, I have to break it to the Treasurer. In fact, it has not been lower since 1993. It is the equal-worst result since 1993, if you put aside the global financial crisis that saw consumer confidence impacted by world events. 


We saw the Treasurer valiantly deny any of this today. 'Nothing to see here,' he said. 'Move along; there is nothing to see in the economy. There's no problem.' He said, 'Look at jobs. We're creating jobs twice as fast.' A couple of months ago he said it was five times as fast, but it is a moving feast for the Treasurer when it comes to figures. Even on this level, his record is a very poor one. 


If you look at job creation since the budget, it is a very poor story indeed. We have seen unemployment increase. We have seen 42,000 more people on Australia's unemployment queues since he stood at that dispatch box and brought down his unfair budget, which smashed confidence. We have seen jobs growth slow to about a third the level it was before he brought down his budget. And we have seen youth unemployment increase dramatically—to its highest level in 13 years—on this Treasurer's watch. They are the facts.


When you look at full-time jobs growth, as a total since the budget, it comes out at close to zero. Effectively, there were no full-time jobs created. It has gone up and down over the months, but if you look at the record since the budget it is a very poor one indeed. Today we have had two bits of news for the Treasurer, which he likes to ignore. He stood at the dispatch box and talked about the importance of services—and he is right. Services are 70 per cent of our economy. Services are vital. Confidence in services is very important in our services sector. Today we had the latest update. We have had several updates on the services sector. 


Those updates have shown the impact of this Treasurer's budget. The organisation which conducts those surveys, the Australian Industry Group, has made clear and explicit what is going on here and what is impacting on confidence in the services sector. It is this government's budget. They said it clearly. They said it in black and white. Again today AIG said that the services sector 'remained disturbingly weak in November, reflecting fragile consumer and business sentiment …'. The Australian economy remains stuck in the slow lane. This Treasurer, if you listened to him, would not think that. He does not appear to know it or recognise it.


Then we had the national accounts, which showed a growth of 0.3 per cent. The Treasurer thinks that is a fantastic result. The fact that it is less than half of market expectation seems to have escaped him. I then asked him a very simple and basic question. But there was one word that could not pass his lips—there are two words that cannot pass this government's lips. There is a 'W' word—wrong—and there is an 'R' word—recession. There is a fact: Australia is in an income recession. 


The AustralianFinancial Review said that income recession is confirmed as GDP growth slows, from just a couple of hours ago. It is very clear, but the Treasurer seems to not acknowledge it. What he has done by his words and his actions is damage the Australian economy. He has brought down an unfair budget—that is true. He has attacked the cost of living of ordinary Australians—that is true. He has brought down a budget which is regressive and fundamentally unfair. He stands accused and he is guilty of it. But he also stands accused of bringing down a budget which is bad for the economy, because he fundamentally does not understand it. He fundamentally does not understand his job. He fundamentally does not understand that when a Treasurer speaks it has an impact. When a Treasurer talks about confidence it has an impact.


The Australian people look to a Treasurer to understand what is going on with the Australian economy. When the Treasurer engaged in his irresponsible and ill-thought-out rhetoric in the lead up to the budget, he had an impact, because when a Treasurer speaks the nation listens. When a Treasurer says something, it has an impact, and this Treasurer could not resist playing politics. He just could not resist because he loves opposition. He could not make the transition to government, and the transition to government means there is a responsibility on him to talk about the strength of the economy and the strength of the budget, and he could not bring himself to do it. We saw confidence starting to be smashed just as he started to talk about the budget. We did not have an adrenaline rush; we had a Mogadon rush from this Treasurer as he started with his rhetoric, and it got worse with his actions. He has acted irresponsibly, he has acted immaturely and he has shown he is just not up to the job of being Treasurer. He is just not up to the task that has been entrusted to him by the Australian people and by the Prime Minister. He is just not up to it. That is why we see speculation that he is not going to make it to election day as the Treasurer, because he just does not understand his role.


He does not understand the insult that he provides to the Australian people, and particularly to the people of Adelaide and Port Adelaide, when he says, 'We needed to get rid of the car industry for the free trade agreements. We needed to do that. I just didn't tell you at the time.' He did not say that, but he was goading Holden to leave Australia. He did not say, 'We need you to go so we can conduct a free trade negotiation with China and other countries.' He said that after the event. He does not understand the insult when he inaccurately says, 'We don't have time for something as outrageous as an open and transparent tender for a minor government procurement like the next generation of Australia's submarines. We couldn't possibly have time for that.' He knows he is wrong. He has been told he is wrong. We have again seen Australian Industry Group nail him for his error, and they are not the only ones. When it comes to this Treasurer, he just does not get it. He does not get it that he has an impact when he says that poor people do not drive cars. He does not get it that he has an impact when he says, 'Don't worry about the car industry, because we need a free trade agreement.' He does not get it that he has an impact when he says, 'We don't have time for such luxuries as an open and transparent tender. We wouldn't want to do that!' It is no wonder that people are speculating that he will not make the next election, because he is just not up to the job. (Time expired)

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-12-03,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (15:25):  Labor is committed to jobs—I appreciate that. They were committed to their own jobs and their own jobs only prior to the last election, but they were not committed enough, because they lost quite a few of those jobs and that is why they are on that side of the House now and why we are on this side of the House. They were not able to look after their own jobs, let alone anybody else's. The member for McMahon, that was a great audition for the top job over the other side—the opposition leader's job. It was not a really good rehearsal, but he will have to keep trying and I am sure that he will in 2015.


The member for McMahon mentioned two words beginning with 'W' and 'R'. I would put it to him that he was wrong about the two words that he used. 'W', when it comes to Labor, tells me of waste, and 'R' tells me of regional. I will get onto that in a little bit.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  I hope the member for Hunter stays and listens. There is the famous proverb: 'There are none so blind as those who will not see. The most deluded people are those who choose to ignore what they already know.' Surely that applies to the Australian Labor Party. There is a big difference between promise and performance. There is a big difference between what is needed and what is actually delivered. There is a big difference between Labor and the coalition, let me tell you.


It has been a year of achievement. The member for Hunter would acknowledge that. We began with budget repair—reducing projected debt by $300 billion. There was the largest infrastructure package ever—committed $50 billion; leveraging $125 billion. We facilitated significant state reforms; repealed the insidious minerals resource rent tax and the carbon tax, ultimately leading to the largest falls in electricity prices on record; privatised Medibank Private—the third-largest initial public offering globally this year, with over $1 billion above what we initially expected; removed around $2 billion worth of red tape; and repealed 57,000 pages of legislation. There was the end of the age of entitlement for industry. And there was more: agreement on three key preferential trade agreements—South Korea, Japan and China. We delivered smaller government, abolished 76 agencies, authorities and boards. There was $1 trillion of environmental approvals and 300 major projects were approved. It goes on and on, including rebuilding employee share schemes and dealing with the Labor tax backlog—almost 100 unenacted tax measures were taken care of. There was international leadership on cracking down on tax cheats. There was a 15-point Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development action plan. There is still more to come. Next year we have the Federation white paper and the taxation white paper. They will be key papers which are going to help the economic reform of this nation. And there will be further progress on budget reform and further preferential trade agreements.


In question time today, when the member for Berowra and very well respected Father of the House talked about the year of achievement, all we heard from the other side—



Mr Husic interjecting—



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  The member for Chifley was one of them and the member for Hunter was another. I am not quite sure about the member for Fraser. I think he was concentrating on his Eureka debate tonight. There was nothing but jeers and mocking laughter by Labor. Ignorance, ineptitude, irresponsibility, incompetence and absolutely incapable of seeing reason. That is Labor. It is writ large.


We compare our record of achievement, our year of achievement, with what Labor left this country: $123 billion worth of cumulative deficits, $667 billion worth of debt if nothing more was done, if nothing was set out to be achieved by the coalition. That has left this nation, the taxpayers of this nation—the mums, the dads, the families—with a $1 billion interest bill each and every month. That will increase to $3 billion if we choose to do nothing. Labor are opposed to $28 billion of savings including $5 billion of their own. This includes $9.6 billion of remaining welfare changes. We all know how rusted Labor is onto welfare. Labor want an additional $15 billion of spending restored which will worsen the budget bottom line by $43 billion.


We are looking forward to a stronger economy in 2015-16. Economic growth is projected to improve next year from 2.5 per cent to three per cent. Employment growth is anticipated to grow by 1.5 per cent. Stable unemployment will be around 6.25 per cent. It is too high, but it is certainly not as high as that which was recorded under Labor, and we are working towards reducing it all the time. Exports of goods and services are forecast to improve in volume with a seven per cent growth in 2015-16.



Mr Husic interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  These are important, Member for Chifley. Interest rates are at a historical low. Big infrastructure is starting to roll out.



Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  Member for Hunter, I actually, kind of, heard you cheering today when the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, stood up and talked about the 39,000 agricultural jobs created since we came to government. He is cheering now, as he should be. From our farmers, Labor took away their water and took away their hope. The member for New England is getting on with the job of rolling out a drought package. He is getting on with the job of giving farmers back water, with the help of Senator Simon Birmingham, as well as giving them hope.


This coalition have succeeded in achieving a number of avenues, after only a year in government, following the debt and deficit legacy that we inherited from Labor after their six disastrous, miserable years in office. They were chaotic and dysfunctional years. We are getting on with the job of cleaning up after the disaster left by Labor. Labor presided over the most vast Australian debt position in modern history.


Interestingly, in The Australian, that reputable newspaper, on Tuesday this week there was an article titled, 'Money for marginals sees Labor exposed', which said:


… Labor funnelled money to projects in marginal electorates that were not deemed appropriate …


This is under the RDAF funding. The article continued:



The Australian can reveal that a wide range of worthy projects missed out.



Honourable members interjecting—




Mr McCORMACK:
  You should read the report from the Australian National Audit Office, Member for Hunter, which states:


… there was not a strong degree of alignment between the Minister's—


This is the member for 'Ballarort'—Ballarat, pardon me—


funding decisions and the panel's recommendations. On 40 occasions, the decision made by the Minister diverged from that recommended by the panel in round three.


Amongst those was a really important one, as The Australian reported:


… a program for disadvantaged, homeless and drug dependent youth was set to receive $500,000 in round four of the project, but the decision of the panel was also ignored.


That was in Narrandera, a town which really needed that funding and was really looking forward to it, but it was overlooked by Labor, even though Catherine King came into my electorate in the lead-up to the election and said that it was going to happen. But, of course, it was never going to happen because Labor, firstly, overspent the money from the mining tax by $17 billion or thereabouts, and, secondly, they had no intention of funding these very good programs, as the ANAO recorded. The ANAO report said:


A feature of the Minister's decision making was the lack of strong alignment between the funding decisions taken and the panel's recommendations—nearly half of the funding awarded (48 per cent) went to applications that had been categorised as other than 'Recommended for Funding'. In total, 74 decisions were taken by the Minister over rounds three and four that diverged from the advice of the panel.


The report continued:


It is difficult to see such a result as being consistent with the competitive merit-based selection process outlined in the published program guidelines.


What a disgrace. What an absolute rort and typical of Labor. But the member for McMahon certainly benefited. He benefited from a multimillion dollar program, and I hardly think that the member for McMahon's electorate is regional. But, be that as it may, what an absolute disgrace.


The legacy that Labor has left Australians is 200,000 more unemployed. It is a shame that, amongst those 200,000, there were not actually more Labor people running for parliament at the September election last year. Gross debt, as I said earlier, is projected to rise to $667 billion. We are paying far too much in interest each and every month. That money could be used to help irrigate Australia, to help regional programs, to help fund the program at Narrandera for Outreach, for the unemployed and for drug dependent people. But, no, they laugh and they continue to pour scorn upon these very good programs that they should have funded. They promised that they would, but they actually failed to.


There is a big difference, as I said before, between actual performance and promise. That is why there is a big, big difference, also, between the coalition and Labor. We get on with the job of doing things, of creating jobs and restoring this country to the levels that it should be. All Labor does is wreck and ruin.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (15:35):  In this annus horribilis for the Abbott government: they have given Australia back knights and dames; they have taught us that the name of our North American friend is pronounced 'Canadia'; they have suggested that the US is at risk of default—and I am sure the member for Riverina would not have made a mistake like that. They have shown their common touch by smoking cigars just before handing down the most unfair budget in living memory; enlightened us about the link between breast cancer and abortion; taken to the barricades to defend the rights of bigots; told us that poor people do not drive cars; said that the Australian Submarine Corporation, despite being headed by Sophie Mirabella, still cannot build a canoe; and shown us that demon dialling is the way to every crossbencher's heart.


What they have not done is deliver a budget that will grow the Australian economy, improve egalitarianism and create jobs. In fact, just like one of the member for Sturt's text partners, they have run screaming in the opposite direction. This budget is Robin Hood in reverse. It gives billions to multinationals and hundreds of thousands of dollars to people with more than $2 million in their superannuation accounts but it takes one dollar in every 10 from the wallets and purses of Australia's poorest single parents. This is not a meritocracy; this is a budget for a mate-ocracy. 


This government has attempted to bring in a GP tax. They have attempted to take one dollar in five of student funding from Australian universities. They have cut pensions and, in breach of their pre-election promises, they are attempting to cut into the ABC to turn it into a 'Very Small Business'. They have 'Shaun the Sheep'. They have told porkies about 'Peppa Pig'. In 'The Health Report' they are soon going to be asking, 'Doctor Who?' The'Hollowmen' are on their 'Media Watch'.


When he was swearing in the Governor-General, the Prime Minister told Australians that the reason we have a Governor-General is to visit 'places that aren't important enough for prime ministers'. Right now that is a pretty long list. It includes universities, because you need a small SWAT team to get a member of this front bench to visit them. It includes hospitals. It includes childcare centres and it includes the entire state of Victoria.


The Prime Minister is about as popular in Victoria as a fruit fly invasion. He is about as useful as a porthole on a submarine. That is why they started their campaign for Victorians by sneaking in a fuel tax through backdoor means and ended up sticking to the GP tax like a captain going down on a barnacle-ridden ship. The Prime Minister shirt-fronted his Victorian colleagues and he is shirt-fronting Australians with his unfair budget.


Today is the 160th anniversary of the Eureka uprising. As Gough Whitlam put it in his 1973 Eureka lecture, 'Egalitarianism—by whatever name we call it—is at the heart of the Australian tradition.' But now, with inequality at a 75-year high, we have a government that wants to take from the vulnerable to give to the affluent—a government which is, literally, governing for the knights and the dames. 


We, on this side, have a proud legacy. We kept Australia out of the biggest downturn since the Great Depression. We put in place a carbon price that saw the biggest drop in emissions in 24 years—a great economic reform that allowed us to lower the taxes on work while we were putting a price on pollution, and which boosted egalitarianism, because it is the poorest who will be hurt by unchecked climate change.


We made $180 billion in responsible savings, including means-testing the private health insurance rebate, reforming the PBS, and getting rid of the dependent spouse tax offset. Those opposite claimed last year that they would deliver a surplus in their first year and every year after that. They said there was no revenue problem and that there would be an 'adrenaline charge'. Instead of the adrenaline charge, we have had a government that looks like a dose of valium. We have had more tantrums than a daycare centre at nap time. They are blaming the opposition for opposing, blaming the media for reporting, and blaming the business community for failing to sell their budget.


The problem is not the sales job, it is their very budget. We do not know what cuts will be in the mini-budget when it comes, but we know that what they are selling stinks. It is not the barnacles; it is the ship and the captain that should be sent back out to sea.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (15:41):  I would like to begin by reminding members opposite, and the Australian people, of the reason the government was changed on 7 September 2014. In 2007, Labor inherited a $20 billion surplus with zero net debt and $45 billion in the bank. Labor delivered deficits totalling $191 billion between 2008-09 and 2012-13.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Moreton!




Mrs MARKUS:
  In addition to this, Labor left additional projected deficits of $123 billion over the next four years, from 2013-14 to 2016-17. These are the facts. 


In addition to this, over its six budgets while in government, Labor increased spending by an additional 50 per cent, totalling $137 billion. Labor's legacy on jobs was 200,000 more unemployed. More waste and more mismanagement was demonstrated through Labor's handling of the national broadband network, with an estimated blow out of $29 billion. Further blow-outs include $11 billion in border protection costs, $6.8 billion due to the overpriced cost of school halls, and $2.8 billion spent on the failed pink batts scheme. 


It is important for us to remind members opposite of the reasons the government changed hands last year. This year alone, the debt Labor created will cost $12 billion in interest. If we do not take urgent action and initiate policy change now our debt will continue to grow to an estimated $667 billion. Each Australian's share of Labor's debt is currently $13,500. Unless we take action this will grow by $1,100 annually and could potentially reach $24,500 in a decade. This is a debt that Labor left for each Australian.


The coalition government is determined and focused on building a strong and prosperous economy for a secure and safe future for every Australian. Since taking government the coalition has been active in commencing budget repair. The coalition has reduced projected debt by $300 billion so far, with 75 per cent of our budget measures having now been passed—contrary to what members opposite say. The Abbott government has committed $50 billion to establish the largest infrastructure package ever. This package will deliver critical infrastructure and create jobs and activity-boosting, long-term productivity for all Australians. Next year the $1 billion National Stronger Regions Fund will be rolled out, giving local communities the opportunity and ability to receive the infrastructure that their people, families and businesses need desperately—creating local jobs and building local economies.


This year the coalition government successfully repealed the carbon tax, saving the average household $550 a year. The carbon tax placed direct pressure on over 75,000 businesses, costing over $700 million. Following the abolition of the carbon tax, the coalition government ensured that all savings would be passed on to business, giving the ACCC new powers. These powers guaranteed a reduction in operating costs for many businesses, easing the cost for many business owners.


The coalition government has successfully agreed on three free trade agreements with South Korea, Japan and China. Our free trade agreement with China means more jobs, creating greater investment in Australia and a higher standard of living for all Australians. Once our free trade agreement is fully implemented, our agricultural produce, resources and manufactured goods will be well placed to compete in China's dynamic marketplace. It will mean access for our banks, universities and tourism operators—the heartbeat of the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. They will all receive better, more guaranteed access to the Chinese market. The concessions we have given to China will lead to increased investment in Australia, strengthening our economy, particularly increasing tourism, one of our largest exports, and providing cheaper goods for Australian consumers.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (15:46):  I have one question: does this Treasurer get anything right? He gets nothing right. Let's go through a roll call. Let's do a quick rundown. He told us that there would be an adrenaline surge in confidence. Wrong! It is 13 per cent lower than at the election. He told us there would be a million jobs, but unemployment is worse than it was in the GFC. He told us, 'We will achieve a surplus in our first year in office.' He said that. Where did that one go? Here is another one. He said budgets would be better under them. He said, 'I can promise that the coalition will deliver a better budget bottom line.' In MYEFO, in one budget statement, it went worse than ever. It will be interesting to see how MYEFO delivers in the next few weeks.


I love these quotes. Joe Hockey is like a quote vending machine: you just have to hit him and he comes out with another one. Here is another one—'We must return stable, predictable, honest government to Australia.' That is beautiful! He said, 'The objective of the coalition over time is to reduce the overall tax burden on business and taxpayers, not to increase it.' What about this one? He said, 'The government does not have a revenue collection problem; it has a revenue forecasting problem.' That is what he said. What happened when iron ore started moving? We suddenly started getting the excuses. We also got this whopper—'Poor people don't drive.' There was that one as well. Does he get anything right?


I do not, we do not and the Hockey enthusiasts do not need to answer the question, 'Does the Treasurer get anything right?' Do you know why? It is because the answer was on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday in an article headed 'PM's man to focus on economy' when Peter Hartcher wrote:


The anxious Abbott government is hoping it will be revived by the new head of the Prime Minister's Department, who starts work on Monday with a brief to concentrate on the government's economic agenda.


In an implicit acknowledgement that the government has lost much confidence in the Treasurer …


There you go! Does he get anything right? We do not have to answer that question because those opposite have answered it for us. When Joe goes poorly, they roll out Thawley. That is what they do. They are bringing in Thawley to help out because they have no confidence left in the Treasurer.


I wonder if the Treasurer even knew, because he has not had a good week of being told what is going on with his own budget strategy. Last week he had to find out through the bush telegraph that runs through the press gallery that they were about to announce that the GP tax was going. Whoops! When did he find out about that? He did not find out through the proper cabinet process that we were promised would occur by that side. He found out because it was running through the press gallery like wildfire. Then what happened? The Treasurer stood his ground and said, 'The GP tax will stay.' Will it stay or will it go? We do not know. This is the stable government we were promised by those opposite! Look at the way they are operating.


The biggest economic challenge facing the economy right now is confidence. But how do you get confidence if the coalition does not even have confidence in its own Treasurer? We want the economy to be able to grow because of confidence. However, it has been thugged. Confidence has been thugged by the coalition. If you are a single-income family or a family that is on $65,000, you have had $6,000 taken out by this budget. Wages growth is hardly growing. It is probably the worst the RBA has seen since it began keeping records. Confidence has been further mugged because of the fact that the Treasurer has his hand in every wallet and purse, taking out money by the thousands through a horror budget where pensions were cut, family payments were cut, support for young unemployed people was cut, a GP tax was brought in and petrol taxes went up.


I end on this quote from the Treasurer. This was said by the Treasurer when he was the shadow Treasurer. He said:


The government—


he was talking about us—


wants to blame anything and anyone else for the budget mess.

Dr JENSEN
 (Tangney) (15:51):  Oh, dear, Member for Chifley! If that was a job application to be a stand-up comedian, I do not think you pass. No-one of sound mind or judgement can or should trust Labor. Labor's lies and incompetence have saddled this nation with a huge debt burden. Filling in such a massive hole will not happen overnight. When we last held office, the budget was in surplus. We were $50 billion in the black. We were earning interest, not paying interest. The interest on their debt alone is $1 billion per month or $45 per month for every man, woman and child in Australia. Two months of that interest would be enough to build the Fiona Stanley Hospital in my electorate of Tangney. That hospital is the most modern in the Southern Hemisphere. Just think what not paying the mortgage on the credit card would mean for infrastructure around the country. Think of what that extra money would do for people stuck in traffic on the Bruce or Hume highways, or in Sydney, Melbourne or even Perth. In short, responsible budgeting means living within our means. 


The key message is this: only the Abbott coalition government has an Economic Action Strategy that will grow the economy and fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster. Without ameliorative action, the country was on track for $667 billion of debt—$30,000-odd for every man, woman and child in Australia. One of Labor's biggest failures has been our biggest success—border protection. Stopping the boats was a key plank in our policy platform at the last election. We said that we would stop the boats, and we did. Not only have we restored integrity to our immigration system but we have stopped the needless tragedy of mass drownings at sea. Critically for this debate, it means that we have also stopped the haemorrhaging of public money. Under Labor, we bled money at every turn in this policy space. Search and rescue is expensive, administration is expensive and lifetime welfare payments are more expensive still. Many genuine refugees were left waiting, as queuejumpers risked paying people smugglers to make the journey to Australia. This injustice has stopped.


The list of achievements is long, and my time short. This first Abbott administration is committed to action. We have scrapped the carbon tax, saving the average household $550 per annum. We have scrapped the mining tax so that this vital sector can create more jobs. We have handed down a $50 billion infrastructure package—the single largest infrastructure package in this country's history. We have delivered free trade agreements with Japan, with China and with Korea, and this means more jobs for Australians. We are putting in place long-term structural reforms to fix the budget. 


To quote Ronald Reagan:


The nine most terrifying words … are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'


At the last election, the Australian people said: 'Stop helping. We are dying of regulation suffocation.' We will heat the economic engine with economic bonfires of bureaucracy. The globally-interconnected competitive marketplace scares the pants off lazy Labor layabouts. How lazy? So lazy that your leader did not even bother to check that the petition was compliant when he presented it in this place recently. If they cannot run their own house, why would you let them run your house? 


Labor have no plan for our country. Our government have a clear vision: free trade and a higher value-added strategy of sustainable growth. I am pleased that a can-do government that understands business is now back in charge. My constituents in Tangney have been waiting for years to see work commence on the Roe Highway stage 8 extension. I welcome the $675 million to finish the Gateway WA project in Perth. Unlike Labor, we do cost-benefit analyses. You promised surpluses and delivered deficits. You promised conservative fiscal policy and delivered more and higher taxes. You promised stability and delivered two coups and much chaos. Let us get back to building hope, reward and opportunity. (Time expired)

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (15:56):  We have been hearing over the last 36 hours that this has been a great year of achievement by the government. The Prime Minister has been on about it, the Minister for Education has been on about it and the Treasurer has been on about it. Let us ask ourselves about some of those achievements. What have they done? They have gutted the auto industry in this country. They have created huge lines of unemployment in the manufacturing sector and done it deliberately. They have doubled the deficit; almost within three months of coming into government, they doubled the deficit to $120 billion over the forward estimates. That is a mighty achievement! Yet they come into this place and bang on about how, somehow, the deficit is a Labor problem. The deficit is not a Labor problem. The deficit has been doubled by these clowns. 


Who else have they successfully worked with? Well, of course, Australian families! Every Australian family feels grateful for this government! They feel really grateful because of what this government has done! I think not. We heard just a moment ago about the impact on working families of changes to the tax concessions for families. That is a direct impost on those families—something that you have done proudly. You know that in your electorates the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are toxic.



Government members interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  You know it. I know what happens in your party room: you are all yapping like this, 'What are we going to do next?' Well, we know what you are going to do next. It will not be too long before the Treasurer is out of a job; I guarantee it. 


What else have they done? Well, they have hit health and education. They have cut $80 billion out of health and education. That is a very positive outcome for the people of Australia! I am sure that we are all very pleased and clapping the government 'Thank you' for cutting $80 billion out of health and education! They have tried to introduce a co-payment for Medicare treatments. I live in the Northern Territory, and I know people who would say to me, 'How the hell would I ever go to a doctor if I had to pay a co-payment of any description?' You know this to be the case in your own electorates. You know people in your own electorates who will say to you, 'We will not have a co-payment, because we can't afford what it will mean to us and our families.' 


Let me come to one of the most insidious things: the fuel tax. We know that the Prime Minister is noted for telling the truth! We note that before the last election he promised that there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no cuts to pensions. 


Just read the budget papers! The other group of people they have chosen to target are veterans, veterans' families and Australian Defence Force members. The member for Solomon is sitting here. What does she say to her Defence Force constituents when they ask her: 'Why are you cutting our real wages?' You know what they say to you. They say: 'We don't forgive you for that. We are concerned about this government. You lied to us before the last election and you continue to lie.' You are just liars! We know you lie and the community knows that you lie.

Mrs GRIGGS

 (
Solomon
) (
16:01
):  We just heard from the member from Lingiari, and I have to say he was going on about the co-payment but he has such a bad memory that he forgot that he voted for the co-payment years ago when it was first introduced. He does not put that on the record.


I welcome the opportunity to stand here today and speak on this MPI and talk about the tough reforms this government has had to introduce to fill the path of destruction the previous Labor government created during their six years in charge of Australia's finances. The Treasurer really does have his work cut out for him in trying to clean up the mess that the Labor Party left behind. I have to say that he is doing a mighty fine job, given the state of the books when he took over after the election.


Labor's legacy to our children is 200,000 more unemployed, gross debt projected to rise to $667 billion, with $123 billion in cumulative deficits, more than 50,000 illegal arrivals by boat and the world's biggest carbon tax. That is Labor's legacy.


I am proud to say that we have commenced work on fixing all of those problems, and the Australian economy is well on the road to recovery. We have scrapped the carbon tax, saving the average household $550 a year; we have stopped the boats, preventing deaths at sea and saving the budget billions of dollars; we have scrapped the mining tax so this vital sector can create more jobs; we have handed down a $50 billion infrastructure package, the single largest infrastructure package in Australia's history.


Projects worth $1 trillion have been given environmental approval; we have cut around $2 billion in red tape; we have delivered three free trade agreements with Japan, Korea and China, which mean more jobs for Australians. We are putting in place the long-term structural reforms necessary to fix the budget. This government has provided an additional $630 million to our police and security services and updated our national security laws to address the most pressing gaps in their ability to combat the growing threat of home-grown extremism. 


I think that is a pretty good track record so far. In the face of all this progress and reform, the Labor Party have stood in the way and stomped their feet like little children. There is a clear difference between the Labor Party and the coalition: we have a plan, they do not. We have a vision; they do not. We care about small business; they do not. We care about jobs; they do not. We have a plan for budget repair, when they have a plan for budget sabotage. Our plan is the only plan, and we will continue to deliver on our economic action strategy, which I believe is the mandate given to us by the Australian people.


The Labor Party cannot seem to accept that the Australian people have given this government a mandate—a mandate to fix the mess. And we are doing exactly that. The Labor Party needs to get out of the way and let us do the job we were elected to do. The Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments were six years of chaos, waste and mismanagement, which turned nearly $50 billion in the bank into a projected net debt worth well over $200 billion. This is the fastest deterioration in debt, in dollar terms and as a share of GDP, in modern Australian history. Australians are already paying $1 billion a month in interest payments and that is not even our money—it is borrowed. No country can continue to pay the mortgage payments on the credit card.


However, thanks to the coalition, the foundations for a stronger budget and a stronger economy are now in place. Even though it was the Labor Party that left us in this mess of debt and deficit, they are still trying to sabotage our tough but necessary budget. They have voted against $28 billion worth of savings, including $5 billion they handed down themselves.


We must work together to achieve a budget surplus again; it is necessary for this country and necessary for jobs and growth. Over six budgets, Labor increased spending by over 50 per cent—that is $137 billion. The adults are in charge now, and we are cleaning up the mess the children made.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (16:06):  The first budget of the Abbott government was not just unfair; it was also mean-spirited, short-sighted and incredibly counterproductive. It was a budget that gave tax breaks to big business and put money back in the pocket of big polluters. It was a budget that took money from families and pensioners and that cut funds to renewable energy innovators, the CSIRO, and the Climate Change Commission. It was a budget that hammered the young unemployed, denying them any support for a period of six months, while seeking to gift six months' salary in parental leave to people on $100,000 a year. It was a budget that Cassandra Goldie, the CEO of ACOSS, described by saying:


The real pain of this budget - crushing and permanent - will be felt by people on low incomes, young people, single parents, those with illness or disability, and those struggling to keep a roof over their heads. These are the groups doing the heavy lifting …


It was a budget that Jennifer Westacott of the Business Council of Australia described by saying:


We are very concerned about the risk that savings are falling too heavily on some families and young people trying to find work.


And it was a budget that has directly and indirectly cost jobs in areas that Australians hold precious: 1,000 jobs in science and innovation from the CSIRO, which invented wi-fi, Aerogard, plastic banknotes, the world's first effective influenza treatment, 100 varieties of cotton and the hendra virus vaccine, among many other things; 500 jobs from the most trusted source of news and current affairs in the country, the ABC; more than 10,000 jobs across the Commonwealth Public Service; and tens of thousands of jobs in manufacturing, the renewable energy sector, the automobile industry and ship building and maintenance. In August, Australia reached its highest level of unemployment in 12 years and for the first time since 2007 unemployment was higher in Australia than in the United States. The Prime Minister promised to create one million jobs within five years. Unfortunately, we know how much promises are worth from this Prime Minister.


The Abbott-Hockey budget is a remarkable failure. It has cost jobs and deepened the deficit. It has only succeeded in its aim of directing punitive measures against those who can least afford it and in cutting funds to health, education, science, pensioners, Indigenous affairs, the environment, the ABC and the SBS. As Crikey's Bernard Keane wrote earlier this week:


The political difficulties that face Hockey spring of course from that disastrous budget in May. The problem about that document wasn't merely the perceived unfairness of its measures, or the government's cack-handed attempts to alternately insist it was fair and explain its toughness was justified by the budget situation. It was that Hockey managed to produce a sadistic budget that didn't actually significantly advance the timetable for a return to surplus. The government was thereby left with the opprobrium of pursuing measures universally recognised as punitive, without the political benefit of being able to point to a fiscal light at the end of the tunnel. Worse, it's clear now that the tunnel is getting longer.


The damage and chaos of this budget have been visited upon so many Australians that it is only fair that responsibility for its harm be shared by those opposite. Responsibility belongs not just with the Prime Minister, but also with the Treasurer and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has presided over the biggest cuts to the Australian aid program in history—$7.6 billion has been stripped away in the name of Australia's political, economic and trade interests rather than continue the previous Labor government's focus on saving lives and reducing poverty. The foreign minister has not acted to stop the savage cuts in her portfolio that have seen hundreds of dedicated former AusAID staff lose the jobs they were passionate about and that have significantly reduced the critical work that Australia does to stop disease, to lower infant and maternal mortality, to provide medicine, clean water and sanitation and to build resilience and capacity. In fact the government is now threatening a further pillaging of the aid budget as a consequence of its own parlous economic performance.


UK Prime Minister David Cameron spoke with courage and he acted with honour when he said that the budget of the United Kingdom would not be balanced on the backs of the poor. The Abbott government has not acted with honour or courage. It has not balanced the budget; it has made the deficit worse. It has laid the burden of its economic incompetence on the backs of the poor and the disadvantaged, both here in Australia and across the world. It has presided over a sharp jump in unemployment to the worst level in more than a decade. It has cut jobs and, what is worse, it has sought to crush the source of future jobs in the knowledge economy, in renewable energy innovation and through education and training. We talk about good policy and administration as future-proofing. Unfortunately, this government is busy punching holes in that future, and the jobs and wellbeing of thousands of Australians are right now pouring through those holes.

Mr PITT
 (Hinkler) (16:11):  Some of the contributions to this MPI simply cannot go unanswered. I note the contributions from the member for Fraser and the member for Lingiari in particular. The member for Fraser spoke about the ABC. At a parliamentary committee meeting this week with Mark Scott, I was advised that the number of employees at the ABC is currently just over 4,000. Do you know how many of those are employed in regional areas, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott? I know this affects you. There are just 400. There are only 400 employees in the ABC in regional areas right now. It is Sydney-centric. It is not helping the bush. It is traditional radio, which we rely on. It is something that is exceptionally important to the people in my electorate. I note that the member for Fraser talked about the indexation of fuel. He said there would be a $20 increase for the average family. The member for Fraser should go out and buy some fuel. I suggest he gets a car. The price of fuel is down 14 cents a litre, right now, simply because of market changes. The member for Lingiari spoke about defence. What a hypocrite. In the 2012-13 budget, those opposite cut defence spending by 10½ per cent. It is the biggest decrease in the defence budget since the Korean War.


We all know why we are in this position. It is because those opposite spent all the money. They did not spend just our money, they spent my children's money. How did they do it? They did it as quickly as humanly possible. It was an incredible waste of taxpayers' money. They started off like they had received an inheritance from the maiden aunt. Aunt Johnny left behind a $20 billion surplus, no net debt and $45 billion in the bank. What did those opposite do with it? I am sure they had a meeting, put some notes on the back of a drinks coaster, perhaps, or maybe a napkin, and blew the lot. They spent it all. What happened then? They got addicted to spending and then they went looking for more money. Where do you find more money? The first place you find it is your credit card. Obviously, the credit card came in the mail and they filled it. It did not matter what the interest rate was, that was fine—they needed to spend some more money, another 16 per cent. When we have filled the credit card, what do we do? We look for another one, because someone will send us another one in the mail, and we will fill that one too. When we have spent the inheritance and we have filled up the credit card what do we do? We go to the bank and borrow more money. The bank would not give them any more money, so they had to go overseas. So now they had overseas money, and they spent all of that. What to do once we have spent all of that? We get rid of the Visa cards because they are all empty. We spent the inheritance—it is gone. We can kick down the neighbour's door—maybe they will give us half a cup of sugar. That might help us out. But, no, those opposite went for our children. As the father of three children, I am appalled that they have been left with $13½ thousand each. That is $13½ thousand of debt to my three kids, who are completely innocent. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame. It is an absolute disgrace.


But moving on, it is important that we note some of the things they are talking about with country areas. The member for Mallee, my good friend here, knows all about country areas. He grew up in the bush. We keep hearing about Country Labor. It is a shame that the member for Hunter, the shadow agricultural minister, has gone. It is important to note what they did for country areas: they took away their money. In RDA rounds 3 and 4, money should have gone to the member for Parkes and it should have gone to people in Gippsland. What did they do with it? They sent it to Sydney. Sydney is exceptionally important for the bush!


I can tell you that the people in my electorate, the people of Hinkler, are very keen to see the Labor Party come up. The baseball bats are smoking hot still. They remember what happened in the live cattle trade industry. They remember what happened to them. They know they had to go into the paddocks and put their stock down because they had absolutely nowhere to go. What happened to the people of this nation in the bush is an absolute disgrace. It should never have happened and it will never happen again under this government. I am absolutely hopeful that I never live to ever see the people on the opposite side in charge of the Treasury again. They should never be put in charge of the people's Treasury ever again in my living memory. I never want to see it. They have absolutely squandered our inheritance. It is a disgrace.


But this government will get on with this business. The National Stronger Regions Fund will grow the economy and will grow regional economies. We will make sure that we get them over the line, because they are good projects that will produce jobs and jobs for the people in our electorates.

I acknowledge the support that this bill received last night in the other place. The government introduced this bill as we are greatly concerned about the number of appointments that are being missed by job seekers. In 2013-14, job seekers missed 35 per cent of appointments with their employment service providers. That is almost 4½ million appointments that were missed. The measures in this bill are designed to ensure that more job seekers do the right thing the first time and attend their scheduled appointments or pick up the phone ahead of time and reschedule. In addition to ensuring that job seekers remain active and engaged, this bill will see a reduction in costs and red tape for employment services providers.


I note the amendments proposed. The government indicated last night that it would not oppose these amendments. The amendments preserve the substance of the bill by introducing new arrangement and penalties. They will strengthen the job seeker compliance framework and ensure the integrity of the social security system. I thank those who have contributed to the debate on this bill.

We are very pleased to see that the government has seen sense and agreed to our amendments, particularly those amendments that allow job seekers to maintain their right of appeal if they are suspended due to missing their appointments.


We also are particularly pleased that our amendment to exclude job seekers over the age of 55 from job search activities has been agreed to. We do think that the discrimination in the job services market for those people who are over 55 is real and we think the government has got a lot more work to do before we could agree to such a proposal.

Ms COLLINS
 (Franklin) (16:18):  I am very pleased that the government has accepted the amendments that we moved in the Senate. They are 10 amendments to strengthen this legislation and to actually protect vulnerable job seekers. We were very concerned that vulnerable job seekers were again going to be penalised by the government, as we have seen in other pieces of legislation from the government. We are very pleased to see that the government has seen sense and agreed to our amendments, particularly those amendments that allow job seekers to maintain their right of appeal if they are suspended due to missing their appointments.


We also are particularly pleased that our amendment to exclude job seekers over the age of 55 from job search activities has been agreed to. We do think that the discrimination in the job services market for those people who are over 55 is real and we think the government has got a lot more work to do before we could agree to such a proposal. I thank the government for actually considering the amendments and for taking them in the manner in which they were put into the other place. I am pleased to see that this bill be passing.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (19:30):  On this, the 160th anniversary of the Eureka Stockade, it is a pleasure to speak in this adjournment debate. 'It is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called upon to obey, [and] taxation without representation is tyranny.' So began the call of ten thousand Australians for self-determination, one weekend in November 1854. It was the first solid step towards Australian democracy, and the beginnings of a cherished national identity.


The goldfields of 19th century Ballarat were a colourful and varied place. The call of gold had brought the hopeful from across the globe, drawing together such a number of cultures and nations as to make what happened there all the more remarkable. The 10,000 bound themselves under the oath of the Southern Cross to each other, determined that any rights available to one would be reflected upon the others. The charter says: 'It is not the wish of the League to effect an immediate separation of this colony from the parent country, if equal laws and equal rights are dealt out to the whole community …' Less than one month later, on 3 December, this stockade, made of miners, immigrants, men and women, stood together under the flag of the Southern Cross where they were attacked. It took only twenty minutes for troopers to reach the flag and tear it down, leaving 22 diggers dead, along with five troopers. The charter reads: 'We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.'


It was not the end for the Ballarat Reform League. Their struggle for basic human rights and their fight to be free of unjust, uncaring tyranny sparked changes that led to freedoms for all Australians—freedoms we now hold dear, and ideas like the right to a fair go, of personal liberty and a national identity forged around mateship. The charter reads: ' … the Reform League will endeavour to supersede such Royal prerogative by asserting that … the people are the only legitimate source of all political power.'


This significant moment in Australian history is all the more powerful for its selfless reach and universal application. The crowd at Eureka was fuelled by anger, disappointment and fear, and yet their struggle birthed a charter determined to reshape a more equal society for all. The fundamental tenets of the charter called for full and fair representation; suffrage for all men—women would, of course, come later; the eligibility of nonlandowners to hold office; the payment of members of parliament; and a short parliamentary duration. Not only that, the charter itself presents the first serious call for the freedom of the press in Australia's history, making it the first time a real platform for an Australian democracy was laid out.


Today has seen my home town of Ballarat come together to celebrate the anniversary of Eureka, and I am so proud to be able to speak on behalf of the people of Ballarat. Sovereign Hill held its light and sound show, 'Blood on the Southern Cross', in commemoration this morning. A memorial service at the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka saw the raising of a flag hand-stitched by Eureka Stockade descendants, as well as fine speeches by the Hon. Steve Bracks; Mayor of the City of Ballarat John Phillips; and MADE Chairman Kaaren Koomen.


Yet, as a nation, we may be letting the Eureka spirit fade. The anniversary of the stockade is not a date well known by children around the country. It is not even an annual fixture in the schools of Victoria, the site of the gold rush that energised this country for more than 50 years.


It is also not a simple event. Australians died on both sides—fighting for greater rights and fighting for the state. The actions of the colourful protagonists, such as Governor Hotham and rebel leader Peter Lalor are still debated from many angles. Peter Lalor's later election as the member for Ballarat and North Grenville just served to demonstrate the complex nature of the events. We have seen the adoption of the Eureka flag by many causes, both left and right.


But this does not serve to reduce the relevance of what happened, 160 years ago. It should spark a deeper debate, a greater connection to our education, more literate institutions and a greater understanding of our nation and ourselves. The Eureka fight for equality, representation and freedom continues today around the world, and we should be very proud of what Australia has done to contribute to that legacy.


I want to pay particular tribute to the people who keep the Eureka spirit alive—the fantastic Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka; the Children of Eureka, whose idea it was initially to have a copy of the diggers' charter tabled in this place—and I will seek leave to do that shortly; and the families of the descendants of those who were at the stockade. It is groups like these that make sure the legacy of the Eureka stockade lives on.


This legacy is simply stated in the charter's concluding words, that cut right to the heart of why the 160th anniversary is so important: 'Its principles and objects are the full political rights of all people.'


I seek leave to table a copy of the diggers' charter, a larger version of which I will have in my office and which will continue, hopefully, in perpetuity in this place, in all the of members for Ballarat's offices into the future. (Time expired)


Leave granted.

Mr GILES
 (Scullin) (09:30):  I rise to speak about the Victorian state election last Saturday and in particular how it relates to the state electorates contained within the federal electorate of Scullin. Four years ago, the Baillieu government was elected, promising to fix the problems. Clearly, this was a promise which resonated with the Victorian community, concerned about significant quality-of-life issues, particularly in the growth areas which represent much of the electorate of Scullin. But, after that, we saw a state government characterised by inertia and a state government which said one thing before an election and did very different things after it—a familiar concept to those of us in this place.


We also saw the impact of very significant cuts at a state level leading to a range of very serious social consequences, including very high youth unemployment. These have been compounded in the communities I represent by the policies of this federal government—in particular, the refusal to fund urban public transport and a cruel budget opposed by Victorians, particularly those within Scullin, who looked for and found in the Labor Party led by Daniel Andrews a government which will put people first.


I rise to acknowledge the contribution the five Labor candidates and members made in ensuring that Scullin will be adequately represented in this state Labor government. Firstly, Vicki Ward, the new member for Eltham, ran an extraordinary campaign, ably assisted by a fantastic young woman in the form of Clare Keys Lilley. Danielle Green, the member for Yan Yean, was returned despite an enormous investment made by the Liberal Party, including visits from former Prime Minister John Howard—I note the current Prime Minister did not participate in this campaign significantly. My friend Colin Brooks, the member for Bundoora, was comfortably returned. It was very pleasing to see a large swing to Bronwyn Halfpenny, the member for Thomastown, which has significant growth areas and desperately requires infrastructure support it has not been getting. My great friend and former boss Lily D'Ambrosio, the member for Mill Park, was also returned with a very significant swing. 


I look forward to working with all my Labor colleagues. I am so pleased to see Scullin completely represented by Labor members. I am looking forward to seeing the Mernda rail, the O'Herns Road interchange and improvements to buses, schools and our local health services.


I also take this opportunity to give my thanks to the members of the Scullin Labor Party. It is an absolute privilege to work with and for you all. I think, together with our five state Labor members, we can do great things for Melbourne's north under an Andrews Labor government. We look forward to seeing more positive developments in the federal arena: a government that cares about outer suburban communities.

Mr DUTTON
 (Dickson—Minister for Health and Minister for Sport) (10:29):  Later today it will be my sad duty, with the Prime Minister and thousands of Australians, to attend the funeral service of Phillip Hughes. I want to speak on behalf of the government and, I think, all Australian people in saying that his untimely passing at the young age of 25 is a reminder about the life that he led, which was an amazing life. It was full of love from his family, who were supportive in his early formative years—the years that made him into the fine cricketer that he was. It is also a reminder about how fragile life can be—to be lost at the age of 25. He was on the cusp of returning to the Australian cricket team. It said to all of us that it was such an unfair outcome. Our thoughts and prayers, of course, go out to his loving parents, to his two siblings and to the Australian cricket team and all of the support staff in the team, who feel this loss as much as anybody.


I also want to make special mention today of Sean Abbott, who is, again, a fine Australian cricketer, an amazing bowler and a young man with enormous talent, but he feels enormous grief and, no doubt, guilt. But he has the support of not only his team mates but, of course, the nation as well.


On Saturday I was at the under-nine Ferny Hills Cricket Team, where I help to part-time umpire and coach in my youngest son's cricket team. The innocence of watching those young boys wearing their black armbands, talking a lot about the loss of Phillip Hughes, was replicated at cricket clubs of all grades and all levels across the country. To me, it demonstrated the tight-knit community of cricket in this country. It is, of course, part of the Australian fabric. It has been reflected by cricketers of every generation, the names of whom Australians can instantly recall, and Phillip Hughes is amongst that company. Those young cricketers, as they went to the field, had a minute's silence and they remembered an amazing young man.


Phillip Hughes, of course, will be remembered for his great ability on the field, but Michael Clarke's outpouring of emotion, which to me is a demonstration of the great character of Michael Clarke, demonstrates that Phillip was a great man off the pitch as well. I think Michael Clarke has demonstrated the skills and the great capacity that a leader of the Australian cricket team must possess—people like Simpson, Border, Benaud and all of these people that had similar characteristics. Michael Clarke has demonstrated that over the course of the last few days. He has encapsulated the feeling of a nation. He has been able to lead his team through a very difficult time. At the same time, he has been having to deal with his own grief and loss for a person whom he describes as his brother in Phillip Hughes, somebody with whom he obviously had an enormous and heartfelt connection. He will suffer today, and all of us will be reminded during the funeral service about, as I say, the preciousness of life but also the ability of this young man to transform a nation not only on the pitch but off as well.


I want to in particular say thank you very much to Cricket Australia for the support that they have provided to the players within the team but also the broader cricket community, including the support staff as well. These are people that travel together. They are a very tight-knit group of people—the players, the support staff and the team at Cricket Australia. The fact is that they have been very conscious of the emotion which is still raw within the Australian cricket team. To delay the playing schedule is a significant undertaking, but they have done that with a great level of professionalism, and I congratulate James Sutherland and his team for the way in which they have been able to provide that support. They have demonstrated ably how they have been able to accommodate those players by delaying the Brisbane test and rejigging the playing calendar with India across this summer. Full credit to them.


I want to say something about the game of cricket, because the other day I went to a school within my electorate and I spoke to the year 7 groups about parliament, as all of us do from time to time. They ask about your parliamentary role, so they had questions about health, but predominantly they had questions about sport. In particular, they had questions about Phillip and they had questions about whether or not the game should change, whether or not helmets needed to be modified and whether or not there could be particular changes to cricket that need to be made.


In many ways, these things will be discussed at a later time, at a more appropriate time. But I think it is important to put on the record the fact that, by all accounts, this is a one-in-100-year event, a freak accident. Two young cricketers were doing their very best, representing their states and representing their nation. It was a freak accident. Frankly, from the medical advice, it seems that, had that ball landed a millimetre up or down or to the left or right, it would have resulted in a very different outcome. People can have discussions around whether or not you need to have a change in the design of the helmets—all of that. I do not think that is an appropriate discussion for today.


I do say that cricket is a safe sport. It is an amazing sport for young people to be involved in. We see thousands, literally, of Australian kids involved in the MILO program in the junior ranks who go on to have cricket as part of their life forever. I suspect that the Australian team and Phillip Hughes in particular would want the great game of cricket to continue on unimpeded—yes, with sensible changes if they need to be made, but, most importantly, to hold the values and virtues of this great game foremost. I think that is the message that we will see in coming weeks.


I want to say thank you very much to the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others who have contributed to this condolence debate in the other place. I know that their thoughts and wishes and prayers for the family in particular, as I say, would be representative of the messages that thousands of Australians would want to be conveyed. In closing, I want to say thank you to the Australian public for the way in which they have provided an outpouring of grief and of support for the Australian cricket team and for the family in particular. It makes me very proud as the Minister for Sport in this country to see us represented by amazing athletes, not just in cricket but in many sports, on the track, in the pool and on ovals across the country. We are a better country for sport and for having sport as part of our DNA in this country.


We say to young Australians that the life of Phillip Hughes, whilst cut short in his absolute prime, is a demonstration that being involved in sport in our country is in many ways to be fully immersed in Australian life. I think this is an opportunity for us all to celebrate the life of a young man who made an incredible contribution not only to club cricket but to state cricket and obviously to national and international cricket as well. He was a great ambassador. We have seen the fact that different codes and different cricket teams from around the world, who would normally be adversaries on the oval, have come together as one to unite in their grief and to say to the Australian public and to those internationally who are admirers of the game that this is a great game. It is a very important part of our life. It is a part of the formative years of many Australians. We celebrate an amazing life, but we recognise the support of those around him and in particular the grief being felt by the family and by the Australian cricket team, ably led by a great Australian in Michael Clarke.


I want to thank the House very much for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. These issues are always dealt with on a bipartisan basis. As I say, this is an opportunity for us to contribute to what is a sad affair but a celebration of a wonderful life. Thank you very much.

Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (10:39):  I rise to honour the life of Phillip Hughes and send my condolences to his family and friends. Over the past week we have seen an amazing outpouring of grief for a life tragically cut short. We have also seen a celebration of a life lived to the fullest; a life that gave joy to so many; a life that will continue to affect so many for years to come.


Phillip was born in the beautiful New South Wales mid-North Coast town of Macksville in 1988 to parents Greg and Virginia. The son of a banana farmer, Phillip excelled in both cricket and rugby league, but his diminutive stature would always lend itself more to the gentleman's game. After wearing out the arms of Macksville's finest bowlers, Phillip followed in the footsteps of Don Bradman, Brian Booth, Glenn McGrath and so many other great Australian cricketers and made the pilgrimage from the bush to the big smoke in pursuit of the baggy green.


Arriving in Sydney at the age of 17, Phillip joined the Western Suburbs District Cricket Club in Ashfield, scoring 141 not out on debut. The transition from the bush to the city could not have been more seamless, and Sydney's grade scene knew someone special had arrived. As his career progressed Phillip was selected to make his Australian debut against the might of South Africa on 26 February 2009 at new Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Against one of the great bowling attacks in modern cricket, Phillip Hughes was dismissed for a duck in his first test innings. In what was to become a recurring theme throughout his career, Phil fought back after this initial setback and scored his maiden test hundred in the first innings of the second test before adding another hundred in the second innings. In doing so at the age of 20 years and 96 days, he became both the youngest Australian since Doug Walters to score a test century and the youngest player from any country to score a century in both innings of a test match.


Phillip would go on to be dropped four times from the Australian cricket team, and after every setback he went back to shield cricket and piled on the runs. As Australian captain Michael Clarke said of his work ethic and attitude, 'His legacy of trying to improve each and every day will drive us for the rest of our lives.' Phillip's work ethic, determination and sense of humour are traits espoused by all those who knew him—a loved young man with a cheeky grin and a determination to represent his country in the game he loved.


In my remarks today it would be remiss of me not to mention Sean Abbott. Sean is a young man from Sydney's north-west, who played his junior cricket with Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, not far from my electorate, before progressing to the grade cricket ranks with Parramatta and now for his state. My thoughts are with Sean. He deserves our support and indeed the support of the entire community.


The passing of Phillip Hughes has obviously impacted on so many. It reminds us that life is fragile and precious. It makes parents hold their children that extra bit tighter. It reminds us that life is more important, more special and more unpredictable than any game. As Alan Stokes writes in Fairfax media, 'The loss of someone so young cannot fail to strike at any heart.'


On the day Phillip is laid to rest I send my deepest condolences to Greg, Virginia, Megan and Jason Hughes. I cannot imagine the grief you are feeling, but know that Phillip was loved by so many. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Rest well, Phillip.

Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (10:43):  It is always a very sobering occasion when any of us speak in this place on the loss of a great Australian, and sadly we seem to be doing that quite a lot. I cannot claim to be Australia's foremost authority on cricket, but the passing of Phil Hughes is a tragedy that has affected not just the whole of Australia but the whole of the world. As a mother of a 26-year-old son—and Phillip was due to have his 26th birthday on 30 November—I have to say that Phillip's death has rocked me to the core. I cannot imagine the grief that Phillip's parents, Virginia and Greg, and his sister, Megan, and brother, Jason, must be feeling. My heart goes out to them. As a parent you never really expect to outlive your children. From the time that they are born you watch over them, you care about their safety and you fear for their safety. I think perhaps that as mothers we have a tendency to fret about our sons' safety even when they grow into men, as they will always be our little boys. While we as parents worry about them being in a car accident or some other such accident, I do not think anyone could ever have imagined that such fatal harm could occur from a child playing a game that they loved so dearly.


Since I first heard of the news that Phillip had been injured on Tuesday, 25 November, I have discovered a great deal about what an exceptional young man he truly was. He was a young man that any parent would be proud of, that his siblings loved and cherished, that his local community admired, that his team mates respected and that we as a nation should honour. He was a great Australian. At only 25 years of age, he had 26 centuries to his name in first-class cricket. I note that the Australian Captain, Michael Clarke, said that he had no doubt that Phillip would have made 27 centuries last Tuesday and gone on to play 100 tests, such was his determination and skill. 


If anyone ever questioned how deeply cricket is ingrained in the Australian national psyche and how we as a nation have respond Phillip's loss, the episodes of the past week should remove any such doubt. The Melbourne Cup may be the race that stops the nation, but I believe that cricket is in the nation's soul, just like football is in the country of my parents heritage. It is a powerful legacy that is as strong today as it ever was. There are heroes and legends that have defined us from the very first Australian 11 Aboriginal cricket team to tour England in 1868, the first Ashes series in 1882, our Don Bradman, Richie Benaud, the Chappell brothers, Jeff Thomson, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh—to name just a few. I did say that I am not the most foremost authority on cricket, but I do admire and respect these great men, past and present. I have been struck by just how strongly this legacy has been expressed with the 'put out our bat' campaign to mark Phillip's passing. I have been astounded by the huge number of homes and businesses all over the electorate of Brisbane that have cricket bats of all sizes and in all states of repair placed outside them as a mark of respect. They were put there for Phillip. 


Phillip's passing is a tragedy not just for him and his family but also for another wonderful young man, 22-year-old Sean Abbott. I have been incredibly gratified at the level of consideration that has been extended to Sean for the pain and anguish that he must be feeling. I understand that Sean and Phillip had also been team mates in the New South Wales Blues. My heart goes out to Sean, who only recently made his debut in the Australian T21 one-day side. I know that Sean has the sympathy of everyone in the nation. We all hope that one day he will go on to realise his dream, as Phillip did, of wearing the baggy green. 


From everything that I have read about Phillip, he was never one to let a setback keep him down or dampen his spirit. If there is a heaven then I am sure he is there now—another great Australian teaching them how to play cricket.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (10:47):  I rise today to express my condolence to the family of Phil Hughes, to his team mates and to his friends. Later today in Macksville on the New South Wales north coast, he will be farewelled. That is an occasion for which Australia will stop and pause. 



This tragedy has had an enormous impact on Australians. Cricket is our national game. It is a pastime where people, young and old, participate either by playing or by watching. The shock that someone who was so well known to Australians could lose their life so tragically is one that has had a profound impact on the nation. (Quorum formed) 




Mr ALBANESE:
  Phil Hughes was someone who I had the honour of meeting on a number of occasions. He played for Western Suburbs District Cricket Club as his local team, which is based in Pratten Park in my electorate. Phil Hughes was someone who always had time for the youngsters who played cricket there, from Milo cricket up to the district competition. My son was one of those young people who played cricket based at Pratten Park, for Summer Hill Cricket Club. My son was also a left-handed batsman. I think you can tell a lot about someone who is a star—and make no mistake: Phil Hughes was a superstar—by how they approach a young kid who nervously comes up to them and asks for a bit of advice or just to say hello. Phil Hughes gave batting tips to my son. I well recall him giving my son a bat and asking him about his stance and giving him a bit of advice that was gentle, considered and humble. This was a bloke who was a country cricketer based in the relatively small town of Macksville, which will be mourning today. 


Phil Hughes is someone who never got ahead of himself. In spite of his setbacks—four times dropped and then returned to the Australian cricket team; he played 12th man and he spent a lot of time in the dressing room as well as on the field—he never thought that that was not good enough for him. The way that he approached the youngsters, not just my son but the youngsters coming up through the Western Suburbs teams at Ashfield, to me indicated the character of the man. It was absolutely of no surprise to me the impact that his passing has had on Michael Clarke, who has shown extraordinary leadership during this difficult time, and on the rest of his teammates.


Today I also acknowledge the trauma that Sean Abbott must be going through. Sean Abbott was just doing his job as a bowler, and there could have been no expectation of this tragedy. I have seen a lot of cricket over the years. You just do not expect that someone will be seriously hurt, let alone lose their life, when a ball comes down the pitch.


Phillip Hughes was someone you wanted to watch. He is someone you wanted to be in the team because of the quality of his cricket. He is someone who was unorthodox, someone who was not a graceful player like a Mark Waugh or a Greg Chappell. He had an unorthodox technique but he was extraordinarily effective and fantastic to watch, particularly his play through the offside. Memories of his driving and his cuts are something that will remain.


The fact that these statements are being made in the House—and that today he will be honoured by the presence of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others at his farewell—says a lot about the impact that he had during his all-too-short time on this planet. I today express my condolences to his family, to his teammates in the Australian cricket team and the South Australian team, to his former teammates in New South Wales and to the Western Suburbs cricket club in my electorate. He had an enormous impact on all those who watched him but also an enormous impact on all those who had the privilege to meet him.

Ms HENDERSON
 (Corangamite) (10:56):  I consider it an honour to speak in the debate on these statements of condolence on behalf of many people across the Corangamite electorate who have been touched by the untimely death of Phillip Hughes. It really has been incredibly moving to see the tributes over the past week and the cricket bats outside parliament and outside the homes of so many local people in my electorate. I visited one of my good friends Patrice Savage the other day. Her boys love playing cricket, and there was the cricket bat outside her home.


Later today the Macksville community and the cricket family will join together to farewell this inspirational young man. I wish Phillip's family and friends all the very best as they come to grips with what is an utter tragedy at this very, very difficult time. His death has touched not only friends, family, coaches and cricketers, both young and old, but people from all walks of life, all corners of Australia and around the world.


I think perhaps there are a number of reasons why Phillip's death has particularly reverberated so strongly. He was so incredibly young, just days out from his 26th birthday. I think his death is a poignant reminder that one cruel twist of fate is all that it takes to take someone away that we hold so dear in such an instant. There are so many people across Australia who love their sport and who love their cricket, and we watch and admire cricketers across the nation, as we have for many years, with such a degree of emotion. We watch the successes and the failures, and there is a very deep connection with the emotions of the players. I think it has been particularly difficult to watch Phillip's teammates come to terms with his passing without deeply feeling that loss ourselves.


Phillip Hughes was capable of playing world-beating cricket. He made two test centuries against South Africa and one against Sri Lanka, as well as two one-day international centuries, also against Sri Lanka. And who could forget his memorable partnership with Ashton Agar in England in July last year. Ashton Agar stole the show that day with a score of 98 on debut—an incredible effort—but it would not have been possible without the leadership and the level-head of Phillip Hughes, who finished the innings unbeaten on 81. In first-class cricket Phillip maintained an average of 46.51, with 26 tons and 46 fifties. Australians love an underdog, and there would have been few things sweeter than to see this young man make his return to the test team.


The first test of the summer, against India, was due to start tomorrow. But for a few millimetres, Phillip Hughes might have had his chance to finally cement himself in the national team. That we will no longer see him strapping on the pads and striding to the crease is a very sombre thought. 


At this point I want to reflect on the words of Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who said a number of days ago:


People are not supposed to die playing our national game. Sport is supposed to engender pride, not grief.


To Phillip's family, to his friends and to cricketers young and old, this is a very, very sad loss for our nation and a loss that has reverberated around the world. Rest in peace, Phillip Hughes—63 not out forever.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (11:00):  Today will be a very sad day for many Australians as we commemorate the life and the tragic death of cricketer Phillip Hughes. Phillip Hughes was not a soldier who died in service for his country nor was he a hero who died trying to save others, but his death has greatly affected our nation and touched something within many, many Australians. It is appropriate that we acknowledge this grief in this chamber. 


All loss of life is tragic. Family and friends will mourn the loss of loved ones deeply, regardless of whether the nation and the media spotlight accompanies them. But in this case the Australian public, and particularly the Australian cricketing community, are in mourning with Phil Hughes's family, friends and teammates because we feel a shared loss. The public loss of such an enormous talent and such enormous potential feels especially bitter to us all. We all know how much more Phillip Hughes had to offer Australian cricket. 


It will be small consolation for his family and friends, but Phillip Hughes will long live on in Australian cricketing folklore. Like Archie Jackson, another cricketing prodigy—who died of tuberculosis at just 23 years of age 80 years ago and who still lives on in the imagination of the cricket obsessed 10-year-olds across our country—Phillip Hughes will hold a special place in Australia's collective cricketing memory. I will tell my children how, at just 20 years of age, Hughes scored centuries in both innings of just his second test match in South Africa—becoming the youngest player in history to achieve this feat—punching the South African pace attack through the offside again and again. I will tell them how I sat glued to the television throughout the night watching Hughes and another brilliant young Australian cricketer—Ashton Agar—compile a world-record last-wicket stand of 163 runs, with Hughes giving Ashton Agar every opportunity to score a century on debut, which would have been magical for a number 11, and falling just two runs short. It was truly one of the most extraordinary cricketing partnerships I have ever seen. 


And I will tell my children that if Hughes had lived long enough to receive another act, another chance as a test cricketer, he would have surely followed in the footsteps of other brilliant young talents like Steve Waugh, Matthew Hayden and Damien Martin, who came back from periods outside the test team to achieve even greater feats in the baggy green. 



The fact that this public loss of Phillip Hughes—and the loss of his great potential and talent—occurred in the most prosaic circumstances, while he was doing something that so many thousands of cricket-playing Australians have done many times over, makes it that much more personally affecting for us all. The way in which the 'put out your bats' phenomenon has taken hold in the days following his death is a testament to this feeling of shared loss in the Australian community. Since Sydney father Paul Taylor placed his cricket bat at his front door and tweeted the image in Hughes's honour, thousands of Australians and sports lovers from all around the world have joined in in this act of respect to demonstrate their appreciation for Phillip Hughes in a tangible way. As Taylor explained: We've all played cricket in one way or another …We've all grown up with a bat and ball. This is our way to connect and show our sadness.'


We find our sense of community as Australians both when we want to celebrate and when we need to mourn, and in this way it is pleasing to see how the Australian cricketing community has embraced Sean Abbott, the bowler who had the pure bad luck to have delivered the fateful ball. We all know that Sean Abbott bears no responsibility for what has occurred, but we also know that he will be suffering more than we can imagine at this point, wondering the little things that he may have changed on the day. Our thoughts are with him at this time. He bears no responsibility and he has our this full support.


I also want to note the way that the Australian cricket captain, Michael Clarke, and Cricket Australia have managed this extraordinarily traumatic event. The deferral of the first test match showed appropriate consideration for the welfare of the Australian players dealing with the loss of a friend and work colleague. The decision to adjust Phillip Hughes's final scorecard to record him as being 63 not out forevermore is an especially apt, symbolic gesture. Symbols matter at times like this, and that little asterisk beside his name will be a potent symbol and a reminder for the generations of cricketing Australians to come of what the Australian cricket community has lost in the tragic death of Phillip Hughes.

Mr PASIN
 (Barker) (11:05):  I rise to speak in condolence at this very sad time. Today will mark the funeral of Phil Hughes, and many in this place will take the opportunity to reflect on his contribution. When he made his debut for his country in February 2009, there had only been 408 Australians—privileged, nay, talented Australians—who had had the privilege of donning the baggy green cap. As we heard from the previous speaker, almost every Australian boy—and, increasingly, Australian girl—grows up playing cricket, aspiring to one day wear the baggy green. I can tell you that I was such a young man. I spent much of my youth juggling my responsibilities scholastically with a love of cricket and the game. I shared that love with my brother, who was 11 years older than me, and I was privileged enough to play cricket at a reasonably senior level. Unlike Phillip Hughes, who had the talent to play for his country, I did not, but it is the fact that he was playing our national game when he was taken from us which I think has caused his plight to resonate so deeply with the Australian psyche.


A life well lived can be measured in years or it can be measured in quality, and I think it is important to note at this time that a life well lived is indeed a ripe old age. If one lives their life well and to the fullest, one can take solace in the fact that they have lived to a ripe old age, even if they are taken far too soon as Phillip Hughes was. We heard from the Prime Minister earlier this week. He said—and I will repeat his words—that Phillip Hughes's death 'has so affected people because it happened in the midst of life, at its most exuberant'.


This was a man who had played for his country, whose unconventional technique had made him both a local hero and someone that the ordinary Australian could relate so clearly to. He had gotten on top of his technical difficulties and was returning to the field and, quite frankly, was slated to play for Australia and to continue his test career. We could sit here and speak about his statistical record, his 26 tests and his 25 one-day internationals, but this story now speaks a lot larger than that. His passing reminds us that life is both precious and fragile. I, like the previous speaker, have held in my thoughts ever since last Thursday Sean Abbott, who did nothing more than play the game we love and play it as hard as Phil Hughes would have wanted.


It is important that he be marked as 63 not out. Symbols really do matter. I am pleased to see that across our nation we have seen the phenomenon of 'putting your bats out'. I am pleased to report that amateur cricket in my electorate of Barker continued on the weekend. Not only did players don black armbands, but they all paused to reflect on the tragic loss of Phil Hughes.


We have all had opportunity to understand more of the Phil Hughes story since his tragic passing. I noted with some interest that he was a country lad. He shares that with me. He had a great love of cattle, and stud cattle in particular. Like Phil Hughes, I hope one day to leave this place and retire to a farming property. Like me, Phillip has Italian heritage, in his case through his mother, Virginia.


I know something about loss. Whilst my sympathies are with Phillip's mother, Virginia, and his father, Greg, I cannot pretend to know their pain. What I do know acutely is the pain that Jason and Megan, his siblings, are sharing right now. I know it because I have lived it. I say to them: you will never forget—as this nation will never forget—the contribution your brother has made, but you personally will never forget him. You wake up most mornings thinking of him. From time to time during the day you will think, 'What would Phil do in this situation?' From time to time you will think, 'How would Phil have coped with this?' The reality is that you never recover from a loss of this nature. You learn to live with it but you will not recover from it.


Not only have cricket clubs throughout my electorate reflected and acknowledged this sad passing, my own cricket club, the South Gambier Cricket Club, which I maintain membership of, was very keen to acknowledge the passing of Phil Hughes. I spoke to a number of players before they took the field on Saturday and remarked to many of them, many of whom I have played cricket with for a decade, that was has shocked them is the fact that we play our national sport and play it hard, but none of us ever thinks that will be the last act in the drama of life. I think that is why this event has so shocked the Australian psyche.


Phil was a great cricketer. He was a great Australian. Much more importantly than that, he was the best of people taken at his most exuberant, as the Prime Minister described it. Vale Phil Hughes. My sympathies go to his family. My sympathies go to his team-mates. I am grateful that, as a nation, we have acknowledged his passing in the most appropriate of ways. We probably will not see his equal again. He was an unconventional batsman who had a raw talent who has been taken from us far too soon. As a nation, we have been robbed of his talents. To his family and his team-mates I send my deepest condolences. May he rest in peace. May he enjoy cricket for the rest of his days in that oval in the sky, and join other Australian and international greats playing the game they love for all eternity.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (11:13):  I rise today, like so many in this place, to pay my respects and speak on the condolence motion for Phillip Joel Hughes, an outstanding cricketer taken far too soon doing what he loved best. Phillip was born on 30 November 1988 in the small New South Wales town of Macksville. Today in Macksville the funeral and memorial will be held for this very young man, aged just 25 years.


Phillip started playing cricket as a junior in Macksville, where his undoubted talent quickly shone through. At the age of 17 he moved to Sydney to play for Western Suburbs District Cricket Club, having in front of him a most brilliant career. Phillip played two seasons with New South Wales in first-class cricket before making his test debut for Australia in 2009 against South Africa, at the age of only 20. He was the 408th person to play test cricket for Australia. It was an illustrious achievement in his career to have been the 408th cap in what is such a  special and small club.


In just his second test match, at the age of 20, he scored a century in the first innings before scoring a further century in the second innings, making him the youngest test cricketer in history to score a century in both innings of a test match. Phillip played 26 test matches during his career and scored 1,535 runs with a batting average of 32.66—a great achievement. He also played 25 one-day international matches for Australia and scored 826 runs with a batting average of 35.91. He was the first Australian batsman in the history of one-day international cricket to score a hundred on debut. 


But all the numbers and all the great achievements never tell the full story. Like all players, Phillip went through some peaks and some troughs—as we all do in life and through our careers—and experienced good and bad times. Those who knew him well have noted the remarkable way that he dealt with those inevitable setbacks and maintained his dignity and his friendships and built a fantastic career at such an early age. His determination to work harder and improve, because he loved playing for his country and had more to offer the game, is a tribute to his attitude as a professional sportsperson and character as a human being. 


Last week, while playing for South Australia against New South Wales, he compiled 63 runs and was undoubtedly reminding the nation and the national selectors of his talent. What happened next was as unexpected as it was tragic and sad. On Thursday, 27 November 2004, Phillip passed away as a result of the injuries that he suffered from being struck by a cricket ball. There is no doubt that Phillip's injury and death has struck a very deep chord in all of us in this parliament, in his home town, in cricket, in Australia and much, much further. Right across the world, it seems to have struck a chord in terms of who Phillip was but also in the tragic way that life can be taken from us in the most unexpected of circumstances—in a game that is not meant to have an element of danger that would result in somebody losing their life, or as we go about our daily business, doing what we do best, working, playing, living our lives and not really contemplating that at any moment somebody could be taken away from us. What we have seen is this outpouring of tributes, not just from close friends and team mates but from ordinary Australians who would not have known Phillip Hughes apart from seeing him on the television but who really felt this connection—some affinity, some loss within themselves—which is why they are grieving as well as his family.


Over the weekend, local cricketers paid tribute to Phillip in many different ways and ordinary people put out their bats to honour his memory. Today, also, I am thinking of Sean Abbott—many other people who I know are thinking of Sean Abbott—a young man who has done nothing wrong and, simply by bowling a cricket ball, has been caught up in this tragedy. 


At the end of all the tributes about his career on the pitch, Phillip was a son, a brother and, in many respects, an ordinary person like the rest of us, albeit an extraordinary one. Having recently experienced loss myself, like so many people in this House, you know that all of those things cannot possible replace the loss that you feel. I know that today his family and his closest friends will be confronting their deepest fears about that loss—his parents, brother, sister, friends and everybody. I extend my deepest sympathies, particularly to his parents, Greg and Virginia, and siblings, Megan and Jason—to know the difficulty they will be facing. There is no doubt that Phillip will remain in the memory of all Australians, No. 408, forever 63 not out. May he rest in peace.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (11:19):  The outpouring of grief across Australia, and indeed across the globe, as many members have said, is quite remarkable—everyone is paying their respects to an inspirational young man who touched the lives not just of people in our nation but across the globe. So I rise today to speak on behalf of the people of Solomon. 


Phillip was deeply respected by Territorians, as he was nationally and internationally. Territorians remember him with great fondness. It is no secret that Territorians love their sport, and cricket, along with AFL, is one of the sports that we love the most. The Territory was honoured to host Phillip Hughes, and many children were able to learn from his spectacular cricket skills earlier this year, when he visited my electorate to announce the upgrades to Northline Oval that enabled us to host the quadrangular one-day series in Darwin and Palmerston. That meant that we were able to host players of the calibre of Phillip Hughes.


As many have said in this place, Phillip Hughes was an outstanding cricketer and, by all accounts, an outstanding person—and there have been lots of media stories about what an outstanding young man he was, not just on the cricket field but in his personal life. He will be forever remembered as a national hero because he made Australians proud, not just because of his ability as a fantastic sportsman but because of the way that he conducted himself in his life. He will be remembered not for how he died but for how he played Australia's favourite game.


I want to share with the House from the NT News Facebook site. A lot of constituents have shared their thoughts. Camilla Snelson said that she is really looking forward to the fact that she can share in today's funeral and be able to watch it. People are pleased that all the media outlets have worked together to enable the country to come together. John White said:


R.I.P. mate. My thought's go out to your family, friend's, colleague's and to Sean Abbott.


Leanne Kossack said:


RIP mate and Godbless your family and friends.


Jodie Corbett said:


God bless those you left behind mate. Especially your mum


Andrew Douglas said:


""Spare a thought for the people of Macksville and the Nambucca Valley today. They are beautiful, salt of the earth human beings.""


Tim Gilbert from the Today Show indicated that this morning. I think that it is really important that we as a country acknowledge and think about not just Phillip's family and friends but his teammates and, indeed, his very close-knit small community.


I would like to finish by saying that Phillip Hughes, as I said, was an outstanding cricketer and an outstanding Australian. I would like to say to Sean Abbott: our prayers and thoughts are with you as well. The nation stands behind you. We hope that you will be able to resume your life as a cricketer. No-one holds you responsible. It will be a tough day for you as well. To Greg, Virginia, Jason and Megan, I hope you all find comfort in knowing that our nation mourns with you. Phillip's short life was lived so well. May he rest in peace.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Opposition Whip) (11:24):  I rise to speak in this debate as a cricket tragic, as somebody who grew up in Macksville and attended the same schools in Macksville as Phillip Hughes—he attended the Macksville Public School and the Macksville High School—and as a person whose family still lives in the Nambucca Valley.


I remember the first test that Phillip Hughes starred in. At that particular time, I was visiting my mother. We talked about how wonderful it was to have somebody from Macksville, from the area that she lived in and the area that my sister and her sons live in, starring on the world stage in cricket. The pride that the people in the Nambucca Valley had in the achievements of Phillip Hughes was enormous. My nephews used to talk to me about how they would go up to Macksville and go to the pub up there; how they would all stand there and have drinks with Phillip, and he was still the same guy that he had been in the past; and how committed he was to that local community.


I know how that community are hurting. I know how they will feel. I know how devastated they are by the loss of one of their favourite sons, somebody who has achieved at the absolute highest level of cricket and somebody who was on the doorstep of coming back into the Australian cricket team. He will always have that very special place within the community of Macksville and the Nambucca Valley. He will be one of the heroes of that area. He will become a legend. He will be talked about for decades to come, centuries to come, as he will within the history of cricket.


I will not go through his achievements. I know there have been many, many people that have stood up and talked about his fantastic double century, his achievements in the Sheffield Shield, his achievements in county cricket, his achievements in one-day cricket—his achievements in all levels of cricket. But the one thing that I really want noted in this House is how important he has been in the psyche and the history of that little town that people are gathering in today, a little town of just over 2,000 people, which will really swell today; how people will gather in that school hall at Macksville High School; and the enormous sadness that will pervade that town. I think I read that the shops will be closing their doors this afternoon. That is a true Macksville tradition. That is a community getting behind somebody that is very special to them.


In addition to expressing my sympathy for the town, I would like to express my sympathy for Phillip's family. They would really be hurting today, as will his fellow cricketers. To see their son starring, to see their son achieving, to see their son so vital, to see their son so full of life, to be just a few days short of his birthday—one minute he is this vibrant young man who is achieving at the highest level, and the next minute his life is taken from him. What that does is show us just what a precious gift of life is—how each and every one of us can end up just like Phillip Hughes.


But the thing that is so special about Phillip is that he really epitomises what Australians look to when they look to their sporting heroes. He really has done so much not only for cricket but for young people, going along and coaching when he was not playing, and telling young people always to 'go for your best shot'. I suspect that that is what Philip was doing when that ball hit him—going for his best shot—and that bouncer came up and caught him unaware.


It is interesting that there have only been a hundred such deaths before, and two of those have been in cricket. I know that Cricket Australia and cricket worldwide are looking at the helmets. That is a good move.


Sometimes there are things that you just cannot account for. Sometimes things just happen. This is one of those events. This is an accident that nobody can be blamed for and one that will pull the cricketing community closer. Sixty-three not out—that is fantastic—and the retirement of his shirt are all great tributes to Phillip.


Of course there is Sean Abbott—a young man whose cricket was blossoming and for whom the tragedy is amplified over and over. One the one hand, he could have been hit for six but, on this occasion, the ball just bounced the wrong way. My thoughts are with Sean Abbott. I hope that he continues to strive in his cricketing career. I know that Phillip Hughes and the other members of the Australian team would want him to. 


Phillip's colleagues in Australian cricket will be doing it tough today as will his parents and family. This is a time to remember his family, friends, the cricketing fraternity, and the community of Macksville and the Nambucca Valley.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (11:31):  I rise to lend my voice to the millions who have grieved since the tragic death of Phillip Hughes. We all feel the loss of a life cut short. There is no rationalising this event. This was a terrible accident. For this brilliant and talented young man to have been taken from his us in the midst of playing our national sport seems unimaginable.


Phil Hughes was born in Macksville New South Wales to Greg and Virginia. He grew up with a love of sport and excelled at a young age. His passion and skill led him, on the cusp of his 19th birthday, to become the youngest New South Wales debutant since Michael Clarke in 1999. 


In 2008, Hughes was rewarded for his achievements by winning the New South Wales Rising Star Award. And following his wondrous debut to competitive cricket, Phil Hughes became only the 408th man to be given the honour of pulling on the baggy green cap and playing test cricket for his country. His achievements did not end there as he went on to become the youngest cricketer in history to score centuries in both innings of a test match.


I have been deeply moved to witness the national and indeed international response to this event. Sport has forever been our unifying factor, and this has been made evident in our reaction. Families have joined together to honour Phil by placing cricket bats outside their front doors and tributes have been left at local cricket clubs.


Today we as a nation will come together to support Phillip's family and community. We will take an hour from our day and celebrate Phillip's life.


Phil will be unquestionably remembered for his cricketing prowess and his love of the game, but the words of his teammates, friends and family over the past week have revealed a much admired and loved young man. Every image shown has seen him smiling. This is how we should remember him—for how he lived, loved and played.


Cricket is more than a sport. The term 'cricket' is the embodiment of fairness, sportsmanship, accepting the umpire's decision, the bravery to face a fast ball, and the bravery to choose to hook. What happened to Phil was not fair. Phil will remain in our hearts indelibly. Phillip will remain in the very soul of cricket as long as it is played.

Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (11:34):  On behalf of the people of Kingsford Smith, I wish to pay tribute to Phillip Hughes who passed away tragically on 27 November. The Australian summer is defined by three things: the beach, the barbecue and cricket. It is part of Australian culture. In summer, our kids' heroes are those who wear the baggy green. Phil Hughes was Australian hero No. 408. He was characteristic of a true Australian opening batsman—unassuming, small in stature but big in heart, with a fierce determination to score runs for his country. And score runs he did. In his second test, he scored a century, at the age of 20—115 against South Africa in Durban. In the second innings of that test, he scored 160 and became the youngest cricketer in history to score centuries in both innings of a test match. In 2013 he made a century on debut in his first one-day international game, against Sri Lanka. Like many of Australia's great batsmen, Hughes battled for his place in the Australian side. He was dropped four times, but he showed characteristic guts and determination to make his way back into the team. On 27 November this year, on 63, he was on his way to a century and what many believe would have been another test call-up.


Hughes was the quintessential Aussie cricketer. Born in Macksville on the North Coast of New South Wales, he was also a very good rugby league player and played beside none other than Greg Inglis. Greg Inglis last week, in The Courier-Mail, recalled the boy who would get up the noses of his opponents and mates when nobody could get him out in a cricket match. Greg Inglis said that Phil Hughes was always destined to play for Australia. He played A grade in the local competition at the age of 12. At 17 he came to Sydney and began grade cricket with the Western Suburbs club. In 2007 he was selected for the under-19 Australian World Cup squad. In 2007-08 he was selected to play for New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield. Like many Australian cricketers, he also did a stint in England, in county cricket, playing for Middlesex, Hampshire and Worcestershire. Towards the end of his career, he was paying Sheffield Shield cricket for South Australia. Phil Hughes played 26 tests for Australia and scored 1,535 runs, with an average of 32.65.


The outpouring of grief and sorrow that we have seen throughout Australia, from not only his team mates, friends and family but also the Australian public, has been remarkable and is testament to the high regard in which he was held and his tenacity and spirit for the game of cricket. David Warner, a constituent of Kingsford Smith, was one of Phillip's greatest mates and sat beside Phil as he was taken from the SCG on a medicab and later to St Vincent's Hospital. His feelings are reflected in the sorrow that people in the community of Kingsford Smith are feeling at the moment. 


Phil Hughes represents our love of cricket and our love of cricketers. Our thoughts and prayers are with his team mates, in particular Sean Abbott. On behalf of the people of Kingsford Smith, I say to Sean Abbott: know that you are not at all at fault in respect of this tragic accident; know that you have the support and encouragement of the nation; and know that we hope that you play on in your cricketing career.


Finally I would like to pay tribute to the cricketing community in Kingsford Smith—to the players, the family and friends, the officials and the fans who have given touching tributes to Phil Hughes and his family. I am deeply proud to represent the sentiments of our community in this place.


In conclusion, I think Richie Benaud summed up perfectly the feelings of the nation when he said last week: 'A boy just beginning, 25 years of age, baggy green No. 408. His father's best mate. Son, brother, fighter, friend, inspiration. Phillip Hughes, forever rest in peace, son.' I offer my condolences to Phillip Hughes's family.

 (Swan) (11:40):  I too rise to support the Prime Minister's motion that the House records its regret for the tragic loss of Phillip Hughes, one of Australia's elite sportsmen and, in the words of Australia's national cricket captain, Michael Clarke, 'one of its great blokes'. On behalf of the electorate of Swan in Western Australia, where there are many cricket clubs—particularly South Perth Cricket Club, which is one of the biggest junior cricketing clubs in Australia—I express our deep sorrow that Australia has lost one of its cricket players, one of its cricket team, one of the nation's heroes who wore the baggy green with such pride. He could only inspire you as he plied his trade when he went out onto the grounds and played his heart out not only for himself but for his team mates and for his nation.


The day of 27 November 2014 will go down in history as a dark day for cricket and for sport, and for Australia. It is the day that our nation last an amazing talent; but, first and foremost, it is the day that Phillip Hughes's family lost a son and a brother, and his friends lost an irreplaceable mate. While Hughes's family and friends, his team mates and members of the community, both in Australia and internationally, mourn this tragic loss of life, we hope that some of this grief may be lifted by knowing that we lost this young man while he was playing the sport that he loved. We do not expect such tragedies to occur in sport, particularly not in a game that brings friends, communities and nations together, recognising players' hard work, their dedication and their ability to achieve what many of us can only dream about.


As I said, sport, particularly cricket, which is our national sport, has the ability to bring people together from all walks of life. In some of the citizenship ceremonies I go to where people becoming Australian citizens are from other cricketing nations, I always emphasise to them that the true test of their citizenship will be that they now support the Australian cricket team. It is a sport that people just love. You can talk about the statistics. You can look at all the different shots that go through. Unfortunately, most players, even after a test century, always remember the shot that gets them out, not the shots that got them their test century. There is so much variety and there are so many aspects to that sport that people can talk about for hours in the pub and enjoy it and relive those moments and look at the statistics and the history of that sport. It has such a great ability to bring people together in the community.


On the weekend, I joined some mates of mine to recognise the 30-year anniversary of the formation of the Floreat Aquatic Recreation Cricket Club. Since its inception, the club has lost three members: Ray Bully Smith, to cancer at an early age; Ian 'Jughead' Jones, to a heart attack last year; and Ken Screech, recently, to cancer as well. In each instance, when these members have passed away, the club has rallied, coming together to remember and celebrate their lives. On a much grander scale, across the nation, that is what we are seeing with the loss of Phil Hughes to our sport, our cricket team and our ability to cheer him on as he plied his trade, making runs for his beloved country. 


The three members of the Floreat cricket club that I mentioned who have passed away will be remembered by the club in the same way that Phil Hughes will be remembered by our nation—but certainly not for their cricketing ability, as Phil Hughes will be remembered for his. They were in no way in the same class as Phil. They were prime examples, though, of mateship, fun and piss-taking that sport and particularly cricket instigates in our nation. Sport is known for its camaraderie. The mateship that we have all seen displayed by Hughes's teammates could only be described as uplifting, during such a time of tragedy. All Australian cricket players, both nationally and in state teams, have joined together to pay tribute to and to honour a man who left this world far too early. These tributes have also been reflected all over the world, including from our head of state, the Queen—which is a true testament to the life he led.


I take this time to commend Cricket Australia for their recognition that this is a tough time for their players, and for the immediate steps they took to ensure that all players had access to grief counselling. I would also commend their rescheduling of the test series, to give players the time they need to grieve. I commend Australia's cricket captain, Michael Clarke, for the leadership he has shown to players; for the support he has given to Hughes's family; and for the respect he conveyed to his teammate and—in his words—his brother, in his own personal tribute to Hughes on what would have been his 26th birthday, last Sunday. As Michael Clarke said, his cricketing achievements, of which there were many, really play second fiddle to the human qualities that he exhibited—loyal to a fault, eternally optimistic and kind-hearted, with a wicked sense of humour and a childlike verve for life. It is for these qualities that he will forever be remembered by his friends and family. But I am sure he would be happy to have his on-field achievements recognised too, and we have heard many of those from other members here today, including his three centuries, seven half-centuries, and his total of 1,535 test runs in 26 tests.

Mr IRONS:
  While I have made reference to the cricketing world, it is of course the Hughes family who have suffered the most since that fateful day on 25 November when Phillip was felled by a bouncer at the Sydney Cricket Ground. When a parent is forced to carry the burden of burying their child, it is as though the world has been turned upside down. Thankfully this remains the exception rather than the rule in our society, but for those who are struck by such tragedy life can never be the same. Time may help, but a parent can never truly heal from such a heartbreak. I take this moment to pay my respects to the Hughes family—Greg, Virginia, Jason and Megan—whose world, within a few moments, collapsed around them. It is my hope that knowing every Australian is thinking of you brings you some comfort at this time.


Lastly I would also like to pay tribute to Sean Abbott. Although I, along with all of those members who have spoken before me, cannot begin to imagine what he is feeling, our thoughts are also with him. The death of Phillip Hughes was both a tragic and extraordinary circumstance which has shaken the sporting world. While we remember Hughes for his talent on the field, we also pay tribute to the man he was off the field. With his love of the game and quick wit echoed by each of his teammates over the past week, I am sure he will be looking down on his friends and family and forever making the claim that he is still not out—a sentiment that I am sure every Australian would be happy to applaud.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:53):  I too join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and other members in extending my condolences to Phillip Hughes's family. Last weekend was the annual parliamentary versus press gallery cricket match. Like cricket fixtures all around the country—including my grandson's under-9s game in Campbelltown—we started with a minute's silence, and everyone played with black armbands.


The tragic death of Phil Hughes has seen one of the greatest outpourings of grief. It is not just among those of us who are cricketing enthusiasts; it is throughout our nation. Indeed, we are seeing it across the globe. Phil Hughes died as result of a very freakish cricketing accident in a Sheffield Shield match last week, when he was struck on the neck from a bouncer delivered by a pace bowler. Cricket, like most sports at the elite level, certainly has a high degree of risk and implicit dangers. It is why we celebrate our champions who excel at that level of the game.


The fact is that, quite frankly, players are regularly injured as a result of being struck by the ball. Miraculously, only a handful of players and now one umpire have been killed by a cricket ball in the game's long history. Given the nature of this accident—and I note the comments of other members—we should not forget about the dreadful impact that this has had on the bowler, Sean Abbott, who, it must be stressed, has done nothing wrong. He bowled a bouncer at a well-positioned opening batsman, who was well set in his innings having already scored 63. It has been the practice throughout the game that fast bowlers try to disrupt a batsman's thoughts by forcing him to play a shot that he was not planning to make. We can only hope that, not before too long, Sean is able to recover his composure and take his place in the New South Wales squad and to hopefully continue on his quest to be included in the Australian team. 


Phil Hughes is the first test player to suffer this fate, although there have been several near misses. In 1975, New Zealander's medium pacer Edwin Chatfield was struck in the temple, and his heart stopped. Fortunately, he recovered and went on to play another 42 tests. Phil Hughes, as everyone has already indicated, was a very talented sportsman right from childhood. He was a most talented batsman and set records right from the start. He made his debut as a test player at age 20. He was awarded the baggy green, No. 408, when Australia played against South Africa, in Durban, in 2009. He set a record on his debut, scoring centuries in both innings. That is a pretty significant achievement for a 20-year-old. As so often happens with cricket players and those of other sports, Phil showed himself in and out of form, but his more recent successes in first-class cricket, his batting in the Sheffield Shield side for South Australia, saw him widely spoken about to be recalled to the test team. He was clearly a very talented young sportsperson. 


That Phil was taken out like that at age 25 is just beyond belief. As the former speaker, the member for Swan, indicated, it certainly goes against the grain from any parent's perspective to have to bury your child. That is not the way life in our society normally works, regardless of whether or not you are a sports hero. For a father, for a mother, it is almost beyond belief. 


As everyone has already indicated, Phil Hughes was one of those really likeable larrikins. He was well admired amongst his team players and he did a lot of work in the community. When he was in the New South Wales squad, he used to spend a lot of time with schoolkids, helping to teach them the finer points of the game. He was one of those youngsters who knew that he was on the way up but who wanted to take a very clear role in giving back by encouraging others to follow him. 


I would also like to mention the Australian captain, Michael Clarke. He has shown considerable maturity in the way in which he has conducted himself, not only in the way he has reflected the feelings of his team at this very sad time but also in the way he has channelled the grief of our nation. For me, Michael Clarke has shone like a beacon, with his long bedside vigil—he hardly left Phil Hughes's side for the two days that he was in hospital—and the dignity and the compassion that he displayed in delivering the final announcement of Phil Hughes's death.


For the Hughes family, I offer the condolences of my community. May Phil Hughes rest in peace.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo—Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development) (12:00):  I wanted to make a short contribution to this debate. It has been a terribly sad week, since last Tuesday when we all saw the horrific incident which took Phillip Hughes's life. In saying 'the horrific incident', it was an incident which happens quite regularly on the cricket field. In fact, I got hit about five centimetres away from that same spot in my last game of district cricket, which broke my jaw. I think it brought home just how lucky we are—every day, in a lot of ways—and just how terribly unlucky Phillip Hughes was for that one spot in his head to have been hit and for it to have taken his life.


He was an outstanding cricketer who was progressing to become, I think, an even better cricketer. I think, probably because of the focus on AFL and the physical nature of AFL football, we look at people playing that game, and when they get to 25 or 26 they are getting to the mid-to-later part of their career. Cricketers, I think, often get a lot better as they get older. And I think with Phillip Hughes you were seeing a maturity develop with his batting and his cricket, which would have meant he would have contributed much more significantly in the future. In saying that, he was an outstanding junior cricketer. Anyone who plays under 19's for their country is an outstanding junior cricketer. He travelled from country New South Wales to the Western Suburbs District Cricket Club in Sydney to pursue his dream. I went from Mildura to Adelaide to play cricket with Glenelg to pursue a dream; he was far better than I was. It is a trip that many young Australians take, particularly those from regional areas.


Cricket is a game which was invented in heaven and will be played in heaven even better now, with Phillip Hughes as part of the starting 11. His death, I think, has shown how important cricket is to our culture. The reaction in the last week, with a simple tweet from a man in Sydney about putting out your bats and the reaction that got, was quite extraordinary. It is a game that pretty much everyone in our country plays at some point in their life, whether it be seriously and to the level of wanting to play for Australia or whether it be on Christmas Day in a backyard. Pretty much everyone has picked up a cricket bat and played a version of the game. It touches our lives enormously.


I think what you saw last week, and what we will see today, is that sport is more than just a recreation. It is a community builder; it brings people together. We can all share in the grief because whether you knew him well, whether you were as close to him as Michael Clarke, or whether you were just an admirer or someone who knows about the importance of the game, it has brought everyone to this grief that we all share. 


I share the sentiments of all the members who have talked about Sean Abbott. Of course, we feel for what that young man is going through as well, and we hope that he is able to find peace and recover.


Michael Clarke, I think, has shown absolutely outstanding leadership in the last week, not just with the bedside vigil that the member for Werriwa mentioned but with the statement he made on Saturday morning, which was one of the most brutal things I have ever seen on live television; it was horrific. That moment, I think, encapsulated the grief that we all share as a community, and he deserves as much credit as he is rightly getting.


It has been a very sad occasion. Cricket will go on and life will go on, but it will not be the same. We have lost a very bright young man—a very talented young man—and it is a reminder of just how precious life is. Rest in peace, Phillip Hughes.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (12:05):  Phillip Hughes played 26 test matches, made 26 first-class centuries and died just days before his 26th birthday, following a freak accident while playing for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales last week. Phillip Hughes's death was the result of terrible luck. The injury that he suffered was an incredibly rare one, with only a hundred cases having been identified in the medical literature and only one previously in a cricket match. Phillip Hughes is not the only one suffering from this bad luck. Sean Abbott, who bowled the bouncer that struck Hughes, was simply doing his job as a fast bowler, providing a gripping contest between the speed and aggression of bowler and the bravery and skill of batsman.


Luck, good or bad, plays a greater role in our lives than we would often like to admit. This is no less true of cricket, the game that is often claimed to be a metaphor for life. In their analysis of cricketer performances, economists Shekhar Aiyar and Rodney Ramcharan look at debuts. They look at players whose test debut was at home and those whose test debut was overseas. It is a stroke of luck where you debut, but they find that the challenges are quite different. So an Indian batsman who debuts at home expects the cracks that emerge on Indian pitches in the later days of a test match but might not be prepared for Australia's bouncier wickets. It turns out that, if you debut at home, you score one third more runs and, over your career, one fifth more runs.


So luck has affected every career of a test cricketer, and in some ways Phillip Hughes was lucky. He got a break at a young age and bucked the trend of players that struggle if they debut overseas, because he made his debut in a test series against South Africa, in Johannesburg in 2009. It was his second test match against South Africa, in Durban, for which he will be remembered. He scored 115 runs in the first innings and 160 in the second to clinch the three-match series for Australia. Phillip Hughes's centuries made him part of one of the most exclusive clubs in cricket history. In 137 years of cricket test history, only 63 players have scored centuries in both innings of a test match. His achievement was even more remarkable for the fact that Hughes was only 20 years old at the time, the youngest man to achieve the feat in cricket test history.


His career was not perfect; few are. His technique was unorthodox and he had been in and out of the Australian team. By the time of his death, he was fighting to regain a spot in our test team. But his performances were remarkable. He was one of only four Australians to have scored multiple centuries by their 21st birthday. The other three were Neil Harvey, Doug Walters and Don Bradman.


When young people die, we cannot help but think of the promise unfulfilled. This is the second condolence speech I have given this year in this place on a young man, full of potential, dying shy of his 26th birthday. Who knows what heights Phillip Hughes could have reached had his career not been cut tragically short—how many more runs to score, victories to savour and fans to delight?


For Phillip Hughes's family—his mother, Virginia, father, Greg, sister, Megan, and brother, Jason—it will not be his unfulfilled professional potential that they will miss but the presence of a cherished member of their family. There is no meaning to be found in death like this. It was a tragic accident. But we can take comfort from the way it has brought us together as a community—the heartfelt tributes by cricket and sporting fans across the world, including here in our cricketing community in Canberra, and the bats left out across Australia. 


In the under-13 game on Saturday between Canberra Grammar and Daramalan College, Grammar batsmen Felix Ford and Oliver Phillips both retired on 63 not out—Phillip Hughes's final score. Felix's mum, Simonetta Astolfi, said: 'The players were talking about it a lot. The mood was pretty sombre. But by the end of the of the day, the kids were energised and playing for a purpose.' That ambivalence that Simonetta Astolfi speaks about will be familiar to cricket fans around the country as we look forward to a summer of cricket—forever tainted by the tragedy of Phillip Hughes's death. Cricket is a great Australian pastime and Phillip Hughes was a highly skilled, enthusiastic and joyful cricketer. We will fondly remember his triumphs and rue the innings he will never get to play. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.

Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (12:10):  I rise to make a short contribution to this debate about the death of Phillip Hughes. I do so as a member of parliament representing my 100,000-odd constituents but also as a proud board member of the Western Australian Cricket Association and as a person who has had a lifelong love of the game, inherited from my grandfather and fostered obsessively by my mother. Last Friday after returning from Canberra, watching my wife digging through a grey nicks bag—for an old bat to place next to a tattered Greg Chappell wide brim hat at the front of our house in tribute to the loss of a fine young cricketer—was a deeply sombre experience. 


Even when middle age reduces playing to the odd social game, the opening of a cricket bag on any other occasion is just a simple joy. The cricket bag is one of those needle-hooks of experience that drags the mind back to wonderful things. The smell of zinc stained whites, usually unwashed from the last rare match, ignites the summer corner of the brain. The mere sight of the strange artefacts in a cricket bag revives a collage of memories that are better than the best of dreams. The cricket bag is the treasure-trove of youth, of summer, of friends and of the pursuit of simple and beautiful things. Cricket is the greatest game on earth. Everything good about sport and life is to be found somewhere inside cricket. So the opening of a cricket bag in mourning, rather than joy, was something that hundreds of thousands of Australians would have done for the first time in their lives last week. Opening a cricket bag in sadness rather than joy is something that none of us would ever have thought we would do. 


Phil Hughes, by every single account, was just one of those guys, one of the few who embody all the best things about the pursuit of a great game at the very heart of Australian life. Cricket is not a skill that just happens; it is a craft that only a handful of completely brilliant people can master over decades. Even then it is only mastered if they are willing to offer the sport itself their complete and utter dedication. Sometimes the sporting personalities who can combine natural talent with the single-mindedness the game requires can be as difficult as they are admirable, but the picture that emerges of Phil Hughes is very clear and very simple—that he was one of those diamonds of the game, a combination of amazing athletic skill and personal discipline wedded together to produce a rare optimism and a redoubtable person. 


In losing someone like this, Australia is confronting one of those singular events that forces us to withdraw briefly from the busy swim of our lives and sit just for a while on the bank. I recall the biography of the greatest ever Scottish sportsman, the heroic Eric Liddell. In that biography, the author in the preface felt compelled to make the point that, after the endless interviews and research for the biography, they were astounded by the simple fact that not a single person in the hundreds that they had interviewed had a single bad thing to say about the great runner. The same can clearly be said of Phillip Hughes. 


To be so good at something so great, to have so loved his cricket, and at the same time to be the best of teammates, of friends and of people, is the rarest of things. To lose the best of us doing something we all love as much as he did is why our mourning is so profound. To Phillip's family, I extend today every conceivable sympathy.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-12-03,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (12:14):  It is with great sadness that I rise to speak in this condolence debate and add my words to the other members of parliament who have spoken so eloquently.


In the week that Phillip Hughes, tragically, passed away there were many other tragedies around the country. We had the death of truck drivers, we had youth suicides, we had deaths by industrial accident, we had fatal car crashes and we had people die unexpectedly of heart attacks and strokes. All and each of those were a tragedy in their own right and a tragedy for their family, friends and loved ones. But the death of Phillip Hughes has struck a chord in the nation that I do not think I have ever seen before. We have seen such an outpouring of grief.


The PutOutYourBats campaign saw perhaps 100,000 Australians around the country actually putting a cricket bat out at the front of their house. We saw a cricket bat stuck up outside Kirribilli House. On Sunday night when I came into parliament to drop my things off, the member for Barker, whose office is a few doors up from mine, had his bat there. I brought my own in and, with the member for Barker, we put those bats down in front of the House of Representatives chamber as a small tribute.


I ask the question: why has there been such an outpouring of grief over Phillip Hughes' deaths? I think there are a couple of reasons. Firstly, it is because of what cricket actually means to our nation. There is something about the game of cricket that gets into our blood as Australians and as young people. Maybe it is the nobility of the game, but there is something special that the game has. It is something that we can talk about amongst friends and colleagues. And, of course, there is the traditional Christmas Day-Boxing Day test match. There is just something about the game that is unique to Australia.


Secondly, I think the reason it struck so many people is that we were all once Phillip Hughes. We were all once those kids from the country or kids from suburban parts of our cities playing backyard cricket with dreams of one day wearing the baggy green and trying to replicate our idols. When we will bowling, we were Dennis Lillee; when we were batting, we were Ian Chappell. We were all once those kids playing in our backyards. We all played backyard cricket, where we developed the rules to our backyard game like English law—in the way that the English common law has been developed, we debated what constitutes a four, what was a six or, if you hit a particular house, how much that was.


As we read through the tributes to Phillip Hughes this is exactly what he did with his family. In fact, his history said that Phillip Hughes was known for his strength through the offside through those slashing square cuts and those slashing cover drives. It said that those actually came about because where he played outside his family home on the leg side is actually because of where his family home was. He was frightened to hit a shot to the leg side too hard as it would hit his mother's kitchen window and perhaps he would be in trouble—and so therefore he became an offside player!


Perhaps the other reason that this has caused such an outpouring of grief is because of what Phillip Hughes actually achieved in his too-short career. I will just go through some of the records. At age 17, while still in high school, he made a century on debut in Sydney grade cricket. At age 18 he became one of the youngest players ever to debut for New South Wales. In that year he averaged 62 and he became the youngest player ever to score a century in a Sheffield Shield final. At the age of 20 he was selected to open the batting for Australia against South Africa. We can all remember that most ugly four-ball test duck that he faced when he was taking on the might of the South African pace attack of Dale Steyn and Morkel at the time. But in his second test he became the youngest cricketer ever to score a century in both innings. He was the first Australian batsmen to score a one-day century on debut and was the first Australian batsman to score 202 in a recent one-day match up in Darwin.


It is well known that many Australian batsmen have all sorts of trouble playing in English conditions. Phillip Hughes first went to England to play for Middlesex and he scored three centuries in his first three innings.


But perhaps his greatest performance was his Sheffield Shield game playing for New South Wales against Tasmania at Bellerive Oval. Often the true indication of a genius or someone with great skills is how they perform compared to everyone else. For many years a record was held by Don Bradman from the 1939-1940 season when he scored the greatest percentage of runs in a Sheffield Shield game. Phillip Hughes broke that record in the 2008-2009 season when in one match he scored 58 per cent of New South Wales runs. If you have a look through the scorecard, it is truly amazing to see how talented he was. On a green wicket at Bellerive Oval down in Hobart, New South Wales batted first and scored 172. Phil Hughes scored 93 of those 172 runs. Towards the end of the day's play, after Tasmania had gone into bat, 17 wickets had already fallen with but an hour to go; Tasmania was seven for 41. So 17 wickets had fallen for only 213 runs, and Phillip Hughes had scored 93 of those runs. That in itself would be a truly remarkable effort, but, after Tasmania were finally rolled for 127, in the second innings Phil Hughes repeated the same thing. Out of a total of 173 for New South Wales, Phillip Hughes scored 108 runs. That performance was the highest percentage of runs ever scored by an Australian batsman in a Sheffield Shield game.


The other reason there has been such an outpouring of grief is for what Phillip Hughes could have achieved. He died, was taken away from us all, at the age of just 25. If you look at some of our greatest test players, many of them did not achieve their best efforts until they were 26, 27, 28 or into their early 30s. Look at a player like Adam Gilchrist, who did not get selected for Australia until he was almost 27 years of age. But I think there has been such an outpouring because Phillip Hughes's death reminds us of the fragility of life—that, for any of us, our lives can be taken away in a split second. Rather than going along with the sometimes petty gossiping and bickering, and worrying about petty issues, we should live life as Phillip Hughes batted and seize the day: make every day count.


Cricket is a game of numbers and statistics. Every child knows that Don Bradman's average was 99.94. I think for many years or forever, as long as cricket is played, the number 63 will be remembered as the score that Phillip Hughes was not out on. Finally I would like to add a message to Sean Abbott. Mate, the best thing that Phillip Hughes would want you to do is to charge in off your long run, bend your back and dig the ball in. Vale, Phillip Hughes.

"Marles, Richard, MP",ALP,2014-12-03,"



Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (12:23):  I rise to speak in this debate about Phillip Hughes and commend the remarks of the member for Hughes, which I have just listened to. His words speak to many of the feelings that I have about this event, which has, as the member for Hughes said, unleashed an extraordinary outpouring of emotion across the country—which is genuinely remarkable and which has grown since the moment we heard this terrible news. It is emotion which has poured out not just across the country but around the cricketing world.


It does beg the question: what is it about? Over and above the obvious tragedy of what we have seen, this has touched a chord in the life of Australia. It is worth thinking about why this has become such a profound moment. Part of it obviously has to do with the sudden, inexplicable tragedy of a moment in time which utterly changes our world and brings somebody's life to an immediate end.


It is the idea that, just two weeks ago, Phillip Hughes walked on this earth and was breathing and living in precisely the kind of normal, day-to-day way that each of us here is. And now we are speaking in this debate in this parliament today. It is unimaginable. With that moment of shock, so many lives around Phillip Hughes's life are changed in a way which will be permanent. There is something appalling about the fragility of life that that moment demonstrates. Of course, that moment in different ways is played out, sadly, almost every day within our community, but this was a very visible moment that we all got to see.


Part of it, then, is that this has happened not to just anybody but to a really famous, highly skilled person—one of the 20 or 30 best cricketers on the planet, a person whose fortunes we have followed over the last few years. Sometimes I think we have a sense that those in the public eye are immune from the fragilities of daily life, but this tragedy is a reminder that they are not and that a person of his skill, of his standing, of his extraordinary flair and of his individuality and the way that he was able to bring that to his sport can be the subject of such a random, sad and devastating event.


Part of it also, I think, is this idea of distilled talent unrealised. Phillip Hughes really was at the beginning of his career; the best of it was yet to come. He was 25 and, as the member for Hughes said, in cricketing terms his best years were ahead of him. Indeed, many players do not make a debut in test cricket until after that age. It has surprised all of us who are cricket fans, in a way, that Phillip Hughes was still so young, because he burst onto the scene playing his first test for Australia as a 19-year-old and he was genuinely a prodigy. He had talent in bundles in a way which is hard to imagine. The idea that we will not get to see that played out in all its glory seems profoundly sad. We have been deprived of so much joy that we were all awaiting. As a sports fan across a number of sports but particularly with a love of cricket, there is an excitement about watching a career begin and explode, and there is a certain anticipation of what is going to occur. Of course, all of that has been denied.


There are parallels to Archie Jackson, who played eight tests for Australia in the twenties and thirties. He was a contemporary of Bradman's. He was also from New South Wales and, at the age of 19, he debuted for Australia, making 164 in his first test match. At the time, he was the youngest person ever to score a test century. When he and Bradman went to England on the 1930 tour, it was regarded, actually, that Archie Jackson might have been the better of the two players, though that may not have played out, given the extraordinary nature of Bradman. Archie Jackson contracted tuberculosis and died at the age of 23, having only played eight test matches. When you read the histories of that Bradman era and the histories of cricket through the thirties—it was an important game, almost more important then in our nation's psyche than it is now—you really get the sense that something was tragically lost in the inability for us to see the full glory of Archie Jackson's career. So it is with Phillip Hughes. The circumstances of his death were obviously different, but the idea that we will not get to see his full development is absolutely the same.


Part of it is Australia's love of cricket. This is a fantastic game, a game that is full of stats and full of different stories. It is a game that is absolutely about exquisite skill and ability but has an enormous mental element to it. We see people without ability who make it and people with ability who do not. Grittiness plays a part in it as well. It has been utterly central to our nation's history. When Bradman was carving the English to bits during the 1930s, there was a sense in which that, as much as anything, was Australia striking out with its independence from another country. It was a time when Australia's status as an independent nation was ambiguous. Some have described it as almost akin, in a way, to our war of independence, as Bradman took apart the English. When the Prime Minister of India was here recently, there was a quote about the first Prime Minister of India, Nehru, and about the way in which Bradman dealt with the English at that time. It was more than cricket. It was absolutely about the beginning of the identity of our country and, to this day, Bradman is probably the single most unifying person in our nation's history—and he is a cricketer.


This is a sport which is deeply imbued in our psyche, as it is in the psyche of so many around the world, but this is, deeply, an Australian game. I was looking at quotes about cricket and, back in the 70s, John Arlott and Freddie Trueman made this remark: that most games are skin-deep, but cricket goes to the bone. I think that is absolutely the way we as Australians regard this game. That this game can have thrown up such a tragedy as the one we witnessed last week with Phillip Hughes is also, I think, part of why there is this outpouring of emotion—part of why so many of us who love cricket feel compelled at the moment to have a bat outside our door.


But ultimately, this is actually more than cricket. Michael Clarke's testimony about Phillip Hughes made the point that Phillip Hughes's cricketing ability was secondary to who he was as person. When you read what those who knew him have written about Phillip Hughes, you get the sense that he was first and foremost a person of enormous humility. When somebody has been given a great gift—an enormous gift—and can deal with it in a humble way, there is something really special about that. There is something that attracts all of us to it. So often, we see that with great gifts comes a difficulty in handling them, and sometimes a conceit—but none of that appears to have been a feature at all of Phillip Hughes; indeed, the defining characteristic that you hear spoken about him was his humility—this humble kid from country New South Wales, bequeathed with an extraordinary gift. I think that that is actually why there is such an outpouring of grief: because it feels profoundly unfair that this person—of all people—who dealt with his gift in such a graceful and humble way, should have been deprived of it, along with his life, in this way.


I too would like to finish with a thought for Sean Abbott. I cannot imagine what Sean Abbott is thinking about. This is deeply unfair to him. He did not do anything wrong. There was not even a sense of negligence. It was just a random event. And I really hope that he is able to return to the game that he loves, and that he is able to continue it in the future. Vale, Phillip Hughes.

Ms KING
 (Ballarat) (12:33):  I too rise to speak in this important debate on the death of Phillip Hughes. From Marrickville to Mumbai, from Lords to the Sydney Cricket Ground, people all over the world have paid tribute to Phillip Hughes since his tragic passing. The pain of losing a son, a brother, a friend, and a talented cricket player has touched more than just cricket fans; it has reached across Australia and across the world. In winter, we are divided as a nation by four football codes. In summer, we are united by our love of one truly national game—and that is cricket. It is the backdrop to our childhood summers: the sound of backyard cricket, the test on the TV over Boxing Day, the scents of barbecues—it is quintessentially about who we are and how we have grown up. So Phillip Hughes is one of us but he is also about all of us.


Prime Minister may be the highest office in the land but no status is more revered than to be chosen to play test cricket for Australia. To be given that honour and then to fight repeatedly to win it back says something about the character of Hughes, and the way he went about that earned him the love and the respect of all who follow our game. His passing has prompted an unprecedented outpouring of grief and extraordinary tributes. Bats at a gentle lean in the shade of verandas around the nation, from humble backyards to the gates of Kirribilli House, and here in the corridors of Parliament House and even at Lord's is a simple but magnificent way for all of us to share in the grief caused by the loss of a young man who played the game his own way. 


At cricket grounds around the nation, 63-second silences were held in honour of Hughes' final score, and players retired their bat at 63. In my own electorate there was a magnificent gesture from the captain of the Haddon Cricket Club, Shaun Macarthur. With a score of 408 at the end of the 63rd over against VRI Delacombe, Shaun declared their innings closed, ensuring the scoreboard became a memorial to Phillip Hughes, with his baggy green No. 408 united with that final innings of 63. Despite Haddon's all-time batting record being within reach, Shaun chose to walk from the pitch to remember Hughes. It was a fine gesture and one that many across the nation have replicated with '63 not out' becoming a catchcry for many young cricketers. I want to thank Shaun and the many clubs in my own community and across the nation for providing such fine tributes to such a fine young man. 


As with other contributors, I too want to finish my remarks by saying that our hearts go out Sean Abbott—a young man who I hope very much feels and understands the love and support that is coming not just from this parliament but from the entire Australian community. We are proud of this young man. We think that he has suffered an unimaginable experience that will obviously be with him for his whole life. All of us send him our support and our care and wish him all the best over this summer of cricket.

Mr MATHESON
 (Macarthur) (12:37):  I also rise to associate myself with the Prime Minister's condolence remarks on the tragic loss of Phillip Hughes. Today as we mourn the loss of one of Australia's finest sporting talents, we also pay tribute to his life. Phillip Hughes was a humble and decent man from Macksville in northern New South Wales. He was raised on his parents' banana farm and always stayed true to his country roots. From a very young age it was clearly apparent that Phillip had a prodigious talent for cricket. At nine years old, he was playing representative cricket for the north coast and by 12 was already playing A-grade cricket. 


Phillip's dream of playing cricket for a living did not come without its sacrifices. At 17, he left his family and friends in northern New South Wales and moved to Sydney to play professionally. However, Phillip did not have to wait long to get his chance to play for his new team. On 20 November 2007, at 18, he made his first-class debut with the Blues against Tasmania at the SCG, becoming the state's youngest debutant since Michael Clarke. Three months later in February 2008, Phillip went on to become the youngest player ever to score a century in a Sheffield Shield final, subsequently winning the New South Wales Rising Star Award. The following year, in 2009, while on his debut tour with the Australian Cricket Team in South Africa, Phillip scored back-to-back centuries against the Proteas in Durban. Phillip was 20 years old, the youngest ever player in test cricket to score two centuries. This historic achievement helped Australia to a surprise series victory and, in doing so, the boy from Macksville had grabbed the world's attention. Unfortunately, Phillip was bowled out by England in 2010-11 Ashes, for which he lost his place in the national side. In the ensuing years, he was constantly in and out of the test team but he refused to give up, proving that he had both the patience and the mental fortitude to play at the highest level. Phillip bided his time, listened to advice and worked hard on aspects of his game that needed improvement. Yet, last week, just as selectors looked set to finally give Phillip another call-up for his country, his life was cut tragically short in a freak accident at the SCG. 


As we struggle to come to terms with this terrible loss, I am reminded of the Prime Minister's comments that this was a young man living out his dream. He was doing what he loved until his final breath, and for that we should be truly grateful. The energy and spirit he showed both on and off the field throughout his life should be an example to us all. At just 25, Phillip had already set the cricketing world alight with his precious and daring talent. Everyone who knew him speaks of a man who would go out of his way to help others and who always had a positive attitude no matter what was a thrown at him, and he never gave up on his dream. Phillip Hughes is a lesson to us all. 


Finally I would like to take this opportunity to offer my sincerest condolences to Phillip's friends and family as they pay their final respects today. The Macarthur cricket community, along with the rest of the country, mourn your loss. You remain in our thoughts and prayers at this difficult time. I would also like to say to Sean Abbott that each and every one of us pray that you do not in any way hold yourself responsible for what happened last week. I look forward to seeing you back on the field, as Phillip would have wished. Phillip Hughes, you will always remain 63 not out. You will be sadly missed but forever remembered. May you rest in peace.

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (12:40):  I rise on behalf of my constituents to express our condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Phillip Hughes, following his passing last Thursday after the awful accident at the SCG on Tuesday. It is an understatement to say the death of Phillip Hughes has affected many millions of Australians very deeply. We have been sincerely shocked that a young man in his prime could die as a result of playing the gentlemen's sport of cricket, a game that is integral to our national sporting culture. We shook our heads at the unexpected and freak nature of this accident. We felt for Phillip's family. We sympathised with his friends and colleagues. We scoured the press for those two days, looking for a glimmer of hope that there would be some good news. And we were so saddened by this tragedy and its impact on everyone.


Last Saturday, at cricket ovals all over the nation, tributes were paid, minutes of silence were held and remembrance was given for a wonderful sportsman. Others have reflected on his prowess at the game he loved, and his name and scores will be etched in the history books forever. Quite rightly, we have celebrated the skills that enabled him to play at elite level and represent our nation internationally. But what has really struck me, and I think has heightened our national grief, is that Phillip Hughes was not just a great sportsman. As his friends have each attested, he was genuinely a decent human being who set an example for others in the way he lived his life. If there can be any consolation for his family and his friends, it is this. Phillip's life will have an impact for generations to come. The ripple effect will be hard to qualify, but it will enrich our nation for so many years.


It can sometimes feel like there is a lack of genuine role models for our young people, but I know there are many young people—boys and young men, in particular—all around this country who have vowed to honour Phillip Hughes in deed and action. I know there are parents all around this nation who have had discussions with their children about life and the importance of the values that Phillip Hughes embodied. They have told tearful children, as they have tucked them up at night, that the best way to honour someone is to live your life in the best way possible.


As a mother of three girls, I admit I perhaps do not have a personal knowledge of how much cricket can mean to boys and young men. However, one of my staff has an 11-year-old son who plays for his local club and she assures me that the passion and fervour her son reserves for cricket are very special. I am sure there are many mums of boys around our country who know exactly what I am talking about.


Sport has an enormous role in teaching our young people values like responsibility, determination, teamwork, striving to do better, mateship and, importantly, how to deal with loss. Most of the time, it is dealing with the loss of a game. For the cricketing world last week, it was dealing with the loss of a young man who was a friend to all who knew him and a role model for many others. While it has been a difficult time for many people, including many who did not know Phillip personally but have been touched by this random accident, it is also a reminder to every one of us to be a little kinder, to hold those we love a little closer and to remember that every minute we have on this earth is precious. 


I sincerely hope that the outpouring of emotion provides some consolation to the Hughes family. I hope they hold to the thought that this tragic accident has touched the hearts of many and will act as a catalyst to remind them of what is important in life and how they should conduct themselves. There are undoubtedly many who, until last week, have only admired Phillip's cricketing prowess and now, having read a little more about the type of man he was and the way he treated others, will seek to emulate the person he was, not just the skills he possessed. I sincerely hope the knowledge of this aspect of Phillip's legacy provides his parents, Greg and Virginia; his sister, Megan; and his brother, Jason, with a degree of solace at this incredibly difficult time.


Australia is richer for the life of Phillip Hughes. On behalf of the people of McPherson, I extend my condolences to his family and friends.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2014-12-03,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders—Minister for the Environment) (12:45):  I want to join with Australians from all walks of life in recording my sadness and also, I think, to speak for the whole of the Flinders electorate at their sadness at the loss of a beautiful young man, a wonderful young life.


I remember watching Phillip Hughes's maiden test century. I was actually in Western Australia at the time. I was at home of Peter van Onselen, and we were meeting for the first time. We were talking about life and we had the cricket on in the background. We stopped and we watched this amazing left-handed genius, in his second test, approach the century and achieve it in the most glorious of fashions. Both of us thought here was somebody who was the one to continue in the tradition of Greg Chappell, passed on to Allan Border, passed down the line to Steve Waugh and then to Ricky Ponting and to Michael Clarke.


All the omens were that this young man—who, at age 20, then went on to achieve the extraordinary outcome of being the youngest person ever to have compiled two centuries in the same test match—had a glorious career ahead of him. I subsequently made the statement publicly that I thought that he would play 100 tests. Far more importantly than my view, the Australian captain, Michael Clarke, has said over recent days that he believes this young man, who was almost 26 at the time of his passing, had his best years ahead of him. He had already made some extraordinary achievements.


But I think the reason that the loss of Phillip Hughes has gripped Australia so much is that, firstly, it was so public—on the pitch, in front of four current test players—with not a ripple but a tidal wave through the entire Australian team and cricketing community. Secondly, it was clear that his best years were ahead of him, despite what he had already achieved, and that he was right on the edge of potentially returning as the No. 3 batsman within the Australian cricket team. Indeed, if this innings had progressed from 63 not out to a century, I would say he was odds-on. Having said that, there is this grieving at the sense of loss. Thirdly, what has emerged is that the person behind the impish grin and the cheeky smile was one of the most fundamentally decent nationally ranked sportspeople of recent decades. There was a sense of being unaffected by the international stage and a sense of the love of the bush from which he came with his family—with Greg and Virginia, his parents, and Megan and Jason, his sister and brother respectively.


The fact that we have the classic Australian story of bush to the bright lights, but without affectation—without a loss of the sheer joy of the game, the love of the bush and the intense love of family and friends—is the most extraordinary testament to Phillip Hughes's family, his teammates and his own character. These things together—the public nature of the demise, the sense of loss for what could have been and, above all else, the respect for somebody who was just a decent human being of the highest order—seem to have captured the nation, and, I think, rightly so. Every now and then, there is a moment where tragedy strikes and it represents a collective reckoning.


This is a great game. I have lived and breathed cricket myself since I was a very young boy. My first real memory of the game is of watching Doug Walters reach his century in Perth with a six—a great reminiscence of that. In the same way, it was reflected with Phil Hughes achieving his first test century. Throughout that time it has been the national sport, but this is the most high profile and profoundly moving death of a leading Australian cricketer since Archie Jackson, back in 1930.


I would simply say this: we are deeply saddened. I think the 'put out the bat' spontaneous movement has been a very uplifting element of Australia responding to this sadness, saying, 'We just think this is a tragedy.' I have seen houses and I have seen shops and I have seen the front doors of parliament with bats and a hat out the front. That is the best of Australia coming to recognise the best of a young man.


Nothing, for Philip Hughes's family, will replace this young man, but I am certain that, as they have generously said, young Australian cricketers should feel blessed to bat on, to bowl on, to field on, to be part of the game, because it is as clear as night follows day that such an unaffected young man would not want his tragedy to impair people's love for the game. But, at the same time, I feel that this tragedy will also be remembered and will put the game in perspective, in that, at the end of the day, it is humanity and people and mateship and family which matter more than anything else. For that, I say that he should be congratulated on a life well lived. His memory should be honoured, and his family should be comforted.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (12:52):  I know that the member for Riverina also wants to speak in this debate, so I will endeavour to be brief. It is with great sadness that I speak this afternoon on the death of Phillip Hughes. I think all of us who love cricket and who have played cricket have been absolutely shocked by what has happened, and also I think the Australian community have been reminded of how fragile life can be. I cannot forget seeing for the first time the footage of the blow that struck Phillip Hughes. Can I say to the young man who bowled that ball: you hold no responsibility whatsoever for what has happened here, and a nation feels for the pain that you must be feeling at the moment, as the nation feels for the pain that Phillip Hughes's family and friends must be feeling.


We have all—or a lot of us have—faced a cricket ball bowled at us which has whizzed past our ears, and we have ducked and we have weaved. We have also been hit by cricket balls. But none of us, I think, have ever thought that, in a split second, that could bring an end to our lives. I think that is the thing that has so starkly hit us all with what happened to Phillip Hughes.


As the events have unfolded, we have heard more and more about what an incredible young man Phillip Hughes was. I must say that, as a country boy and a very proud country boy, I have loved hearing about how he epitomised what coming from the country meant. The spirit with which he went about things and the approach he had to life reminded me that you can never take the country out of people who are born and bred there, who grow up there and who have those values instilled in them. Everything about Phillip Hughes seems to epitomise that. 


The thing that most epitomised that was his ability to deal with the adversity that was thrown at him. He had a brilliant start to his test career. I remember watching it at night when he made his first test hundred over in South Africa. The approach that he took was brilliant to watch. He flayed the South Africans, especially through the off side, using that wonderful cut shot that he had. It was fantastic. But then, of course, with his technique, fast bowlers thought that they saw some opportunities and he was out of the test team. Did he drop his bat, did he say, 'This is too all hard, I am going to give up'? No—he just worked and worked and got himself back into the test team. He also focused on his one-day career. Then he had adversity again. He was dropped again. What did he do? All he did was say, 'I am going to work even harder and harder.'


I am sure that tomorrow, in what would have been the first test starting in Brisbane, we would have seen Phillip Hughes walking out to bat again for his nation. Without doubt he was about to embark on a wonderful career as a test batsman for this nation. He had learned. He had continued to hone his techniques. He had continued to develop the skills that he needed. In much the same way that Matthew Hayden took a while to get into the test team and had to learn to play with softer hands, Phillip Hughes learned that he had to come to terms with his technique. I think he had, and he was ready to embark on a fantastic career. 


It is with great sadness that I speak on this matter today. The tributes that have been paid by the parliament have been absolutely magnificent. The tweet 'put out your bats' has been incredible. I know I did it myself. I know the member for Riverina also did it. It is extraordinary what that tribute really meant. May Phillip rest in peace. I extend my kindest regards to his family and friends following this absolutely tragic event.

"McCormack, Michael, MP",Nats,2014-12-03,"



Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance) (12:58):  Vale Phillip Hughes on behalf of the people in the Riverina, not just the cricketing community but all people in the Riverina who have shared the emotional roller-coaster that this nation has been plunged onto in recent days with the tragic death of a great young Australian. As the member for Wannon said, he was a great young country Australian. 


The Phillip Hughes story was quintessentially Australian. He was a boy from Macksville who made good but who never forgot his roots, who never forgot where he came from and who never forgot his origins. When he was playing test cricket and one-day cricket for Australia he yearned so often to be back on his father's banana farm or chasing the cattle around and doing all those things that country boys love to do. He is sadly missed by all, not just those who follow sport and who follow cricket. As I say, this has put the country into a state of mourning like we have not seen previously with the death of a sportsman. Paul Taylor's wonderful 'put out your bats' social media campaign has captivated not just people in Australia but people right across the world. 


We all love our sport but we should not forget that sport is dangerous. Whilst we mourn the death of Phillip Hughes at the all-too-young age of 25, we should not forget the four female jockeys—Simone Montgomerie, 26; Desiree Gill, 45; Carly-Mae Pye, 26; and Caitlin Forrest, just 19—and the female hockey player, Lizzie Watkins, 24, who have all died since 2012, playing sport. Whilst they all loved doing so, it does bring home the fragility of life. Sport does unite us in a way that nothing else can, and certainly I have seen some wonderful contributions to that effect from this parliament, generally a divided parliament. Indeed, we are all united on this occasion, as we should be.


It has been a time of sadness in the Riverina. Yesterday I attended the funeral of Mark Andrew Cornell, a great mate of mine, a good cricketer, who passed away on 26 November from pancreatic cancer. He fought the good fight against the illness for nine years. His sister-in-law, Colleen Breust, said that one of his great loves, as well as playing Australian Rules for Ungarie, was playing cricket, and his fondest moment was when he and his two brothers-in-law, Chris and Pete, played with him against West Wyalong: they won the grand final as underdogs, in the final overs. The loss of Phil Hughes was not forgotten by those at the funeral yesterday in Wagga Wagga as we celebrated the life of Mark, gone all too soon.


We mourn Phillip Hughes; we mourn the four female jockeys and the hockey player I mentioned earlier; and we mourn Mark Cornell, all of whom are gone way before their time. But they leave an indelible mark on us all. I finish with a statement by Sachin Tendulkar, who said, long before Phillip Hughes died:


I feel when somebody has been playing cricket for a long time, he creates a separate identity for himself.


While Phillip Hughes did not play cricket for a long time, he scored a century, as the member for Wannon pointed out, in just his second test, just like Sir Donald Bradman, and then backed it up with another one in the next innings—the very youngest batsman to ever do that in test cricket history. Phil Hughes did not play cricket for a long time; it was all too short. But he certainly created a separate identity for himself, not just because he has died but because of what he gave to the game and the legacy that he leaves behind.
