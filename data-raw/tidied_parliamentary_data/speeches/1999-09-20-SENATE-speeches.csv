"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I rise to speak in this debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  and, in doing so, take the opportunity to indicate that this bill, though seen by the opposition as an important bill, is one which is also masking another attack on the human rights of Australians, particularly 
 the rights of disadvantaged people in our community.
This bill presents an important opportunity to look at the government's human rights record. It is a bill that cannot be debated in isolation because, though it does present and represent the government's response to the Brandy decision, it does contain further attacks on the disadvantaged—those who suffer discrimination in the Australian society. It is yet another of a series of actions that have been undertaken by this government, actions that are depriving many hundreds of thousands of Australians of the right to access justice and to hold government accountable.
Basically what we are seeing in the government's strategic approach to this area is a denial of access. This government is attacking the rights held by Australians by making cuts to a wide variety of justice related services—including, for instance, cuts to legal aid, the federal courts and tribunals and the family services program. The government has also increased fees for federal courts and tribunals and is considering limiting the rights of Australians to hold their government accountable through the Commonwealth's administrative law system.
It is worth noting at this point in the debate that, from the date of its election to the end of next year, in total, the government will have cut more than $400 million from services that help Australians access justice. Most importantly, it is those who are less well resourced who are denied access to justice. If there is one lesson that can be learned from the Victorian election over the last few days, it is that the community will no longer tolerate being denied access to services that they have been used to and which, I think quite rightly, they see as their right. One of those services is access to justice and, through that, accountability of government.
Foremost amongst the cuts that I have mentioned are the government's cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government has reduced funding for the commission from the $20.5 million provided in the 1996-97 financial year to $17.9 million in the 1997-98 financial year, to $12.3 million in the 1998-99 financial year. 
 With the move to accrual accounting, the budget of the commission on paper has increased to $16.069 million. However, even this is a slight decline on the $16.099 million estimated as the accrual budget of the commission in 1998-99.
When the additional $470,000 provided to the Privacy Commissioner to meet his foreshadowed responsibilities for privacy in the private sector and the related capital injection of $89,000 are taken into account, the commission will, in effect, still have $600,000 less in 1999-2000 than it did in 1998-99. When all these factors are taken into account, the commission's budget will have been cut by some 50 per cent since the Howard government came into office, and that figure does not even take into account an adjustment for inflation.
As a result of the second round of cuts foreshadowed in the 1997 budget, the commission was forced, for budgetary reasons, to implement those cuts with effect from 1 January 1998. The government did not even provide the commission with ancillary funding to meet the inevitable costs of redundancies—and redundancies there have been. As a result of the cuts, the commission has been forced to sack approximately 60 of its 180 staff, or one in three—half the budget and one in three of the staff made redundant.
You cannot make those sorts of cuts without having some impact on access to the services of the human rights commission, its resources and, as a consequence, making government accountable. These cuts have caused the commission to effectively abandon the great bulk of its ongoing inquiry work. Instead, it has been forced to meet its essential statutory obligations to conciliate complaints. An exception to this is the report released recently by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner into pregnancy related discrimination. Apart from that, the commission now has shed some of its functions in a major way.
The actual effect of these cuts is completely at odds with the government's claims. This is probably another lesson that the government needs to learn from the weekend's election results. You cannot keep on doing things to 
 the public and then say to them that something contrary or directly in conflict is happening. In this case, despite the staffing cuts and the shedding of functions, the Acting Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, stated in the middle of 1997:
Reports in the media today contain incorrect claims that changes to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) will have a negative impact on disabled people.
However, the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Sidoti, who is now the Acting Disability Discrimination Commissioner as well, confirmed in evidence to a Senate estimates committee shortly after Mr Ruddock's statement that the services provided by the Disability Discrimination Commissioner would be amongst those affected by the cuts. So, the cuts should be condemned, but the government's deceit in not telling some of the most disadvantaged in our community what the real effect of these cuts would be is also something that needs to be condemned.
Supposedly some cuts can be related to this bill, but I also want to note in this part of the debate that the government originally projected a cut of $1.5 million per year in the commission's 1996-97 budget to transfer the hearing function from the commission to the Federal Court of Australia. Some cuts and functions have been documented, but diddling of the books has also gone on in respect of HREOC. The hearing function was transferred to the Federal Court of Australia and a projected cut of $1.5 million was made to HREOC's budget because of what the government assessed was the cost of fulfilling that service by HREOC. Even that cut is unjustified. In terms of duplicity and wanting to do away with this commission, the government itself told the estimates committee that that function was only costing the commission some $600,000. So they took the opportunity to take another $1 million off the commission under the guise of shifting a function. The commission suffered and those who accessed the services of the commission suffered.
However, a broader part of the community has been suffering because of the cuts in general to legal aid across the nation. In its 1996-97 budget, the government announced 
 a cut of $120 million over three years from legal aid funding from 1 July 1997. They decided to dismantle Australia's national unified legal aid system. Those two decisions have had a massive impact on the ability of Australians to enforce their human rights. This is particularly so in cases where there are discrimination law disputes which will now be determined by the Federal Court of Australia.
I would also like to draw the Senate's attention to the more detailed discussion of the effects of the cuts to legal aid funding as contained in the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee's first, second and third reports on Australia's legal aid system. I will not discuss the impact of these cuts here, but it is worth noting that the impact of those cuts was all-pervasive across the community. I also noted the effect of the changes to the guidelines to legal aid. As I say, the cuts have been quite pervasive but the Commonwealth-state legal aid agreements which came into effect on 1 July 1997 contain the following guideline with respect to the funding of equal opportunity and discrimination cases. That guideline says:
5.1 The Commission may grant assistance for equal opportunity/discrimination cases where there are strong prospects of substantial benefit being gained not only by the applicant but also by the public or any section of the public.
This guideline has to be totally unacceptable because it unfairly excludes people suffering discrimination from access to legal aid. The guideline achieves this effect by providing a number of qualifiers to the standard merits and financial hardship tests that an applicant is required to demonstrate. From now on, not only do applicants have to meet the financial hardship test and the merits test but they have to show that they have a strong prospect of success, that those prospects are directed towards the attainment of a substantial benefit, and that the benefit not only be acquired by that individual but must serve a broader public interest, or otherwise be in the interests of a section of the public.
These additional requirements have been applied arbitrarily as other civil litigants are not required to demonstrate similar matters to access legal aid. I am sure the government knows that these additional requirements will 
 effectively exclude large numbers of people adversely affected by discrimination from access to legal aid. I have to say that these additional requirements are simply unacceptable as a matter of principle. The creation of equality of opportunity and the elimination of discrimination are matters which derive substantial benefits not only to the individual complainant, but also to a whole class of persons to which that complainant belongs and to the community as a whole. By mere example, mere definition and mere decision, a decision can have an impact on a broader range of people. Putting all this together, we have had an attack on HREOC and we have had an attack on legal aid. We have also had an unfair discriminatory exclusion from access to legal aid for those who deserve that access the most.
I will take this opportunity to turn to the legislation and indicate some of the flaws that the opposition finds with it. This legislation has two fundamental objectives. The first is to ensure that discrimination determinations can be enforced in a timely, effective and efficient manner in accordance with the ruling of the High Court in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The second is to implement a restructuring of the commission's complaint handling mechanisms. We acknowledge that, since the Brandy decision was handed down in early 1995, it has been necessary to vest the power to make enforceable determinations in a body exercising the judicial power of the Commonwealth pursuant to chapter III of the Constitution. Following the Brandy decision, the previous Labor government introduced interim procedures for the handling of discrimination complaints, procedures which effectively reinstated the system that had applied to discrimination complaints prior to 1993. These arrangements provide for an initial determination to be made by the commission, which determination, if acceptable to the parties, operates subject to their goodwill and continued compliance. Determinations of the commission as such are not legally enforceable.
Under this scheme, enforceable determinations require a fresh hearing of the dispute 
 and a determination by the Federal Court. It has always been our view that the continued operation of the pre-1993 regime is inappropriate. This is because of the need for a second hearing by the Federal Court of a complaint for a determination to be enforceable. We believe that the current mechanism is unwieldy and places all parties at a financial and temporal disadvantage. So there is a strong and clear public interest in disputes being enforceable once determined. We support the creation of a special human rights registry within the Federal Court of Australia, as provided in the bill, as the most appropriate and cost-effective way to give effect to this purpose.
We also support the bill's effect in giving the commission the power to conciliate disputes. Under the proposed arrangements, as set out in the bill, complaints are lodged with the Federal Court which then transfers the matter to the commission for conciliation. The executive president of the commission is responsible for administering the conciliation function, although the role will be largely performed by specialist conciliators. Should the dispute not be capable of conciliation then the matter is referred to the Federal Court for determination.
We broadly support the structure of the bill. We see that as a necessary mechanism for the attainment of simplified and effective complaint determination procedures. However, as I will discuss more fully in the committee stage, we do believe there is a need for a number of important amendments to ensure that the rights of complainants are protected and they are able to access those rights.
In closing—and I indicate that much of our complaints will be detailed in the committee stage, and there is no need to duplicate the debate at this stage—I want to make one particular point in terms of process and the delay with this legislation. On 3 March 1998 the Attorney-General issued a press release accusing the Labor Party of delaying the passage of this legislation. In so doing the Attorney called on the Labor Party to stop `opposing' the bill. This was despite the fact that he knew that we had said that we generally supported the bill. The Attorney made his 
 statement knowing that, when he first announced this proposal to create a human rights registry of the Federal Court, it was I, as shadow Attorney-General, who said in a media release dated 9 August 1996 that the proposal was consistent with previous Labor government policy and that we would support it.
The Attorney made his statement knowing that recommendation 3 of the minority report on the bill, signed by Senator McKiernan and me and dated 25 June 1997, stated:
The Labor members of the Committee support the passage of the Bill subject to the Parliament's agreement to the amendments set out below.
So what you have here is an Attorney who knew what was on the public record, who knew what was in the documentation of this Senate—a specific recommendation of me and Senator McKiernan—but then proceeded to put out a thoroughly untruthful statement. Why did he do this? Essentially he did this because he wanted to hide the fact that the only reason there has been a delay in having this bill dealt with is that he could not get sufficient priority for this legislation from his colleagues to have it debated in the Senate.
The Senate committee reported on this bill in June 1997, some 26 or 27 months ago. It first appeared on the Notice Paper in December 1997, some 21 or 22 months ago. It appeared after the Native Title Amendment Bill and therefore, as one could have expected, there would not have been sufficient time for it to be brought on for debate. The Attorney had a couple of goes at trying to bring it on for debate last year, but once again it was put down low on the list in terms of priority in every sitting week in the Senate that it was listed. Once again, those who put it there knew that it could not have come up for debate. As a result, it has been over two years since the Senate committee finished deliberating on this bill—two years in which the bill could have been debated in the Senate. The bill lapsed in the Senate because the Attorney could not convince his colleagues of the need to debate it before the last election.
—You filibustered on the native title bill and now you blame us.
—If you go back to that debate, Senator Campbell, you will realise that that debate was treated quite expeditiously and that was acknowledged by Senator Minchin at the close of that debate. So a cheap shot from you at this stage of the proceedings is probably not going to assist proceedings for the rest of the week or the rest of the fortnight.
It is extremely disappointing that the Attorney has sought to blame others for his and the government's failure to give human rights issues the priority they deserve. If he had shown the same diligence in pursuing the interests of the victims of discrimination as he blames others for his own lack of action, then we would have finished debating this bill quite some time ago.
This is a bill that will have an extensive committee stage. We will be moving amendments, but we will not be moving all the amendments that I have circulated. There has been some fruitful discussion in recent weeks between the Labor Party and the government in respect of some of the issues that have been outstanding, and it took two years for the government to sit down with the opposition and discuss these issues. There are still some areas of disagreement.
While I have circulated all the original amendments proposed by the Labor Party in relation to the bill, I can advise that I propose now to move only amendments 1, 2, 12, 13, 14, 18, 20, 21 and 22 and when we get to the other amendments I will explain my reasons as to why I will not be moving them. I do not think I need to say much more at this particular stage of the debate. I know other colleagues want to speak on this legislation. I look forward to the committee stage of the debate.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-09-20,"—I rise to speak in support of the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . It is necessary following the High Court's decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in 1995 that a means be found to ensure that parties can gain direct access to the Federal Court. I am concerned that cheap justice in the form of mediation and conciliation will 
 not always equate to real justice. I would further support the development of a federal magistrate's court to enhance a cost-effective approach to dispute resolution. Access should be timely, affordable and enforceable.
I support limiting the role of the commissioners and think it is most unfortunate that we cannot also limit their pay packets to match. Tony Smith, a previous member of the House of Representatives for Dickson, said in his speech on the second reading debate:
Why couldn't the Brandy case have been dealt with in the magistrate's court? It could have been dealt with simply and summarily and disposed of once and for all. Instead, we had an exhaustive process that took it through the Federal Court and the High Court, and an enormous amount of money was spent.
I stress again that I welcome any approaches regarding the creation of a federal magistracy to deal with these issues. However, in supporting the bill, I also have enormous reservations.
Let us face facts: the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is not treating the causes of the problems within this country but treating the symptoms. It is well known that economic freedom buys political freedom. With economic freedom comes our dignity and our self-esteem. When we have access to housing, health, education and employment opportunities for all Australians we have armour to deal with unwarranted and unwelcomed infringements on our rights—rights that we earn through being responsible citizens.
When people in this country talk about human rights and about discrimination and tolerance, many of them are fond of apologising for Australia. I am not one of those. I think Australians have an outstanding record on human rights. I think we are outstandingly tolerant people. One of our great characteristics is that we have welcomed millions of people here from all over the world. By and large, they are treated with dignity, with great decency and great respect by the majority of Australians. I hope that that will always continue to be the case. These are the sentiments of not only One Nation but also our Prime Minister on 10 December 1996. Pauline Hanson's One Nation knows that the majority 
 of Australians are decent people who are only too willing to give another Aussie a fair go. Yet here we are spending $15 million in the 1999-2000 budget on this commission to deal with a problem that the Prime Minister himself tells us is a small issue.
The funds would be better expended in our health system on cancer, diabetes, asthma or dermatitis research and treatment facilities. These areas require funding to save and support the lives of thousands of ailing Australians. Our politicians act as if they have a bottomless pit of money to direct to the social elite and to their cosmopolitan ideals. In her new book, The Great Divide, Katherine Betts discusses that liberal cosmopolitans have a sincere concern for international humanitarianism. They delight in travelling to Paris, New York and Bangkok and in impressing their neighbours with their new found sophistication. They distance themselves from their own origins by attributing selfishness and racism to the parochials. Katherine Betts asks the following question:
. . . how many times have we felt obligated through social pressures to watch our language or change the subject to avoid taboos that the new class have constructed around the questions of immigration and race?
Like most of the working class—that is, the new working class poor and those on support benefits—it is a desperate struggle to prioritise their most finite resource—cash. Mainstream Australians are hurting badly and every householder knows the necessity to prioritise their spending. There are many members of our community having difficulty affording school uniforms and shoes for their children or new tyres for their old cars. There are many homeless Australians who cannot find support accommodation and who are forced to suffer intractable poverty, yet politicians are still spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on this bureaucratic, top-heavy instrument of government.
Hasties Law, named after a British socialist, states:
The incidence of alleged racism in a given society will vary in direct proportion to the number of people handsomely paid to find it. 

I suggest that Australian taxpayers are spending an inordinate amount of money through the commission to address a small percentage of our population who, regardless of legislation and the efforts of those commissioners, denigrate those they perceive to be weaker and inferior to themselves. I often reflect on the diggers who came back from World War I who were proud of their country and their achievements but were nicknamed `Hoppy', `Wingy' or `Hooky', depending on whether they had lost a leg, an arm or had makeshift surgery on their face. This ability of Australians to relate in an abstract way to their adversity has in fact contributed to their ability to cope with those adversities. Thank God the commission did not exist in those times, as a victim mentality may have overshadowed what has been a part of Australian life since settlement.
Australians have and always should enjoy freedom of thought, freedom of speech and freedom of association. This has led to our uncanny ability to form enduring relationships—mateships—in times of extreme hardship. We have always enjoyed an ability in the past not to take ourselves too seriously. If the commission is to pursue the occasional discriminatory person in our society, then it should also pursue the matter in which our monopolistic, overseas controlled media frequently behave in their desire to pursue profits. These entities have ignited and poured fuel on racist stereotyping in the interests of sensationalism, of selling newspapers and of making profits. These international conglomerates, with an aim to gain market dominance, affirm in headlines across the country that the accused are guilty until they prove their innocence.
The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is not supporting the Australian people but creating a victim mentality and industry. The greatest threat to individual freedom of thought and speech has been the dominance of this legislative machine. I welcome the changes that dilute the power of this commission. Put decision making processes into federal magistrates courts to more thoroughly ensure that real justice can be achieved. I do not support the Human Rights 
 and Equal Opportunity Commission as I believe the funds currently allocated to this body would be better spent saving lives, not fragile egos.
In conclusion, I will support this bill but believe that it has not gone far enough. It does not solve the problems facing Australia, rather it merely sticks a bandaid over a festering sore. Economic rationalist policies have denied economic and ultimate political freedom to Australians by denying them the opportunities to secure worthwhile employment, health, housing and educational opportunities. If the government and the opposition work towards rectifying employment, health and housing, they will go a long way towards not needing the human rights commission. Solve the problems rather than treat the symptoms.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I also rise to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . I for one do not dismiss as easily as Senator Harris seems to the very real concerns of people with disabilities about their basic human needs to be addressed and their right to seek recourse when they are discriminated against. I think that is at the heart of this bill. This bill is one of a series of pieces of legislation the government is seeking to introduce in relation to human rights. While the bill includes many necessary reforms which the Labor opposition supports, it also has at its core what I see as a fundamental attack on the basic human rights of many members of our community, principally the disadvantaged and people with disabilities. The focus of my contribution today will be on the impact of the legislation for people with disabilities. The awarding of the costs rule, the application of court fees and the commencement of the restructuring of HREOC will erect massive financial and administrative barriers in the paths of people with disabilities seeking recourse for discrimination. While the bill does provide for enforceable decisions, at the same time it diminishes access to, and affordability of, justice for people with disabilities. The real impact of this bill will be to reduce their capacity to exercise their rights. 
Since the coalition government's election in 1996, justice related services have consistently been downgraded. The Family Court, legal aid, tribunal and family service programs have all suffered. The full extent of these staggering cutbacks can be measured in dollar terms: the Howard government has cut an astonishing total of $400 million from services that directly assist Australians accessing justice. In addition, people with disabilities have faced a two-pronged attack. Since 1996, in addition to the general justice service cutbacks that affect them, people with disabilities have faced a constant barrage of discriminatory human rights policies and have seen their support services grossly underfunded. The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  represents another example of the coalition government diminishing the rights and opportunities available to people with disabilities.
The bill seeks to reform the functions, structure and complaint handling mechanisms of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. It also responds to the High Court decision in the 1995 Brandy case that found that HREOC, as a non-judicial body, did not have the constitutional power to finally determine disputes. While the Labor opposition welcomes moves to address the issues that emerge from the Brandy case, many other sections of the bill will severely limit the ability of people with disabilities who are facing acts of discrimination within our community to access justice. The requirement to pay up-front court fees and the risk of an adverse costs order will not enhance, promote or protect the human rights of people with disabilities in Australia. On the contrary, their rights will be severely reduced and the real fears associated with mounting legal challenges against big business and government departments will be compounded. The inability of people with disabilities to afford the costs associated with lodging discrimination complaints and the possibility they may be the subject of an adverse costs order will mean that they may often choose to put up with the discrimination rather than risk everything they own. As a result, the Disability Discrimination Act will become an inadequate 
 and unaffordable source of protection for them.
Australia has a proud human rights record, and successive Labor governments have sought to strengthen and reaffirm that commitment. The Whitlam Labor government introduced the Sexual Discrimination Act 1974 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The Hawke Labor government introduced the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, and the Keating government introduced the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. The coalition, on the other hand, has consistently sought to turn back progress when it comes to discrimination and access issues for people with disabilities. The recent prescription of various state acts from the Disability Discrimination Act by the federal Attorney-General's office without so much as token consultation with community groups or individuals clearly highlights this government's attitudes towards people with disabilities. This government is more intent on rewarding big business with gold medals than legislating to ensure that access and transport requirements of people with disabilities are not simply left to the whim or the social conscience of the provider.
Advocacy programs for people with disabilities are also under threat from the coalition government, under the guise of the National Disability Advocacy Program review. Despite the final recommendations of the review only recently being made public, advocacy groups are already expressing concern. It appears the intention of the review is to reduce the number of advocacy organisations available to assist people and to divert the remaining services away from providing systemic advocacy—the very kind of discrimination cases that receive legal aid funding, as the outcome can affect the wider population. In addition, the coalition government recently included several new outcomes in the program funding contracts of numerous community organisations assisting people with disabilities. These organisations are now required to seek out their own revenue, to reduce their financial dependence on the department and to alert the department to any contentious issues that may generate negative media interest 
 prior to the issues being made public. Clearly, these outcomes will only divert resources away from where they are most needed and reduce the level of advocacy services available for people with disabilities.
Let me turn to the costs rule. The main criticism of this piece of legislation from a disability perspective centres on the potential impact of the Federal Court's costs rule and court fees. I have received numerous submissions and letters from community groups representing people with disabilities, and from members of the public with disabilities, concerning the potential impact this legislation will have on them. The introduction of court fees and a costs rule effectively silences those members of our community who are on a low income and are seeking to pursue a discrimination claim. Given that the majority of people with disabilities are on low or fixed incomes, an act to impose financial barriers on the prosecution of discrimination claims will disproportionately affect them.
A single person over 21 on a disability support pension receives just $366.50 and a member of a couple receives $305.90. This is barely enough to live on, let alone pay Federal Court costs if you have a discrimination case you wish to proceed with. Despite the fact that the awarding of costs has never previously been a feature of the handling of discrimination cases, under this legislation, even if an applicant has an arguable case and loses, they may still have to pay thousands of dollars in costs to the other party.
The Disability Discrimination Act is different from other race and gender discrimination laws, or, indeed, any other law, in that it actually allows for discrimination if the respondent can show that the elimination of the discrimination would cause them unjustifiable hardship, generally in a financial sense. When lodging discrimination complaints, people with disabilities are in a position whereby they not only have to prove that discrimination has occurred under the DDA but must also be able to rebut the respondent's claim of causing unjustifiable hardship. For example, under the proposed legislation, a complainant might successfully prove that discrimination in law has occurred yet still 
 have the costs of both parties awarded against him or her. This would occur if the respondent were able to convince the court that adhering to the DDA would cause them to suffer unjustifiable hardship.
The uniqueness of the unjustifiable hardship clause creates far greater uncertainty in disability discrimination law than in any other area of law. The ability of a complainant to accurately assess the viability of their complaint succeeding is practically non-existent when the unjustifiable hardship component is factored into the equation. Very few people would risk the possibility of having costs awarded against them when the outcome of their case is so uncertain.
Systemic, wholesale discrimination is exactly the kind of discrimination people with disabilities are facing every day of their lives. Under this legislation, however, it will rarely be challenged simply because people with disabilities will be too frightened to take the associated risks. Despite assurances from both the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister that people who cannot afford to pay will not be required to pay their own or the other side's costs if a case were lost, people with disabilities, their advocacy groups and the opposition remain unconvinced. The Federal Court is a particularly costly and formal forum and has the potential to intimidate many people with disabilities to the point of exclusion. The existence of up-front court fees, coupled with the potential for an adverse costs order, will prove an impossible barrier for people with disabilities accessing the courts and tribunals.
Under current guidelines, applicants have to pay only a nominal fee when lodging a complaint. If this legislation is passed, many will have to pay full Federal Court fees, averaging $3,200, if the matter ultimately goes to hearing and a minimum of $505 if the matter is resolved through conciliation. For a single day hearing, the lodgement fees, service fees, setting down fees, witness fees and hearing fees can total as much as $3,000. Many people, including the majority of people with disabilities, quite simply do not have that kind of money to spend.
Only people on very low incomes are eligible for legal aid, which in some states is pegged at $12,000 for discrimination cases. Bearing in mind that most Federal Court actions are defended at a cost well above $12,000, even those people with disabilities accessing legal aid may still be left exposed to cover debilitating costs. As I understand it, a number of jurisdictions will not even consider legal aid funding for discrimination matters.
Australia must retain an adequately funded, independent and accessible national human rights body. HREOC has a fundamental role in protecting the rights of all Australians—in particular, people with disabilities. HREOC was established to stem the rise of discrimination across our society. By slashing the funding available to it, the coalition has seriously undermined its function. HREOC's own annual report contains a series of criticisms in relation to the government's discrimination reform agenda.
While HREOC welcomes the proposed strengthening of its educational function, commission representatives expressed grave concerns about some aspects of this legislation which, in their view, adversely impact upon the independence, integrity and effectiveness of the body. Former president of HREOC Sir Ronald Wilson issued a press release stating:
At a time of great need for restating the values of inclusion, non-discrimination and tolerance in Australia, these cuts will mean the Commission will be unable to work at its current level.
Interestingly enough, Sir Ronald's position as president was abolished just six weeks after he made those comments. The Howard government has reduced funding for the commission from the $20.5 million provided in the 1996-97 financial year to $17.9 million in the 1997-98 financial year and $12.3 million in the 1998-99 financial year.
As a direct result of the funding cuts, the commission's work force has been slashed by one-third, from 180 staff to just 120. Any organisation suffering a reduction in funding to the tune of nearly 50 per cent, coupled with a one-third culling of its staff, would note a reduction in the number of cases it is 
 in a position to deal with. This is precisely what is happening at HREOC, as the bulk of the commission's ongoing inquiry work has been abandoned in order for it to meet its statutory obligations to conciliate complaints. This direct, unashamed attack on the funding, resources and, therefore, ability of an institution established to monitor, protect and educate all Australians in antidiscrimination issues is, in my view, beyond contempt.
As I previously mentioned, this piece of legislation is just one part of a series of reforms the government plans for human rights in Australia. The  Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999  outlines further reforms for HREOC. That piece of legislation proposes to abolish the five specific commissioners, including the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, and to replace them with three deputy presidents with responsibility for several jurisdictions. By abolishing the position of a dedicated federal Disability Discrimination Commissioner, the coalition government has reaffirmed its ignorance and indifference on discrimination issues relating to people with disabilities.
 People with disabilities suffer forms of discrimination unlike—and unknown to—the wider community. Even the Acting Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Chris Sidoti, criticised the government's reform agenda and confirmed that people with disabilities will be sorely affected by the abolition of that office when he said:
The loss of a specialist position devoted solely to disability discrimination issues comes only five years after the enactment of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the establishment of the position. Much has been accomplished during those years but equality for Australians with a disability remains at best, unfinished. The case for maintaining a specialist position remains compelling.
People with disabilities also vigorously argue that discrimination cases involving them are not only complex but also particularly widespread. A dedicated commissioner focusing on disability discrimination issues is absolutely imperative given the volume of discrimination people with disabilities must endure on a regular basis. For example, gender and race discrimination cases are generally more straightforward than disability discrimination 
 cases. Gender discrimination cases involving a woman applies to all women, whereas a discrimination case involving a person with a disability might arrive at differing outcomes depending on the actual disability involved—mental disability, paraplegia, hearing impairment, et cetera—as well as the physical environment. These cases involve complicated and often multiple issues, and the interests of people with disabilities would be best served by having a dedicated specialist commissioner.
The late Elizabeth Hastings was Australia's first and only dedicated Disability Discrimination Commissioner. All of her life Elizabeth was concerned about the issues surrounding disability. She knew that the rights of people with disabilities flowed from justice and fundamental human rights. Elizabeth's last written article was published in the Financial Review. In it she wrote:
The protection of our human rights, our experience of our rights being protected because we are as human and valued as all people, goes to the heart of our belonging as human beings.
The Howard government's decision to combine the roles of the commissioners has sent one message to people with disabilities: that the advancement and protection of their rights are not a priority for this government.
In conclusion, in a modern society it is inappropriate that a person enforcing his or her fundamental human rights could be subject to the risks of litigation, particularly where the risks between the parties are so disproportionate. The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  does not afford equitable and accessible justice to people with disabilities. The bill does not protect the basic rights of people with disabilities. If effectively diminishes those rights and protects the offenders. As foreshadowed by my colleague Senator Bolkus, the Labor opposition will be moving amendments to address the inadequacies that this legislation contains for people with disabilities. I hope that the Senate ensures that the bill is amended to protect and enhance the rights of all people with disabilities.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-09-20,"—The Human Rights Legislation 
 Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  is the first piece of legislation which I have carriage of as the Australian Democrats spokesperson on law, justice and human rights. As honourable senators will now realise, one of the central planks on which the Australian Democrats was founded was the respect and promotion of human rights. In my capacity as the Democrats spokesperson on law, justice and human rights, I look forward to continuing a role—it is what we may now modestly call a tradition—in the Senate of representation and emphasis on human rights.
I wish to begin my contribution today by quoting from the statements made by my colleague Senator Murray in 1996 when the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Back then Senator Murray had this to say in the minority report:
The modern principles of democracy have long abandoned the simple notion that the mandate of the ballot box, legitimises all government action. Democratic principles also require the respect for human rights and the protection of minorities against the possible coercive and oppressive power of the majority, the powerful, the wealthy or just simply the strong. It is what distinguishes democratic and relatively free nations from that of oppressive and tyrannical ones. It is in essence, a system of checks and balances on the potential abuses of any government or any sector of the community against a vulnerable group in the community that we are talking about.
At a national level at least, it has been recognised that equality should be afforded to persons regardless of their gender, race or disability. The Australian Democrats believe that this protection should be extended to that of sexuality and age in the immediate future.
I would like to add my support to those sentiments expressed by my colleague Senator Murray no less than three years ago. There could be no greater example of those sentiments expressed by Senator Murray three years ago than the human tragedy and political malevolence that has unfolded in East Timor. Australia need only now look at our nearest neighbour to see the consequences of democracy stifled and human rights denied. If for no other reason—but, for some, many reasons—East Timor and its courageous people exemplify why, in comparatively 
 peaceful Australia, we must be ever vigilant and never complacent about the state of human rights in our own country.
While it is true that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission performs many functions under its foundation legislation, no function is as important as its capacity to receive, manage and process complaints of human rights violations. To a large extent, it is the capacity to resolve the conflict of human rights with human behaviour that is at the core of what this commission is all about.
In 1996 the Attorney-General in his second reading speech outlined the practical implications of the 1995 High Court's Brandy decision. There has now been four years of effective constitutional deadlock with that decision paralysing the present structures of the commission. This deadlock is not merely an administrative one; it goes to the core of that central function that is the human rights commission's existence—to enforce decisions concerning the abuse of human rights and to see that ultimately a form of justice prevails.
Antidiscrimination law, human rights law or its other manifestation of equal opportunity law is necessary in Australia because not everyone is equal in this country. While the pretences of working-class equality have pervaded Australian mythology, the experience for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disabilities, women, the young  and people in the gay and lesbian community has been anything but equal. Since 1975 we as a nation have acknowledged through this parliament that no-one should be disadvantaged on the grounds of their race.
In 1986 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was established as Australia's human rights watchdog. If our democracy is to continue to function, we should—and I emphasise `should'—place great emphasis on institutions and organisations which monitor and protect human rights. Would anyone doubt the valuable work and the contribution that organisations such as Amnesty International have made in alerting the world about, and then coordinating action against, nation states which, for undemocratic 
 motives, abuse the human rights of their citizens.
In the stark contrast that East Timor presently provides, it could be convenient to suggest that on comparative terms Australia has little with which to concern itself. We would, I think, be in error if we assumed that human rights abuses were just about violence, discrimination or vilification in the way we have seen graphically portrayed in Dili, although they certainly do include those things. But they also include ignoring people and not catering for their needs. They include the deliberate omission or marginalisation of specific groups on specific grounds: be it the mandatory detention of young people in the Northern Territory or in my home state of Western Australia; be it the appalling and disparate social indications such as health, education and housing for indigenous peoples; be it the mandatory immigration detention—in some cases for years—of infants because of inappropriate procedures in dealing with immigration applications; or be it the differing pay rates for young people just because they are young and, more to the point, the assertion that discrimination on the basis of their age is actually good for employment prospects. In the view of the Australian Democrats discrimination can never be justified on economic grounds. To quote my colleague Senator Bartlett, `we live in a society, not in an economy'.
Be it the denial of superannuation benefits to same sex couples or unequal ages of consent for heterosexual and homosexual males, or be it indifference to people with mobility or sensory impediment and their full participation in social life, these too are abuses of human rights and they form part of the continuum that means that our fellow human beings are treated with less than the respect they deserve and to which they are entitled, particularly because they are Australians.
It is a sad indictment of our political system that those groups which seem to have the loudest and best funded voices are the ones which appear to have the ear of government. We hardly need to be reminded that for this government it is large multinational private 
 corporations which presently have that ear. HREOC exists as an ear for those in society who are not necessarily loud or well funded. The recent cuts to HREOC have served only to limit that role. It is now becoming clear through questioning at estimates hearings exactly what these cuts will mean to Australia's human rights watchdog. In real terms, the cuts will exponentially increase the delays in the handling of complaints of discrimination. There will necessarily be an abandonment of major research and development projects directed at reducing and eliminating discrimination against, and abuse of, those classes of persons protected by federal human rights and antidiscrimination law. There will be an abandonment of or, at the very least, a significant reduction in public educational activities directed towards reducing and eliminating discrimination against and abuse of those classes of persons protected by federal human rights and antidiscrimination law.
The Australian Democrats condemn the government for its cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Further, this week the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee will report to the Senate on the government's amendments to the human rights commission. I will not pre-empt the committee's findings except to say that in my view, and in the view of the Australian Democrats, I hope that the committee will find that the efficiency of HREOC is central to the functioning of our democracy. Be that as it may, while this is indeed a government bill, the Australian Democrats acknowledge that this is not a bill of the government's making.
The constitutional validity of HREOC has had a long and chequered history. Until the High Court's Brandy decision in 1995, the system—known as the tripartite structure for discrimination complaints of conciliation—in an inquiry by the commission and a possible de novo hearing in the Federal Court, met with significant criticism on the grounds that it was inefficient and prone to exacerbate rather than ameliorate the distress of the complainant. This situation was summarised by the former member for Kennedy Mr Rob 
 Hulls, who described that process, as it then existed, in the following way:
To my mind, the whole process is an abuse of human rights.
In light of these concerns, the question of the status of commission determinations was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in 1990. The majority committee report recommended that HREOC decisions be allowed for registration of decisions in the Federal Court. In accordance with that majority report, the Labor government introduced the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 which, among other things, amended the newly enacted Disability Discrimination Act 1992, the Human Rights Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act to allow registration of the commission's determinations in the Federal Court. The whole intention of amendments was to have the effect as if a HREOC decision was an order of the Federal Court.
The High Court had other views when the constitutional validity was tested in the Brandy case, and I think it is important to summarise what happened in that case. In the Brandy decision the enforcement procedures of the 1992 act were the subject of challenge. Following a complaint lodged with the human rights commission pursuant to the Racial Discrimination Act, the commission found that Mr Brandy had breached the RDA and had made a determination including the payment of damages. The determination was duly registered in the Federal Court. Mr Brandy challenged the constitutional validity of the determination on the basis that it was an exercise in judicial power which may be conferred upon only a court and not an administrative body such as HREOC. The High Court unanimously found that the provisions within the RDA which allowed determinations of the commission to be enforced through registration in the Federal Court offended the separation of powers and was thereby unconstitutional.
It has been important to take some time to point to this chequered history because, as I stated earlier, clearly there has been no malevolence from the government in this bill 
 that is presently before the chamber. The Australian Democrats, because of the constitutional imperative, are convinced of that fact and, indeed, we are convinced of the urgency of the bill.
The fact remains that there is no place for determinations to go now, other than to a Commonwealth court. Having said that, the Australian Democrats remain conscious of the consequences of having matters before courts. We are ever mindful of the principles of access to justice and, on that basis, we have made representations to the government concerning the implications of those access issues. In contrast with the Australian Labor Party, we will look creatively and constructively at the government's proposal to establish a federal magistracy, certainly to the extent that this new and emergency jurisdiction will reduce costs and the delays that exist in the present Commonwealth court system. Honourable senators, we each carry the responsibility of working towards the dignity of our fellow Australians. The human rights commission is an honourable institution that is arriving at the next stage in its evolution.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-09-20,"—The Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  makes some amendments to that law which affects the human rights of Australians. It is made necessary, amongst other things, by the decision in Brandy's case, which said that the system as it used to exist could not stand with chapter III of the Constitution. So this is a means of giving people an ability to vindicate rights that they have, and that is as it ought to be.
Senator Greig was talking about going to the courts. The idea under the old system was that people should be able to vindicate their rights in a way that was quick and fair, of course, and of reasonable cost. Hopefully, that will not be lost when it goes to the Federal Court.
I think that Australia may gain by matters going to the Federal Court, because there is need for a jurisprudence at the level of the Federal Court to tell Australians what their rights are. In contrast to comparable countries, Australia is not well equipped with legislation. I think England now has a human rights 
 act which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights. So it has legislation. The United States, of course, has its rights constitutionally guaranteed. Canada has an act of parliament, and so does New Zealand.
So Australia is alone amongst like countries in the sense that it has not got legislation as specific as the legislation that operates in those countries. But it has got other great institutions which look at legislation in a way that I think could well bear emulation in other places. For example, may I refer to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, a fine committee which looks at legislation against certain tests, which are really tests that go to the issue of civil liberties. Can I also mention the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, which is now well chaired by Senator Coonan, who is here, which again looks to see whether or not legislation—or in this case, delegated legislation—accords with those principles of justice which any decent community should think were correct.
While I am mentioning people in that context, I see the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, and also Mr Peter O'Keefe, who have served with those committees. They will attest to the very effective work that those two committees have done over the years. It does show the use that parliament can make of its committees and the approach that the parliament can take, if it is so minded, towards seeing that it as a legislature ensures that the laws that Australian makes are in accordance with those human rights that we want. I think you, Madam Acting Deputy President Crowley—since we are mentioning people—were a member of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I think you and the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, went off to England. I think it was the first all women's committee that this parliament sent overseas. I think Senator Patterson also joined that group.
What I want to illustrate by the address I have given so far is that parliament itself should never forget that it has obligations to human rights and obligations to see that the legislation that comes out of this place is in accordance with the rule of law, which is really what we are talking about when we talk about human rights. Rights are a concept that 
 must be married to the concept of the rule of law—that overarching body of values and principles by which we all live and which, when it is all said and done, the world has seen the need for throughout history.
I would just like to go down a list of codes that have, over the centuries, attempted to do what in a small way we are attempting to do here. If you look back over the millenniums there are the matters about which we used to learn in history, such as the Code of Hammurabi; the Ten Commandments, which is a classic one for a country like ours; the Charter of Cyrus the Great; the Code of Manu in the west; the Magna Carta; the Koran; the Bill of Rights; and the Declaration of Independence. The Atlantic Charter was made during the war. After the war, in 1948, we had the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1966 there was the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. There was the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so on. The concept of enforcing human rights is embedded in our history and, hopefully, embedded in our souls and our minds. This legislation we are talking about today is absolutely essential.
People say that human rights are a sort of add-on and that they are not terribly important. Not only are they important but they are the essence of what it is to be human. In my youth, which was some time ago now, like all people of that time I was interested in cowboy stories. There was one novel I remember reading called The Ox-Bow Incident by Walter Van Tilburg Clark. It was about a lynching.
—It was a very good movie, too.
—It was a very good movie, as Senator Schacht says. The story went that people were apprehended by a lynch party—a group of cowboys—who then, on the most convincing of evidence, as they saw it, hung them. They carried out justice as they saw it ought to be carried out. Of course, it turned out that they were wrong. They had applied lynch law instead of going through the processes. People often condemn those processes, but they are absolutely essential for 
 people to go through if they are to get justice. A terrible injustice was done.
The other story, which more people may have read, was To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.
—Another good movie. It won an Academy Award.
—Another good movie. Again, it shows what human rights are all about and the processes you must go through if you are going to get justice and fairness.
I think we can all go back over our lives and remember the injustices done to us and, no doubt, the injustices we have done to others. That is the sort of thing that remains in the mind rather than whether you earned a particular sum of money in a particular period, although that of course is important. It is in that context that I say that although we discuss in this chamber time and again, and properly so, the economic forces that rule the world, we do not spend enough time on looking at the forces of justice that should prevail around the world and should prevail in this society.
This parliament always has new issues to look at. One of those issues is determining whether there are any invasions of human rights in relation to matters that are contracted out from government. We have a mindset that matters run by the Public Service, matters that are in the public hands, are subject to scrutiny by parliament. But a problem has arisen with contracting out services. I will give an illustration of that: contracting out the detention of people—I would say the imprisonment—under the Migration Act. That is now in private hands and the contract is not as available as it should be.
I have discussed this matter by letter with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, who has done much work in this place in relation to Amnesty International. He is known for his appetite to see that civil rights are properly exercised. He has offered to show me the contract, as long as I keep it private. That is a generous offer but an offer that cannot be usefully accepted where you want such matters to be made available to the public. He says it is not so 
 much the commercial-in-confidence point that he wants to take but rather the issue that, if contracts are available to the public, then there might be all sorts of legal actions, with people being sued, and it is all likely to get out of hand.
I do think that contracts should be made available to the public—it is the taxpayers' money that is involved—so that people's rights and, in particular, their human rights can be protected, in the sense that parliamentarians should be able to see whether contractors are carrying out the contracts as they should be. One of the ways to do this is for parliamentarians to visit the places where we have others incarcerated. But it is also proper that contracts—from now on, in any event—should be made on the basis that they be available to be scrutinised publicly. In any event, I thank Mr Ruddock for the offers he has made in that regard.
The bill itself has all the best intentions, but one of the problems—a very big problem which has been spoken about by previous speakers in this debate—is the issue of how all members of the public can make use of Commonwealth legislation to help vindicate their rights. We have the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act of 1986, the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975—a seminal act in this area—the Sex Discrimination Act of 1984 and the Disability Discrimination Act, of which Senator Evans so eloquently spoke before. It is easy enough to make legislation; the real issue is how we can make the provisions of those acts available to the people who might want to exercise them.
We come back to one of the great issues in this parliament, and that is the issue of legal aid. The taxpayers' dollar must be spent jealously, and we must have due regard to the priorities that are to be given. But, if we do not devote more resources to enabling people to exercise their rights, the whole structure will be available only to those who can afford it and, as has been said by speakers before me, that is not a good thing.
It is time that this parliament exercised its mind on how to get that done. We need more money and more resources, yes; but we must also see how things can be done much more 
 expeditiously in this electronic age. We really ought to look at it. We have to protect human rights in terms of the legislation that comes out of this place. We have to ensure that the actual provisions that are made do not insult the rights that people have. We have to make those rights available to them.
We as a nation have taken a very big step over the last few days in terms of vindicating universal human rights. That, of course, as has been mentioned in this debate on a couple of occasions, has to do with the issue of East Timor. If we do not believe in human rights and the rule of law, and if we do not attach the importance that we should to those issues, then of course we should not go to East Timor. We have chosen to do so because we consider that there are basic values, entitlements and issues that should surround the lives of us all and that, if they are to be prejudiced, there comes a time when we have got to do something about them.
Australia does not have the protections it should have in its formal structures and laws. On the other hand, there is a culture in the community which is very protective of rights. Again, the East Timor situation has shown that. During the committee stage of the debate, I may have more to say about these issues. This bill presents an opportunity for a debate which should take place again and again. Parliament is most admired for its vindication of rights and for the rule of law. It is good to see that this is an occasion on which we can keep that tradition going.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1,speech
"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I rise to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . Again, as others from the opposition have indicated, in general we support the bill, but with a number of very important amendments which we trust the government will be able to support. The bill, as others have said, has had a long gestation period brought about by decisions of courts, even going to the High Court in the so-called Brandy case, and it goes back to the previous government. There have been Senate committees of inquiry—references committees and legislation committees. The bill was considered before the parliament was prorogued for the last election.
The government has again returned with a bill which deals with a number of human rights matters. As I say, some of these matters were previously brought about on the initiative of the then Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, and the government has added some of its own. The first one is, of course, the Brandy case, in which the High Court found that the structure and operation of a part of the HREOC was unconstitutional, and therefore amendments had to be made. This matter was being dealt with by the then Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, when the previous Labor government went out of office. I must say that Mr Lavarch, in his period as Attorney-General, made significant decisions in a number of areas aimed at improving human rights in this country and also arguing for human rights values in the wider international community. There is much that he can be proud of in his period as Attorney-General.
As I say, the opposition supports the bill overall but with reservations. We are proposing a number of amendments. A very important amendment which my colleagues have mentioned concerns the change in the structure of HREOC to abolish the five specialist commissioners that are now available to deal with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander matters, social justice, human rights and disability, racial and sexual discrimination and to replace them with three deputy presidents with responsibility for human rights and disability discrimination, racial discrimination and social justice, and sex discrimination and equal opportunity. There is a less specific and broader description of their responsibilities. We will be moving amendments opposing that change.
We believe that there is a very strong case for having specialist commissioners. It identifies in the public's mind that there is a remedy through HREOC to have issues they are concerned about dealt with. We believe HREOC still has a very important part to play in educating the public about the rights they have. It has been a new aspect in Australia's political, constitutional and legal history over the past 20 years to have an ever-expanding focus on human rights. I do not think anybody would deny the fact that it is long 
 overdue for the public to have the right to have remedy in the law through an appropriate tribunal and then remedy to the court when they have been harshly done by.
Some have argued that this is social engineering, and there has been much criticism by conservatives that this is opening up a Pandora's box that leads to unnecessary litigation and disputation in the community—and that it encourages minority groups to launch vexatious legal cases to tie up the courts and disturb the longstanding legal and social arrangements we have in this community.
That is not a view the opposition has. Over the last 20-odd years or more, the Labor Party, in government and in opposition, has argued that, if we really want a democratic society, those who are disadvantaged and do not have access to the normal structures of our community should have the right to have their case heard.
Occasionally, those decisions of HREOC have led to consternation amongst conservative elements of our community. This has led to the government being pressured to get rid of the specialist commissioners who are often seen as being at the forefront of taking decisions that have affected longstanding traditions, conventions and operations in society. Therefore, we think it would be a backward step in the evolution of human rights in this country to have these specialist commissioners removed. I do not say that it would be a calamitous step to remove them and replace them with three deputy presidents with a more broadly defined role, but I think it would be unnecessary—and certainly the opposition thinks so.
The basic issue that we are arguing about in this bill and have argued about in related bills over the last 20 years is really that of access to justice. We accept that if you lack financial resources in this community your access to justice will be greatly curtailed and limited. In the late eighties and early nineties I was a member of the Senate legal and constitutional committee chaired by Senator Cooney which looked at the issue of the high cost of justice in Australia.
—To be fair, you're the one who got the issue of the cost of justice going.
—I thank Senator Cooney for his interjection that I played some role. Sometimes lawyers have a rather populist role in exposing the issues of the high cost of justice—
—Not populist, popular.
—Populist and popular issues about the operation of the legal system in this country. Because of its high costs and its restricted nature it often disadvantaged ordinary Australians.
Some of the issues we raised initially have now been dealt with by both sides of politics, and we have now seen a much more genuine move to reform and change the structure of the legal system in this country so that ordinary Australians have access to justice without fear of being crippled financially by the cost. I notice that it is mentioned in this bill that the cost of justice per day—to take a Federal Court case—is $2,000. So one could not imagine any ordinary Australian—average citizen, average wages—faced with the cost of a $2,000 a day hearing in the Federal Court. It would be a big disincentive to take your matter up.
The opposition has made comments in the Senate minority report about how we think that could be better dealt with rather than just allowing the sledgehammer of high cost of legal fees to affect the ability of people to seek remedy, quite rightly, in the court. We also point out that we have complained strongly that in the last three years this government has substantially reduced the money available for legal aid under the guise that this is a state responsibility. We believe that already there are examples—I know it is the case in my own area of veterans affairs—of ordinary citizens being denied the right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or to the Federal Court, because they did not have access to legal aid funding. The cutback that the federal government has imposed on the legal aid system, now running into hundreds of millions of dollars, is one of the more disgraceful episodes on its record.

The number is estimated to be in the region of 140,000. There is also, as one would expect, a significant number of persons who are away from their own normal location inside East Timor.
We certainly support the visit of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Ogata, to West Timor, and we welcome her intention to deploy staff in that area. The government is certainly very disturbed by reports of the situation in West Timor, particularly reports that relief agency staff still face difficulties moving about freely. There are some signs that the security situation in East Timor has stabilised over the past few days.

I would have thought that it is an abuse of the standing orders, as well as the intention of the Senate in designing the committee system, particularly on a day when the Senate will be debating that legislation, to create a debate on the report at this stage.
Again, as I have done on a number of occasions, I remind the Senate that creating a debate on the tabling of a report is indeed not envisaged by the standing orders. That is why Senator Sherry needs to seek leave here. On granting Senator Sherry leave—which I would never on normal occasions refuse, particularly to him—I would certainly remind him that this bill should be on for debate within a matter of a few hours this very day. I am just reminded that I am talking about a different bill. So, Senator Sherry, I give you leave immediately, but my points still stand.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS AND TERMINATION PAYMENTS TAXES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Report of Economics Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-09-20,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
I  think  you  were  talking  about  the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 , Senator Campbell. I will not speak at length on this matter. I just want to highlight a couple of points in this report. There will be an opportunity at a later date, as Senator Campbell has inaccurately reminded us.
This is an important report because it deals with the highly controversial so-called superannuation surcharge or tax. I want to draw to the Senate's attention that this legislation will be the third package of amendments to the superannuation tax. It deals with a number of critical issues. It deals with the removal of the 
 requirement for the Commissioner of Taxation to determine an advance instalment of the so-called surcharge; it provides for a self-assessment regime for certain superannuation providers; and it allegedly clarifies the definition of surcharge contributions and how they are to be calculated.
I do want to draw to the attention of the Senate the contents of the Labor senators' minority report, and I will do so briefly. As I have said, it is particularly disappointing that this bill represents the third major legislative policy change to the superannuation surcharge tax. On many occasions the Liberal government, particularly the current Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, have been forewarned about the inherent flaws in the superannuation tax collection mechanism—not just by the Labor opposition but by almost every commentator, economist, accountant, actuary and financial planner who is involved in the superannuation industry in some way. It was Mr Noel Davis from Clayton Utz, amongst many others, who passionately highlighted the very problems of determining a notional surcharge contribution factor as it applies to defined benefit funds.
What we have in respect of the first aspect of the legislation is a complete backflip by this government, as represented by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, in respect of removing the advance instalment provisions for the collection of the so-called surcharge or tax. I can recall that when this legislation originally went through the Senate I pointed out the following question to the chamber and to the government: how can you collect an advance instalment of a tax when the tax office does not know what the income will be of people at some future date? I submitted at that time, some 2½ years ago, that that was a fairly fundamental flaw in respect of collecting the advance instalment.
We are not talking about peanuts in terms of revenue collection; we are talking about $120 million in revenue. The government has done a total backflip on this aspect of the legislation and decided to abandon the advance instalment collection of the so-called superannuation surcharge. When I asked Senator Kemp about this issue at the Senate 
 committee hearings, Senator Kemp maintained, `We still feel that the original bill was sound.' If the original bill was sound, what is the explanation for the government abandoning an advance instalment that collects $120 million in revenue? What is the explanation? Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer, as is his wont and his record, could not provide any explanation whatsoever for the abandonment of a commitment to collecting $120 million in revenue.
The Liberal government cannot have it both ways. If they are abolishing the advance instalment, then either the surcharge tax is flawed and the advance instalment cannot be collected and that abandonment is a result of a substantial policy change, or, as Senator Kemp argued before the committee some two weeks ago, the original bill is sound. Senator Kemp's and the government's position on the advance instalment and its abandonment is a total contradiction. There is a total lack of adequate justification for the government's policy changes with respect to the abandonment of the advance instalment, as advanced or not advanced on this occasion by the Assistant Treasurer.
It may perhaps be that the original criticisms of the advance instalment as advanced not just by me, I might say to the Senate chamber, but by every reputable commentator in the area of superannuation—every actuary, every economist, every accountant and every financial planner—that you could not collect an advance instalment of a tax when you do not know what the income levels of persons in future will be is a very basic flaw. That is one of the issues that is highlighted in this report. I do not want to take all of the 10 minutes that are available to me because there is a range of other matters I will be commenting on when this legislation comes before the Senate.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1999-09-20,"—I would like to make some comments to wind up the debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999 . I might bypass the general introductory remarks and go straight to the things that need to be said. In relation to the role of commissioners, a major reform in the bill involves the consolidation of the three complaint handling schemes contained in the racial, sex and disability discrimination acts into a single uniform scheme contained in the one act. The new scheme will simplify the complaint handling process and incorporate best practice procedural provisions. In addition, the president will be responsible for complaint handling under the new scheme. Centralisation will overcome deficiencies in the existing complaint handling processes and improve the commission's capacity to utilise its resources and to deliver services in a more efficient manner. It should also assist in promoting consistent and coordinated practices for all complaints.
That is not to say, however, that the expertise of commissioners will not be utilised in relation to the acts for which they are primarily responsible. Commissioners will have a new role in which they will be able to appear as an amicus, or friend, of the court in order to explain how they consider the antidiscrimination acts should be interpreted. The commissioners' expertise will also be utilised in the complaints area. The work done by commissioners in relation to their areas—in particular, any guidelines or reports prepared by them—will be taken into account in relation to the general approach to be taken on complaint handling. Thus, while commissioners will not be involved in handling individual complaints, as this would present conflicts of interest in relation to their amicus role, the president will have their assistance 
 in the broader direction to be taken in relation to complaints.
I note that some have criticised the bill on the grounds that it may make it more difficult to pursue a complaint. This criticism appears to be based on factors such as the more formal nature of the Federal Court proceedings and the exposure to fees and costs. In response to those criticisms, the following points need to be made. First, the existing system, introduced by the previous government, can hardly be described as efficient or cost effective. There are potentially three levels of dispute resolution, two of which are unenforceable, causing unnecessary delay and expense. Under the proposed scheme, if conciliation is unsuccessful, the parties have direct access to the Federal Court, where they will be able to obtain an enforceable determination of their respective rights. The scheme has the potential to address significant delays in the current system and to reduce the costs associated with obtaining a binding determination in antidiscrimination matters.
Second, it has been claimed that the fees and costs to take cases to the Federal Court will be prohibitive. This bill has not proposed anything different from the current system. People seeking now to enforce determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Federal Court are subject to standard court fees and cost regimes. In this context, I also note that it is planned that the proposed Federal Magistrates Service will have jurisdiction over human rights complaints which have not been satisfactorily conciliated in the commission. Legislation to establish the magistrates service was introduced into parliament on 24 June 1999. One of the attractions of the service is that it will keep costs down for litigants. It will utilise streamlined procedures in a less formal judicial culture, which should allow for quicker resolution of cases. There should be reduced delays in having matters dealt with, which should lead to fewer interlocutory procedures and fewer court appearances by litigants and their representatives. Procedures before federal magistrates will be simplified, which will also act as a factor to reduce costs. Many litigants in the human rights jurisdiction 
 are expected to be unrepresented, and they will also be helped by simplified procedures. All of these factors should help reduce costs and result in savings for litigants both in terms of time and money.
In relation to costs, the bill leaves open the possibility that a person taking a case to the Federal Court may be exposed to an adverse costs order. As I have said, this is no different from the current regime. The government has considered alternative approaches and, noting the Federal Court's wide discretion in this regard, considers that the standard regime provides the best protection for all parties and should continue to apply. Thus, while generally costs are awarded to the successful party, the court may decide that the special circumstances of a case indicate a different order should be made. The government considers that one of the main advantages of allowing the normal costs rules to apply is that more lawyers will be encouraged to represent indigent applicants in human rights disputes where a case has real merit.
This view was supported by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee back in 1997. The commission indicated that the growth in contingency arrangements—that is, don't win, don't pay—and the potential for a costs order against the opposing party are likely to give complainants a better chance of getting lawyers to act in discrimination cases without the payment of up-front legal fees. The commission has recently reiterated its view that normal costs rules should apply. The Law Council of Australia also supports the government's position.
It is not necessarily the case that people will need to engage lawyers to represent them in proceedings. The bill provides that parties may be represented by people who are not barristers or solicitors unless the court is of the opinion that it is inappropriate in the circumstances for the other person to appear. This will allow parties to be represented by a particular interest group or peak body—for example, by their trade union, a disabilities advocacy group, an Aboriginal legal service or a women's support service—or any other 
 organisation providing assistance to people in the sex, race and disability discrimination fields. Senators should also note that, where there is hardship, either party to a proceeding will be able to apply to the Attorney-General for financial assistance for the proceedings. This will also assist in reducing the costs faced by a party to proceedings in the court.
On the matter of fees, while the government considers that the usual rule as to costs should apply in relation to human rights litigation, the government has noted the concerns raised in discussions with the commission, the Australian Democrats and disability groups in relation to court fees. I am pleased to advise the government has agreed that a flat $50 fee will apply to bringing discrimination cases before the Federal Court. This fee will be the only fee payable for human rights cases in the court. This change will be achieved by amending the Federal Court regulations, as is appropriate, rather than amending the bill.
The government regards the special fee arrangement as appropriate in the context of a system where the usual rule as to costs will apply to human rights cases in the Federal Court. Of course the normal rules under the Federal Court regulations as to a waiver of fees for those in financial hardship continue to apply so that those human rights litigants who qualify for a waiver will not be required to pay any fees. This measure, in combination with the introduction of a Federal Magistrates Service, will significantly reduce the costs associated with human rights litigation under the new arrangements.
There have been some general matters raised in relation to access and equity, and the bill contains a number of initiatives designed to reduce formality in Federal Court proceedings which will possibly lead to less reliance on legal representation. The court will be able to adopt informal  procedures as it will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms. Although the bill makes no provision as regards the rules of evidence, the court will have the usual discretion to waive the application of the rules in appropriate circumstances.
In addition, the commission is naturally interested in the conduct of human rights litigation in the Federal Court and currently 
 reviews case law as part of its responsibilities for administering human rights legislation. The commission has indicated that it would continue to undertake this role and would draw the government's attention to any concerns it may have if it considers that formality or technicality has compromised decisions and therefore the effectiveness of this legislation. The Attorney-General's Department of course also monitors the case law and would bring any such concerns to the government's attention.
When the bill was being debated in the House, the opposition moved amendments seeking to extend the definition of a discriminatory act under an award beyond the provisions contained in the Sex Discrimination Act. The Sex Discrimination Act currently includes a power to refer discriminatory awards and agreements to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and discriminatory determinations to the Remuneration Tribunal or the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal. The opposition's amendments sought to extend this referral power to the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act.
The government has no in principle objection to the opposition's proposal, but the drafting resources required to properly give effect to the proposal are substantial and we consider that it would be better to leave consideration of this issue until a later date. The Attorney-General's Department is currently undertaking a review of all Commonwealth human rights and antidiscrimination legislation, with a view to consolidating that legislation into one act. The government undertakes to ensure that the opposition's proposals are considered in that process.
In the debate Senator Evans criticised the government in relation to recent processes for the prescription of laws pursuant to 47(2) of the Disability Discrimination Act. That act indicates that responsibility for consultation with relevant stakeholders lies with the individual state or territory which is seeking to have its legislation prescribed. To ensure that this process occurs, the Attorney-General has undertaken to seek formal assurances from the relevant state or territory minister 
 that any necessary consultation with all stakeholders has taken place before any prescriptions under the act are undertaken. In addition, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Office of Disability in the Department of Family and Community Services will be consulted on any future proposed prescriptions.
Senator Bolkus and Senator Cooney raised the issue of legal aid funding for human rights matters. The proposed new section 46PU of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act provides for a scheme of financial assistance for matters arising in the Federal Court. The scheme provides that applications for assistance may be made to the Attorney-General by a person who has commenced or proposes to commence proceedings before the Federal Court and the Attorney may authorise assistance if satisfied that to refuse assistance would involve hardship and it is reasonable in all of the circumstances to grant the application. Any grant of assistance may be made with or without conditions.
Discrimination matters which are likely to be of public benefit continue to be a Commonwealth priority for assistance. That is reflected in the priorities and guidelines the Commonwealth has established in the legal aid funding arrangements that it has made with the states and territories. In addition, the Commonwealth will continue to provide funding for assistance in disability discrimination cases through the community legal service network. I think that covers the points that were raised that need to be answered. I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-09-20,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999  is intended to give effect to the government's 1998 budget changes to the regulation of small superannuation funds—do-it-yourself or excluded funds—and to a recommendation of the financial system inquiry, the Wallis inquiry. Primarily, it amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993—SI(S) Act for short—and a range of other related financial services, taxation and superannuation acts to implement three main changes. First, it will establish a new category of small super fund with fewer than five members, to be called a self-managed fund, where all the members of the fund must have a business or family relationship—non arms-length—and must become trustees of the fund. Second, it will transfer the regulation of self-managed funds from the 
 Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to the Australian Taxation Office with effect from 1 July 1999. Finally, it will provide for a reduced supervisory levy, from $200 to a maximum of $50, to be payable by self-managed super funds.
The arguments that the government has proposed for the changes contained in this bill are some of the weakest that have been presented before this Senate. According to the 1998 budget papers, there is no revenue implications involved in this policy change, while the explanatory memorandum states that changes to the superannuation supervisory levy are expected to have a budget revenue cost of around $19 million in each of the financial years 1999-2000 to 2001-02. The Treasury stated in a briefing on this bill that they expect this revenue to be recouped through user charging principles applied by the ATO and APRA. So this is clearly not a savings measure. It is difficult to determine exactly why the government has proposed this bill, other than to create even more confusion in the superannuation industry, which must shudder at budget time and whenever the government mentions tax system changes or an inquiry into the financial services sector.
The government does seem to be trying to make a case that there are some members of excluded superannuation funds who are perhaps not able to best represent their interests in the fund. These members might be at arms length from the trustees of the scheme and are more than likely to be employee members of small employer sponsored funds. However, the government has offered absolutely no evidence in support of the proposal that arms-length members are being somehow misrepresented in their fund. Indeed, it is simply asserted that this is the case or may be the case in the future. So, based on no evidence and armed with nothing more than a theory, the government has presented this bill and expects the Senate to pass it in its current form. While this is the prerogative of every government—although perhaps not the prerogative of what is left of the Kennett government—it is the responsibility of the opposition and all senators in this place to ensure that laws which pass this Senate are sensible 
 and do not impose unfair or unnecessary burdens on those who are affected by them. It is Labor's view that this legislation in its current form will impose a range of burdens on the trustees and administrators of excluded superannuation funds. It will also have an adverse impact on the same sex couples who operate an excluded superannuation fund, as well as members of funds who are not related to each other.
The Senate Economics Legislation Committee has examined this bill in detail and reported on 22 June 1999. Labor senators found that the bill in its current form would increase complexity and confusion by introducing the ATO as a third superannuation regulator, increase costs to excluded funds which may be forced to restructure as a result of the provisions in the bill, trigger a CGT liability and possibly a stamp duty liability for funds which have no other practical option but to transfer ineligible members out of the fund, discriminate against same sex couples who are currently legitimate members or trustees of excluded superannuation funds and contradict the key objective of increasing protection for arms-length fund members who are currently in excluded funds. With that in mind, Labor will be moving an amendment which is designed to ensure that the disruption and additional costs imposed on excluded superannuation funds are kept to a minimum while still ensuring that the government's bill remains largely intact.
It ought to be noted that the government's delay in introducing this bill has caused unnecessary uncertainty and cost, especially amongst small business owners. This measure, which was first announced on 12 May 1998, was not introduced into the parliament until 31 March 1999. An exposure draft was released but with only two weeks for comment. This sort of delay is simply not good enough. The government has been the master of government by press release, and it has found itself in trouble as a result of it on more than one occasion. The Liberal government says that it represents small businesses, but all it is doing with this bill is unnecessarily introducing more red tape, more cost and more confusion. Think of the cost to small 
 businesses which operate superannuation funds in dealing with the superannuation surcharge tax nightmare as well as the GST nightmare on main street. Small businesses must be wondering where it will all end. It is clear that the passage of this bill will cause increased complexity and confusion for members, trustees and administrators of do-it-yourself funds.
However, the opposition is willing to give qualified support to the public policy intention of this measure—that is, we are supportive of the case that some arms-length members of excluded superannuation funds may not best be able to represent their interests under the current framework. This is specifically the case with employees who may be members of employer sponsored do-it-yourself funds. The often unequal nature of the relationship between employees and employers means that some employees may not be able to best represent their interests in these types of DIY funds. This could still be the case even if the employees were to become trustees of the fund. We will be moving an amendment which will prevent employees being members of employer sponsored DIY funds but will allow non-employees to remain or become members of the fund provided they also become trustees.
The opposition considers that the increased cost and confusion resulting from the measures in this bill could be largely overcome by a government commitment to an effective education campaign following the passage of the bill. Funding for the education campaign could come from existing ATO resources or possibly from a small increase in the significantly reduced supervisory levy. Ensuring appropriate compliance with the law will be an integral part of appropriate supervision, and education is an important part of getting best practice levels of compliance. An example of this is the high rate of compliance with the superannuation guarantee legislation as a result of the highly successful education campaign conducted by the Labor government. Unfortunately, money earmarked by the Labor government in 1995 for a community superannuation education campaign was cut completely by the coalition government in the 
 1997 budget, to the detriment of the understanding of superannuation by the general community. That money was obviously not part of Mr Howard's core promises. The fact that Labor's superannuation guarantee education campaign has resulted in such a high compliance rate and a growing understanding of the importance of superannuation is a good lesson and one that a smart government would take note of.
This bill proposes three major changes. The first is a new definition of self-managed super fund and fund membership changes. DIY super funds are currently subject to less onerous prudential regulations than larger funds which come under the control of the SI(S) Act and regulations. This is based on the presumption that most DIY fund members are closely associated with the fund and its trustees and are likely to be able to represent their own interests as non arms-length members. Some 16 per cent or approximately 30,000 of the 180,000 DIY funds contain arms-length members who, the government claims, might not be able to protect their interests in the superannuation fund and who do not have the full prudential protection of the regulator. To overcome this potential problem, the bill requires all members of a self-managed fund to be family members or business relations, on the assumption that family members or business partners will be able to look after their own interests. In addition, all fund members will be required to become trustees. Under the bill, a member who does not fit into one of these categories will be transferred out of the fund. Alternatively, the fund may not wish to be a self-managed fund, in which case it might appoint an independent trustee and will be regulated by APRA. The fund also has the option of winding up.
The government has not provided any evidence in support of this change which will inconvenience many small superannuation funds, many of which are run by small businesses. The bill will also force fund trustees to expel some arms-length fund members, potentially incurring substantial costs to the fund, its members and the transferring member. There is no sound public policy purpose 
 for requiring fund members to be related either by family or through business but not through an employer-employee relation. The government argues that related fund members are better able to represent their interests in the fund—an argument that statistically is unsustainable and inconsistent with divorce, bankruptcy and other white-collar crime statistics such as theft and fraud. Just because you are somebody's daughter, wife, sister, grandparent, uncle or business partner does not mean that you will not be ripped off by that person. The provision requiring fund members to be related creates problems for friends and/or same sex members of existing DIY funds and will potentially cause a capital gains tax liability. For example, a fund member who is not related will force the trustees to take one of two possible actions: first, roll the non-related person out of the fund into another fund which is likely to be APRA regulated; or, second, change the structure of the fund to an APRA regulated small fund which requires the appointment of an improved trustee.
Either one of the above options will result in increased costs for the fund, the possibility of a CGT liability—as assets may have to be liquidated to pay out an ineligible fund member's interest—and the exclusion of friends and/or same sex partners from their existing fund if they do not have a business relationship. This outcome is otherwise largely preventable by maintaining the provision that permits all self-managed fund members, except employees, to become trustees of the fund and allowing the option that fund members do not have to be related. By becoming a trustee of the fund, a former arms-length fund member should be better able to protect their own interests. The opposition's amendment will allow more flexibility for existing DIY fund members and trustees and will also allow some arms-length members currently in DIY super funds to continue with their current fund arrangements.
A problem also arises for some funds that may have difficulty in finding and appointing an approved trustee if they are required to restructure to become an APRA regulated small fund. APRA has a discretion to ensure 
 that the fund is complying, and it is hoped that APRA will exercise its discretion in an appropriate and fair way.
A question has also arisen concerning the validity of not permitting employer sponsored funds with fewer than five members to access the equal representation provisions which are available to employer sponsored funds with more than four members. Fewer than five members funds with arms-length members which do not become self-managed funds must restructure and appoint an approved trustee. This issue appears inconsistent and may require further amendment, although the opposition will not be pursuing this at this stage.
Second, the proposed regulatory transfer to the ATO has been described by one commentator as `like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank'. Small superannuation fund operators and their accountants and administrators are worried that the ATO may not only crack down on persons allegedly rorting the system but also take a stricter line with funds which appear to be operating within the law. While this is in line with a Wallis inquiry recommendation, it appears to be based on the fact that it is impractical for the APRA to do anything but superficially regulate these funds. APRA generally conducts field audits and would require large additional resources to have any hope of auditing the 180,000 DIY funds it currently regulates. There are only around 5,000 industry, retail, corporate and public sector funds.
APRA's incapacity to effectively regulate excluded funds presented governments with a twofold problem of ensuring DIY funds were complying—and, hence, eligible for concessional taxation treatment—and had an appropriate level of prudential regulation to protect arms-length members, often employees in small employer funds. Arguably, if APRA cannot effectively regulate DIY funds, this could lead to an abuse of investment rules and possible taxation avoidance. Transfer of the regulation to the ATO may curtail this if it is occurring.
Before the Wallis inquiry, superannuation funds were regulated only by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The transfer 
 of prudential regulation for self-managed super funds to the ATO will result in superannuation being regulated by three different entities: APRA, ATO and ASIC, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. This is in direct contrast to the main Wallis recommendation that essentially only two bodies, APRA and ASIC, should be responsible for the regulation of the financial services sector. However, Labor will not be opposing the transfer to the ATO, which should result in better compliance regulation. It is pleasing that the ATO seems to have adopted a positive approach to this role from the start. The opposition's proposed amendment permitting some fund members to become trustees should similarly ensure better protection of members' interests.
Third is the matter of the reduced supervisory levy to be payable by self-managed super funds. Until the formation of APRA on 1 July 1998, all superannuation funds paid $200, plus larger funds paid a percentage of their assets, to cover the costs of their regulation. APRA claims that the $200 paid by DIY funds cross-subsidised the prudential regulation of larger funds. Changes to the levy structure within APRA and the removal of the supposed cross-subsidy by capping the amount payable by DIY—
Senator Kemp interjecting—
—I am trying to complete this debate as fast as I can, Senator Kemp, so I would happily avoid your interjections, if you can control yourself. I know Carlton have made the grand final, and it is an exciting thing for you, but can you just settle down over on that side.
—Brilliant adlibbing!
—Senator McGauran, I would stick to trying to find those pages that you lost before.
—The National Party did okay on Saturday too, didn't they?
—Thank you, Senator Quirke. I will take that interjection.
—Order! Senator Conroy, return to the matter at hand.
—The Democrats had a brilliant showing there as well.
—Senator Conroy, perhaps you could return to the bill.
—That means lower retirement incomes on the part of members of larger superannuation funds, who are more likely to be low and middle income earners.
—Who had a lousy Saturday?
—Kempy was okay. Kempy did not get to show and tell, so you could not tell who he voted for. Very few low and middle income earners would be in DIY funds, which are predominantly recommended to persons with more than $100,000 to invest, although some may be arms-length members. There has been no evidence produced to support the assumption that DIY fund levies were subsidising larger superannuation funds. However, larger funds have not rebutted this assumption nor opposed the lowering of the DIY fund levies. The government may also be counting on using the lowering of levies for self-managed funds as an offset to other changes, including changes to investment rules, which are the subject of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 , to which Labor is currently opposed.
Labor will not be opposing the reduction in the supervisory levy. The opposition will be moving an amendment to this bill to make it fairer and to reduce the cost and complexity this bill forces onto small excluded superannuation funds. It is an amendment which is welcomed by small businesses and the businesses which currently administer excluded superannuation funds, which are often small businesses themselves.
The government's complete lack of evidence as to the necessity of these changes is alarming. There is no revenue involved in this measure. One would anticipate that, if the government were concerned about some sort of rorting, it would provide evidence of lost revenue. That has not been forthcoming. The government should not, however, expect to successfully use the same tactic to get its bill containing changes to the investment rules 
 applying to superannuation funds through the Senate. That bill, which will be examined by a Senate committee, will require substantial evidence in support of it before it gets the support of the opposition.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-09-20,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999  sets out various changes to the prudential regulation of the superannuation industry between the Australian Prudential Regulations Authority, or APRA; the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, or ASIC; and the Australian Taxation Office. It broadly offers the recommendations of the Wallis inquiry into financial services. Most of the bill is non-controversial and, as these provisions have been adequately dealt with by the minister's second reading speech and in the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, I do not propose to repeat them here.
One aspect of the bill that has become controversial is the proposal to deal with self-managed funds. Currently, funds with fewer than five members are excluded from most of the prudential supervision provisions of the SIS legislation. The Wallis inquiry endorsed this approach, recommending that the prudential regulation for self-managed funds be reduced to a minimal level of supervision. It also recommended that this be accentuated by moving the role of regulator from APRA to the ATO. However, the report was concerned to ensure that small funds that had members who were beneficiaries at arm's length should be subject to the full protection of prudential supervision. The report said:
At present, some excluded funds have beneficiaries who are at arm's length from the trustee. This is unsatisfactory to the extent that there is little protection of the interests of these third-party beneficiaries and because there is little scope for effective prudential resolution of such funds. The Inquiry considers that funds which have third-party beneficiaries should not be regarded as excluded funds. On balance, the Committee would prefer to discourage this particular configuration of superannuation schemes. The Committee believes that there is an opportunity to improve the prudence and compliance of excluded funds by requiring all beneficiaries of such funds to be trustees.
The Democrats broadly endorse this approach. However, we are concerned that the govern 
 ment, in implementing this recommendation, has gone too far.
This bill seeks to deny the status of excluded funds to all but those funds where all members are either related or in business together. This approach would exclude a number of arrangements, such as the family accountant becoming a member of the relevant super fund, a same sex partner being a member, or a close friend or distant relative being a member. As such, many groups such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Taxpayers Association and the Law Council were very critical of the proposed narrow relationship definition used to define `not at arm's length'.
The Democrats have long supported the principle that people capable of managing their own superannuation funds should be able to do so. In 1993, when the SIS bills were enacted, we were instrumental in ensuring that small funds were not as constrained as larger funds in terms of assets and supervision. However, we share the concern of the Wallis inquiry that these provisions lessening prudential supervision should not be used to the detriment of the interests of non armslength beneficiaries.
The key question for us in this bill is: whom are we trying to protect? Before we inflict a $6,000 to $7,000 cost impost on small funds by requiring independent trustees, we need to ask: whom are we trying to protect? The fundamental aspect of the occupational superannuation system is that it is about making sure that superannuation is invested in the interests of employees, and that employers do not have access to the funds of their employees just to prop up their own businesses. Similarly, the Democrats have always been concerned to ensure that trustees act in the interests of employees, and that the entire super scheme is structured to deliver maximum benefit to employees.
In terms of reducing the level of prudential supervision of small funds, we would answer the question by saying that it is the interests of employees that we are trying to protect. Thus, where employees are members of a super fund, it is reasonable to insist that independent trustees be appointed. In other cases 
 where business partners, family members or friends join together to manage their own superannuation, provided all members become trustees and have full access to all information about how their funds are invested, it is reasonable that the level of regulation should be minimised. Thus, in the committee stage the Democrats will be supporting amendments to delete the various definitions of relationship determined by the government and instead defining an excluded fund as one that does not include employees of a trustee. This mechanism will ensure that the interests of employees are adequately protected by independent trustees whilst giving self-managed funds more freedom to operate free from excessive regulation.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-09-20,"—The legislation we are dealing with, Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 , can be summarised by the theme that it deals with the structures of investment for the regulation of self-managed superannuation funds, particularly important for small business. It should be examined in conjunction with Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 , which deals with the way in which superannuation moneys can be invested. That is an issue for another debate, but it is related.
There are two schedules to this legislation. The first establishes a new category of small superannuation fund with fewer than five members. It also transfers the regulation of self-managed superannuation funds from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, known as APRA, to the Australian Taxation Office, known as the ATO. There is a new definition of an excluded superannuation fund. In addition to requiring the fund to have fewer than five members, all members of the fund will be required to have a business or family relationship to the trustees of the fund.
The ATO will have responsibility for ensuring that self-managed superannuation funds comply with the non-prudential requirements of superannuation law. A fund that has fewer than five members and that is not self-managed will continue to be subject to prudential supervision of APRA and will be required to appoint an independent trustee.
The second schedule of the legislation provides for a reduced supervisory levy for self-managed funds. By way of background, there are 180,000 excluded funds. Sixteen per cent, or about 30,000 of them, have armslength members. The majority of excluded funds consist of one or two members. There is $42 billion in assets. This comprises 97 per cent of the total number of superannuation funds but represents only—although it is a substantial only in monetary terms—12 per cent of the total assets in superannuation funds and 1.8 per cent of fund members.
A fund is self-managed if it satisfies a number of criteria. Firstly, it has to have fewer than five members. Secondly, all members of the fund must be trustees and there can be no other trustees. Thirdly, there must be a family or business link between each member of the fund.
In the report of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which considered this legislation, a number of adverse impacts are highlighted by several expert witnesses. There will be a number of unfortunate impositions as a consequence of this legislation. They can be broadly categorised into four main concerns. Firstly, there will be increased complexity and confusion by introducing the ATO as a third superannuation regulator. Secondly, there will be increased costs to excluded funds, who will need expert advice on the impact of this bill as a minimum, and may need to restructure—obviously leading to further flow-on costs. Thirdly, there will possibly be a triggering of the capital gains tax liability and the possibility of stamp duty liability. Fourthly, there is discrimination against some relationships, such as of friends; but in particular we should take note that same-sex couples who are currently legitimate members or trustees of an excluded superannuation fund will have to cease the trustee relationship.
For the record, we were disappointed in the evidence given by Treasury and, in particular once again, in that given by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. There clearly was side-stepping and evasiveness once again about the tax liabilities that in particular may be triggered by this legislation. If we look at 
 the government's proposed case for change, the case that is put for changes to the regulation of excluded funds is that arms-length members of excluded funds are not able to best protect their interests in their fund, because it is not regulated by APRA or an approved trustee. There has been little evidence provided for this argument to suggest that arms-length members are not able to best protect their interests in excluded funds. There is a theoretical case that can be put in support of this argument from the Liberal government, but it did not, as usual, present any evidence.
Similarly, the government did not provide evidence in support of the need to transfer the regulation of excluded superannuation funds from APRA to the ATO. It seems that the main reasons for the transfer are twofold. I quote from the evidence given to the committee:
The tax office is better geared and more experienced than APRA in dealing with the large number of returns that would be expected from the small funds. It has the electronic lodgement arrangements and so on that APRA is yet to develop. The facts that, firstly, they do not require prudential supervision—and APRA is a prudential supervisor—and, secondly, the fit in efficiency and processing suggest that the tax office would be a better regulator of these particular funds than what APRA would be.
That is the evidence in support. This evidence does raise some significant concerns. APRA and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, its predecessor, seem to be admitting that they have not been very successful in regulating, in either prudential or compliance terms, excluded superannuation funds in the past.
If this is the case—and there is evidence that excluded funds require further regulation—the transfer of the regulation to the ATO may be—`may be'—prudent public policy. This policy is, however, likely to cause a number of adverse impacts on superannuation funds and their members which must be balanced against any perceived public policy benefits arising from the proposed changes.
There was a range of evidence about adverse impacts on superannuation funds. A number of witnesses suggested that this bill 
 would add to the already enormous complexity and confusion surrounding superannuation regulation in Australia. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia told the committee that the transfer of regulation from APRA to the ATO would create a third regulator where there were previously only two. Superannuation originally had only one regulator, the ISC. This will cause increased confusion among superannuation members, trustees and administrators. Employers are also likely to be confused by the addition of a third regulator—particularly small business will be confused, hurt and hit with increased regulatory complexity yet again.
The Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants suggested to the committee that the introduction of a third regulator for superannuation was anti-Wallis, in that it contradicts the spirit of regulatory consistency and competitive neutrality that was at the heart of the Wallis financial sector inquiry reforms. This evidence directly contradicts Senator Kemp's claim that it is implementing a recommendation of the Wallis report.
ASFA also suggests that having three regulators is likely to result in an inconsistent philosophy applied to the regulation of superannuation. It can be no more inconsistent than the current government's approach philosophically and practically to superannuation matters. If this does occur and the regulators do apply different interpretations to superannuation laws and regulations, greater confusion will occur, to the detriment of retirement incomes policy. The Liberal government has consistently chopped and changed the superannuation rules since it introduced the administratively complex and costly superannuation so-called surcharge—in effect, a tax.
—I knew it. I won my bet.
—Senator Kemp can laugh about what is a very serious issue, the superannuation surcharge tax. We tabled a report today about the abolition of the advance instalment. The retirement incomes policy of the country has been a continuous casualty of the constant confusion caused by these sorts of changes. Further confusion is more likely to occur under the government's legislation, as some small superannuation 
 funds may move between regulators as their circumstances change.
Senator Kemp interjecting—
—Senator Kemp would be better advised to go back down to Victoria and chase up the former Treasurer who retired at the last election—and, in fact, to chase up the Premier, who may be retiring—and just see what they have done about collecting that super tax. As I understand it, nothing has been done about it by Senator Kemp; and he should better concentrate his energies on that particular sort of problem.
I would like to comment now on some aspects of increased costs. One of the alleged purposes of this bill is to reduce the cost of supervision for excluded superannuation funds. Many of the expert witnesses who presented evidence before the committee or made submissions argued that costs are likely to increase, at least in the short term. The answer of the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, to a question on notice from the committee chair, Senator Ferguson—not from Labor—was that the costs could be between $300 and 1.5 per cent of the fund assets. What Senator Kemp in his obfuscation was very careful to avoid—and I think it was a deliberate evasion yet again—and what he did not say in his answer was that, in order to be cost effective, accountants and superannuation consultants generally only recommend excluded superannuation funds to persons with more than $100,000 to invest in the fund. One point five per cent of a fund with a minimum balance of $100,000 would result in a fee of at least $1,500 to appoint an approved trustee.
We should also have a look at the increase in fines for contravention. There can be inadvertent contraventions of the legislation. It is certainly not to be condoned, but it can happen, particularly when you have a government that is chopping and changing superannuation regulations so frequently and then having to review the changes it makes. The fine of 100 penalty units in the event of contravention is a doubling of the current maximum fine of 50 penalty units. The survey by the National Institute of Accountants also stated that the creation of a distinct class of small superannuation funds is likely to in 
 crease the cost of establishing a small fund as members seek extra professional advice.
It is also clear to everyone but the government—in particular, Senator Kemp—that there may be adverse tax consequences due to the application of this bill, particularly in the area of capital gains tax, which we hear so much about from the government. This liability can be borne by the superannuation fund and fund members. So we have, on the one hand, the government waxing lyrical about doing something about capital gains tax; on the other hand, in respect of this legislation, members may in fact incur a capital gains tax obligation—I see Senator McGauran listening very intently—on small business.
—I think you are struggling, Nick.
—If you want to see a real struggle, you should see Senator Kemp try to perform before a Senate committee answering these questions. But I did refer a direct question to Senator Kemp and asked him to provide a detailed answer. He avoided the practical applications with respect to the possible tax liabilities of the proposed change. The argument that a fund would not necessarily have to restructure in a way which would trigger a tax liability is spurious at best and actually goes against the stated aim of the government's bill.
I want to refer also to very impressive questioning from the other side. Again, the chair, Senator Ferguson, and Senator Watson—one of the few in the government who know anything about these issues—directly raised the issue of the sale of assets with the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, and received a very unsatisfactory answer. I quote:
Senator WATSON —I think this question is for the minister:—
that is, Senator Kemp—
given the difficulties of funds which may have to change because of the new rules, is there any possibility of capital gains rollover relief?
Senator KEMP —My understanding is that the current rules provide sufficient capacity to deal with the issues where capital gains may occur. The 
 legislation which exists at the moment provides relief.
Senator WATSON —Where, for example, a fixed asset has to be sold?
Senator KEMP —We are unconvinced that we need new rules to cover that. Obviously if there were particular views put forward we would listen to them, but I would have to say that the government's position coming to this hearing is that—
CHAIR —
this is Senator Ferguson intervening—
For example, say you have some real estate and you have to sell it—wouldn't there be capital gains tax under that situation?
Ms Lejins dashes in to intervene to assist the minister and says:
If the underlying fund actually disposes of an asset and, in the case of the disposal of that asset, a capital gain is realised, that fund will be liable for capital gains tax.
I emphasise that again:
. . . that fund will be liable for capital gains tax.
And the chair finally declares:
So there will be capital gains tax?
All of this is despite Senator Kemp's elusive and evasive evidence about that issue.
I briefly mention some aspects of concern about discrimination. This legislation, by requiring members of the funds to be family members but excluding same sex families or people in a business relationship, will force excluded funds to restructure and it will be no longer possible to ensure benefits that are directed to a same sex partner in the event of death. We see that as an absurd contraction of the existing rights and entitlements of persons. It may not be a same sex partner, as was indicated in some of the evidence before the committee. It may just be that a person does not want a relative or a person with whom they have a business relationship as a trustee—they may want a friend. In this particular case, I do not think the witness was willing to trust the relative being a trustee of the fund—for perfectly good and legitimate reasons. That is their choice.
Finally, this bill again reinforces the perception and the fact that this government has little or no regard for a coherent retirement incomes policy. Several aspects of this bill 
 contradict the Liberal government's own retirement income principles—alleged principles, I should say. Firstly, they increase complexity and undermine public confidence in superannuation. People are less likely to invest additional contributions in superannuation if they do not understand—or have confidence in—the regulatory environment surrounding their retirement nest egg. Secondly, increased costs will result in lower retirement incomes. Simple arithmetic suggests that increased compliance costs must come out of the retirement income of fund members. Finally, the potential for capital gains tax liabilities triggered as a result of complying with this bill will further erode retirement incomes.
Sitting suspended from 6.29 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-09-20,"—In my remarks, I will respond to some of the issues which were raised during the debate on the second reading, and we will undoubtedly deal with those which I do not respond to during the committee stage. The Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999  amends the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1999 to change the regulatory arrangements for excluded funds, sometimes referred to as do-it-yourself funds. The bill is designed to ensure that all members of a do-it-yourself fund are in a position to participate in the management of that fund. That is, for the first time, the bill will allow the members of these funds to actually do it themselves with only nominal regulatory interference.
The bill will replace the existing definition of an excluded superannuation fund with a new definition of a self-managed superannuation fund. In addition to requiring the fund to have fewer than five members, the new definition will require that all members of the fund be trustees of the fund or directors of the body corporate trustee.
As I mentioned in my second reading speech, the financial systems inquiry found that, under the present system, there is little protection of the interests of beneficiaries who are at arms-length from the trustees of an excluded fund. In addition, there is little 
 practical scope for effective prudential regulation of such funds. As such, the inquiry concluded that excluded funds should not have beneficiaries who are at arms-length from the trustees.
Under the new definition, members of self-managed superannuation funds will be able to protect their own interests. Because of this, these funds will be subject to a less onerous prudential regime under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, the SI(S) Act. The bill has been considered by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which recommended that the bill be passed.
Let me now turn to some of the issues which were raised during the debate on the second reading. In relation to the ATO as a regulator, the bill will also transfer the regulation of self-managed superannuation funds to the Australian Taxation Office. While regulation of all other funds will remain with the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the ATO will be responsible for ensuring that self-managed superannuation funds comply with the non-prudential requirements of superannuation law. Nevertheless, some have expressed concerns about the approach the ATO will take to its new responsibilities under the bill. The primary aim of the ATO as a regulator of self-managed superannuation funds will be to ensure that these funds are complying with the relevant provisions of the SI(S) Act.
The ATO has developed a compliance model on which its regulation of self-managed superannuation funds will be based. There are four stages to the model: education, communication and service, self-regulation, assisted regulation and enforced regulation. The ATO expects to spend most of its time and effort at the first two stages to assist self-managed superannuation funds to regulate through education and communication. This reflects the ATO's belief that the vast majority of self-managed funds wish to comply with the law or would comply if made fully aware of the rules.
Changes in the administrative arrangements have given the government an opportunity to address the supervisory fees levied on small superannuation funds. Proposed changes to 
 the supervisory levy for self-managed superannuation funds are expected to lead to a reduction in revenue collected from such funds of around $19 million in each of the financial years 1999-2000 and 2001-02. I should also mention for completeness that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will continue its more extensive role as the prudential regulator of all other funds.
Concerns have been raised about the consequences for self-managed funds should one of the members reside overseas. It has been suggested that the fund would lose its Australian residency status under the superannuation legislation. All complying superannuation funds have to be a resident superannuation fund. This applies to all funds, not just self-managed funds. The requirements of being a resident superannuation fund are not being changed by this bill. One of the requirements of a resident superannuation fund is that the central management and control of the fund remain in Australia.
Under the bill, all members of a self-managed superannuation fund will need to be trustees of the fund or the sole directors of a body corporate that is a trustee of the fund. If issues arise about the location of the central control and management of a fund with member trustees overseas, consideration should be given to switching to an approved trustee. Any changes to the requirements of a resident superannuation fund would need to be considered in the broader context of determining the circumstances in which Australia's superannuation tax concessions should be available to non-residents.
Capital gains tax was an issue raised by Senator Sherry. It has been suggested that the bill will require some self-managed funds to pay capital gains tax in order to restructure to meet the requirements of the bill. The changes to the SI(S) Act made by the bill do not require funds to restructure in a manner that gives rise to a capital gains tax liability. All funds will have the option of retaining their current membership and appointing an approved trustee. Where a fund appoints an approved trustee or specific amendments are made to the trust deed to comply with the 
 SI(S) Act, existing rollover provisions in the taxation legislation will apply.
There are a number of issues that Senator Sherry in particular raised, and I have looked in vain to see whether there are any amendments to be moved in relation to those issues that Senator Sherry raised. As there are no amendments being proposed by the Labor Party in this area—with one exception—one wonders why he bothers to pursue these matters. If the Labor Party truly believed in some of the things that Senator Sherry said—and I would understand that there would be qualifications from anyone in fully accepting some of Senator Sherry's diatribes—one would have expected some serious work to have been done, and that apparently was not the case.
There is an opposition amendment which removes the family business linkage requirement while ensuring that employees cannot be a member of their employer's self-managed superannuation fund, except where they are relatives. The government's preferred position is that which is introduced in the bill. Of course, we will have to see how the debate proceeds.
In conclusion, the fundamental aim of the government in introducing this bill is to ensure that the regulation of small superannuation funds reflects the needs of members of such funds as well as the government's retirement income goals. At this point, I would like to foreshadow that the government will be moving a minor amendment in the committee stage to change the commencement date of the bill from 1 July 1999 to royal assent. I thank senators for the debate on this bill. I commend the bill to the Senate. I notice that, in relation to the opposition's amendment, it does seem to have the numbers in this chamber, so we will see what precisely happens.
—You want a division.
—I understand, but I would just like to make sure we are all clear on exactly what is going to happen. My understanding from the Democrats is that they will be supporting the amendment which has been moved by the opposition.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I wish to address some remarks on the Further 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security) Bill 1999 . In doing so, if my remarks tonight seem 
 to lack a central theme and the normal continuity of argument which I hope to bring to my speeches it is because this bill is very much an omnibus bill with a range of separate and at times unrelated measures. So it is quite hard to do justice to a theme or a broad approach in the bill because there is not one.
I also understand that the government have circulated a set of amendments that seek to address a range of issues that have arisen because of the delay in having the legislation passed. I understand that they had a start-up date of 20 September for a number of measures. Because the bill has not yet been passed by this chamber, they have had to revise those arrangements. At the outset, the proposed amendments that they will be moving will be acceptable to us and we understand the reason for those.
First of all, there is a range of initiatives in this bill that the opposition supports. Many of the changes are beneficial. Some are technical corrections that we consider to be worth while. There is also a range of measures that close loopholes and correct anomalies in current social security rules. We will seek to support those as well. However, we will be opposing three provisions in the bill that we regard as extremely harsh and unfair. These relate to the Community Development Employment Project, or CDEP, the employment and education entry payment and the liquid asset waiting period.
Labor will move in the committee stage to amend schedules 2, 3 and 9 which contain these provisions. The government argues that these measures are also reasonable corrections of anomalies and loopholes, but we feel that they are unfair and fail to take account of the circumstances of the people who will be affected. Given the length of the bill and the broad brush of the bill, I do not propose to discuss each of the 11 schedules but simply to put forward some reasons for the amendments which we will be supporting in the committee stage.
Schedule 2 contains some beneficial and some detrimental changes to the Community Development Employment Program, the Aboriginal community employment program established in 1977. In essence, CDEP partici 
 pants work for the dole on projects beneficial to their communities. Despite the image of Aboriginal welfare dependency, many Aboriginal people have in fact been doing work in exchange for income support since the late 1970s. According to the government, there are now some 26,000 participants. Each receives a payment equal to Newstart plus $6 per fortnight. Currently, this amounts to a fortnightly payment of between $299 and $358, depending on age, marital status and whether or not the recipient has children. CDEP workers are ineligible for a range of ancillary benefits such as rent assistance, bereavement payments, telephone rental allowance, pharmaceutical allowance and pensioner concession cards to which other income support recipients are entitled. Participants are eligible for health care cards but, as these are not automatically issued and awareness of them is slight, the take-up rate is low.
Recently, the $20 per fortnight available to Work for the Dole participants to cover work related expenses has renewed concerns about the absence of such benefits in CDEP. This schedule corrects some of these discrepancies and to that extent is to be supported. Labor supports the proposal to make CDEP workers eligible for the $20 per fortnight supplementary payment which applies to other social security programs. This measure ends an unfair inconsistency in CDEP entitlements. For the same reason, we support making CDEP workers eligible for additional benefits such as rent assistance. These benefits are available to other low income Australians and it would be discriminatory to deny them to CDEP workers.
The government's bill, however, contains what we consider to be an unfair measure concerning sole parents who take part in CDEP. At present, unlike other CDEP workers, sole parents have been able to access the sole parent pension—now the parenting payment (single)—in addition to a limited CDEP payment. Accordingly, they have also been entitled to ancillary benefits such as rent assistance. CDEP income has been treated as ordinary income, as it would for any other sole parent pensioner—that is, there is an income free area and any income in excess of 
 that reduces the parenting payment by 50 cents in the dollar. Sole parents working on CDEP have usually been paid CDEP income of up to $124 a week, which is the income threshold for parenting payment. In addition, they have received parenting payment.
While benefits payable to sole parent CDEP workers have been more generous than those available to other CDEP workers who are ineligible for social security benefits, their treatment is equivalent to that accorded to sole parents who receive the parenting payment (single). Again, CDEP income has been treated like any other sole parent's pension income. We believe this consistency is fair and the current entitlements should be retained. I understand that under the government's proposal approximately 4,000 sole parents would be worse off. Sole parents experience particular difficulties in joining the work force and their more generous treatment compared with other CDEP participants attempts to overcome this particular disadvantage. The bill, however, would reduce parenting payment by $1 for each dollar of CDEP income up to the amount of the parenting payment benefit, so there would be no income free area at all. Parenting payment would also be reduced by 50c for each dollar in excess of this amount.
Labor opposes this change because it reduces the incentive to work. The government is constantly telling us that it wants to get people off welfare and into work, but you could not find a clearer example of a work disincentive than those contained in the government's proposed CDEP changes. Every dollar of CDEP up to the level of parenting payment will reduce that payment on a dollar for dollar basis. Admittedly, sole parents would be entitled to the $20 participation supplement and other ancillary benefits, and they could also retain 50c for each dollar of CDEP income in excess of the parenting payment threshold. Our clear advice, however, is that the new entitlements would be worth less than the new penalties and that sole parents who persisted with CDEP could be worse off by approximately up to $100 per fortnight. 
While Labor supports a responsible approach to public expenditure, we are not convinced that the best way to achieve savings is to penalise by some $100 per fortnight sole parents who choose to work on CDEP. This is the kind of disincentive to work that you find when you look beyond the government's rhetoric about reducing welfare dependency. The government justified this change as a way of bringing consistency to the treatment of sole parents within CDEP. Yet, given the work barriers facing indigenous sole parents, we believe it would be wiser to retain the additional incentives which are currently available. These are consistent with the entitlements of sole parents outside the CDEP.
It is a pity that the government are breaching the principle of equal treatment and are proposing a measure that would raise barriers to employment in communities which already suffer social deprivation and a higher level of unemployment. I am sure that is not their intention, and I ask them to reconsider their position. Labor will move amendments in the committee stage to maintain the current parenting payment entitlements for sole parents who work on CDEP. The government have introduced an amendment to apply the same changes to the youth disability allowance supplement—that is, to disability pensioners aged under 21 years who also participate in the CDEP. The opposition will oppose this amendment for the same reasons that we oppose the changes to sole parent rules. The alterations would reduce incentives to work for people who face particularly severe barriers to work force participation.
I turn now to schedule 3 regarding the employment and education entry payments. The opposition will also seek to amend schedule 3. This schedule would replace the current $100 employment entry payment—which I think is at $300 for disability support pensioners—and the $200 education entry payment with a repayable advance. The employment entry payment was introduced by Labor in 1991. In the last financial year, the EEP was paid to 137,000 people at an outlay of $15.5 million. The government has tried twice before to abolish the EEP and each time 
 has been defeated or deferred by the Senate. The government's current proposal is to abolish the employment entry payment, which is a non-refundable grant, and replace it with a repayable advance. The advance would range from $50 to $500, but you would have to pay it all back once you began work. Again, the government's measure would create a disincentive to work.
The government must have no notion of the purpose of these payments. They are intended to make it easier for people to enter education or the work force. I understand the government believes the payment is too small to provide an incentive to start work. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine that someone who has given up looking would take a job for the sake of $100, but this argument ignores the value of the payment in meeting expenses incurred in starting work. The amount would seem small to many wage earners but could provide valuable assistance for an unemployed person. In place of this grant, the government would saddle the job taker with a new debt and force them to repay it at a time when they are trying to re-establish themselves financially and, in many cases, to repay other debts accumulated to family, friends and institutions. Again, this debt creating advance is payable only if you find work. This is the third time that the government has tried to abolish the employment entry payment. The Labor Party believe it is persisting in a folly, and we will maintain our opposition. We accept that there is some merit in providing some flexibility, and our amendment will offer people a choice of either taking the kind of loan the government has proposed or taking the grant that is currently available.
There is even less that can be said to be good in terms of the government's proposal for the education entry payment. They are proposing to abolish it for allowance recipients—that is, those on Newstart. At the moment, if you are unemployed and you start a TAFE course, for example, you are entitled to this grant to help with the cost of books, et cetera. Now that will be abolished. What does that say about the government's approach to those people who are trying to fulfil their side 
 of the mutual obligation system—trying to better themselves and advance their prospects of work? Labor will move an amendment to maintain the current entitlement to assist Newstart and other allowance recipients who are trying to improve their work force skills.
I turn now to the third area, which is schedule 9, the liquid asset waiting period. Schedule 9 will also be the subject of opposition amendments. Currently, an unemployed person with liquid assets greater than $10,000 does not become eligible for Newstart until he or she has waited 13 weeks from the time he or she became unemployed. In some circumstances, an unemployed person who studies during this time can count that period of education as part of the 13 weeks. But schedule 9 would require Centrelink to disregard any such time spent in education. This means that the 13-week wait could begin only once that person had withdrawn from their course.
The government claims again that its change would promote equity. This is spurious, however, as no double dipping is possible. No-one whose study time is deemed to be part of their 13-week waiting period can claim Austudy or Youth Allowance during that time. On the contrary, they live on their own resources, and that is what is supposed to be happening during the 13-week wait. If you take an education course, you have to serve two waiting periods. If you do not choose education, you have to undergo only the one waiting period. The measure would make study a less appealing prospect, in our view, for some unemployed people. Labor will seek in committee to prevent the government from introducing what we see as a short-sighted and unfair measure. Just as the CDEP and employment entry payment changes create a disincentive to work, the changes to this schedule create a disincentive to study. We believe those schedules are fundamentally flawed, and we will move in committee to amend them.
I will confine my comment to those remarks. As I said, it is a difficult bill to address, given the nature of the bill and the disparity between the measures contained in it. On this occasion, I have adopted the approach of talking about the specific meas 
 ures in which we wish to see some change. I reiterate my opening remarks: there is much in the bill that is beneficial and that we will be supporting. I have not sought to cover all that ground because of time constraints and the detail of the various schedules. We will be supporting many of those measures. Many of them are necessary improvements to the current regime. I have sought to outline what Labor see as necessary amendments to the bill to make it a fairer and more equitable bill. We will be advancing those in the committee stage of the bill.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-20,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to this particular  social security bill, the Further 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security) Bill 1999 . It contains a significant number of measures. As Senator Evans has indicated, it is quite a wide range of measures which are not necessarily linked to each other. It is a range of different measures and is, as is often the case with bills of this sort, from the Democrats' perspective a bit of a mix of good measures, housekeeping measures, reasonable measures and measures that we have some concerns about—and I will touch on those briefly in the second reading contribution and a bit further in the committee stage of the debate.
This particular social security bill is one of just a number. It is our comment frequently when we are debating social security matters in this place that the Social Security Act is an extremely large and very complex act which is, along with the tax act and the Migration Act, not only one of the larger acts at a national level in this country but also one of the most frequently changing, not just in terms of the principal legislation but also in terms of delegated legislation or disallowable instruments legislation and rulings and the like.
That makes it very difficult not just for legislators like ourselves—that is part of what our job is supposed to be—but more particularly for those meant to be the beneficiaries or the customers, which is what I think the jargon is these days. They are subject to acts such as the Social Security Act, which is so 
 complex and so frequently changing. It also does not make it easy for the people in Centrelink and the social security department who have to enforce the various components of the act when it is changing so frequently and it affects so many people in so many different ways.
I know that the government has given some commitment over time to try to simplify the act, and that is a laudable aim. However, you need to be constantly on the alert that what is called simplification is not used as an excuse for lowest common denominator savings measures. That has often been the case in the past, and it is something that we are frequently concerned about. I think this particular piece of legislation contains a few more examples along those lines.
Senator Evans has outlined some of the aspects of the bill and the different schedules contained within it. The amendments relating to the CDEP are interesting and important. Overall they provide some positive changes, but we do have some areas of concern in relation to the bill's impact on sole parents. I will be exploring those issues further in the consideration in detail stage of the debate.
The special employment advance is another interesting area which seeks to replace the employment entry payment—something that has come into this chamber a number of times over the years, where the government has attempted to abolish the employment entry payment without success. The Democrats believe, whilst it is not a major payment, that for those people entering employment after a significant period out of work smallish payments such as that can be quite significant. It will provide extra assistance to people in the form of a kick-start back into the work force, and it will ensure that the poverty which frequently envelops people when on income support does not stay with them for a long period of time.
That period when people first re-enter the work force can be when they are at their most vulnerable, particularly if they have been out of work for a long period of time. They need to adjust to a different approach, and having extra financial burdens placed upon them is the last thing they need. I am sure the govern 
 ment would say that, with this new concept of a special employment advance, they are catering for such people. To the extent that they are, that is an improvement on previous attempts to simply abolish the payment. 
If you look at the explanatory memorandum and the financial impact statements that are contained there, you will note the special employment advance in the current financial year—although the date of its effect will change somewhat because it has taken so long for this bill to be brought on by the government for consideration—which in its first main year of operation was detailed as costing the government $1.5 million. That sounds like a generous contribution to assist people who are re-entering the work force. However, if you look at the savings for abolishing the employment entry payment, you will see that in the corresponding year it is a saving of $14.1 million; nearly 10 times the amount in savings as would be provided in outlays under this new advance.
If you look at the years following from that, the outlays under the special employment advance drop over time, perhaps partly because the government believes unemployment will drop. I am not quite sure of the rationale for why the outlay would drop over time, but the saving in terms of employment entry payments would increase over time. So, once you get a couple of years into the future, the outlay is less than $0.9 million a year whilst the potential or expected saving is seen to be over $18 million. I think that shows this up for what it is. It is basically a savings measure. It is another attempt to abolish the employment entry payment with a bit of a smokescreen over the top called the special advance.
The aspect of that which the Democrats have extra concern about is the fact that that advance is, as it says, an advance. That means it has to be repaid. So it takes the form of a debt. As a party that has consistently opposed the introduction of tertiary fees or HECS fees, which were originally brought in by the Labor Party and which have now got to a stage where they provide a significant debt load for many students, this would be the first introduction of a similar concept in the Social 
 Security Act. That is something that the Democrats would be very concerned about. The thin end of the wedge may be a cliche, but many times it is a cliche with some validity.
The introduction of such a concept causes the Democrats great concern, particularly given the anticipated outlays in relation to this new employment advance. They are meagre, but from the Democrats' point of view they seem to be opening up far too great a precedent for very little gain whilst ensuring that a very significant number of people would cease to be eligible for any form of extra assistance when they do re-enter the work force.
The introduction of a crisis payment, which is covered under schedule 4 of the legislation, has some positive aspects in relation to the extra assistance that it will provide to people, particularly those fleeing incidences such as domestic violence. We have concerns about the possibility that it may lead to a less helpful form of assistance for some people being released from prison, and we would seek to explore the potential impacts on those people during the consideration in detail stage of the debate.
 Schedule 5 relates to newly arrived residents' waiting periods, an issue that I have raised concerns about a number of times in this place over the last couple of years. This is perhaps where the concept of the thin end of the wedge is borne out. This measure was brought in when the ALP was in power. It introduced a six-month waiting period for newly arrived migrants for some social security payments and the philosophy, if you like, of newly arrived migrants not being entitled to assistance when they first arrive or not expected to come to this country unless they are able to provide for themselves in certain circumstances. That seed of an idea—germ is probably a better word in this case—was expanded on considerably by the coalition when it came into government. It extended the waiting period from six months to two years and extended the waiting period to virtually all social security payments except special benefit under very limited circumstances. 
I suspect that it was more by inadvertent omission than anything else that this did not apply to health care cards, and the government seeks to rectify that omission via schedule 5. I suppose it is fair enough, as the government says in its explanatory memorandum, that this measure is put forward to ensure consistency in the application of the newly arrived residents' waiting period. I guess it makes the measure consistent so that newly arrived migrants dip out across the board rather than having that tiny sliver of assistance via the health care card.
The Democrats believe that a significant degree of hardship has been visited on quite innocent people—people who have come to this country wanting to make a contribution and to start a new life—and extending that hardship, even by the small amount contained in this measure, is something that the Democrats are opposed to. Again, it is a measure that aims to save over $13 million a year in the not too distant future. This means that the more than $13 million worth of assistance currently being provided to newly arrived migrants will no longer be provided under this measure. It is a matter of ongoing concern to the Democrats that this approach is continuing to be followed through.
Another significant amendment is a measure that expands the definition of `suitable work', requiring people to accept work even further away from home under certain circumstances. It is a curious measure that in itself is aimed at saving only about $3½ million a year in the near future. One has to wonder how much savings would be applied to such a measure that by definition is somewhat curious in its potential application and that in a sense is aimed at providing an extra incentive for people to ensure that they take up work that is offered to them. It is another one that the Democrats have concerns about and where the principle being outlined in this particular schedule may end up being extended over a period of time as not only the social security department but also Treasury continually search for more and more areas to nip, tuck and cut in the welfare budget. It is an area that again causes the Democrats some concern. 
Schedule 8 relating to moving to areas of lower employment prospects is another measure that was brought in many years ago, the intent of which the Democrats expressed concern over at the time. To some extent, the principle seems reasonable, but in its application it is almost impossible not to hit a number of people who are not trying to rort or to avoid anything but who are simply moving to a different area, as people do all the time in Australia.
It creates a situation where a particular class of people—namely, people on income support—have a more restricted freedom of movement than others in the community because of their lower form of income, which creates an extra hurdle for people at the best of times. It also creates an extra legal impediment that others in the community do not have to face in order to be able to move from one part of the country to another. Nonetheless, whether or not one supports the overall component that already exists in the Social Security Act of penalising people for moving to areas of lower employment prospects, this particular schedule closes an existing loophole that presumably is used, although, looking at the savings that are expected, it is not used by very many people. We understand the argument at least of ensuring that the intent of the measure, whether or not one agrees with it, is able to be implemented across the board.
Schedule 9 relates to the liquid assets test waiting period. This is another measure where, on the surface, if you look at the explanation that is put forward—trying to rationalise inconsistencies in its application, simplifying it and ensuring the liquid assets waiting test operates the same across the board—obviously it is a good idea to have something as important as that apply consistently across all payments. It is easier for staff to administer and easier for applicants to understand how it works.
It always seems to be the case when we are rationalising inconsistencies that it also tends to save the government some money at the same time. That in itself sounds like a nice idea but it is not just a matter of saving the government money; it is a matter of people who are often amongst the poorest in the 
 community—people who are potentially eligible for the liquid assets test are certainly those who by definition have virtually no liquid assets—not having access to that amount of money in income support. Whilst $1½ million a year does not sound like a lot and any extra assistance we can get in ensuring that taxpayers' money is not wasted is always laudable, it also means $1½ million of assistance that is currently provided to people with virtually no liquid assets will no longer be provided. That is the flip side of measures such as these.
It is similar with the following schedule, schedule 10, which introduces a two-tiered payment structure for the Austudy pensioner education supplement which relates to the study undertaken by the student. Whilst this measure exempts disability support pensioners and disability pensioners from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, a very important area—an area sufficiently important that a Senate committee is considering  Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  tonight; I am supposed to be at that hearing considering that piece of legislation, but unfortunately I cannot because I am here considering this piece of legislation, such is the difficulty of managing the legislative workload in this chamber—it is one that, by virtue of creating that two-tiered system, sets in place an extra complication. But the principle of simplification goes by the board if there is a bit of extra money to be saved—in this case, about $6 million a year.
I think all parties would readily agree this is an area which is so important—providing encouragement for people who want assistance to get education to increase their learning and their qualifications to improve their employment opportunities. Indeed, the Minister for Family and Community Services has spoken a number of times recently of the need to provide extra assistance for people who want to get back into the work force. I note again that this measure does not apply to disability support pensioners—one of the groups the minister has been talking about—who need to have extra assistance to get back into the work force, an aim with which I certainly concur. But there are other pension 
 ers or income support recipients—parenting payment recipients in particular—who will be hit by a measure such as this.
From our point of view, the Democrats find it hard to see the purpose of measures such as this for people who are trying to obtain education. Other than that, the only purpose that seems apparent is the savings measure. I hasten to add that trying to limit unnecessary budget expenditure is a goal that all people in this place would support but, if it is at the expense of reducing incentives for people to get back into the work force or undertake education, or at the expense of reducing income support and assistance for people who are amongst the poorest in the community, that seems to the Democrats like a pretty poor saving in many cases. However, we will have the opportunity to explore some of these measures a little bit further in the committee stage of the debate, so I will restrict my remarks at the moment and perhaps ask a few questions of the minister in a little bit more detail when we get to that stage.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-20,"—I thank senators for their contributions. I would like to speak briefly about CDEP because that was something which I think was well done by the previous government. It was an initiative which showed the way, if you like, for the Work for the Dole scheme, which has now been extended to the rest of the Australian community. CDEP was therefore, I think, a pathfinder in terms of programs, and it is one which has enabled remote communities in particular to have some feeling that they are contributing to their own wellbeing rather than simply getting sit-down money. CDEP was designed as an employment initiative and participants who sign onto the program are required to forgo their entitlement to social security benefits.
The government commissioned the report by Mr Ian Spicer, who is well respected in the community. The Spicer report recommended that, with the success of the Work for the Dole scheme, participants in CDEP should be able to obtain similar income support 
 benefits. The proposals eliminate the imbalances by qualifying CDEP recipients for certain add-ons such as the $20 CDEP scheme participant supplement, rent assistance, bereavement payments, telephone allowance, pharmaceutical allowance and the health care card. In addition, the reforms to CDEP include amendments to redress a disparity in relation to CDEP recipients who are lone parents and who receive what is now known as parenting payment (single). This appears to be an area about which some senators in the chamber have a concern. The government, however, believes that it is only equitable and fair that all people on CDEP payments should be treated in a similar manner. But, currently, as the CDEP scheme is drafted—and perhaps there was not careful thought given to this—this particular category of people is not required to forgo the social security benefit, as is everybody else on CDEP, in order to participate in the scheme. That seems pretty unfair and, with a reform of the scheme and an increase in benefits—the add-ons, as I have just mentioned—it would seem pretty reasonable that this is the proper occasion to put everybody in the CDEP scheme on the same level.
I think the Senate should be alert to the fact that I have in front of me now a copy of a letter which was sent by the Chairman of ATSIC to the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Lees, asking for the Democrats' support in securing the passage of this legislation, the  Further 1998 Budget Measures Legislation Amendment (Social Security) Bill 1999 , and referring in some detail to the CDEP scheme. The letter points out that the board has given its in principle support to the package of measures contained in the initiative and considers successful implementation of this initiative important for providing access to these benefits.
The board did express concern over the potential impact of the new income treatment arrangements on lone parent pensioners on CDEP. The board also acknowledges that this is an equity issue between the income treatment arrangements afforded to other pensioners and those on CDEP. The board acknowledges the government's strong argument that 
 the introduction of new income treatment arrangements will address the potential double funding by government of CDEP participants who are also lone parent pensioners. In light of the independent review by Mr Spicer and his recommendation on this point, in light also of ATSIC's strong view about the need for this legislation to go through and its recognition of the government's strong argument about this particular part of the CDEP reforms, I urge the Senate to not impede what is a considered and careful reform to a very important initiative which was introduced by the previous government.
I also would like to speak briefly about the special employment advance. I believe that this is an important reform. It means that there will be much greater coverage and provision of advance payments to income support recipients taking up work. Currently, for example, there is a number of people who are not able to access the employment entry payment. Certainly the new scheme will be available to a wider range of people, and it will offer a higher range of financial assistance. For most people the EEP was limited to $100. It was available only to people who could demonstrate they would be no longer receiving an income support payment. By contrast, the special employment advance will be a maximum of $500. It will be available to help people who have an offer of employment of at least six weeks duration which reduces their income support payment by at least 50 per cent—that is, it will assist people in the work force, even though they may still require further reduced income support, such as those participating in part-time work.
The special employment advance will also assist people who have unreceived earnings. When I first got the job of Minister for Social Security, a steady stream of letters came my way from people who had earned income—by being relief teachers, for example—and had not been paid under the arrangements of their employment with a state government authority, for example. There were some weeks and sometimes months before they actually got paid, but they were prevented from getting income support because they had unreceived earnings. That seemed to me to be something 
 that badly needed redressing, and one the reasons for introducing the special employment advance is to deal with people in those circumstances. Currently, where a person has unreceived casual earnings, their income support payment is reduced, even though they have not received the earnings. That can lead to financial hardship, as senators would recognise.
The availability of the special employment advance will remove the risk of hardship. It is obviously an incentive for people to take up work in circumstances where it may previously have been unattractive. The employment entry payment scheme offered no assistance in those circumstances. Senator Evans earlier was talking about incentives in the system and disincentives to work and to study. I think the arguments that can be mounted for this special employment advance are such that it is quite clear they do provide incentives where, in fact, the previous system had disincentives. So I do urge the Senate to have a rethink about that matter and be prepared to support it.
The crisis payment, I believe, will be very well received. I have spoken to community organisations. I have spoken to women who have an interest in women escaping domestic violence, and I have also talked to people who help prisoners on release from prison. All of them believe that a crisis payment, as proposed in the legislation, would be a very useful adjunct to the social security system. There have been some concerns about prisoners in some parts of Australia who may be released at odd hours of the night or when they cannot easily get to a bank. The amendments from the government are designed to enable an early payment in these circumstances, so I think that the only problem that anybody has seen in the crisis payment will be redressed.
I do not know that anything can be served by my continuing on these matters, except I did want to say something about the application of the liquid assets waiting period. The bill does remove inconsistencies in the operation of the liquid assets test waiting period for claimants of Newstart allowance and sickness allowance where the claimant or the 
 claimant's partner is an education leaver. The underlying rationale for the waiting period is that those with sufficient financial resources should support themselves for a period prior to accessing income support, but the waiting period provisions have been found to operate inconsistently when applied to education leavers. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has decided that in certain circumstances a person may be treated as unemployed while undertaking a course of full-time education.
The net result of this interpretation is that a full-time student with significant liquid assets may, on finishing studies and applying for Newstart, avoid having a liquid assets test waiting period imposed. That was never the government's intention. As a result of that decision, the government is now bringing in amendments which will restore the situation as we had understood it to be and intended it to be. I shall leave it at that, and I welcome discussion in the committee stage of the bill.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-09-20,"—I will speak briefly to this motion that has been moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate indicating that in tomorrow's sitting of the Senate we deal with only two matters: consideration of a motion relating to the situation in East Timor and then the adjournment debate at the conclusion of that business. I am sure everyone in the parliament would accept that there is no more important issue that the parliament could give consideration to at this time than the situation in East Timor. That is a matter that both this chamber and the House of Representatives does need to give priority to.
There is, I think, a question in relation to the order of business that needs to be addressed. My colleagues in the House of Representatives will be arguing forcefully for question time to take place in that chamber. I would make the point that whatever occurs in the House of Representatives I think should be also reflected in this chamber. I think we will deal with this issue in the Senate before it is dealt with in the House of Representatives. I suppose I could be bold enough to make the prediction that, although I think there is great force in the arguments that my colleagues will mount in the House of Representatives, it is possible it will not find majority support on the floor of that chamber, as so many of their good suggestions don't, as senators would be aware.
In that circumstance, again, I think the principle that should apply is that our business here should reflect what occurs in that chamber. In other words, if there is a question time in the House of Representatives, I think it is appropriate that there be a question time in the Senate. Given the important questions that have been asked in both chambers today about East Timor, the arguments for that occurring are very strong. It is important to hold the government and the executive accountable on this important issue.
I also raise another key issue in relation to the question before the chair. The point of the proposal of the government is that we consider a motion in relation to the situation in East Timor. As of this time as I now speak in 
 the Senate, that motion still has not been provided to the opposition or, I assume, to Senator Lees and other Independent senators who might care to make a contribution on this, and I assume to others in the parliament as well. Before I got to my feet I was assured by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that the Leader of the House, Mr Reith, is going to provide a draft motion to the opposition in the House of Representatives in very short order indeed.
I do think it is difficult to determine at a time like this, when a draft motion has not been provided and when we are not quite clear what might be the decision of the House in relation to its own order of business, what it is appropriate for this chamber to do. I am making a bold assumption that the persuasive arguments of my colleagues in the House of Representatives in relation to the holding of a question time tomorrow will probably fall on deaf ears, will probably be unsuccessful, and that that is unlikely to take place. But I do make the important point that the government's motion in relation to the situation in East Timor should have been provided well before this time—that is, 9.25 p.m. on Monday of the first day of these important sittings of the parliament.
It is disappointing that we have not been provided with that motion. I do believe it is an important courtesy not just to the opposition but to all those in both chambers of the parliament who would like to make a contribution on an issue that has dominated public debate in our nation over the past few weeks. I am disappointed that the government has not been able to provide that motion. Of course, the opposition would much prefer to find itself in a position where it is in agreement with the government on a motion and there is some negotiating process between the government and opposition and other parties if they care to be involved about the appropriate wording of such a motion. It does appear that we have to deal with this issue before that matter is finally determined. I am afraid that I cannot apprise the Senate or any of my colleagues about the draft motion that is coming from the government.
In this circumstance, we find ourselves in a difficult position. It is an important principle 
 that the motion be provided before we agree to such a debate. It is an important principle to hold a question time to hold the executive accountable for its role in relation to this important issue. I would have preferred the motion that we are debating now to have reflected those considerations. In the circumstances that we face where that is not possible, I think perhaps I am limited to making this short contribution on this matter to explain the approach that the opposition is taking, which is one that I think any fair-minded Australian or fair-minded member of the Australian parliament would accept as a very reasonable one in these circumstances.
So we await further developments in the House of Representatives. We would certainly encourage Mr Reith, as Leader of the House in the House of Representatives, to try to lift his game and ensure that the opposition is apprised of the government's motion on East Timor as soon as possible and to engage in the necessary discussions and negotiations in the way a matter as important as this ought to be progressed.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,27,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-09-20,"—I rise to support this motion. It would be helpful, however, if we could see, sometime this evening, the motion that is planned to be debated. I am sure most of us could write most of our speeches, having seen enough on the television screens about what is happening, but I say to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that I think it would be conducive to a more fruitful debate if we could get a copy of the motion before we leave this evening.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Days and Hours of Meeting and Routine of Business</title>,Business,27,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-09-20,"—I am assured that the motion will be available. It probably is already available in that other place. Although I am sure Senator Faulkner's colleagues will earnestly, articulately and forcefully put the argument that there should be a question time tomorrow, the precedent to the best that I can judge from recent cases—I understand the debate on Somalia was one of those—is the debate on the Middle East 
 conflict, the Gulf War. On 21 January 1991, the parliament was recalled to a special sitting. Question time was dispensed with then in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Senate made the decision to ensure that we mirrored what happened in the House of Representatives, which I would suggest is not always good practice. Their practices are often rules unto themselves.
The Senate's procedures are often far better than those of the House of Representatives. We should not always seek to mirror them; we need to be a different place. But I do not think it is helpful that they debate East Timor over in that place and we engage in question time and other matters up here. It is appropriate that the statements or the motions be moved concurrently. That was very much the view put by Senator Robert Ray, the then Manager of Government Business in the Senate, on 21 January 1991, when he said:
There was no desire by the Government to hide from Question Time, but there was a desire to get on with this most important matter—as most people in the chamber would acknowledge—at the same time as the House of Representatives.
—What did Hill say at the time?
—I think Senator Hill's words might have had an incredible resonance with what Senator Faulkner just said. I am sure Senator Hill put up a protest, as Her Majesty's opposition should always do. I genuinely appreciate the support from other senators and I undertake, on behalf of the government, to ensure that the draft motion is in the hands of all honourable senators in a very short time.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-20,"—I thank Minister Newman for giving me some clarification in relation to this during the brief interval. I sympathise with her in having to elaborate on the rationale and the impact of these amendments which are listed as technical corrections. Given the difficulty in getting more precise information on them, and whilst I take her assurances that no financial implications means negligible financial implications—which means probably not very much money, which means probably not terribly many people affected—I am not overly keen on supporting something with reasonably scant information about its likely impact, particularly in an area such as this that potentially deals with people who are already on low incomes and suffering disabilities.
As I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate, there is a number of other social security bills on the Notice Paper. I am sure these measures could be re-presented, and perhaps a bit more information could be provided at that time. Given that they are of negligible financial impact, I feel less apprehension about doing that than I might otherwise. They are clearly not going to have any significant financial implications for the government's budgetary situation—for the budget coffers—but they may have significant financial implications for young people, albeit for a very small number. That being the case, I find it a bit difficult to support these amendments in this context.

		 (b)	 if the person ceases to be a CDEP Scheme participant before the end of the quarter—the day on which the person so ceases or 19 March 2000, whichever is the later.
	 (3A)	 Any accumulated amounts payable to a person to whom subsection (2) applies are to be paid at such times (not later than 19 March 2000) as the Secretary determines.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-20,"—According to the note, this amendment deals with the right to accumulate supplement. It is also part of schedule 2 and therefore has no financial implications, according to the supplementary explanatory memorandum revised. It seems reasonably self-explanatory, but it contains four clauses. Given what I said before about the potential impact, I want to at least get the minister to confirm my reading of it, rather than get her to explain it from scratch. It appears to me to enable a person to accumulate payments in a similar way to how some of the old pension credit schemes used to operate. It seems to be a beneficial measure—although, again, if it is a beneficial measure, I would have thought it might have a small budgetary cost to the government, which again is not reflected in the explanatory memorandum. Perhaps that balances out the small budgetary expense under the previous measure, which therefore neatly makes zero. I would like a clarification of that before I express support for this one.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,1999-09-20,"—I think the information in revised FC206 is pretty self-explanatory. Certainly there was an intention that people would be able to accumulate amounts of a supplement, and this makes it possible for that to happen. There was also a need to ensure that people who were in receipt of payments under the CDEP scheme could take their accumulated amounts back to March 1999. They could also take it quarterly. That is the best I can do for you, Senator. I think that is what you are driving at.",SENATE,<title>FURTHER 1998 BUDGET MEASURES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SOCIAL SECURITY) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,28,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-09-20,"—To clarify that, does that mean that people can stack up their payments and get them paid in a lump sum at a later date?
—Yes.
—Thank you.
Amendment agreed to.
—We now move to government amendment No. 13.
Amendment by (Senator Newman) proposed:
(13)	 Schedule 4, item 13, page 72 (line 10), after ""payment"", insert ""either while the person was in gaol or psychiatric confinement, or"".
—The question is that government amendment No. 13 be agreed to.
—I am sorry, this is another one which says `technical correction', which makes me nervous after the last one which said `technical correction'. It is also not on my running sheet, which is making me more nervous.
—It is on sheet FC206.
—The amendment is there, but it is not the next one on the running sheet as I see it. I am getting confused. I think we have skipped a page.
—No, it is the next one on sheet FC206.
—It is at the top of page 3 on the running sheet, I think.
—I support Senator Bartlett's confusion.
—To assist you, Senator Bartlett, it is at the top of page 3 on the running sheet.
—If that is the case, that is an amendment to schedule 4.
—It is too.
—That means we should not be anywhere near that yet. I think the minister might be missing a page on her running sheet.
—No, this was an old one.
—I think Senator Bartlett's point is that the next amendment that I have in front of me on the revised running sheet is an amendment to schedule 2, items 9 and 53, government amendments (1), (5) and (6) on pages 30 and 33 of the bill.
—If I could short-circuit your contribution, Senator Evans, I have just been given that running sheet myself. Senator Newman, apparently there is a more up-to-date running sheet which has the next amendments being (1), (5) and (6) for the government. Perhaps we 
 should move to those amendments before moving to amendment No. 13.

These series of amendments and our amendment No. 8, which is to oppose section 1188D, all go to the same issue, which is the payment of parenting payments single to recipients of CDEP.
As I mentioned in my speech at the second reading stage, this is one of the three major areas of concern that the opposition has with the bill. The minister and the government are seeking to make a number of changes to CDEP, most of which we support. They provide for allowing CDEP recipients to access some additional benefits that they have been traditionally denied, such as rental assistance, bereavement payment, telephone rental allowance and other ancillary benefits, and the opposition has no qualm with that. We think that is a positive and beneficial measure.
However, the opposition is concerned at what appears to be unfair treatment of those recipients of CDEP who also have access to parenting payment (single)—that is, single parents involved in CDEP work. We have ascertained, from looking at the legislation and from some research done for us done by the library, that it seems in excess of 4,000 sole parents may well be worse off as a result of the measure undertaken by the government. Those people would lose the entitlement to income, the sum of which would be over $100 a fortnight. These are often quite disadvantaged people such as Aboriginal people working in a CDEP project who are also single parents. By definition many of them suffer a range of disadvantages in terms of their access to the paid work force and to a range of other facilities in society because many of them live in remote communities.
While the other measures are beneficial, this is a very serious reduction in the amount of income paid to those 4,000 sole parents. At present, unlike other CDEP workers, sole parents have been able to access the sole parent pension—now the parenting payment (single)—in addition to a limited CDEP payment. CDEP income has been treated as ordinary income for any other sole parent pensioner—that is, it is an income free area—and any income in excess of that reduces parenting payment by 50 cents in the dollar. Sole parents working on CDEP projects have usually been paid CDEP income up to $124 a week, which is the income threshold for parenting payment and, in addition, they have received parenting payment.
While benefits payable to sole parent CDEP workers have been more generous than those available to other CDEP workers who are ineligible for social security benefits, their treatment is equivalent to that accorded to other sole parents who receive parenting payment (single). Again, CDEP income has been treated like any other sole parent pensioner's income. We believe this consistency is fair and the current entitlements should be retained. Sole parents experience particular difficulties in joining the work force, and their more generous treatment compared with other CDEP participants attempts to overcome this disadvantage. The measures proposed by the government in the bill would reduce parenting payment by one dollar for each dollar of CDEP income up to the amount of the parenting payment benefits. So there will be no income free area at all. Parenting payment would also be reduced by 50c for each dollar in excess of this amount.
We believe this would reduce the incentive to work and is not justified purely on the basis of arguing that this brings them down to a level occupied by other recipients. It provides a disincentive to work and it removes a small advantage that has been given to people who are amongst the most disadvantaged in the Australian community. To remove up to $100 a fortnight from these people, with the only justification seeming to be that it would bring them back to a level playing field, is not only insufficient but also highly unfair.
We think it is probably more a question of the government looking at a cost saving measure rather than at a measure based on any sort of merit. It would be very hard to argue that these people are receiving any great advantage in our society. They are in need of the sorts of support mechanisms that they are receiving currently, and it is easy to justify their continuing to receive those payments. We cannot at this stage see why, if it is not a cost cutting measure, the government would be looking to reduce their entitlements in this way.
We think that the current situation and regime provides a far fairer treatment for those people. We do not see why these 4,000 
 individuals who are struggling to work and to raise children on their own should be disadvantaged by this measure. I know the minister, in answering concern about the previous measure relating to the youth disability situation, said that such people may find it harder to get participation in CDEP projects because others would regard them as getting a double payment. That may or may not be true—I have no evidence for that, and none was advanced—but it seems to me that if there are some prejudices or difficulties we ought to work to overcome those prejudices and difficulties rather than seek to diminish the payments made to these people.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-09-20,"—The situation in East Timor over the past three weeks has been horrific. It is an absolute tragedy. I hope with all my heart, as do all Australians, that any further killing, violence, intimidation and forced removal of Timorese people will be averted or kept to the absolute minimum possible with the arrival of the United Nations peacekeeping force. People around the world have been shocked and appalled at this tragic turn of events.
The people of Australia have been particularly affected for several reasons: the geographical proximity of the two regions, our past close historical ties with the Timorese and the large number of Timorese people in Australia.
I know this bond with the Timorese is a special one and will be a lasting one. The recent tragedy has led to many Australians working together with the East Timorese to alleviate their suffering as best they can. Nowhere is this more obvious than in Darwin.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the many people, agencies and organisations which have been involved in the relief 
 effort to date and acknowledge the supreme efforts they have made. The brigades of volunteers and public servants deserve our thanks and praise.
The people of Darwin have opened their hearts to the East Timorese and have donated money, clothing, toys and time in a bid to help these people as best they can. Many Darwin people are acting as volunteers and assisting in any way they feel is right and useful.
 On 10 September 1999, 478 people were evacuated from Dili. Of these, 344 were East Timorese. They arrived in Darwin by RAAF Hercules to a well-organised humanitarian relief effort. A further 1,500 East Timorese and almost 60 UN staff were evacuated by RAAF Hercules on 14 September 1999. The Northern Territory and federal governments had organised an East Timorese reception task force which originally used the Portuguese-Timorese Social Club as the reception centre for the refugees. Here they were processed efficiently and compassionately by Customs, Immigration and other officials in the first instance. The reception and processing of refugees was later moved to the Marrara Sports Stadium to accommodate the larger numbers involved. The East Timorese were given three-month safe haven visas similar to those granted to the refugees from Kosovo.
The reception task force, under the guidance of the Hon. Mike Reed MLA, the Northern Territory's Deputy Chief Minister, has done a superb job of making things as comfortable, simple and painless for the refugees as possible. The tent city erected by the Australian Army at the Kalymnian Social Club at Marrara is able to house 2,000 refugees in conditions that are the best possible for relief and temporary relief. The tent city is being run by the Northern Territory police and the officer in charge is Superintendent Mick Van Heythuysen. The tent city is a credit to the organisational skills of Superintendent Van Heythuysen and his officers, and also to its Timorese residents. A Timorese couple named their newborn infant after Superintendent Van Heythuysen and he will be a godfather to the baby. These actions show the depth of feeling that is being expressed on both sides in this 
 crisis and is similar to the affection afforded the Australian Federal Police contingent in Timor for the recent poll.
Charity and aid organisations and many dedicated people from religious orders are playing a large part in the relief effort and, without their tremendous support, life for the refugees would be much more difficult. Anglicare has been collecting thousands of items of clothing for personal kits for the refugees. Their Darwin store has been open 24 hours a day as part of a drive to collect as many clothes as possible for the East Timorese. On a poignant note, it was requested that the clothes be of a small size and preferably of a dark colour due to the fact that the people were in mourning.
The Red Cross have also been doing a marvellous job. Their compound in Dili was stormed and they suffered strong intimidation from the militias, but this does not seem to have dented their resolve one iota. The Red Cross and their volunteers are working hard at the vital task of tracing families and attempting to provide information on the whereabouts of loved ones. They have also provided much needed assistance, with the local Darwin Timorese community, in helping refugees to fill out things such as immigration forms. The government aid organisation AusAID began food drops on 17 September with food and blankets dropped to refugees hiding in the hills south of Dili. These vital supplies may mean the difference between life and death for some people.
The aid workers who were in East Timor have had a particularly trying time. They have experienced some horrific episodes and must deal with those and also their feelings for those they were forced to leave behind. Their job is ongoing, in Darwin particularly, and it is an unfortunate reality that it will soon recommence in East Timor. They can take solace in the knowledge that they have already saved thousands of lives. Health Services Australia, working very closely with Northern Territory Health, was able to mobilise seven medical staff within 24 hours and by today had screened around 1,100 refugees, with about 500 to go. Doctors worked throughout the weekend to ensure refugees 
 were screened in the most humane and sensitive manner, and the staff of Health Services Australia, the Royal Darwin Hospital and Territory Health Services must be congratulated. Reports indicate that people being seen are malnourished and psychologically traumatised. Those people with health problems have been hospitalised in the Northern Territory.
Hotels and motels around Darwin were absolutely full as those East Timorese who had passed through immigration and health checks were moved out of the tent city into more appropriate accommodation on 12 and 13 September. On 18 September, 292 refugees were flown to Melbourne to stay at Puckapunyal army base ahead of a further 300. Several hundred Timorese community members from Melbourne were on hand to greet them, continuing the strong support their compatriots in Darwin have shown. I am sure the refugees who will be accommodated at Puckapunyal in Victoria, Leeuwin in Western Australia and East Hills in New South Wales will be as well looked after as they were in Darwin.
The troops from Townsville, and particularly my constituents from the Northern Territory based in Darwin, Palmerston and Katherine who are forming such a vital part of the UN peacekeeping force, deserve a strong message of thanks and good wishes. I, along with all Territorians and the rest of Australia, wish them godspeed and a safe campaign. The hopes and wishes of all Territorians go with them, particularly the 2,000 troops who left today from Darwin. The RAAF has played a strong role in the lead-up to the peacekeeping force leaving today. The Hercules crews who flew the evacuation flights and who flew supplies to the besieged UNAMET compound showed determination and courage in conditions that were extremely adverse.
The head of the United Nations mission on East Timor, Mr Ian Martin, who flew out of Dili only on Tuesday, 14 September with the 1,500 refugees from the UN compound, showed extreme courage and wise judgment in circumstances few of us can imagine. I would also like to pay tribute to the journalists who have been covering the crisis from Timor and Darwin. The coverage has, in the 
 large majority, been responsible and sensitive, with the journalists from international and local media following and understanding the need for rules that have been set.
Finally, I think it is important to acknowledge and applaud the strength and the courage that the East Timorese refugees themselves have shown in such trying circumstances. They are exceptional people, and the recognition they gave to the Prime Minister today at the tent city shows the feelings they have for all Australians. I pray for peace in their troubled country.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>East Timor</title>,Adjournment,29,1,speech

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,1999-09-20,"—The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1) In October 1993 the then Attorney-General wrote to the State and Territory Attorneys-General, and again in March 1995 and December 1995, concerning the need to review legislation and to either remove such inconsistencies as exist, or where necessary, seek prescription of laws pursuant to section 47(2) of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). Requests for prescription were received from several States and Territories. The review of the requests for prescription from New South Wales (NSW) and South Australia resulted in the making of the Disability Discrimination Amendment Regulations 1999.
It is relevant to note section 132(2) of the DDA which provides that, before making any regulations for the purposes of section 47 of the DDA, the Governor-General is to take into consideration any comments made to the Minister by a Minister of a State or Territory who is responsible for matters relating to disability discrimination. This statutory 
 requirement was complied with in the making of these regulations.
(2) While neither the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) nor the Disability Discrimination Commissioner were formally consulted in relation to the individual requests for prescription from NSW or South Australia, officers of the Attorney-General's Department discussed the prescription process with officers of the HREOC.
(3) The DDA indicates that responsibility for consultation with relevant stakeholders lies with the individual State or Territory which is seeking to have its legislation prescribed. Accordingly, the Attorney-General will seek formal assurances from the relevant State or Territory Minister that any necessary consultation with all stakeholders has taken place before any further prescription is undertaken.
In addition the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Office of Disability in the Department of Family and Community Services will be consulted on any future proposed prescriptions.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Disability Discrimination Amendment Regulations</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,32,1,answer
