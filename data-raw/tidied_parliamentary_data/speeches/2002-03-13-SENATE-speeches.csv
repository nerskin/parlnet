"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—The question before the committee at the moment is whether or not there should be a binding commitment on the state governments that have signed regional forest agreements that they will carry out the environmental components of those agreements: the establishment of comprehensive and adequate reserves and the commitment to ecologically sustainable management, which means sustaining the environments throughout the forest domain. I pointed out in the debate last night that the current state of affairs with the regional forest agreements is that the Commonwealth is bound in its commitment to compensate the woodchip companies if any areas of forest are protected for the value of those forests as if they had been logged, but the states are not bound in their obligation to act on ecologically sustainable principles and protect rare and endangered species and so on. 
The minister, who entered the debate early on, misled the Senate by saying that the states are bound to carry out those obligations. When you look at the regional forest agreements it explicitly states that the environmental obligations are not binding on the government. The minister has not seen to address that because he knows he is in the wrong. I have made that abundantly clear in this debate. 
The question now really becomes academic. What the Crean Labor Party is doing here is joining the Howard government in endorsing a piece of legislation which says: the states are not bound but the Commonwealth is; the woodchip corporations are compensated, but the protective mechanisms for the environment are not going to be enforceable. One example that has arisen during the course of this debate has been buffer areas around streams. I think Senator Murphy gave some good examples of how these are breached.  
Under the Forest Practices Code in several states, and certainly in Tasmania, when it comes to river buffers around streams, 40 metres on either side of the stream must be protected. When it comes to permanent streams, 10 metres more from the tops of banks, not from the centre of the river but the tops of the banks, should be protected, but they are not. Time after time, Forestry Tasmania breaches the Forest Practices Code. Senator Murphy pointed to a case where, even though it is somewhat of a watchdog on its own activities, it was fined $1,000 for a breach of the Forest Practices Code. It is doing it repeatedly. In almost every coupe that you go to in the Tasmanian forests there are massive breaches of its own code. 
This commission does not abide by the law or the ethics of law that it has drawn up itself. The Australian Greens are asking, by moving a proposed new section, for the components of the law which apply to Forestry Tasmania and which apply under this legislation relating to the environmental commitments and the good management commitments, because some of them are certainly not what I would call environmental, to be made binding. The Labor Party joins the government in saying that it does not want to make them binding. 
The question here is: why not make these provisions binding? That is a question that Senator Macdonald for the government and Senator O'Brien for the opposition are not going to answer. The minister was wrong when he said that the RFAs already make these provisions binding. I pointed to the RFAs themselves, which explicitly state that that is not the case, and then he went silent on that particular measure.
—It is not World Heritage forest that is being logged.
—World Heritage value forests are being logged, and the minister can hang his head in shame about that. That is a very good point that the minister, Senator Macdonald, brings up by interjection. The forests in the Weld, the Picton and the Huon, for example, have been described as World Heritage value, not only by Australian scientific authorities—
—You said, `World Heritage listed.'
—If I said, `World Heritage listed', the minister might read it out. You will find him changing, ducking and altering—
—You will not answer it because you know you have been caught out.
—It is becoming a habit of this minister now to misrepresent people and to try to divert—
—You might note that I am being interjected upon, Mr Temporary Chairman. It is becoming a habit of this minister to try to divert this debate from the issue at hand—the forests—toward vilifying the people who want to protect the forests. He has brought up the matter of World Heritage value forests. The forests of the Great Western Tiers are of World Heritage value. It is my submission, and scientists will agree with this, that the forests of the Tarkine, the largest temperate rainforests in Australia, are also of World Heritage value. But they have not been included in the World Heritage listing—to use the word the minister uses— because the state Labor government in Tasmania and the federal Liberal government and its predecessors in the Keating government have simply refused to carry out their international obligation, which is that once you understand that you have an area of World Heritage value you ought to list it. Australia once led the world in endorsing the World Heritage convention; unfortunately, Australia now comes at the back of the pack because it breaches the spirit of that convention time and again. These forests ought to be in a World Heritage area; instead, they are being logged.
Finally, I want to appeal yet again to the Labor Party. It is a very serious matter that we are dealing with. Senator O'Brien knows that the Forest Practices Code is broken by Forestry Tasmania. I went to Mount Arthur on the same day he did. There, a stream that should have a 10-metre buffer from each bank has been logged right through, with the trees felled into that stream. The erosion into that stream, which feeds into the Launceston water supply, is prodigious. It is a clear breach of the Forest Practices Code; therefore, it is a clear breach of the regional forest agreement; therefore, it is a clear breach of the Prime Minister's commitment that there would be environmental protection. Yet here we have the means of ensuring that that does not happen in future by making the Forest Practices Code binding, and Senator O'Brien, who has seen this with his own eyes, says, `I turn my eyes away from this breach of the law as far as the Forest Practices Code is concerned. I will ignore it, because it does not serve the interests of the woodchip corporations in Tasmania for me to do the right thing and insist that they stop breaking the Forest Practices Code and that they be brought to book over it.' If the state government will not do it, then the federal government ought to. I commend this amendment to the chamber. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-03-13,"—I know that what is proposed here was proposed on a previous occasion when we debated this bill. I note that the ALP are proposing a different approach in respect of dealing with parliamentary scrutiny of RFAs. With regard to RFAs and the legally binding issue, it is also my view that they ought to be legally binding. I think I said earlier that the Commonwealth has, in large part, paid a lot of money to the states, for various reasons. We went through a long process. With regard to why these things should be legally binding, what I would like to highlight to the minister and his officials is that it is primarily because the states are not upholding their end of the bargain. The Commonwealth, as it says in the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 and in the regional forest agreements, is expected to legislate to maintain its commitments—and the principal commitments relate to the exemption of regions covered by RFAs from certain Commonwealth legislation. That is a very significant step, particularly if you have the states, who are required to legislate for a whole manner of things, not in their turn upholding their end of the deal.
I want to use a factual example—and I would ask, Minister, that your officers take note of this, because I want them to check it. My example goes to the issue of threatened species. The state of Tasmania has threatened species legislation. Up until late November or early December last year, the threatened species legislation had effect in Tasmania in respect of harvesting operations within RFA regions—and Tasmania is a total RFA region. Drawing again on the wonderful expertise of the Forest Practices Board of Tasmania, I draw the attention of the officers and the minister to page 13 of their current annual report, which states:
(b) Native forests—area (hectares) of operations covered by Forest Practices Plans certified in 2000/2001 by harvesting method, future land use and tenure
It then sets out a graph that demonstrates the amount of state forest and private land that has been harvested and regenerated. The total in respect of clear-felling is 17,850 hectares. If you analyse that further, what has actually happened is that approximately 17,850 hectares have been partially logged or, if you like, selectively logged, leaving 10,000 hectares which have been clear-felled—and I would ask the officers, again through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to check this, as the minister might want to verify that what I am saying is actually true. If you then look at the operation of clear-felling and say, for instance, that approximately 20 per cent—and we will be fair here—of the coupes that have been harvested by the clear-fell method are left in streamside reserves and not harvested for some other reason, that leaves about 8,000 hectares that have been clear-felled and burnt.
Under any legislation in respect of flora and fauna—threatened species—that is a breach. There is no question about that: that is a breach. You cannot comply with the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 and conduct that sort of harvesting practice. What has happened is that, in order to allow the Tasmanian government to permit the forest companies to comply with this act, they have amended it. I say to the government and the minister: that was not the situation when the government negotiated the regional forest agreement. What the state has done is to change state legislation to allow it to breach its own legislation, through the regional forest agreement—because the regional forest agreement actually mentions the Tasmanian act. That is why at some point the Commonwealth has to stand up and say, `When we made this agreement, we had an expectation that you would honour those commitments.' This is where it comes back to ecologically sustainable forest management. The state of Tasmania is legislating to avoid that obligation, and that is why the Commonwealth has to take a stand and make some of this legally binding. It is imperative that we do that. If we do not, we will continue to allow the states—Tasmania, Victoria, South Australia or wherever—to legislate away at the state level the obligations that they have given. That is what you will allow them to do, because the regional forest agreement, if you read it, Minister, does not stipulate any requirement on the state. You wrote a letter to me, arguing a case for why things are not legally binding. Indeed, you raised the issue of constitutionality. All I can say is that I draw to the attention of your officers— 
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Do you mean my officers, Senator Murphy?
—I do apologise, Mr Temporary Chairman: through you, I draw the attention of the officers of the department of the minister to section 51 and subsection (xxxix) of the Constitution. There are enough Roman numerals there to sink a ship. I seem to recall that the Commonwealth was not too backward in coming forward some years ago in respect of laws that related to human rights in terms of gay and lesbian rights. The Commonwealth seemed to be prepared to use its powers then, and I suggest to the minister that the Commonwealth has every right, particularly when it is being dudded by a recalcitrant state government, to put legislation in place at the Commonwealth level to ensure that the state upholds its end of the agreement and the commitments it has given to the Commonwealth through a regional forest agreement—because the Commonwealth and the state are the only parties to that agreement. I am not going to argue about whether Senator Brown's amendment is the correct form in which to do that, but I support the thrust and the principle of doing it. It is important. Otherwise, the Commonwealth is just going to allow the state of Tasmania—or any states or, indeed, territories—to legislate away at the state level the obligations to do certain things. You only have to look at the state's own, if you like, checker, the Forest Practices Board and to read its annual report to see that the state is not complying with the thrust of the regional forest agreement.
As I said the day before yesterday, I think, I had cause to visit some people in the north-west of Tasmania with regard to a property that had been purchased by Gunns. A report had been prepared that the land proposed to be harvested had been left by the owners two times previous to the present owners, Gunns, for the express purpose of protecting a threatened species—namely, the freshwater crayfish. Because of the amendment in November or December last year to the state's Threatened Species Act, Gunns can now harvest that property. To me, that is unacceptable. Nobody knows some of these things better than I, because I argued with the Labor Party and Labor ministers about a lot of this. I was a member of the Forest and Forest Industry Council in Tasmania, appointed by the state minister, and I can say that during the course of all those meetings it was never the intention to end up with the situation that we now have; the intention through the National Forest Policy Statement was to have a regional forest agreement. I say again to the minister and to others that this is the last chance for the Commonwealth to do something, and it should do it. I hope that at some point we will put something of substance into this legislation, to ensure that the states uphold their end of the bargain.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-13,"—Senator Murphy raises a couple of issues. As well as being advised by officers from my department, I am advised by officers from Environment Australia that the Tasmanian legislation that Senator Murphy speaks about was changed in accordance with the RFA. That is, it had to have Commonwealth involvement, and that involvement was with Environment Australia, taking into account the threatened species legislation and the Commonwealth's obligations in relation to that. So it was done in accordance with the arrangement. Unfortunately, that adviser has just left to check on another matter, but my understanding of his advice to me is that that was actually done in conjunction with Environment Australia. I cannot give you the nature of the consultation, but there was consultation with Environment Australia. 
—I would appreciate a briefing on that consultation.
—I am very happy to do that for you , as I have indicated to you privately and publicly. I am happy to do that for anyone who has a serious and genuine interest in this, and I am sure you have, Senator Murphy, and I am sure the Labor Party has as well. We are quite happy to do that, because this is not a political exercise; this is trying to bind the Commonwealth to its obligations under the RFA. That is all we can do constitutionally. We think the RFAs are well done, and we have all agreed with them. You agreed with them, Senator Murphy, in a previous life. Now you say you did not, but you did. The debate has been going on for more than 15 years, and what this whole arrangement was about was trying to have the arguments, the debate, the consultation and the negotiation, to look at the science and make sure it was all all right and to embody that in legislation, so that everybody would know where we were going and so that those very substantial reserves that have been set aside—and they are better than international requirements demand—would be certain and people's jobs and security and small businesses would be secure and people could invest to continue those jobs in those small townships with certainty. That was the whole purpose. The debate has been had for 15 years. There are certain people who will never accept the will of the people and the principle behind it. It is a free country, and that is their business. So, if you want a briefing on anything, Senator Murphy, please let me know, and I will arrange it either with my office or with Environment Australia. That is my advice.
I make this comment in passing: when natural fires go through areas, certainly threatened species are endangered, and there is nothing anyone can do about that. Of course, there have been wildfires throughout Australia for many years. 
Senator Murphy, you are interested in the point—and I guess we all are, although, unfortunately, we do not always have time to follow these things through as closely as we would like, and I am no constitutional law expert—but my understanding and advice is that the Commonwealth does not have the power to legislate in relation to forest practices. They are clearly matters for state governments. Perhaps we might, under our international obligations, have some ability to legislate in relation to threatened species, but again I am told that this may be in the nature of the Commonwealth enacting legislation that says, `If you deliberately endanger an endangered species then you are liable to fines and penalties'—so there are consequences. I suspect there is legislation that says that, although I will have to get advice on that. It is not germane to this particular debate today, so I do not want to spend more time on it. 
I am very anxious to get this legislation through. I am anxious to answer any legitimate questions that are asked of me here or, in the case where they are not germane to this bill, perhaps we could get you that information some other time. Like you, Senator Murphy, I think that, even though our Public Service is world class, sometimes it slips up, sometimes our advisers slip up and sometimes governments slip up. Where that happens, if you are interested in the outcome, come and talk to us and the officials, put your case and let them put their case. You may be able to give them information they do not have; perhaps they can give you information you do not have—they do have fairly wide resources. If you are right and they are wrong, let us fix it. I am very happy to do that.
I am very happy to work with anyone who has a genuine interest in these sorts of debates. I am not terribly interested in working with people who get up and publicly say, `World Heritage listed forests have been logged. The government have the power to stop it; why aren't they stopping it?' We all know that that is a complete and absolute misrepresentation of the truth. I am not interested in those sorts of people. They are obviously in the business for reasons that are not related to our country or our environment, the ecology and threatened species—they are pursuing some other agenda. I am interested in people who are genuinely interested, and there are a lot of those people. I am very happy to work with them. This probably is not the place to do it.  
We are in a situation where this bill has been through a number of times, and it has been through committees. Different people have put up amendments and the government over the years have taken what is appropriate out of those amendments. We have included it in our legislation. We brought it back—this is the fourth time. We hope that we have covered everything. But we do not want to be in a situation where, every time it comes forward, people start thinking of another amendment they can put forward and so delay the process. We want to get it through.
That is why I do not want to enter into long debates, Senator Murphy, at this stage about matters that are in the area but not really relevant to this legislation. I would like to see this legislation go through. I understand that the Labor Party, you and Senator Harradine, perhaps with amendments, want to get it through. Other legislation is going to start building up in the Senate. There is talk that we might sit Saturday and Sunday to get through it.
—There is plenty of time in April and May.
—Senator Murphy, you know, as I do, that we all have other things to do, including you. You are not the easiest person to contact, as I have proved. You are out doing other things. You have a constituency to serve. We do want to get it through. We want the full time for adequate debate on the legislation, but we do not want filibustering about things that are vaguely related but not germane to the legislation just so there will never be a vote on the subject. If people who are opposed to this think they are right, let us put it to the House of Representatives and see what the representatives of the people actually say. 
I will try to answer Senator Murphy and other senators who have a genuine interest in this and make genuine inquiries on the legislation. Where their inquiries are not on the legislation, I am very happy to arrange, at your convenience and that of the department—although I am sure we can make their convenience mirror yours—to go through these things. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—I have two very specific and easy questions to ask the minister which are very important in this matter of whether or not we should support a Greens clause to make the regional forest agreements binding. Firstly, is it a fact that none of the East Gippsland RFA is binding? That includes the no compensatory provisions. Secondly, is it true that the East Gippsland five-year review of the RFA has been deferred? If so, was the Commonwealth asked? Did the Commonwealth agree? Where was that made public? When will this five-year review be completed?
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Murphy, do you want to ask the minister some questions at the same time?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-03-13,"—Yes, I do. As somebody who has been involved in this process since 1978, let me assure you, Minister—
—Perhaps you could assure the minister through the chair, Senator Murphy.
—Of course. I assure the minister, through the chair, that, having argued this to and fro through 13 years of Labor government, I do not want to prolong this either. I can assure you I have other things I would like to do; I have one which I enjoy very much and I would much rather be doing that than sitting in here arguing the case about the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002.
I do have a genuine concern about these matters, and it worries me when I see evidence of circumstances that I fully believe—from the intention of this whole program, commencing at the National Forest Policy Statement level—were never intended to happen. This goes to the question I was asking before about the Threatened Species Protection Act of Tasmania, which you say was done in accordance with Environment Australia. The Threatened Species Protection Act said that the Forest Practices Plan would be sufficient—if there were in place a forest practices plan that was required to take account of the threatened species in a particular area to be harvested—to exempt the harvesting from the Threatened Species Protection Act. It has now been demonstrated in a recent case, known as the Dudley case, which is before the Resource Management and Planning Appeal Tribunal, that the Forest Practices Plan did not adequately protect two threatened species in the north of the state. I ask. through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, whether the minister would like to check this or ask Environment Australia what its views are about that. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-13,"—Again, Senator Murphy, that is not particular germane to this debate. I will take it on notice. Perhaps if you could give us some more detail—
—Privately.
—Perhaps Senator O'Brien could give us the detail.
—Privately, I would suggest.
—Privately, yes; give us the information privately and we will follow that through. Again, if there are breaches of either the RFA or the Commonwealth's obligations, we will pursue them. As I said to you in a letter and publicly, even though I have no jurisdiction I am very happy to join you in approaching the Tasmanian government if you have evidence and clear facts. If you can say, `On this day or at this time these particular things happened in this particular locality,' then let's try to follow it through.
Senator, you made in your previous speech a reasonably good point that, if you clear-fell and burn, the chances are that some endangered species might be harmed. But you probably, again, know better than I that—I think it is under the RFA and under the code in Tasmania—there is a very precise process: before there is any logging they send in forest practices officers—are you saying they are corrupt as well?—who must assess all of the values of the proposed area for harvesting. If there is a threatened species in the area, then prescriptions would be incorporated into the harvesting plan to protect those values. I have seen areas that have been clear-felled—not cleared; I know you know the difference, Senator Murphy, but others here would suggest that clear-felling means clearing—and there are stands left. You say, `What's that all about?' and they say, `There was something of value there that the forest practices officers looked at and dealt with.' We try to address the sorts of issues you are talking about.
I recall—having just checked—that, where the forest practices officer assesses values, they then bring in specialist flora and fauna assessment officers and specialist heritage assessment officers. You are nodding in agreement, Senator Murphy; you know that. I can only assume that you are saying, `Yes, but it does not work.'
—You've got it.
—You've got it in one.
—Senator, if you are alleging that people are deliberately not doing their job, or they are doing it wrongly, or they are being threatened and overborne, that is a matter for the relevant state authority who has control over this. Of course, you have the ability not only to put the point in a proper submission but to raise public interest in that. Public interest can be a powerful tool when it is reasonably and responsibly used. It is not much of a tool when it is done by rabblerousing people who go into the forests and criminally destroy areas. They send a message, but not that sort of message. Where there is a genuine issue, I am sure you know better than I do how to arrange those things. 
If you are alleging malpractice, inability or just plain lack of skills, perhaps those are things that should be addressed by the relevant state government. Whilst I have no particular authority in that, I am happy to lend whatever assistance I can in getting to the bottom of those things. That is not directly germane to the bill that we are debating at the moment, but I am very happy to take those matters on and help if I can, even though it is beyond my constitutional ability. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—The minister did not answer the very clear and specific question I asked him.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Perhaps you would like to take this opportunity to repeat those questions when the minister is not seeking further information to enhance the debate.
—The questions were: firstly, is it true that the East Gippsland Regional Forest Agreement is not binding in any way and does not have a compensation provision to be bound by, anyway? Secondly, is it true that the five-year review of the East Gippsland RFA, which was due this year, has not taken place and therefore we see another effective breach of the regional forest agreement as publicly proclaimed five years ago? I ask the minister: was the Commonwealth consulted to allow a delay or even a complete acquittal from this obligation to have a five-year review? If so, when did those consultations take place and why wasn't the public informed? If not, what action has the minister taken to see that that review gets under way? What consultations have taken place with the Victorian Bracks government, which has failed to undertake this review as the regional forest agreement required?",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-03-13,"—We should not take longer than we can afford to, but there are some important matters. Minister, when you raised the issue with me and I indicated that this thing is not working, it is in fact not working. I will come to that in a minute, but I would try to impress on you that it is relevant to this legislation—
—Are you trying to impress on me or on the minister?
—Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I am trying to impress on the minister.
— Perhaps you would care to do that indirectly through me.
—I will endeavour to do that. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I would like to impress upon the minister that it is relevant to this legislation. With regard to the process, what you outlined is correct. They do have forest practices officers who go out and do the flora and fauna assessments. They also have other officers who do assessments of the likely harvest outcomes, yield outcomes et cetera. They also employ the services of specialist people—scientists who are specialists in the fields of fauna or flora—to write reports, and they may feel that there are some species that may be of significance or may be threatened, et cetera. But what happens? Again I refer to this great body known as the Forest Practices Board, for whom the forest practices officers work. The problem is that some of those reports are not being adhered to. 
You say to me, Minister, `You should go to the state body, to the state authorities, or to the state government.' I say to you, Minister—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—that I have done that on any number of occasions, and I have also approached ministers at the Commonwealth level. I have approached them for, I would think, at least 20 years, but more particularly I have approached them on a stronger basis since 1989. That is still a very lengthy period of time. I have shown information to officers of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and, when they watched the videos and saw the photographs, they thought that there was something wrong. They said, `We will go and talk to the minister about this and come back to you.' That was last year.
—When?
—I cannot remember the specific date, but I can give you the specific date if that is what you want. It was well before the last federal election.
—So it was about mid-year.
—No, it was after July. I will give you the specific date. If my staff are watching this debate, which I hope they are, they will be looking for that date right now. 
—You will give that to the minister, will you, Senator Murphy?
—That is a diarised date. There were two officers: the senior officer for forestry at that time—
—Why don't you just let me know and I will follow it through and write to you about it—
—That you can, Minister, but at the end of the day we are debating a bill that, sooner or later during the course of this week, I hope, will pass this Senate. That is the problem. If you gave at least some consideration, which you wrote to me about, in respect of what I have put up as an amendment with regard to monitoring this process—
— Senator Murphy, it is rather difficult to understand, when you are saying `you', whether you are referring to the chair or the minister. I am feeling rather superfluous. You could rectify that malady if you would be kind enough to direct your contribution through the chair.
—I am sorry I am making you feel somewhat superfluous, Mr Temporary Chairman Lightfoot, because you are not. 
— Thank you very much, Senator Murphy, that is very kind.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I am pointing out to the minister and I am referring to the minister, and I apologise because I should be referring to the minister in the third person. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I say to the minister that I would not mind the minister telling me to do certain things if I had not tried these things. I have tried these things. Almost six years ago I wrote to the Forest Practices Board. This was at a time when we had export controls for woodchip export licences. I wrote about an allegation of sawlogs being in the Hampshire woodchip mill yard in the north-west of Tasmania. Indeed, I pleaded with them to come out and inspect six kilometres of logs—six kilometres in length—11 metres long and on average over four metres high in stacked form. They wrote back to me and said, `No, we're not coming out with you, Senator; we won't come out and check anything.' They said that since the inception of the mill there had been two sawlogs found in the Hampshire woodchip mill yard and that they had been recovered and sent back to sawmills. I can tell you that that was the greatest lie of all time. But would that department come out and inspect? No. 
I have, likewise, as I said earlier, asked the Regional Forest Agreement Monitoring Unit, which is supposed to monitor this process, to come down to Tasmania—not take my word for it; not cause me to have to get up in this Senate chamber and, in effect, take a lot of the time of the Senate debating this matter. I have said to them, `Get off your backsides and get down here and have a look. Don't take my word for it; make your own judgment.' But would they do that? No; they said, `No, Senator, we can't do that.' So I asked them, `What is your role? You are listed in this RFA newsletter as the monitor of this supposedly great exercise,' to which they replied, `We'll have to ask the minister, Senator.' `Okay, ask the minister,' I said. And what did I get back from the minister? I got a letter that said, `Don't harass my staff.' Senator, if I should so get an expert opinion that there is somehow a breach occurring in the forests of Tasmania in respect of the regional forest agreement, I then might consider whether or not I will cause an investigation to take place.' What a joke! 
Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I say to the officers that they know it is a joke. It does not work, and this is the place where we should be trying to fix it. And I open the door again: get off your backsides and get down there and have a look, but do not do it through the process listed in the regional forest agreement that says that you have to give three weeks notice, because if you do you will get the Cook's tour—the old sanitised version of a forestry exercise. That is what you have been getting all of your life. The quicker you come to the realisation that that is not what should be happening, the better.  
We have a public responsibility to ensure that these forests are managed, for a whole range of reasons. My involvement throughout this debate has been on the principal reason of employment. I am sick and tired of seeing thousands of jobs go out of this industry because of the way it is managed. That is what is happening. I get sick and tired of hearing members of this Senate, including ministers, get up here and say that this bill is relevant to employment, when that is the greatest load of crap of all time. It is not relevant to employment because it is doing nothing for employment. That is the problem. 
As a former secretary of the Timber Workers Union, which subsequently became the CFMEU, I argued for workers' rights. As I said, I participated on the Forests and Forest Industry Council. I arranged blockades, demonstrations and everything else that you drive to try to get a better outcome for workers. When I see the forests being trashed and logs being piled up on the wharves at Burnie and Bell Bay to be exported to China or Korea, I ask myself: what does that do for the workers in the timber industry of Tasmania? It does not do a thing. When I see logs being left in the bush to burn and tens of thousands of man ferns being destroyed, I ask myself what that does for employment in Tasmania. It does nothing. 
When you look at that and you look at the state government of the day—I do not care; Liberal or Labor—you see that it does not matter whether it is Liberal or Labor. They have both been as bad as one another and have not been prepared to do anything about it. When I was a member of the Labor Party, Jim Bacon and Paul Lennon gave a commitment to the union, in front of other union officials, that if they were successful in coming to the government benches they would do something about this problem, but then they did not do it. They tell me that they will not do that because of financial contributions from certain companies. I find that abhorrent. That is doing nothing for the workers in this industry. I will not cop that.
We have a responsibility in public life to uphold the interests of the people, and in this place in debating this bill we have a responsibility to ensure that we do it not only for the people who work in this industry but for the future generations of this country. That is why we must ensure that the Commonwealth maintain some sort of control over this process. It is not sufficient for us, for political reasons or for political opportunity, to handball this to states that are demonstrating no capacity to manage the resources of their own forests in the best interests of the community. 
I again say, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to the minister: come and have a look; let us defer this bill; let us have your eyes opened and the eyes of your officers opened to see exactly what is going on and then you can come back here and see whether you will respond to me in the unfortunate way that you are responding at the moment. I have great sympathy for you, Minister, because you have come to a new portfolio and it is very difficult one. I do not want to be disrespectful to you in any way at all, because it is a difficult job, but it is important that you are informed to a greater degree than you currently are about what is really happening, not what some people want you to believe is happening. You might say that I am doing exactly the same, but I am not. I am asking you to go and have a look for yourself and then make your own judgment, and that is what I will continue to ask you to do.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-13,"—I was asked about the five-year reviews in the Victorian forests. I can indicate that the RFAs for East Gippsland and Central Highlands were signed in February 1997 and March 1998 respectively. The Central Highlands RFA provides for its first review to be conducted concurrent with the first five-yearly review of the East Gippsland RFA. On this basis the first five-yearly review for the RFAs was due for completion in February this year but, recognising difficulties from the 2001-02 review of sustainable yield and the associated timber licence renewal process and the input to be provided by the review of the Victorian state of the forest reports in June 2002, both parties have agreed informally to extend the review time line to March 2003, the fifth anniversary of the Central Highlands RFA. The Commonwealth has made it clear, though, that we wish to use this extra time to institute a robust review process incorporating the principles of independence, consultation and good science. 
In relation to Senator Murphy's comments, I indicate that I have absolute confidence in the advice given to me by my advisers and my department. They are very professional, very sincere and very able officers, and the advice I am given from them I accept. I have to say, Senator Murphy—I do not want to be provocative here—that I have raised a number of the issues you have raised with me and they have said, `Yes, we have looked into that and this is the answer, this is what happened, this is what was done.' To me, it sounds reasonable, and it is a different point of view; it is looking at it a different way.
You mentioned that you are very concerned about jobs. We all are. One of the reasons that I am so committed to this bill is that it does give security, and security provides jobs. Whilst you might, if you trawl through this long enough, pinprick and find holes in the legislation and in the RFA— nothing is perfect; I accept that—let me ask you this question: what does it do for jobs if this bill is not passed? If all the limitations you mentioned are accurate—and I do not accept they are—then, by defeating this bill, how does that make provision for better jobs in Tasmania? If you want to get the Commonwealth involved in forest management and think there is a way constitutionally to do it, put up another bill about that.
—I put up an amendment.
—No, put up a bill about that. You are very critical of this legislation and you are arguing against it. I again ask you: what will it do for jobs if this bill is defeated? This bill might not do all you want it to do, but certainly you would be further backwards if this legislation is not passed. While I respect your view, Senator Murphy, I also respect the view of the CFMEU, who, as I understand it, want this bill through. I understand the view of workers in the forests who have approached me and said that they want this bill through. I understand the view of Timber Communities Australia, a group that you are familiar with, comprising unionists and people who live in small country towns, and they tell me they want it through. I am sure the CFMEU would not be wanting this bill through if it was going to impact on jobs, if it did not at least take things forward a step—though perhaps not as far as you want; perhaps there are other things we can do to assist with jobs. But I ask you again: by defeating this bill or by delaying it to such an extent that there is never a vote on it, what does that do for jobs? I will tell you what it does: it creates uncertainty and insecurity in the industry, there will be absolutely no investment, jobs will be lost and small communities will shut down.
There are a lot of interesting things that you have said, but can I bring you back to what this bill is all about. Under the RFAs, which evolved over a 15-year period, the Commonwealth made certain commitments on what it would do about things for which it has constitutional power, and the bill has embodied what the Commonwealth could and would do in regional forest agreements which we have signed with four states. This bill holds the Commonwealth to account, and it should not be necessary but it does say that the Commonwealth will abide by the obligations it has made. Different governments may come in the future and may have different views, and things can be changed, but anyone who has relied on this, who has invested money on the strength of these agreements, and who then suffers loss by a change in the future would be adequately compensated. Who could argue with that? That is a fair principle of law; it is embodied in our Constitution in other areas. That is what this bill is about. It is really giving legislative backing to the agreements that the Commonwealth has made. You are saying that perhaps we have not made the right agreements. I do not agree with that, but you might be right. Whatever is there, this bill confirms, cements, makes certain that the Commonwealth will at least abide by its part of the RFA; and that is what this bill is about. 
—Why should it not also take account of the states' role?
—Senator, there is such a thing as the Australian Constitution. There are certain things the federal parliament can do, and land management is not one of them. Land management, which includes forest management, is a matter for state government. We can have the argument—and the more I see of this the more perhaps I become a centralist and the more one wonders what purpose states serve—but to even imagine that you are going to get a change in the Constitution to do away with the states is fantasy land stuff, even though many of us at times might think that that is a good idea. The states are there; they have constitutional powers. The federal government is there; it does have some constitutional powers, but it specifically does not have others. We can only legislate for what we can do; that is what this bill is about. It is very important to the industry to give that security and to give that understanding so that the forest industry can go ahead, so that jobs can be created and so that people and their families, those who rely on them, do have a future.
Sure, some of what you say might be right. But by not passing this bill we are not going to increase the security of workers in the forest industry. So I urge you that if you have other issues, if you want to put forward other bills, if you want to ask questions, if you want me to do things, let us pursue all of that at the appropriate time, but let us get this bill through so at least the security that is there through legislatively backing the agreements made by a Commonwealth government in the RFAs is passed and then we can move on and continue considering the areas that you want to.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—I want to commend Senator Murphy for the speech he gave a while ago. It was one of the finest and most compelling speeches on this issue, or on a range of issues, that there has been in the Senate chamber for a long time. It deserves to be widely read by everybody who has an interest in the forest issue in Australia and, indeed, the issue of jobs that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation just referred to. Whatever else can be said in here, there is no greater defender in this parliament of the jobs component of the forest industry than Senator Murphy. Senator Murphy and I, in the past, have been at great loggerheads over that. Senator Murphy has referred to the blockade of the Wilderness Society on which I sat some years ago. It is very important that a member of the Senate who has such a clear and long working knowledge of what is going on on the forest floor be listened to and be heeded.
I noted that during his speech Senator Murphy again said to the minister, `Come down and have a look; in fact, suspend this bill while you come and have a look.' The minister's response was, `No, I will take the word of my advisers.' Let me say to the minister that that is a huge political mistake. Where a minister says, `I myself will not make it my business to know what is going on in this industry; I will leave it to advice and I will turn down a request from such a knowledgeable Independent as Senator Murphy to come and see what is going on,' that minister is saying in effect, `I close my eyes to all the evidence that is coming forward. I will not look at it with an even hand; I will not be judicious in this.'
That is the trajectory of a minister and a ministry who will get into trouble because, as Senator Murphy averred—and I can corroborate this—time and again those people who are meant to implement the Forest Practices Code and good management practices in Tasmania are prevented from doing their job, are overruled, are threatened or are sacked. Those people who are involved in the watchdog system are meant to ensure that the Forest Practices Code is properly implemented but they do not do so. They have a biased influence on the outcome. This leads to a travesty of the system. For example, the Forest Practices Board in Tasmania is supposed to investigate complaints without fear or favour and independently ensure that the Forest Practices Code is implemented, but that does happen. Senator O'Brien knows that does not happen, Senator Murphy knows that does not happen and I know that does not happen. 
Indeed, looking into Senator Murphy's speech, there are very grave allegations of corrupt influence at the highest levels in the Tasmanian government, and they simply cannot be dismissed in a debate like this. I have foreshadowed the bringing of a bill into this place calling for an inquiry into the whole rotten edifice in Tasmania which fails to deliver the Forest Practices Code, ecologically sustainable management and the aspirations of the people of that state that their forests should be managed in their long-term interests—and that does not happen. What the minister is doing is, before the chamber, determinedly saying, `I will not accept an invitation to go and see what is alleged'— very serious allegations—`about the mismanagement of this huge industry that is based on a public resource.' Senator Murphy refers to whole logs sitting on the wharves at Burnie and elsewhere in Tasmania that are destined to go to China and Japan. Why is that?
—Korea.
—China and Korea. Senator O'Brien, I thank you for that correction. The question is: why is that? How can it be that, in a state where some sawmillers cannot get supplies and many have gone out of business, we are told that it is essential to keep cutting into contentious wild forest, some of World Heritage value, and that there are whole logs—these are native forest logs—on the wharves waiting to be exported for downstream processing to other countries.
Logic says that there is something wrong here—something very wrong indeed. How can it be that people routinely go into the forest coupes, after they have been logged and left by the woodchippers, and take out truckloads of sally, sassafras and myrtle— high-value timbers—for backyard wood-turning, for furnishing and so on? The people who do that are acting illegally: it is illegal to go in and clean up after the loggers without a licence from Forestry Tasmania. But what happens is that Forestry Tasmania comes along and firebombs that same resource. There is massive mismanagement of the forests in Tasmania, and the minister says, `I won't go and look at it; I'll depend on my adviser system'—which has led to this mismanagement.
This is a very important moment for the chamber. We are supposed to be the watchdog of government behaviour, of the delivery of the executive of government, but particularly we are a watchdog of the Australian resource base, in the interests of the people. In this chamber, Senator Murphy, Senator O'Brien and I represent Tasmania—we represent the interests of our state as well—and here we have legislation whereby the Commonwealth is ceding its powers back to the states to protect forests and ensure that they are managed properly. I have an amendment before the committee that says, `Let's make the agreement at least binding on the states as well as the Commonwealth.' The minister says we cannot do that: we can give our powers away but we cannot insist that the state implement its side of the agreement. 
I would point to just one of a huge litany of breaches of the forest agreement signed by the Prime Minister—a simple thing like a five-year review of East Gippsland. Without any public announcement, without any reference to the owners of those forests or the people of Victoria, we now find in the Senate chamber the minister saying, `Oh well, there was a behind-door covert agreement between the governments that we put that off.' It was a very simple tenet, loudly proclaimed at the signing of the original forest agreement for East Gippsland, that there would be a five-year review. That has been changed. It is now not going to be for six years. The minister just says, `Well, I am part of that breach of public faith in the regional forest agreement,' and the public has not been told about it.
The minister refers to the inability of the Commonwealth to be able to have the states bound in this matter. He is totally wrong, and constitutional advice will show that he is wrong. Indeed, he will not be furnishing advice in here—and I ask him to furnish advice if he has it—which says that the Commonwealth, in a position where it is ceding powers, does not have the ability to get a reciprocation from the states and have it legislated. I therefore ask the minister, if he can, to give constitutional authority to this amendment binding the states as well as the Commonwealth to the regional forest agreements— poor as they might be—so that they are implemented. I am not going to get an answer, and the Senate chamber is not going to get an answer.  
We should and we must support this amendment. When the Commonwealth cedes its power to the states to ensure that there is good management of Australia's forests, we should and must expect the states to be obliged to carry through, particularly when we have such a powerful exposition as the one we have just heard from Senator Murphy that since the signing of the regional forest agreement the state with the biggest industry, Tasmania, has manifestly been breaching the regional forest agreement, not just at the level of surveillance by Forest Practices Code officers but right through to the leaders of the state government, the Premier and the Deputy Premier. What could be a more serious indictment of failure of process at a time when we have amendments here that can fix it?
When the minister says, `Well, we'll leave it to see how it goes,' that is not acceptable. It is not working. The minister resorts to the old shibboleth, `We have to get this legislation through for jobs.' At the outset of this debate, Mr Temporary Chairman, you will recall that I asked the minister to present the figures showing that 550 jobs would be created in the native forest logging industry in Tasmania. Prime Minister Howard promised on that day in 1997, when he signed the regional forest agreement with the then state Premier of Tasmania, that these jobs would be created.
I said to the minister, `Where are those jobs?' because at least 450 jobs have in effect been shed from that industry. So the industry got $80 million plus of taxpayers' money. In the woodchip industry particularly, the bigger the corporation the more it gets in flow-ons and Gunns is the biggest hardwood woodchipper in the world. Where are the jobs it has created vis-a-vis the absorption of North and Boral in the last two years? Right now, Gunns is shedding more jobs. It is what you call rationalising. Its objective is profit; it is not jobs. The concept that this regional forest agreement is for job creation is a total deception. The way that concept is being used and the way it was just used by the minister is very dishonourable in purporting to create jobs when the record is that jobs are being lost and will continue to be lost. It is known politically that it is a very strong driver. The CFMEU, in my book, falls into this all the time—`This will create jobs.' The record shows that it sheds jobs, that massive amounts of money go into the big corporations, which get bigger, and small ones lose out further down the line. Forests are not being managed for the small operator; they are being managed for the big operator. 
In Tasmania, 90 per cent plus of the forests are going to woodchippers, and in amongst those are millions of tonnes of sawlog value logs which should be being kept for generations of sawlogging to come, but they are not. They are being woodchipped and sent to Japan to make a quick profit for Gunns, its shareholders outside Tasmania and the five or six board members of Gunns who recently voted themselves a pay increase from $200,000 to $500,000 per annum. It is a sheer windfall for them. Their jobs are secure, but they do not care at all about the jobs of the people who work in this industry. I will be testing this shortly with an amendment. In the meantime, this amendment, which requires the states as well as the Commonwealth to be bound by regional forest agreements, is compelling, is important, is good practice and ought to be supported.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-03-13,"—I do not intend to make any other contribution to this debate other than to speak to my own amendments—primarily because I think it is just a big waste of time. Minister, in respect of the questions you asked me, I raised this matter with Michael O'Loughlin, head of the RFA Monitoring Unit, in either late September or early October 2000. I subsequently wrote to Mr O'Loughlin on 19 October 2000 as a result of not hearing back from him after the phone call I made. I then received a letter from the minister on 2 November 2000. I wrote back to the minister on 7 November 2000 and made the same offers that I have made to you with respect to visiting the forests as I made to Michael O'Loughlin of the RFA Monitoring Unit and I have never received a response to that letter. Moreover, on 10 August last year I had a lengthy meeting with Rob Rawson and another officer from AFFA, during which I showed them video material and still photographic evidence of what I believed were breaches, but as I have said consistently, `Don't take my word for it, don't believe what you see on the video; come down and have a look.' I do not wish to misrepresent their view, but I got the impression that they were pretty horrified by what they saw. They said they would talk to the minister and come back to me and I have not heard anything from that day. So I hope you can understand that I am not too confident about how things work. 
As I said previously, I have written to state authorities, the Forest Practices Board and the minister. Indeed, in two coupes which were harvested in the north-west in Mawbanna State Forest, Dip 21(c) and I think 21(a)—I cannot remember off the top of my head—which were mixed forest, primarily myrtle, there was a significant residue of logs. I received a call from a contractor, a person working in the industry. Shayne Murphy does not have time to wander around every single forest looking for things to pick holes in, to try to find arguments. I have better things to do with my time. If I have any spare time, I like to go fishing. I assure you that I do not want to spend any more time wandering around the forests than I have to. So I got a call from a contractor, whom I did not know from a bar of soap, and he said to me, `You need to come and have a look at this. I am concerned by the circumstances I am confronted with.' So I went down to have a look. I said, `What are you doing here, because I was here when this coupe was harvested?' In fact, I still have the video of the harvesting of the coupe, which has never been shown, and I have a voiceover of a contractor who did the harvesting, which I will never produce because the views he expressed to me at that time would jeopardise his employment. Coming back to the contractor who was in this coupe, he said, `I was asked to come in here to clear out some of the residue so that they could windrow this and burn it. The windrow contractor wanted almost three times the normal rate because there were so many logs left on the forest floor.' Forestry Tasmania can verify this because I have had them out there. The contractor said, `I'm there cutting this wood, myrtle logs. I've taken 32 ten-yard tip truck loads of sawlogs out of this coupe. I have asked Forestry Tasmania for a sawlog permit. They won't give me one. I am now afraid that I could be prosecuted'—which he could have been—`for illegally taking sawlogs out of a state forest coupe.' He was seeking my assistance to address that problem.
I went to Forestry Tasmania and I got the District Forester, Paul Smith, and his second-in-command, Islay Robertson—this can all be checked—and I asked them to come out to the coupe to do an inspection, and that we did. There were significantly more sawlogs recovered from those coupes—a significant number. What happened was that, before the windrowing was to proceed, I wrote to the minister and asked the minister if we could send in an on ground sawmilling operation at no cost to the government and at no cost to Forestry Tasmania. The response was no. So they windrowed the two coupes and they burnt them. We then conducted an inspection after the coupes had been burnt and it was the view of some sawmilling people that there was still a significant amount of sawmill material that could be recovered. So I wrote to the minister again and I asked whether we could now proceed, at no cost to the government and at no cost to Forestry Tasmania, to put an on ground sawmilling operation in those coupes and endeavour to recover what we considered to be a significant amount of high-quality valuable resource. The response was no. I cannot accept the minister's criticism that I have not endeavoured to pursue these matters through the proper processes—which they really should be; that should be the process that works. We should be able to go to the relevant authorities and/or state government to get these matters rectified. Clearly, that ought to be the case. 
I had been in the same area of the Mawbanna Forest two years before. I raised the same problem with Forestry Tasmania. I videoed material to show to Forestry Tasmania the number of myrtle sawlogs that were being left behind. Myrtle is a very valuable timber. After I had shown them that video I asked them, `Why have you not recovered these logs?' I cut one log with my own chainsaw. I went to Forestry Tasmania and asked, `Can I get the log?' It was less than 30 metres from the road. It was over seven metres long and one metre in diameter. I offered to pay for it. They said no. There was a range of timber lying about the place that anybody would have been pleased to have at a sawmill where it could be milled. I certainly would have been pleased with it. The amount of timber I could have recovered was amazing. I would not have wanted to sell it because it was beautiful timber to use in a house, furniture et cetera. It was proposed that that be burnt.  
I went back 12 months later and the only reason it had not been burnt was that it got too wet and Forestry Tasmania could not light a fire, which is unusual for them because they are pretty good at it. They could not get it to burn so they did not burn it. When I went back 12 months later and the log was still there I thought I would try it again. I asked, `Can I get that log?' I was told no. 
Minister, I do not accept your criticism that I have not endeavoured to pursue these matters through the correct processes, because I have. The only reason I stand in this place and argue the case for the Commonwealth to maintain some control and right is because of the failings of the system at the state level. I would not be bothered otherwise. We have the constitutional right to do this, and we have used that right on any number of occasions previously. I again refer to part 5 of the Constitution, `Powers of the Parliament', and section 51, which states:
The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have the power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to: ...
There is a whole range of things. I particularly want to refer to placitum (xxxix) which states:
Matters incidental to the execution of any power vested by this Constitution in the Parliament or in either House thereof, or in the Government of the Commonwealth, or in the Federal Judicature, or in any department or officer of the Commonwealth. 
It is my view that that does provide the Commonwealth with the right. 
—Unfortunately your view is not shared by the High Court. 
—Is that right. I would like you to produce some evidence that what I am suggesting by way of amendment is not right. If you can do that then I may be convinced of that at the time. 
—I'll write to you about that.
—I have received a lot of letters, as I said. In regard to the people I have spoken to, I hope you will understand why I have a sense of frustration—having identified problems, or having endeavoured to identify problems, and having been confronted by a significant failing in the system at both the state and Commonwealth level. That is why I want to continue to pursue this issue and make sure that the Commonwealth has a capacity to at least ensure that some integrity in this whole system is maintained. It is of vital importance.
Finally, with respect to jobs, it is critical in some aspects to get this legislation through—there is no question about that. As I said before, Labor governments in the past used the forest industry as a political football. Former Senator Graham Richardson, in the process of seeking to extract what was perceived as a two per cent green vote, used the forest industry. I was very dark about that and I have voiced my opinion about that to any number of former and current Labor members of parliament. No-one wanted to see this matter progressed more than I—that is, taking away the right of the government of the day, for political win purposes, to use the forest industry as a political football.
I clearly support this process for those reasons. But I also want to ensure that integrity in the process is maintained, that—this word we keep hearing about—security for the industry will deliver some investment et cetera. I can tell you that I have heard so many announcements about investments, so many announcements about a feasibility study into a feasibility study to see if we are going to have a this or a that. I took the opportunity to ring the state government again the other day and they rang me back yesterday. I asked them about their Industry Development Plan 2001. In relation to the section on forestry, timber and paper it says: 
South African company, Kortas Veneer and Plywood, has undertaken a study into the feasibility of a 120,000 cubic metre veneer mill in Tasmania.
I thought I should find out how well that was going so I rang the Treasury—there is a phone number in the document—and they could not tell me. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-03-13,"—I have a couple of points I should put on the record which may assist the debate. The first point relates to whole native hardwood logs being exported from Tasmania. I do not know which particular logs Senator Murphy was referring to. I do know that a trial project is currently running whereby hardwood logs are exported to Korea and also to Finland for the rotary veneer peeling process. If the project is developed—and I understand that all indications at the moment are positive—the intention is to establish rotary peel veneer factories in the state of Tasmania to manufacture construction grade ply, which will be export as well as import replacement. That is the advice that I have, but that may not involve the logs in question. So there are valid reasons why hardwood logs would be exported. It may be that there are other areas where logs are also being exported. 
As far as the federal opposition is concerned, the intent behind the opposition's philosophy on resource security for this industry is to confirm a long-term future within this country for downstream processing of the products of the forest. I have spoken to a number of people from the forest industry and it is our view that this cycle of regional forest agreements provides the opportunity for the industry to prove to the Australian community that it can provide a long-term and sustainable future for the forest industry, including substantial downstream processing of its product in this country, and that its performance over the lives of those regional forest agreements will have a significant bearing on whether agreements are renewed—and, if they are renewed, in what form they are renewed. I do not pretend to know which particular logs were sitting on which particular wharf at a particular period of time—that is impossible. I am sure Senator Murphy would appreciate that, but what I am saying is that there are reasons why whole logs might be exported, particularly as part of that process.
I also understand there is a process in train where a laminated interlocking flooring system, which is a commonly used floor covering around the country, is being trialled using Tasmanian hardwood as the top veneer of that particular product. That process is probably unlikely to find its way as a manufacturing process into Tasmania because of the economies of scale involved, at least at this stage. It would be my hope that the matter continues to be investigated and if there are opportunities for that sort of downstream processing it should find its way into the state.
But I reiterate that we see the process of establishment and development of downstream processing opportunities as integral to this cycle of regional forests agreements and therefore I agree with Senator Murphy that there are aspects of this legislation that are crucial to the process of establishing those opportunities. The industry tells us—and I am sure that they have told Senator Murphy and the government—they need to be able to assure the people who will finance those developments that they are not going to find a couple of years down the track that the resources have been so manipulated that they do not actually have the wherewithal to conduct a viable business in the industry. So security of the resource and the security that the Commonwealth will not capriciously breach agreements it has already entered into require the passage of this legislation.
Let me say in relation to the matters Senate Murphy raised, with regard to what he says are particular problems in particular localities with the administration of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, that an amendment—I will come to that later—in our view will deal with the provision to this parliament of the opportunity to review those matters. If they are proven in the context of, for example, public hearings before a joint parliamentary committee, there would be, I think, compelling pressure on any state government to correct deficiencies in the operation of its regional forest agreement. I suspect there would also be compelling pressure on the Commonwealth, where it had the opportunity to do so, to require compliance with provisions of regional forest agreements in accordance with the necessary review clauses in particular agreements. We believe our amendments provide the wherewithal to do that. That view may not be shared by other senators but that is the view of the opposition. I look forward to the debate on that particular provision at the appropriate time and, hopefully, in the not-too-distant future and in the context of the conduct of this debate. ",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—Senator O'Brien has just said that effectively where there is broad-scale breaching of the regional forest agreements in the application of the Forest Practices Code, as in Tasmania—which we have had so cogently outlined by Senator Murphy— we will leave it to some future inquiry by a Commonwealth and/or state committee. If these breaches are found to be actually occurring, and we know they are—who here is going to say that Senator Murphy is wrong in what he says—then we will get them fixed up after that because the states would have to fix them, wouldn't they, even though we know that they have a whole edifice of policing of forest practices, which is failing totally.
Senator Murphy, on behalf of the Crean Labor opposition, which is totally in support of the Howard coalition on the matter of getting this legislation through, says he will not support the Greens amendment which would make the regional forest agreement binding on the states as well as the Commonwealth. So the one mechanism that might put some teeth into this legislation in terms of ensuring so-called ecologically sustainable management and would ensure the reserve system, Labor will not allow. The Labor Party will block that. 
That brings me back to the very learned letter from Mr John Haywood in Tasmania to Senator O'Brien, the shadow minister for Labor on forestry, earlier this month, which has gone unanswered. I read the first part of that letter last night.
—In the last few days you mean.
—Thank you, Senator O'Brien. I will continue the letter from Mr Haywood. It says:
A ... wasteful 94% of all logs felled were chipped ... [and] While this may see a wanton stupidity, the minimal labour, time, and processing required for woodchipping, combined with enormous volumes of trees obtained for virtually nothing, means that it is extremely profitable for the well-connected few. Newly emerged market dominator Gunns Ltd recently announced a 191% increase in profits along with a profit target double that again. The fault lies with the public officials who are sanctioning the give away of public resources and attendant environmental destruction. Despite the already mind-boggling inefficiency, Forestry Tasmania (FT), the caretaker of public forests, has offered loggers an additional 2.5 million tonnes of publicly owned wood p.a if they can find a buyer.
This level of exploitation is made possible by extraordinary administrative arrangements in which the woodchip industry has been given virtually total self-regulation, with immunity from planning and environmental legislation. Industry representatives control the Forest Practices Board, the industry regulator, which approves almost 99% of logging plan applications, as well as the Forest Practices Tribunal, which upholds the Board's decisions against public objections by a similar percentage.
The industry, including its GBO agencies, campaigns vigorously and often deviously against a wide range of planning and conservation proposals, while actively promoting its sympathisers for strategic positions at both levels of government. It also exercises a blatant power to dictate the passage of legislative amendments to eliminate the most minor constraints—
a process which we are seeing enhanced here today, I might add. Back to Mr Haywood's letter:
In 1998, ater a Supreme Court decision upheld a council's power to refuse approval for harvesting a rural residential zone, the Bacon government— 
in Tasmania—
passed amendments to enable a landowner to bypass council by direct application to the Forest Practices Board for Private Timber Reserve (PTR) status. The PTR is itself an extraordinary legal device, is an easement to the industry which expressly removes the subject land from all planning and environmental legislation.
So a private forest is removed from all planning and environmental legislation under state law. Back to the letter:
It also makes the easement irrevocable if any money is owed by the landowner to the plantation manager and contains a dormant provision which could make PTRs irrevocable if the minister simply declares that they have been recognised by another act, as all of them are.
Mr Haywood said in this letter to the Labor Party shadow minister for forests just a little more than a week ago:
In November 2001, the Tasmanian parliament voted to exempt forestry from a key provision of the Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 a few months after forestry suffered its first and only loss in the Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal over a threatened species issue. There have also been major misuses of public funding, with some $67 million in federal conservation funding being diverted to the replacement of native forest with plantations.
Forestry Tasmania, which has been given control of some 1.6 million hectares of public forest (out of Tasmania's total area of 6.8m hectares), operates openly as a service provider for the woodchip industry.
Mr Haywood says that in 1999-2000, despite a 48 per cent increase in logging volume, Forestry Tasmania:
... reduced its annual public dividend to a ludicrous $2.8 m, down from $11.2m paid the previous year (for which they needed to borrow). Last year, with a 20% increase in the native forest harvest, the dividend fell 34% to $5.75 m. The $2.8 m was later declared to have been increased to $8.68 m, but the following year's annual report indicates the amount paid was the smaller figure—
that is, $2.8 million. It continues:
Most of the very modest royalties received are recycled back to the private operator in the form of logging roads and other infrastructure.
I want to continue with this letter, but I will comment on those figures later. They are in fact worse than Mr Haywood presents, in terms of Forestry Tasmania, which is regularly running at a loss. His letter continues:
FT has never paid a dividend sufficient to pay the interest on the $272 million in forestry debt transferred to the public account in 1990.
That was by then Labor Premier Michael Field. The letter says:
This was reduced by $40 m a few years ago through the sale of pine plantations to a US conglomerate for a fraction of the normal value. In 2000-2001 the dividend fell to about 40% of the dividend from 1997, when the harvest tonnage was less than half as large. FT has in September 2001 admitted having generated further liabilities of $112 million. Some $500 million in public funds have been poured into Forestry Tasmania since 1988. The royalty rates for export woodchips, which FT refuses to divulge in detail, are very low by national standards, reportedly often in the $4-7 per tonne range, which encourages both waste and clear-felling. The biggest private operator is believed to enjoy after-tax profits of a staggering 45-50% on investment, based on 30% returns for a much smaller and more heavily taxed Harris-Daishawa operation in NSW whose accounts are more accessible.
Tasmania's subsidised use of 1080 poisoning against native wildlife is routine, massive, and indiscriminate; the 109,500 kgs. of poisoned carrots prepared last year were sufficient for a bait line 7,000 km long, enough to kill 13 million rufous wallabies. The use of the poison has been described by some RSPCA officials as being in breach of the state's anti-cruelty legislation.
I depart from the letter. This is a massive poisoning of native fauna in Tasmania by the logging industry once it has destroyed their forests, and that mass killing of Australian wildlife will be implemented and enhanced by the passage of this legislation, supported by the Labor Party, which comes from the government. Back to the letter:
The use of the poison has been described by some RSPCA officials as being in breach of the state's anti-cruelty legislation. Studies have indicated that sublethal doses of 1080 cause residual damage to the reproductive systems, brains and kidneys of relatively resistant and often endangered species, such as Spotted-tail Quolls, White Goshawks, and Wedgetail Eagles, a fact studiously ignored by the forestry industry and its subordinates in the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries in all their publications. 
The task of assessing the conservation values of prospective logging coupes, and of monitoring their biodiversity, has been assigned to employees of the logging companies or Forestry Tasmania. They also have the task of deciding if it is necessary to test waterways for residues of their heavy application of herbicides, including those of the carcinogenic atrazine group. The salient quality of Tasmanian logging is its crude expedience, most prominently expressed in the cable logging and clear-felling of steep slopes, banned in many developed countries.
Until recently, the chair of the Threatened Species Scientific Advisory Committee was an employee of Forestry Tasmania, who busily and successfully applied himself to the de-listing of a threatened snail which inconveniently inhabited forest areas.
I add here that they wanted to log those forest areas and some of them have since been logged. Back to the letter:
It is no surprise that Tasmanian forestry is not approved as sustainable by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the most influential international certification body, nor that a Forestry Tasmania manager heads the puppet certification body, Australian Forestry Standard, being set up to circumvent this fact.
The smash-and-grab methods of the woodchip industry mean that Tasmania's potentially very valuable sawn timber is excluded from mainstream world markets which observe Forestry Stewardship Council, FSC, certification. Mr Hayward, in his letter to Labor's shadow forestry minister, Senator O'Brien, which has not been answered, went on to say:
As if chipping was not wasteful enough, the state government is pushing for three wood-fired power generators which would consume close to another million tonnes. It is unlikely that this would come from the 10+ million tonnes annually burnt in smoke-belching and health-threatening pyres on the forest floor. It is expected that these generators will be seen as a profitable way to dispose of clearfelled native forest timber, which is increasingly spurned by Japanese paper mills in favour of specialised pulpwood. The rationale for clearfelling is that, where pulpwood or pine plantations are planted on the sites of cleared public forests, which was the case in 57% of coupes logged in 2000-2001, those plantations became the property of the private plantation managers who establish them, effectively acquiring the land beneath rent-free. (It should be noted that Victoria, recently the subject of the scathing Vanclay report on excessive logging, does not permit the replacement of native forest with plantations).
The plantations which are supplanting both native forests and farmland are a high-volume, low-value, low-employment industry which is having an increasingly destructive effect on Tasmania's far more important tourist and agricultural industries. Some 10% of Tasmanian farms have already been swallowed up by plantation managers in an artificial boom created by the lavish tax concessions currently being attacked by the ATO. Because plantation managers routinely destroy or remove farm infrastructure so as to minimise the property's value for rating purposes, council revenue in forestry areas is being severely reduced (forestry on public land is, unlike the case in Victoria, completely exempt from council rates). Plantations are also exempt from land tax.
The proximity of plantations has also been found to reduce the market value of neighbouring properties by a third or more, a fact that both the industry and the state government strenuously refuse to acknowledge.
This is a compelling letter from a constituent to the Labor Party. It can be assumed that it will fall on deaf ears on the part of the government, but how the Labor Party could line itself up with the Howard government in this matter is beyond belief when it comes to the economic, employment and environmental aspects that are involved. It is such an important letter that I will present the rest of it to the Senate in a moment. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—I will now continue with the letter from Mr Hayward to Senator O'Brien and the Crean opposition, appealing to them not to support this legislation but to intervene and ensure that good forest practices are instituted in Tasmania, where good forest practices, at the moment, are not the norm. Mr Hayward goes on to say:
Plantations employ only about 15% as many people as would farms on the same acreage, a ratio which is worsening along with total forestry employment as the industry becomes more mechanised and the percentage of the harvest chipped continues to increase. Since woodchip export quotas were abolished in November 1997 by the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement, with a resulting huge increase in the volume harvested, employment in forestry has fallen from 6558 to 3440, or 47%, with only about 700 people now reported to be employed in the main activity of native forest logging. Wages and conditions in the industry have also fallen sharply with the concentration of corporate control. 
I depart from the letter for a moment to ask the minister to respond to this committee on those job figures. He has said this is about jobs. The Prime Minister said the regional forest agreement was going to create 550 jobs in Tasmania. What Mr Hayward is saying is that, in fact, hundreds of jobs have been shed since the regional forest agreement was signed, even though the volume of forest being destroyed has dramatically increased. That is a challenge to the minister. I ask him to answer these questions in the chamber: where are the jobs that would be produced? Where are the jobs that have come from the massive investment of taxpayers' money and the so-called security which the regional forest agreement the Prime Minister signed in 1997 promised would be brought about?
Mr Hayward goes on in this very compelling letter to say:
A number of economic studies, such as that released recently by economists Marsden Jacobs Associates, and earlier ones by KPMG and the Victorian Auditor-General, have concluded that Australian native forest logging, when properly costed, is economically indefensible from the public perspective. Amazingly, no cost/benefit analysis has ever been conducted on Tasmanian forestry, by orders of magnitude the most intensive and wasteful in the country, but inferences may be made from the fact that over $231 million, a quarter of the state's debt, has been generated by forestry. No Tasmanian minister or forestry official has ever responded to the substance of these reports.
A standard response of the logging industry and the Tasmanian government to the facts and arguments cited above is to ignore them—
something which Senator O'Brien, as shadow forestry minister for the Crean opposition, has done so far, but I challenge him now to answer them—
and continue repeating baseless platitudes about “jobs”, “sustainable development” or “world-class industry”. Another is to cite the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) process as proof of the wisdom of what has followed. While submissions were received from all sectors in that process, the RFA's final form was determined by logging industry wishes. The most disastrous feature of the Tasmanian RFA was the abolition of woodchip export quotas, which has led to the runaway increase in native forest logging and environmental damage.
What provisions for conservation and other competing interests that remain are rendered largely illusory by the fact that the RFA is administered by Forestry Tasmania and the Forest Practices Board. The travesty of that administration was most recently illustrated by FT's abolition of 1000 ha of the 1800 ha of rain forest reserve on Mt Arthur in NE Tasmania, despite it being the habitat of a listed threatened species found nowhere else on earth, the Mt Arthur burrowing crayfish, and despite the fact that the area is unsuitable for plantations. The area was clearfelled.
It is notable that this letter is addressed to Senator O'Brien. Senator O'Brien has been to see the Mount Arthur disaster and the breaches of the Forest Practices Code there but, consistent with the Tasmanian Labor Party and those sections of the forest industry which are totally malfunctioning in Tasmania, refuses to give an account of those breaches of the Forest Practices Code in this house and defends the process which allows those breaches to continue. 
The letter goes on to say that Forestry Tasmania's:
... professed reason for removing reserve protection, that similar rainforest existed elsewhere, ignored the fact that it had been reserved for local significance. Despite the documentation of 64 breaches of the Forest Practices Board by local residents—
at Mount Arthur, that is, north of Launceston—
the Forest Practices Board refused to take any action against the logging firms or to give local citizens the required leave to undertake legal actions themselves.
We have a process here which is binding everybody's hands except the loggers'. This legislation continues and enhances the process at the highest level—that is, through Commonwealth legislation—where Mr Crean and Mr Howard together support a process of depriving citizens of their rights to defend their localities, their environments and their jobs from a marauding forest industry. Mr Hayward goes on to say: 
It is difficult to see more than one plausible explanation for the brazen looting of Tasmanian forests, and that is the same as applies to Indonesia and other Third World competitors—a corrupt political establishment. 
With virtually free access to a vast public resource, logging has considerable resources to invest in cultivating the major political parties and sympathetic candidates. They have been spectacularly successful. A reported seven members of the Bacon government are or have been members of a logging industry front group known as the Forest Protection Society until recently, when it renamed itself Timber Communities Australia. This is of a type known as an “astro-turf” organisation, an artificial grass-roots group developed in the US by industries such as tobacco and forestry to lobby and agitate on a remote control basis. A few years ago Forestry Tasmania announced a “Community Forest Agreement” had been signed under which FT would consult with the FPS as a representative of the public on the management of Tasmania's forests. No genuine community groups have been accorded this privilege.
The log trucks roll day and night in Tasmania, pulverising the landscape to the financial benefit of the well-heeled and well-connected few, including former premier Robin Gray, now a director of Gunns. Despite the constant barrage of forestry propaganda (much of it funded by taxpayers), the comprehensive Tasmania Together survey—
which, I interpolate, was set up by the Bacon government—
discovered 80% of Tasmanians helplessly oppose the pillage. Groups of medical, veterinary, teaching, timber working, and legal professionals have been formed recently to oppose the destruction. But with both the state's major political parties deep in the industry's pocket, and with an ineffectual or compromised media, outside help will be needed to stop the looting of a unique and economically priceless environment.
That comes from Mr Hayward in Weegena in Tasmania, and copies were sent to ABC TV, ABC Radio National, the BBC, Channel 9, the Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, Senator Ian Macdonald and House of Representatives member the Hon. Carmen Lawrence. 
What an extraordinary indictment this is of the industry and of the political edifice which allows it to happen. What a demand this is in this letter for Senator O'Brien to respond. He shakes his head at the minister opposite. The nature of politics is that those who have the power can buck their authority to do the right thing by the populace, which does not have that power. The minister ought to know that one of the travesties behind this whole process is the system of largesse from the big industries to the big parties. This means that, in the wash-up, while 70 or 80 per cent—and, in some cases, opinion polls as high as 89 per cent in Western Australia— show public opposition to the logging of these forests, the tragic reality is that 90 per cent plus of politicians, the big parties included, support the destruction of the forests and will do so under this process here today.
The amendment is before the chamber to say, `There is a process here which many of us oppose'—I oppose it vehemently—`but, if this is the process that is to be implemented, let the industry stick by it.' The bill talks in grand terms about ecologically sustainable management, protecting forests and wildlife, reserving areas where there are rare and endangered species. The Greens amendment says, `Let's make that binding.' The bill itself says it is binding on the taxpayers of Australia to compensate woodchip industries if, somewhere down the line, they are denied the opportunity to destroy forests. We are saying: let the industry and the state governments who are employing the Forest Practices Code be bound by what they say in the legislation and all attendant documentation about their adherence to environmental principles. But, no, there are double standards here: give the industry the money, bind the taxpayers to give the industry the money but deny the taxpayers their wish that the forests shall be, if not protected, properly managed and don't put any impulsion into that.
The Labor Party—the Crean opposition— supports John Howard, the honourable Prime Minister of this country and leader of his party, to the hilt in this denial of the Australian people's wishes. This legal binding of the Australian people to give woodchip corporations huge payouts of millions of dollars if any forests that are currently unprotected are protected in the future. What extraordinary legislation! What an extraordinary get-together by the big parties to deny the Australian people their wish in this matter at the behest of big industry. 
One hundred years ago, President Roosevelt in the United States said that we cannot have a functioning democracy until we get the influence of the corporate sector out of it. He would turn in his grave if he could see how politicians have failed to get rid of that corrupting influence. We have heard today about how it goes to the highest levels in Tasmanian politics. I will be introducing a bill for a thorough investigation into the lot; but you know what is going to happen: the Labor Party will again join with the Liberals to deny an investigation, because it is not in their interests to have their friends in the logging industry—who are getting their pockets lined at public expense through this legislation—open to public gaze and cross-examination. 
There is widespread corruption in the industry in terms of adherence to even the law, and the Forest Practices Code is laid down in several states. It is a deplorable state of affairs. It may not be interesting to the media at the moment. Very often these matters are not covered by the media, because, on the one hand, there is massive advertising by the industry in the media, and, on the other hand, for an issue to be big it needs to be one in which the Labor Party puts a difference between itself and the government. On this occasion, the Labor Party in Tasmania is worse than the Nationals and the Liberals when it comes to the destruction of forests. 
The Bacon government, and the real power behind the throne down there, Deputy Premier Paul Lennon, have a deplorable record when it comes to their obligation to manage these forests—if not in the public interest then at least according to the tenets of the Forest Practices Code. The numbers are not with the Greens, the numbers are not with Senator Murphy, and the numbers are not with the absent Democrats in this debate.
—It is called democracy.
—Go to the polls, Minister. You will find you are in the minority on this one. Neither Prime Minister Howard nor the Leader of the Opposition once raised this issue in the run to the election. They know how unpopular and on the nose the government's destruction of forests is. 
Question negatived.
—I want it recorded that I was the only voice in the chamber that supported that call.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Yes. Thank you, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—I move Australian Greens amendment (6) on revised sheet 2432:
(6)	Page 5 (after line 4), after clause 5, insert:
5A Parliamentary scrutiny of RFAs
	(1)	The Minister must not enter into an RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth except in accordance with this section.
	(2)	Where a Minister has already entered into an RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth the Minister must cause a copy of that RFA to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the commencement of this section whereupon it becomes subject to this section.
	(3)	Before signing an RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth, the Minister must cause a copy of the proposed RFA to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.
	(4)	Either House of the Parliament, within 15 sitting days of that House after an RFA or a proposed RFA has been tabled, may, under motion upon notice, pass a resolution disapproving of the RFA or the proposed RFA in whole or in part.
	(5)	Where:
	(a)	a notice referred to in subsection (4) is given with respect to an RFA or a proposed RFA; and
	(b)	at the expiration of the period during which a resolution disapproving of the RFA or a proposed RFA would have been passed:
	(i)	the notice has not been withdrawn and the relevant motion has not been called on; or
	(ii)	the relevant motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of; 
the RFA or the proposed RFA is deemed to have been disapproved of.
	(6)	If:
	(a)	either House of the Parliament passes a resolution in accordance with subsection (4); or
	(b)	a proposed RFA is deemed to have been disapproved of under subsection (5);
the Minister must not enter into the proposed RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth.
	(7)	If:
	(a)	neither House of the Parliament passes a resolution in accordance with subsection (4); and
	(b)	a proposed RFA is not deemed to have been disapproved of under subsection (5);
the Minister may enter into the RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth on or after the day immediately following the last day on which a resolution disapproving of the proposed RFA could have been passed.
	(8)	In this section:
RFA includes an amended RFA.
This amendment is about the democracy the minister has just been speaking about, which is to ensure parliamentary scrutiny of the regional forest agreements. One of the things that is happening here is that the government, with the opposition, are moving through this legislation to remove parliament's overview of what is happening on the ground in the forests of Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania. The amendment, under the heading `Parliamentary scrutiny of regional forest agreements', says:
	(1)	The Minister must not enter into an RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth except in accordance with this section.
	(2)	Where a Minister has already entered into an RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth the Minister must cause a copy of that RFA to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of the commencement of this section whereupon it becomes subject to this section.
In other words, the regional forest agreement has to be brought into both houses of parliament within 15 days. It goes on:
	(3)	Before signing an RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth, the Minister must cause a copy of the proposed RFA to be tabled in each House of the Parliament.
	(4)	Either House of the Parliament, within 15 sitting days of that House after an RFA or a proposed RFA has been tabled, may, under motion upon notice, pass a resolution disapproving of the RFA or the proposed RFA in whole or in part.
	(5)	Where:
	(a)	a notice referred to in subsection (4) is given with respect to an RFA or a proposed RFA—
that is, the minister has caused a regional forest agreement to be tabled—
	(b)	at the expiration of the period during which a resolution disapproving of the RFA or a proposed RFA would have been passed:
	(i)	the notice has not been withdrawn and the relevant motion has not been called on; or
	(ii)	the relevant motion has been called on, moved and seconded and has not been withdrawn or otherwise disposed of;
the RFA or the proposed RFA is deemed to have been disapproved of.
This is a very strong way of saying that the RFA must shape up before parliament. Parliament needs to look at it. If it is not looked at and approved, it will be rejected. It continues:
	(6)	If:
	(a)	either House of the Parliament passes a resolution in accordance with subsection (4); or
	(b)	a proposed RFA is deemed to have been disapproved of under subsection (5);
the Minister must not enter into the proposed RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth.
	(7)	If: 
	(a)	neither House of the Parliament passes a resolution in accordance with subsection (4); and
	(b)	a proposed RFA is not deemed to have been disapproved of under subsection (5);
the Minister may enter into the RFA on behalf of the Commonwealth on or after the day immediately following the last day on which a resolution disapproving of the proposed RFA could have been passed.
Finally, the amendment has a definitional component. This amendment is saying that regional forest agreements should come before parliament, be vetted by parliament and not be entered into finally until parliament has given authority. Why should that be? There are a number of reasons. The first is that over $300 million of taxpayers' money has been given through the regional forest agreement process to the forest industries. That is a massive amount by anybody's reckoning.
Are we as a parliament acting responsibly if we say in return that we will not have scrutiny of those agreements? I reiterate: the regional forest agreements have not been vetted by parliament. They were signed by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister flew to Perth, to Melbourne, to Sydney and to Perth in Tasmania—where he was met with a huge protest—on a number of occasions in the last several years, and he signed the agreements together with the then state premiers. The federal parliament has not been party to those agreements, yet they involve hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. It is incumbent on the parliament not to allow the executive to behave solely in that fashion with taxpayers' money. It is incumbent on the parliament to make sure it scrutinises massive amounts of taxpayers' money given to an industry which should be profitable in itself but which is actually being propped up by taxpayers. 
But then you look at what the taxpayers themselves think of this industry and whether the industry itself is necessary. I am referring here to the broadscale logging of old-growth forests in Australia. The answer is negative in both cases. Australia has a two million hectare suite of plantations which has enough wood to provide all this nation's wood needs. Native forest logging was meant to be tailed off as the plantations came on stream—and these plantations were paid for largely by public money in the past in make-work schemes—so that the native forests could be saved as the plantations grew. The plantations provide wood for house building, paper and a multitude of other needs. But, in effect, the industry is making so much money out of destroying the forests that it wants to continue doing it. It is doing this subsidised by the taxpayers. 
So what is happening with the plantation wood as these plantations reach maturity? It is being exported overseas as whole logs, and the downstream processing, the jobs and the money are going to Korea, China and other countries. There is always the promise of some new investment. We heard some from Senator O'Brien this morning when he was talking about whole native logs from Tasmania being exported to Finland a while ago. But it just does not happen because it is too lucrative for the industry to be woodchipping huge amounts of forests and sending them overseas and to be diverting the small percentage of those forests into the sawmilling industry when the woodchippers arrive. Sawmilling these days is a by-product of woodchipping. That sawn timber coming out of our native forests at the behest of the lucrative woodchip industry then floods the market, displacing the plantation timbers which are exported overseas. Australians lose out all the way down the line. The jobs are exported, the forests are destroyed and the opportunity for job creation in the much more job-prospective industry of presenting those forests to visitors from overseas is lost at the same time.
I have yet to see a Japanese visitor to Tasmania who did not say that they preferred to see Tasmania's forests vertical than on the back of a log truck being sent to a woodchip mill to go to Japan. Japanese visitors do not know about it and they are horrified when they find that their country is a major recipient of the devastating woodchip industry in Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania. Japanese visitors are coming in bigger and bigger numbers to see what? To look at log trucks? I doubt it. To look at clear-felled areas? Of course they are not. To look at Forestry Tasmania plantations? No, they are not. They want to come and see the wildlife in Tasmania. They want to come and see the intact forests. They want to come and enjoy the experience of nature. 
Recently in the south of Hobart an idea long put forward by conservations was taken up, and an airwalk was built at taxpayer expense—some $5 million—in the Huon Valley. Forestry Tasmania thought that this would be a good way of expending taxpayers' money to put its ecotourism veneering on display and to distract from the increasing destruction of nearby forests. It does not do that. While it has had a massive number of visitors, they have not gone to see the clear-felled areas. Indeed, Forestry Tasmania did not put up an airwalk in a clear-felled area— although the airwalk paid for by the taxpayers is of such size that you cannot miss seeing clear-felled areas when you get up there. It put the airwalk in a remnant area of intact forests—namely, the Tahune Reserve on the Huon River. I will give Senator O'Brien a little geography tip: it is just downstream, not upstream, of the conjunction with the Picton River. When you get to the end of the airwalk you are confronted with a massive clear-felled area on Pear Hill above the junction of those two rivers—ugly, diverting, distracting and degrading of that experience. Many people comment on it.
What of the Styx Valley to the north, which has even bigger forests much more intact? This is terrain in which, in future, millions of visitors from around the world will delight. It has the tallest trees in the Southern Hemisphere, the biggest hardwood trees in the world; indeed, the biggest trees in the world outside North America. When I was out there a week or two ago there were people there from Western Australia, New South Wales, Germany and America. They look at these gigantic living creatures soaring up to nearly 100 metres high and they marvel at them. Then they drive on to the next lot of tall trees but in the meantime have the intervention of a clear-felled area—total destruction of the selfsame forest.
We have got this extraordinary deception whereby Forestry Tasmania say, `We will protect any tree that is over 85 metres high.' That is nearly as long as a football field turned on end. It is much higher than the Wrest Point Casino in Tasmania. It is much higher than the sails of the Opera House in Sydney. These trees are soaring from water level right up into the high arch of the Harbour Bridge in Sydney. What do Forestry Tasmania say? They say, `We will protect a tree if you can show it is that high.' In the meantime they have undoubtedly logged many trees that high or higher in a postage stamp sized protected area. 
That brings me to the asseveration of the minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, about these areas, that you will see little areas which are protected when you go to clear-felled areas, which are for the good of nature. I can show him a photograph of such an area in the Tarkine Wilderness in north-west Tasmania left to protect the nest of an endangered Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle, bigger than the mainland wedge-tail. Forestry Tasmania came along after logging and had left this area and were very proud of it and set it on fire, because that is the next thing—the firestorm—and burnt down the eagle's nest and that copse of trees with it. 
We go back to the Styx, and the minister says in this place that the Forest Practices Code officers are not corrupt—`If they are, tell me about it'—that they do not breach their principles, that they go on in front of the bulldozers and make sure that the environment is looked after. Not so. Let me give a very simple but startling example. The Skelton Creek road was driven south of the Styx up onto the ridge and Forestry Tasmania, backed by the Howard government and the Labor opposition, was moving in to cut it down. At the end of 1998 the Wilderness Society in Tasmania went in and decorated one of the trees, which happened to be 76 metres high, with thousands of coloured lights and on top a four-metre-across huge star which is still there and lights up each night on a solar panel system, which is a phenomenal thing to see. The attendant worldwide interest, because this is the tallest Christmas tree ever decorated anywhere on the face of the planet, saved the day. Forestry Tasmania did not want the bad publicity it would get from destroying that particular batch of trees. In looking around there, the Wilderness Society found what the Forest Practices officers did not and Forestry Tasmania did not—that is, an eagle's nest in the vicinity. Under the Forest Practices Code, it is illegal to road or log within 200 metres of an eagle's nest, but Forestry Tasmania had already roaded right through the middle and knocked down huge trees in the process, breaching its own code. The minister is not even listening to this because he knows he cannot answer it. It was left to the Wilderness Society to do that work, and now there is a temporary stay of execution on these grand forests in the vicinity of that eagle's nest.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-03-13,"—The opposition will not be supporting this amendment. Senator Brown will no doubt suggest there is some irony in the fact that we supported a similar but not identical proposition when this bill was before the Senate in 1999, almost three years ago. Certainly it is three years since we inquired into the 1998-99 legislation. Of course, in our amendment we did say that the regional forest agreements then in effect would not be the subject of the so-called disallowance provision now proposed by Senator Brown. We are now in a situation where almost all of the regional forest agreements have been signed and we are not proposing now to support an amendment which would allow for disallowance of all those agreements, and particularly those which we stated in 1999 we did not believe should necessarily be the subject of that process. So we will not be supporting this amendment. We do say that the amendment which I believe has been circulated in my name on behalf of the opposition in relation to the joint parliamentary committee will provide adequate review provisions for the parliament in relation to this matter.
I guess I should take this opportunity to comment on Senator Brown's apparent possession of correspondence sent to me. I did not note him saying that it had been forwarded to him directly, but apparently it has. Perhaps it went to him before it came to me; I do not know. The reality is that I did receive a letter in the last few days. I cannot attest to the time because I do not operate a date stamp system here in Canberra. It is a substantial letter which will, like the great many other pieces of correspondence that I receive, receive the appropriate attention and will receive a response. I do not propose to respond to my correspondence in the chamber, but it is curious that Senator Brown has this letter, is familiar with it—he is obviously familiar with its author—and chooses to seek to use the time of the chamber, in fact about 30 minutes of the debating time so far, in referring to that piece of correspondence. If it assists Senator Brown, I can tell him that that correspondence will be responded to in due course, like other correspondence that is received. Perhaps he can convince the government to increase resources for the opposition so that we can attend to those matters expeditiously. Perhaps in those circumstances there would be a moderate decrease in the time that it takes to respond to substantial matters raised in correspondence such as that. In any event, the author of that letter, together with other authors, is entitled to a response and will receive one.
In relation to this suggestion again by Senator Brown that there is broad scale logging of old-growth forests—I think those were his words—I repeat that, of the old-growth forest in public forests in our—his and my—state of Tasmania, about 85 per cent will never be logged because they are in reserved areas. In addition, although fewer of the old-growth forests on private land are so protected—I think it is in the vicinity of 68 per cent at the moment—measures are in train which are day by day increasing the amount of old-growth forest which is protected and which will never be logged. So it is incorrect to say that there is broad scale logging of old-growth forests.
The assertions with regard to responses from tourists about what they observe from the air walk in relation to a small area that currently does not have any trees on it are inconsistent with the fact that we are looking at one of the most successful forestry based tourism attractions—or, indeed, any tourism attraction—in Tasmania. It is a phenomenal attraction, which is outdoing its own predictions. There was a tremendous underestimate of the attraction of members of the public to go and see for themselves not only, as Senator Brown described, the remnant old-growth forests in and around the Tahune Reserve but also the forests in various stages of regeneration—forests which have been logged over the years and which are in the process of regrowing and are available for harvest. One could not say that Forestry Tasmania were in the process of setting up an attraction which shielded viewers from the realities of a working forest. They did not. What did happen when this attraction was opened to the public was that the Greens demonstrated and harassed people who were attending, including the wife of the mayor who was there because the mayor of the region had been part of the team.  
—Betty Norris.
—The lady's name is Betty Norris. Her husband had been part of the impetus to get the project off the ground. She was the subject of some physical jostling—she was jostled around, quite inappropriately so, by people who were trying to discourage members of the public from going to attend the opening of this venture. It is very popular and there is the expectation that, over this first year of its opening, some 200,000 visitors will attend.
—It was vandalised, too, if you recall.
—Senator Calvert reminds me that there has been some vandalism of the air walk, and that is regrettable. It has not detracted from its popularity. The scale of the amenity there is a bit too small for the amount of attraction that this facility has. It is good to be able to criticise the planners on the basis that they underestimated its value, but it certainly is a very valuable and attractive forestry based tourism attraction.
I agree with Senator Brown that no-one finds log trucks attractive. They are certainly not going to be a tourist attraction in any part of the world. He does state a self-evident truth when he says that no-one is going to travel to Tasmania to see logs on a log truck. But there are a great many opportunities for visitors to Tasmania to see working forests, forests which will never be logged—and there are a great many of both of those—and many other beauties of the state while they are there. I would hope that he encourages those that he is associated with to do so, as would I. I did think it was important to say that there is nothing in what Senator Brown says that detracts from the fact that working forests are part of the state—any state— having an industry based on forestry, and that is what this legislation is, in part, about achieving. 
There are already a number of regional forest agreements. They have been in place for so long that, as we have heard in the debate, they are coming up for or are at their first five-yearly review. We have an amendment later which will enhance the ability of the parliament to scrutinise the operation of the industry over the life of the first cycle of the regional forest agreements. In relation to the performance of the industry, as I said earlier, it is the opposition's view that this industry has this first 20-year cycle of regional forest agreements to establish that it will deliver to the Australian community value in return for the community making available to the industry, in a secure fashion and in a way where they do not have the excuse of saying, `We could not get finance because we did not have a secure resource,' some sort of downstream processing development so that the value of the industry is maximised to the community, and indeed that jobs arise from downstream processing in the industry. I did give the example of the proposals for rotary peel veneer operations which, as I understand them, are going to be directed towards using regrowth forest and logs which might otherwise be substantially suitable only for woodchip and, in fact, converting part of the resource that Senator Brown suggests is available only to the woodchip industry to an industry which will involve significant employment, export opportunity and import replacement opportunity for this country. That is just an example of a number of opportunities that arise for the industry which, it is the opposition's hope, will be enhanced by the passage of this legislation. We really do not see the point of endorsing a process which Senator Brown, I believe, intends to be used to try to undermine further the confidence in the industry.  
I know there are groups who are going around trying to undermine the company Gunns in terms of investment and trying to undermine its share value. We heard in the debate today that a forestry company is not an ethical investment, in the same way that investment in a tobacco company is not an ethical investment. I completely reject the comparison that, by implication, is made between the two industries. On the one hand, we are talking about companies that are producing products that are injurious to health in a very direct way; on the other hand, we are talking about an industry that is using a renewable resource. Trees do grow; I do not think there is any doubt that it is a renewable resource. It is also a sustainable resource when properly managed, and that is what this legislation is about. I think it is entirely inappropriate to seek to compare the forestry industry with the tobacco industry, and I think that shows you the level to which the debate in this country seems to have degenerated. Perhaps we should get back to the realities and not make ridiculous comparisons like that.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2002-03-13,"—I said that I would not get up in this debate again until I came to my amendments. Unfortunately, when you have these sorts of debates issues come up and senators say things that, if they need to be corrected, should be corrected at the appropriate time. Senator O'Brien spoke earlier about his knowledge of shipments of logs from Tasmania. He alluded to the matter of logs being shipped to Finland or Korea, or both, and that they were the only logs he was aware of that were being shipped out of Tasmania. For the record, logs have been shipped to China from Tasmania, from both private and public forests. Indeed, I should have taken the time to check the quantity, but I think either 10,000 or 20,000 tonnes or cubic metres went to China.
This is not the first time that logs have been sent to Korea. As Senator O'Brien indicated, some of these logs are being sent away for the purpose of trialing the material to determine its suitability for processing into veneer or plywood. Back in 1996, I think it was, we sent a significant shipment of logs from Tasmania, through the port of Hobart, to Korea supposedly for that purpose. It was organised through a Korean by the name of Mr Simon Kang. If I recall correctly—and I must check my information on this—at that time it was found that the wood was not really suitable.
With regard to trials, earlier I mentioned the industry development plan for Tasmania and spoke about the South African company Kortas Veneer. Kortas Veneer's parent company is actually a Korean company by the name of Sam-O. The interesting thing about it is this: it has undertaken a feasibility study—in fact, it is not quite correct to say that, because it was actually a pre-feasibility study—funded jointly by the Commonwealth, the state and the company. It cost about $150,000. I understand that the pre-feasibility study has been completed but that the results have not yet been made public. I also understand that the amount of money expended will probably be mentioned in the five-yearly review of RFAs, and I find that rather intriguing. Although they are not out yet, I understand they will come out shortly—which is another process I find quite interesting. 
We have a review of the RFA process that is supposed to assess how it is all going. On this occasion, which is the first occasion for Tasmania, for instance, the five-yearly review process has been conducted by the Resource Planning and Development Commission—which is interesting. Again—and I say this to the Minister for Forestry and Conservation and his officers through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—there was no public process. The terms of reference—which, unfortunately, I did not bring down with me—which were established by the state minister were so limited that it would have been almost impossible for the Resource Planning and Development Commission to make any real assessment of how the state was going in delivering the objectives and some outcomes of the regional forest agreement. They would have had to rely entirely on the advice given to them by the state authorities, because the terms of reference were so restricted. The only capacity for the public to have input into this debate in respect of the review was to make some comment about the terms of reference. 
The draft review report, which is imminent, will be available for public comment. That public comment comes in the form of me and/or other members of the public being able to write in and say, `We think your findings in this or that aspect of the report are inaccurate.' That is the end of that—no further public debate, no further public input. Obviously, the Resource Planning and Development Commission will take note of the public comments that they receive and, hopefully, will write back to those who write to them. They will probably say, `We don't agree with you. On the great volume of evidence that we were given, we have concluded thus.'
I come back to my point that this is where the problem lies in this process: there are no checks and balances. There is no real capacity for anybody to go out there and take account of what is really happening. That is the issue we must address. To suggest that the Commonwealth take a position of greater monitoring of what is happening with the management of the forests is not to suggest in any way that we are somehow seeking to block the ability of an industry to develop or to threaten the security of resource to the industry. What I have been suggesting is merely that we want to make sure that what we are told is being done is actually being done. That is why we must pursue these matters.
I cannot understand anybody in this chamber saying, `We do not want checks and balances; we will have an argument about constitutionality.' It is not for this place to determine constitutionality; that is a matter for the courts. If this parliament puts matters that are unconstitutional into legislation, it is the right of the states and territories to challenge that. It is not for us to determine that, and so I cannot understand why, on those grounds, we would reject suggestions for improving legislation we are to pass through the parliament. Even if it is only my view that what I have suggested by way of an amendment will improve the legislation, it is not for this parliament to question the constitutionality of that; that is a matter for the courts. Therefore, it comes back to this point: either we are prepared to take the steps that we think can deliver greater integrity to the system because we will have more checks and balances or we are not. That is what we should stand up and say: we are prepared or we are not. It is that simple. I note what Senator Brown has proposed. It has been proposed before. I also note what has been proposed by the Labor opposition. I am happy to support either approach, but at the end of the day we must take up the responsibility of putting in place a mechanism that will give credibility to this process and restore public confidence in it because right now there is none.
I know that the minister has said on a number of occasions that there are all manner of people who are supportive of just getting this legislation through. Of course there are. This is a funny debate: it has been going on for umpteen years and it has often been the case that there have been two very polarised views. That is an unfortunate consequence of what I think was bad government policy at the time and poor government management of the issue at the time. That is what has happened; nevertheless, by the same token, the great bulk of people have a view that there is no credibility in the process. That is what we ought to seek to rectify. It is our public responsibility. I would urge that at some point, as I have said before, we actually take that step, and I sincerely hope we do.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-13,"—The government will not be supporting this proposal or any other proposal along these lines. As a result of discussions over a long period, the government has put in place in the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 as it is presented to parliament a series of measures which will provide for parliamentary scrutiny of the RFAs. I remind senators that sections 1 and 2 provide that a copy of the RFA must be tabled in each house within 15 sitting days of the commencement of the section or within 15 days of the RFA being entered into, whichever is the latter, except where the RFA has been tabled in that house previously. The bill goes on to provide that a copy of the amendment to the RFA must be tabled in each house within 15 sitting days, whichever is later. These are to be tabled after the RFAs have been agreed, and the agreements have been signed by two sovereign governments. Sections 4 and 5 provide that a copy of the RFA annual report must be tabled in each house of the parliament. The bill, as proposed, goes on to provide that a copy of any RFA review must be tabled in each house of the parliament, and the bill as it stands defines the RFA review report and the RFA annual report. 
Those of us in this chamber know this, but anyone else not familiar with the workings of this chamber and the House of Representatives may not know that, every time these are tabled and every time a report is put in, there is opportunity everywhere for comment to be made and debate to be had and points to be raised. These chambers, of course, always have the ability to set up select committees or to refer things to existing committees, and so there is ample opportunity for full and adequate parliamentary scrutiny of every aspect of the regional forest agreements. So we will not be supporting this amendment or any of the others.
—Will you support my select committee?
—I am not sure what you are talking about, Senator Murphy, to be honest. I should not say `no' off the top of my head because I am not aware of your proposal for the select committee. There is opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny and that has been deliberately written into the bill. We have heard the discussions over a long period and the previous proposals to put this bill through the parliament. The government is determined this time to get this bill through because of what it does for people's jobs, what it does for the families in the forest communities, what it does for small timber towns, what it does for certainty and security in the industry—which relates back to people, which relates back to the economy of the various states, particularly Tasmania, which is so reliant on this— and it takes away mischievous government intervention, which has been a great depressant of the industry over more than a decade. 
We agreed over the last 10 years through negotiation, through consultation, through arguments and through debates between governments of all political persuasions that it was important to get this out of the political process and give the industry a chance, give those who rely on the industry for jobs—the small timber communities, the small country communities—a chance to get on with it. In spite of the best attempts of people like Senator Brown to destroy this industry, to destroy jobs, and to destroy small country communities, they are there. They stay there in confidence and in hope that once these RFA bills have legislative backing that will give them a sense of certainty and security, which they have not heretofore had.
We will not be supporting this or any of the other proposals unless there is some debate that causes me to change my mind. I have looked through them very carefully. I have had considerable advice on them and discussed them with the people in the small communities whose jobs are reliant on the provisions and those in the industry whose investments will create jobs. As a result of my consultations, we will not be supporting this or any other proposal. There are other perverse legislative impacts of Senator Brown's amendment which I will not bother to go into. With respect, these proposals are about gutting the bill and causing legal minefields that would make it unworkable and therefore contrary to the whole purpose of the RFA in the first place. That is why we will not be supporting these proposals.
I think it is important to again look at the purpose of the bill. Senator Murphy made the comment in his contribution that, if there is any suggestion of unconstitutionality of any proposal he puts up, the parliament should accept that and should leave it to the courts to decide. Unfortunately, Senator Murphy, governments do not have that luxury. We have to try to act responsibly. Where things are obviously not constitutionally appropriate then it behoves governments to deal with them at the appropriate time and not say, `We know it is unconstitutional, but we will let it go through and let some court determine it later.'  
—No, I did not say that. 
—I thought you did. 
—You have not produced any evidence to prove that what I have proposed is unconstitutional. 
—I am really not commenting on your proposal, Senator Murphy, because we have not addressed that in full yet. I thought you were making the general point that whether or not it is unconstitutional we should pass it anyhow because it is not for us to determine but for the High Court to determine. That is what I thought you said. If you did not say that, I withdraw my comments and apologise to you. 
(Senator Forshaw)—Any comments should be addressed through the chair, Senator Murphy and Senator Macdonald. 
—You are quite right, Mr Temporary Chairman. I make that general point in passing. Again I say to Senator Murphy that we think this bill is appropriate and it will achieve the intended purposes of this government, previous governments and state governments of all political persuasions. You think it has flaws, but passing this bill will give greater job security and greater encouragement for investment, which creates jobs, than rejecting it or having the bill filibustered to such an extent, as with the previous bills, that the will of the people will never be properly tested by a vote on the bill in this chamber. 
There are some senators who know that the people who represent by far the great majority of Australians support this bill and want to get it through and attempts to stop the vote—and I am not suggesting this is you, Senator Murphy, because I accept your confirmation that that is not your purpose— are not helpful. Even if it has the flaws that you think it has—I do not agree with that—it is better than nothing. It is very important to get this through and to continue to address any other issues relating to forestry operations over which the Commonwealth government has constitutional jurisdiction henceforth as these issues arise.
Senator Brown or Senator Murphy spoke about a rare Tasmanian eagle. The stand of trees containing the eagles' habitat is retained but then it is fire bombed at a later stage so the eagles are destroyed anyhow. My advice is that the firing processes provided will take that into account and the fires will not damage this rare species.
I am also advised by Environment Australia that the particular species of bird is one to which the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act applies. I am trying to get advice about the complaints that have been made regarding the particular incident that the senator spoke about. If there is destruction of species that are subject to the EPBC, we would be very keen to know whether complaints have been made and, if they have, what has happened to them. If they have been dealt with inappropriately, then it certainly is something we should have been aware of. We would have appreciated it if the senator's office which made the allegation had brought it to our attention earlier. I suspect that this probably did not happen because so much of this debate goes on lies. I would like to accuse Senator Brown of lying, but that would be unparliamentary, so I will not.
—I am glad you recognise that, Minister. Otherwise, I would have had to draw your attention to it.
—The comments that he makes about there being logging in World Heritage listed forest would fall into the category of that definition because they are just wrong. I have challenged him about it. I know he says it all the time, but he usually says it in places where he is not challenged. I have asked him to name the World Heritage listed forests where he says logging is going on at the present time, but there has been no response; he has been caught out. He continues in that vein by alleging in this debate that I refuse to go and see a forest. I expect that sort of thing from Senator Brown, but people listening to the debate might get confused. They might not have heard on the day we were not on broadcast that I indicated to all senators that I was very happy to accept invitations. Senator Murphy has issued invitations and so have a lot of other people—people in the industry and conservation groups. I indicated right at the beginning of this debate that, as my time permits, I will be down there. I cannot wait to get on the skywalk that Senator O'Brien spoke about. 
—The airwalk.
—The airwalk. Senator Calvert tells me it is absolutely magnificent. I am very proud to learn that the Commonwealth government contributed to the airwalk with funds flowing pursuant to the RFA process and was something done by the Tasmanian government to encourage ordinary citizens, ordinary mums and dads and families to come in and have a look at these magnificent forests. But these are the sorts of activities that Senator Brown and his colleagues try to prevent anyone from doing. They think that the forests are only there for people who have five days during every working week not to work but to wander through the forests and enjoy these experiences. Great if you can get it, I guess. For the ordinary mums and dads who have to work, these airwalks are a fabulous way to let people experience the benefits of the forest. 
I know from Senator Brown's contribution that he is anti-industry, antipeople, antijobs, anticommunity, anti any government and all governments. He even says that there is a conspiracy with the media and that everyone is against him. It is the sort of comment that people like Stalin and Hitler used to make— you attack everyone, you are antiestablishment, you are an anarchist, you disagree with everyone, you are the only one who is right. Well, that is not the way the world is. Most people, including this government, are genuine; we are trying to do the right thing by conservation practices, by the industry and by looking after jobs. This bill is part of that and that is why we are determined to get it through. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—I bring the minister's attention back to the eagle's nest he was talking about, and the fact that it took the Wilderness Society to discover this eagle's nest, but the damage had already been done. The road and the destruction of the tall forest through the 200 metre so-called `safe zone' that is supposed to be around these eagles' nests had been bulldozed. The chainsaws had been in. No doubt the eagles in that season were driven back out.
—But you said they were firebombed. Be consistent!
—The minister interrupts yet again to say that they were firebombed.
—No, you said that.
 (Senator Forshaw)—Order, Minister!
—Let me reiterate in the two minutes I have. There are two lots of eagles' nests. If he looks at the 1992 magazine of Forestry Tasmania, he will see—
—That is 10 years ago.
—That is correct, it is 10 years ago. The minister is certainly sharp this afternoon. He will see that the eagle's nest that was so-called `protected' in one of the copses he mentions, which Forestry Tasmania say are for protection, was burnt to a cinder. Forestry Tasmania lit a conflagration—it is in their own magazine—and burnt the copse with the eagle's nest in it—that was in the Tarkine. These birds are down to some 200 breeding pairs in the Styx River Valley, where Forestry Tasmania broke the Forestry Practices Code and drove a road through the 200 metre exclusion zone. It was left to the Wilderness Society to discover this, and that area is now under temporary protection. It would have been totally logged by now, in breach of the Forest Practices Code and in breach of all the promises and the EPBC, had that not happened.
Progress reported.",SENATE,<title>REGIONAL FOREST AGREEMENTS BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,1,1
"Senator McGAURAN,",NP,2002-03-13,"—I rise to speak on a matter which I previously raised in the Senate on 29 November 2000. It was regarding a sad but controversial incident that occurred at the Royal Women's Hospital in Melbourne on 3 February 2000. The incident was a late-term abortion of some 32 weeks undertaken on the grounds that the baby had dwarfism. In that address I claimed, firstly, the 32-week-old abortion was illegal under section 10 of the Victorian Crimes Act which creates an offence of child destruction after 28 weeks. The reason this law is black and white in making late-term abortion a criminal offence is that the baby can live separately from the mother. That is, there is no contest of life between the rights of the mother and the child; the child is viable without the mother. Secondly, I claimed in my address on 29 November 2000, the incident that occurred at the Royal Women's Hospital was not a one-off but rather one of many.
The evidence came from a freedom of information request showing that over the past 10 years there had been on average a late-term abortion performed 44 times a year. Moreover, the statistics showed an alarming culture of acceptance by the Royal Women's Hospital of this practice, a culture running rife from the hospital board down to the doctors. This shocking procedure of the 32-week-old baby being terminated was referred to the Victorian State Coroner for investigation under criminal law. It was regarded as a test case as to the legality of late-term abortions beyond 28 weeks. I remind the Senate that early-term abortions have already been ruled legal under the 1969 Victorian Supreme Court decision known as the Menhenit ruling. 
So that is where the matter rested until December 2001 when the Coroner handed down her ruling on this controversial case. Her opinion was a remarkable abdication of responsibility in regard to this test case. The Coroner formed the opinion that her office had no jurisdiction to investigate a perinatal death as the baby was born dead. The coroner's reasoning was preposterous. I rely on the very advice given to the Coroner by the Acting Victorian Solicitor-General to prove my point. He advised that the Coroner does have the power to investigate a stillbirth under section 17(3) of the Coroner's Act. The Solicitor-General said:
This provision clearly recognises that the coroner has power to hold an inquest into the death of a child whose death may have been brought about by circumstances constituting `child destruction', an offence against section 10 of the Crimes Act 1958.
The absurdity of the Coroner's position is that of course the baby was stillborn because it was destroyed. The truth is the Coroner has the power but chose not to exercise it so as to avoid engulfing her office in the controversy of this case. While the advice given to the Coroner was a quagmire of varying legal opinions and definitions, nevertheless there were certain home truths locked into the Solicitor-General's report. Firstly—and I repeat—the Coroner does have discretion under section 17(3) of the act to investigate this case. Secondly, section 10 of the Crimes Act is black and white law. It is an offence of child destruction to terminate after 28 weeks. 
It is worthy to note that the Short Statured People of Australia were also pressing the Coroner for a hearing into this incident. After all, the so-called disability of dwarfism is what they live with every day of their lives. Surely they had a right to petition the Coroner, but it was denied. Imagine their fear that dwarfism now may have become socially unacceptable and morally repugnant, at least at hospitals like the Royal Women's. Worse though is that none of society's institutions will hear their voice let alone protect their right to be born. The Coroner has failed to grasp the enormity of her decision.
What would dismay the public are the consequences of this failure to investigate. We now have a situation in the state of Victoria where nine-month abortions are allowed and will occur particularly given the culture at the Royal Women's Hospital. The danger is that in time it will be seen as normal and as acceptable as the 4,000 early-term abortions that occur each year at this hospital. While section 10 of the Criminal Code lay credibly on the Victorian statute books, there seemed to be a line drawn at what was acceptable practice, an acceptable time for choice. It was a moral and legal standard. It is a moral and legal standard now turned on its head. 
Not to bring the hospital to account means that this law has become unenforceable. There is now no line in the sand and, for this, society deserves some answers to the major shift in law and morality. To this end it is incumbent upon the Victorian State Attorney-General to now do what the Coroner failed to do—that is, make a decision regarding the law on late-term abortions. His decision is simple: there is either a law against late terminations or there is not. We await his deliberation. 
Furthermore, given there has been no thorough medical or procedural investigation of this tragedy, it is incumbent upon the Medical Practitioners Board to convene a hearing regarding a complaint of possible malpractice. The police report undertaken for the Coroner was not a sufficient investigation into the medical and ethical matters surrounding this case. The police report can best be described as shallow as it was a mere compilation of unchallenged statements by the offending team of doctors at the hospital. Only the Medical Practitioners Board has the capability to hold a hearing into the complaints and have the offending doctors questioned and their procedures investigated. This is their charter. Not to do so will perpetuate the belief that there is a cover-up going on, a cover-up to protect the very doctor who carried out the ultrasound and performed the foetal reduction. The offending doctor's statement to the police—and I use the word `patient' in place of the real name—said:
... it was arranged for—
the patient—
to come to my rooms in Lygon Street that afternoon for the procedure of foetal reduction ... On that day—
the patient—
arrived at my rooms in Lygon Street. I performed foetal reduction under ultrasound control ...
Given the Lygon Street clinic of the doctor undertakes ultrasound examinations and abortions under the one roof, the doctor leaves himself open to accusations of unethical behaviour by running a one stop shop. How many women attending this clinic for a regular and natural ultrasound examination would be horrified to know only a connecting door separates them from the worst of all abortion chambers! The gravity of combining these services was born out by a discussion I had with a reliable medical source. The greatest deception of all had occurred: there was a misdiagnosis of the child's disability of dwarfism. The baby did not have dwarfism but was found to be normal on delivery. Further to this, source papers I have received may bear out this allegation. I quote from a theatre document from the Royal Women's Hospital, which has been undertaken in handwriting, which states: `On delivery: baby doesn't look small'. The reason I do not table this document is that there is other confidential information on it which I would not like to make public.
These matters really do require investigation and clearing up, matters of illegality, unethical practice, misdiagnosis and misreporting. I urge the Medical Practitioners Board to meet their responsibilities in this matter. This is an inquiry the general public would support, to get to the truth and to have the law clarified. While I accept that in the Senate the issue of termination of pregnancy is a matter of conscience, nevertheless I believe the general public do not accept the fundamental move in society's standard morality as shifted by the Royal Women's Hospital and waved through by the leaders of our main institutions. To leave this new wave of `child destruction' unchecked will place us on a roller-coaster ride to the outer limits.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,"<title>Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne: Abortions</title>",Matters of Public Interest,2,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-03-13,"—Yesterday, Senator Conroy asked me a question about forward foreign exchange contracts and I said I would get some further information from the Treasurer. I seek leave to incorporate a response in Hansard. 
Leave granted. 
The answer read as follows—
·	The Commonwealth is not gambling in foreign currencies through forward foreign exchange contracts. Forward foreign exchange contracts between the Australian Office of Financial Management (AOFM) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) are being used to assist in the move to zero foreign currency exposure agreed by the Treasurer in September 2001.
·	Over the period from October 2000 to September 2001, the AOFM transacted forward foreign exchange contracts with the RBA in order to comply with the direction that the existing level of foreign currency exposure be maintained. 
·	Since the decision to move towards zero foreign currency exposure was agreed by the Treasurer in September 2001, forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into with the RBA to manage the rundown of the foreign currency exposure in accordance with a schedule agreed with the RBA.
·	The maturity profile of foreign currency exposures is uneven. The forward foreign exchange contracts enable the foreign currency exposure to be eliminated in a smooth orderly fashion.
·	Under the agreed rundown schedule the foreign currency exposure will be eliminated over a period not exceeding seven years.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Economy: Debt Management</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-03-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr today relating to a contract with the Argentinian company INVAP to build a new nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights.
Despite constant reassurances by the government on the financial stability of INVAP, we have received confirmation today that there has been a loan extended by the Argentinian government to INVAP, the main contractor building the new reactor at Lucas Heights. We have the ridiculous situation whereby the bankrupt government of Argentina is expected to assist a financially stricken company, INVAP, which has been contracted to build the $300 million reactor at Lucas Heights. We are expected to believe the government on this, and I quote, for instance, the Minister for Science, Mr Peter McGauran, who said recently on the ABC Earthbeat program:
We are constantly monitoring the situation through our ambassador. Specifically, ANSTO officers are based at INVAP full time and senior members of the ANSTO organisation, including the executive director, travel to Argentina on a regular basis. We are alert to any flow-on effects from the difficulties of the Argentinian economy, but INVAP is insulated to all intents and purposes from those problems.
We are told that this is a situation where the government is constantly monitoring the circumstances surrounding its main contractor at Lucas Heights, but at the same time the project manager, Mr Gary Seaborne, is quoted on the ABC last week as saying that he was not aware of the arrangements entered into to provide the $10.5 billion loan by the bankrupt Argentinian government to the main contractor at Lucas Heights. Frankly, I find it almost impossible to believe that the project management, despite these claims of constant monitoring, was not made aware of these arrangements. We have, of course, the statement presented by the Argentinian government to their parliament on 1 March last year where they indicated that they were extending a loan of 12 billion pesos for what they described as pre-financing of exports referred to in the contract with the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, ANSTO. There is no doubt in my mind that these circumstances have in fact occurred. What troubles me is the fact that the Australian government has been so inept at discovering these matters until today when we have the situation revealed in this parliament. 
As far as I am concerned, this follows a pattern of evasion. We have seen a Senate inquiry which launched into an examination of the circumstances surrounding the letting of this contract, about the selection of the site and about the priorities set—
—A select committee.
—A select committee to which ANSTO and the Australian government chose not to give basic documents about the contract and the circumstances surrounding the arrangements for the building of the new reactor at Lucas Heights. It strikes me that ANSTO has become so desperate about this contract, so desperate to have this new facility built, that it is quite prepared to do just about anything. 
I understand there are a lot of people in this country who see the need for a research reactor. I am also aware of the overriding concerns of the local community and the very great concerns being expressed by other research scientists that suggest that this is not an appropriate use of $300 million of public moneys—the single largest capital project in science in this country. Yet we have circumstances where clearly the contract arrangements are in question. We have serious circumstances in relation to the disposal of nuclear waste. Serious circumstances have been raised about the security of the site. What we have now is a situation where the international community is also concerned about the financial stability of the Argentinian government and where the World Bank is currently in discussions with the Argentinian government about significant reductions in expenditure across a whole range of social programs, which will, in my view, inevitably include this reactor.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2002-03-13,"—I rise today to respond to some of the scurrilous accusations by association that Senator Carr is raising about the INVAP contract in Argentina.
—Scurrilous?
—They are scurrilous because he is trying to build some sort of link between what is happening in the Argentine economy with this particular company, but at no point has he produced any evidence—not one shred of evidence—to show that this company is in any difficulty at all or is not a bona fide company producing world-class products. I listened very carefully to what Senator Carr said in the estimates hearings two weeks ago when he raised this matter. He went through some points similar to those he has raised today. But, again there, he did not create one shred of evidence linking the two things. I wondered why Senator Carr was doing this. Of course, he has this new grand title in this place: he is now the shadow minister for science and research. I can only assume that he is doing the kick-off in his research role by making a major attack on a company in a foreign country. This is something similar to what we saw Senator Carr do with Greenwich University. Over a number of years he made this his cause celebre and this was going to be his big thing that would get public attention. Unfortunately, in this case he is picking on an operation that is a bona fide operation that is producing world-class products.
How do I know that? I have actually visited the INVAP site. I have been to San Carlos de Bariloche with a parliamentary delegation. We went through the site. We have discussed with the officers what they do, and we saw their products. For the information of Senator Carr, because he obviously knows nothing about this company, this company has a longstanding record of producing research medical nuclear reactors and satellites in a number of countries around the world.
—Where?
—I will give you one off the top of my head: in Egypt they have one of these facilities. There are a number of others around the world. They also produce world-class satellites, and these satellites are launched into space. What amazed the delegation was the professionalism and the capability of this company. It was a cross-party delegation; I suggest, Senator, that you talk to Mr O'Keefe, who was in the lower house and was on that delegation and who was also very impressed with what we saw. I suggest you talk to Mr Hatton, your parliamentary colleague in the lower house, who was there and saw the same facility. 
Let us get back to what Senator Carr's real motivation is. The real motivation relates to the new facility at Lucas Heights. This one has gone through substantial parliamentary inquiries over a number of years. We are in a situation where we have a reactor at Lucas Heights that was built in 1955 and is obviously slated for replacement. We have now a world-class design, one that will keep Australia at the forefront of nuclear medicine and the production of nuclear isotopes. We put our country, in this market, in great danger if this is delayed. The fact that Senator Carr is casting aspersions on this company, very unfairly, and on Argentina is not helpful in terms of international relations and international trade and it is certainly not helpful in the development of science and technology in this country.
I listened carefully to Senator Carr in estimates and carefully here today. He has not produced one shred of evidence that indicates that there is any problem with this company at all. Before you damage international relations any further, if you have any such evidence you should really produce it. Knowing the company, I have great doubts whether you can produce such evidence.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Lucas Heights: Nuclear Reactor</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2002-03-13,"—I will pick up on the last point just made by Senator Tierney. He makes the allegation that no evidence has been produced. In a moment I will come to the evidence that has been produced, particularly before the Senate select committee inquiry, on the serious question surrounding the capacity of INVAP to complete this project. I find it the ultimate irony for Senator Tierney to be standing up here on behalf of the government and saying, `Where is your evidence?' After all, Senator Tierney represents a government whose Prime Minister, ministers and Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet actually made conclusions in respect of another issue, the `children overboard' issue, on the basis that there was no evidence. We had the head of the Defence Force and the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet saying, `Nobody has shown me evidence that it did not happen; therefore, I am entitled to assume that it does.' That is the sort of logic that you get from this government.
But let us get back to the evidence that was produced to the Senate select committee. Firstly, we have the serious concerns raised by members of the scientific community about the capacity of INVAP to deliver. I am not addressing my remarks to the issue of whether we should have a nuclear reactor. Today I want to focus on whether, if we are going to have that reactor as this government seems intent on, we are going to get the best value for the $300 million that is going to be spent initially constructing this reactor and then the further millions of dollars to be spent in the next 40 years maintaining and operating it. I invite senators to go to the full report, but Professor John White, representing the Academy of Science and supporting the reactor, expressed his surprise at the fact that INVAP had won the contract against established companies from Germany, such as Siemens, and from France, such as Technicatome, because of the scientific community's `unfamiliarity with the ability of INVAP to perform'. 
In more specific detail, Mr Tony Wood, a retired nuclear engineer who worked at ANSTO and who supported the building of a new reactor, gave evidence to the committee and he said:
... the literature does not support the minister's claim that INVAP has a `solid track record'. It is not that it has a poor track record. It has no track record on the reactor of significance—that is, a 20-megawatt reactor.
Senator Tierney has referred to the fact that he visited their headquarters in Argentina.
—I saw the reactor that they had built. 
—You did not see the sort of reactor that INVAP has undertaken to build at Lucas Heights. The only location outside Argentina where this company has built a reactor is in Egypt, and there is clear evidence on the record that it has had serious problems in getting that reactor up to full power—it has never been able to operate at full power. Since those allegations were made and since evidence was presented to the committee, we have sought time and time again from ANSTO and from Minister Minchin—who happens to be in the chamber at the moment—detailed documentation such as the contract and a whole range of other material. We were denied access to that material on the grounds of commercial-in-confidence.
We now know, for instance, that, as Senator Carr has pointed out, there has had to be a $10 million allocation from the Argentine government because of the problems that INVAP were in before they won this contract and since they have won this contract. We also know that the intention was to have a new reactor which had a cold source, a hot source and a thermal neutron source. Since that contract was entered into, we have been informed that there will not be a hot source constructed in this new research reactor. So we are not going to get world's best practice as we were promised—far from it. And we have not been told what implications that has for the design— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Lucas Heights: Nuclear Reactor</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-03-13,"—It would appear that the Labor Party, by virtue of the question that Senator Carr asked today, are intent on refighting the last election campaign, to which they took a policy of abandoning our replacement research reactor, thus rendering 800 people out of a job. They seem to want to destroy the whole institution in this country of a research facility and all the 800 jobs that go with that and the scientific capacity that that outstanding facility could give us. That is what this is about. It is not correct for Senator Forshaw to say that this is not about whether or not we have a reactor. That is exactly what it is about. It remains Labor policy to throw 800 Australian scientists out of work by abandoning this research facility.
In the case of INVAP itself and the $10 million, I am advised that this is a draw-down facility to be drawn upon if necessary. The activities under the contract for the building of this reactor are fully funded by the contract payments. I remind the opposition that INVAP is in a consortium with two great Australian companies—John Holland Constructions and Evans Deakin—in the construction of this reactor. The selection process for the contract was probably the most rigorous ever undertaken in the world for a reactor of this kind, and the competition was intense.
It did fall to me, as the then minister, to decide whether or not to approve ANSTO's entering into a contract with INVAP to build this new reactor. I had to satisfy myself that the process was indeed rigorous. I had every confidence because it was certainly true, as Senator Forshaw said, that many in the scientific world were surprised that INVAP was able to beat competition from Germany, France and Canada to win this contract. But I had no doubt and nor did ANSTO. ANSTO has a lot riding on this, so it would have gone beyond the norms to ensure that this was a rigorous process and that INVAP was capable of completing. It was, and I had no doubts that ANSTO should enter into this contract with INVAP as a result of that incredibly rigorous process.
Like Senator Tierney, I am disappointed that, by this line of questioning, by hanging off what is a pathetic line of argument that a $10 million drawn-down facility supplied by the Argentine government to a company that is in fact a state owned company—INVAP is owned by a state government of Argentina— it should draw this sort of attack. I think it is a sad reflection by the Labor Party on the high-quality people we have at ANSTO who are working with INVAP to give this country one of the world's best research reactors and to ensure that Australia remains at the forefront of nuclear science and nuclear research and the production of medical radioisotopes which are so critical to this country. It is sad that the Labor Party's cheap attack today reflects upon all the work that we have been doing to develop our relationship with South America in general and with Argentina in particular, a relationship that I think promises over the course of this century to produce enormous benefits to both our nations and regions. This must be causing enormous distress not only to the Argentine ambassador and his people but to the nation of Argentina, which is going through great difficulty. If anything, we should be seeking to do all we can to support Argentina as it goes through this difficulty. 
I have also visited INVAP. It is an outstanding facility. It does do work with institutions like NASA, which has great confidence in its capacity to produce. I have every confidence in the capacity of INVAP to produce what will be the world's best research reactor. It has met every milestone that has been set for it in relation to this contract and will continue to do so. The contracts are in Australian and US dollars; they are not affected by the circumstances that Argentina finds itself in. This is an international company, as I said, backed by a state government of Argentina. I am pleased that the Argentine government, despite the difficulties it is having, is showing its strong support for this contract by this draw-down facility which may well not be used at all.
I would ask the opposition, in its review of its policies, to seriously look at the position it has adopted in relation to this research reactor. The Labor Party got thumped again in the electorate of Hughes. Danna Vale wiped Labor off the face of the earth again. The people of Hughes have, I think for a third time, shown their strong support for this reactor contract. It is about time the Labor Party accepted the reality, accepted the need for this reactor and started to support it.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Lucas Heights: Nuclear Reactor</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"Campbell, Sen George",ALP,2002-03-13,"—There are a number of points that need to be made or reinforced in this debate. The first is that, as Senator Carr said, this is a very significant investment by the Australian government and a new resource for our scientific community—that is, a $300 million reactor to replace the old reactor at Lucas Heights. I sat on the Senate select committee that inquired into the arrangements for the letting of the contract for this reactor and I sat in on a previous inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee into Lucas Heights in respect of the operation of the old reactor, so I have heard these arguments put ad nauseam by representatives of the government in respect of the reactor at Lucas Heights.
But the important point made by the minister in his contribution—the point which I think ought to raise real concern amongst the Australian scientific community and the Australian community generally—is that this company is wholly backed by a state government in Argentina. We all know the state of the Argentine economy at the moment. It is an economy in absolute crisis. The currency has gone through the floor. There is absolute and complete instability in the Argentine government—they have had five presidents, I think, in a period of about two weeks—and it is a country in absolute chaos; yet we have let a contract to a company based in a country that is backed by a government that is bankrupt. We are questioning the capacity of that company to deliver on its contract.
When we sat through the Senate select committee, we tried to get information about the operations of this company and the relationships it had with the state government in Argentina. We tried to get information about what recovery clauses there were in the contract to secure any moneys that might be spent by the Australian government if this company were not able to complete the contract. On every occasion, we were denied access to any information in relation to these contracts on the basis that they were commercial-in-confidence. We still do not know if what the minister has just said is right— whether this company is separated enough from the government and is capable of completing this contract. We still do not know if the crisis in the Argentinian economy will impact upon the capacity of this company to deliver on the contract, because we do not know what provisions are in the contract to safeguard our investment.
The minister says we should not worry too much, because this company is doing the work in conjunction with two well-known and reputable Australian companies. That is true, but those two Australian companies are on the construction side of the contract and not the design side of it. If the company that has done the design, that is responsible for the functioning of the reactor and that is responsible for the ultimate outcome falls over, I would suggest there is little hope of the two reputable Australian companies being able to complete the contract, because they will not know what they are building. There will be no-one there to guide them about where to put the pipes and the reactor coil and whatever else goes into these facilities. It is just a nonsense to suggest that we should take some comfort from the fact that there are two reputable Australian companies linked up within that contract. 
The reality is we have let a contract to a company about whose capacity to deliver there is grave doubt in the scientific community. The reactor this company has built in Egypt has never operated, as Senator Forshaw says, at full operating level. This company has never proved itself in the international marketplace in its capacity and its designs. I would suggest to you, Minister, that there is a big question mark over this company's capacity to actually deliver the outcome in the contract that has been let. The onus ought to be on the government to come clean about what security there is for the Australian community and the Australian public in those contracts in respect of a guarantee to deliver on the contract.

Name of Bill: Airports Amendment Bill 2002
Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
This Bill excludes airports other than core regulated airports and airports specified in the Regulations from ownership restrictions which currently apply under the Airports Act 1996 (“the Act”). These ownership restrictions play an Important role in preventing anti-competitive practices by airline operators and clear justification must be demonstrated for any relaxation of these restrictions. The Government cites its commitment to facilitate the Tesna consortium's bid for Ansett as one of the two primary justifications for this legislative change and for the lack of consultation in relation thereto. Not only were the proposed amendments to the Act strictly unnecessary for the Tesna bid to proceed, that bid has now been abandoned. In these circumstances, justification for the proposed amendments must be reconsidered following an extensive consultation process.

Appendix 1
Proposal to refer a bill to a committee
Name of Bill: Airports Amendment Bill 2002
Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
This Bill excludes airports other than core regulated airports and airports specified in the Regulations from ownership restrictions which currently apply under the Airports Act 1996 (“the Act”). These ownership restrictions play an Important role in preventing anti-competitive practices by airline operators and clear justification must be demonstrated for any relaxation of these restrictions. The Government cites its commitment to facilitate the Tesna consortium's bid for Ansett as one of the two primary justifications for this legislative change and for the lack of consultation in relation thereto. Not only were the proposed amendments to the Act strictly unnecessary for the Tesna bid to proceed, that bid has now been abandoned. In these circumstances, justification for the proposed amendments must be reconsidered following an extensive consultation process.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2002-03-13,"—by leave—I draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that I am the chairman of the Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident. The committee was advised, and extended all due courtesy, by Senator Mason at its private meeting yesterday that this change to the terms of reference was thought to be desirable. I indicate that, after consideration of the additional terms that have been outlined in this motion, the committee was unanimous in its view that it would support the changes in those terms.
It is worth mentioning that argument in support of changing the terms as proposed was made and, in the course of making that argument, a document, which was a letter from the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Mr Simon Crean, to the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, was tabled by government senators. This was a letter—and it is not appropriate for me to go into the details of it—in which the Leader of the Opposition forwarded to the defence minister a substantial body of documents from a former Foreign Affairs officer and now research officer at the Australian National University about allegations concerning the conduct of the Australian Navy with respect to refugees.
I do imagine that Senator Hill will respond in the appropriate manner to Mr Crean. I do not imagine that this matter, coming informally as it has to the committee, is in any way an answer to Mr Crean regarding the letter he has sent. However, the committee was of the view that the terms of reference probably embraced the scope that is now being sought but on balance thought that there was no reason why it should not be made explicit and, as a consequence, we were unanimous in supporting the motion.
It is, however, appropriate for me to mention at this point that the reporting date of the committee is, from my recollection, 16 May, and this extension to the terms of reference does impose more pressure on the committee. I mention it not because we are seeking, or have even considered seeking, an extension of time for the reporting date—we will certainly try to meet that date—but just to draw the chamber's attention to the fact that it does place more pressure on the committee to complete its work timetable expeditiously. I also note that, in answer to a question from Senator Stott Despoja yesterday, the Minister for Defence, Senator Hill, said, in relation to the committee—and I quote:
... the government believes it is simply a political hatchet job connived between the Australian Democrats and the ALP to achieve a political outcome that they might as well state before the outset.
That seems to suggest that the government's view of this committee is less than flattering. I now note that a government senator has moved to change the committee's terms of reference. The committee has accepted that proposal, and one hopes that the chamber follows suit by voting for it. If the chamber does, all senators who are members of the government will have the opportunity to vote for these terms of reference. I think it is fair to say that that is at odds with the sentiment expressed by the Minister for Defence about the committee. I make that observation because I think it is a pertinent one in terms of how the committee should be seen. The government certainly does recognise the committee and has worked seriously and—I put it in these terms—constructively in order to set up the inquiry. The attack made by Senator Hill yesterday should be seen perhaps as an aberration of that. 
However, I do hope that this newfound constructive approach by those on the government side extends to the cabinet, who have apparently put a ban on some witnesses attending this inquiry, should they be invited. At this stage I have no official information before me as to the exact nature of the cabinet decision. There is apparently no cabinet press release setting out the details. We do have some press reports which claim to be authoritative and which do quote spokesmen for the government, but there is nothing official on the record. One hopes that this newfound approach by the government in constructively seeking to amend this committee's terms of reference does extend as well to Monday evening's apparent announcement about witnesses being able to attend any hearings of this committee.
Having made those remarks, I have no difficulty at all in supporting Senator Brett Mason's motion which has been moved by Senator McGauran, and I commend it to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 30.
The motion I have put before the Senate is that the Senate notes the ministerial code in the United Kingdom. This includes a system that deals with the acceptance of appointments by a minister after leaving office. It calls on the government, firstly, to implement an advisory committee on business appointments, like that in the United Kingdom, from which a minister would be required to seek advice before accepting business appointments within five years from the date after which he or she ceased to be a minister. Secondly, it would ban any minister from taking an appointment that is directly related to his or her portfolio for five years from the date of resignation.
—What about if it is a doctor? Would a doctor be able to go back into practice?
—Yes, the doctor would be able to practice in his or her own right. This is a business appointment. It would not allow a doctor, who had been a minister, to work as a consultant with a drug company or a medical lobbying organisation. This debate brings us to the recent taking up of business opportunities by the former Minister for Health, Dr Wooldridge, and also the former Minister for Defence, Mr Reith.
This is a problem because the reach of the corporate sector and the ability of the corporate sector to lobby in parliament is way out of kilter with the ability of the rest of the populace in being able to have their cases heard. This is compounded when ministers, who have been subject to a lobby during their period of office, subsequently are tempted to take up a monetary return for a business arrangement with the very lobbyists who have been in their office. It leads, frankly, to the ability for corruption because a minister can say, `Wink, wink, if I get a job with you after I leave office, I will do this for you now.'
Secondly, it leads to the position where a minister can resign and become a lobbyist for a group and lobby his or her colleagues who remain in office. That undoubtedly gives them an entrée and an influence, which is quite untoward, as a lobbyist. Effectively, in both these cases, the person who has been the minister is using the office of minister to get monetary reward. We need to prevent that from occurring and we certainly need to prevent it from being extended. In the United Kingdom, amongst other things in the ministerial code, the system has established an advisory committee on business appointments. Ex-ministers are expected to go to that advisory committee when they take up postministerial business appointments to see if it is consistent with the ministerial code, which is meant to prevent ministers being in the compromising position of using their contacts to the advantage of a sectional interest in the community. 
On the information I have, on at least 34 occasions in recent years the advisory board in the United Kingdom has either told an ex-minister not to take an appointment or has advised them to change the terms of that appointment. In both the US and the United Kingdom, ministers are expected not to take such appointments at all within one or two years of their resignation. The Greens do not believe that that is long enough. That is why there is a five-year stricture involved in this motion. It is an extremely well thought out motion. It is based on overseas practice, but extends it and makes it better. I commend it to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FORMER PARLIAMENTARIANS: BUSINESS APPOINTMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-03-13,"—Senator Brown tries to make a case for urgency in relation to the issue of postministerial career appointments and I think he does make a case. This is an urgent matter. The issue for the Senate this afternoon is to determine whether it is more urgent than the pressing legislation program that we have before us, particularly when, as Senator Brown would be the first to acknowledge, this can be done at the drop of a hat by the Prime Minister. This is within the gift of the Prime Minister.
—I would advise you not to hold your breath, Senator Faulkner.
—Thank you, Senator Brown. You are always good for medical advice. The truth is Australia has fallen behind the rest of the world when it comes to regulating the behaviour of former ministers. There is no doubt about that and the situation has become worse recently. We have had the very prominent cases of former Minister Reith's post-ministerial career and the former health minister, Dr Wooldridge's post-ministerial career. The less said about those careers in terms of appropriate behaviour the better because, frankly, any reasonable person would have to be absolutely dissatisfied with what we have seen—Minister Reith taking employment as a consultant to a very prominent company in the defence area and, of course, the disgraceful ministerial behaviour of Dr Wooldridge in the $5 million grant to the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, which has been the subject of controversy and scandal in recent days.
If you look at international experience, you can see under chapter 11 of the US Criminal Code that employees of the executive branch are banned from any attempt to lobby government for two years after they leave their job, with a penalty of up to two years in jail. In Britain, former ministers face a two-year ban on taking up employment related to their past roles. They have an independent body, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, examining appointments. It sounds like a tough regime in those countries; it is not a particularly tough regime. What Simon Crean has proposed on behalf of the Labor Party—a 12-month period after ceasing to be a minister where a minister cannot take employment with or act as an adviser to or be a consultant to any company or business interest with which they have had official dealings as minister in their past 12 months in office—is, we believe, the way to go. We, of course, announced this before Dr Wooldridge's latest shenanigans were exposed to the public. We think that ministers should be required to undertake that, on leaving office, they will not take personal advantage of information to which they have had access as a minister where that information is not generally available to the public. That is a very important principle.
Senator Brown is right to say that this is a matter of urgency. I think he is wrong to say that this matter should take priority over these other pressing issues before the chamber, but it needs to be dealt with. All I say is that it should not be dealt with now by the Senate because at the end of the day the responsibility falls on the Prime Minister and on the executive government to do something about this, particularly in the light of the behaviour of former ministers Reith and Wooldridge. Former Minister Fahey is probably in a different category, but Reith and Wooldridge have behaved disgracefully.
—They have behaved disgracefully.
—That is true, Senator Ray. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>FORMER PARLIAMENTARIANS: BUSINESS APPOINTMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-03-13,"—The Australian Democrats would have been quite happy for this vote to proceed today. We acknowledge what Senator Brown is hoping to achieve through his motion. However, we do not agree with the notion of a five-year cooling-off period. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I have just introduced a private members bill, the Ministers of State (Post-Retirement Employment Restrictions) Bill 2002, in the name of Senator Murray and in my name, which seeks to legislate for an enforceable, two-year cooling-off period. We have heard in the recent remarks of Senator Faulkner the policy position of the Labor Party and I acknowledge it is a 12-month cooling-off period. I seek clarification as to whether or not that is a legislative requirement; that is, is it enforceable? Is it not simply a code of conduct that has been proposed by the opposition? Senator Brown talks about five years. We do not believe that is a particularly reasonable scenario. We say that because you have heard of international precedents that have been referred to in the Senate this afternoon.
—Thank you, Senator Faulkner. The Democrats have put forward a private senator's bill that is based on international precedents, including the UK, Canada and the United States. We have heard very little if nothing at all from the government. I am still waiting to hear strong, rational reasons from the Prime Minister and the coalition as to why there should not be an enforceable cooling-off period for former ministers and also former senior ministerial advisers before they can take up work—that is, a consulting or lobbying position—in an area for which they were directly and previously responsible. 
There are a couple of issues at stake here, some of which have been recognised already, related to accountability. The recent examples, to which people have referred, have raised serious ethical questions not just among members of parliament but particularly among the public. As legislators, I think we have to work particularly hard to reinstall the faith of the public and the community in politicians and in our political institutions. Recent examples do very little to ensure that. There is an issue in relation to accountability, ethics and public confidence. 
—And urgency.
—And urgency. I guess that goes to the heart of the debate, Senator Murray, you are right. We have heard very little from this government as to why we should not meet the standards set in other industrialised countries. There has been no rational argument come forth from the Prime Minister except that he believes that people should have the right to go out and pursue a career in the private sector, make money and utilise the skills that we apparently acquire through public office and in our service as politicians. 
No-one is saying that former ministers cannot go out and be involved in lobbying or consultancy and utilise those very general, maybe even specific, skills that they pick up as a consequence of being a minister or member of parliament, but they cannot exercise those skills in that particular area for which they were previously responsible. We know all too well in this place that ministers and, indeed, increasingly, senior ministerial advisers do have access to secretive and sensitive information. They do have information that the rest of us, and certainly the public, are not privy to. I think we have to recognise that they are charged with a particular responsibility and we should expect nothing less than the highest standards of accountability from these men and women. 
I think the time has come for the cooling-off period and the accountability provisions—certainly the ones that the Democrats have suggested. The community recognises that fact. Increasingly, politicians in the parliament recognise that fact. Once again, the Democrats, with a keen interest in accountability, have decided to act on this issue and put forward what we believe is a moderate proposal which relates to the postretirement employment opportunities of ministers and senior ministerial advisers. There are some notable exemptions. I commend this bill to members of the Senate for reading. If people have better ideas on this—and certainly Senator Brown has put forward his idea; the Democrats disagree that the opposition's proposal is the way to go—they can raise them. At least we are starting this debate. It is now time for some action from the government. We are quite happy to proceed with the motion before us, but even better we have a private senator's bill on the Notice Paper with which we could proceed now. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>FORMER PARLIAMENTARIANS: BUSINESS APPOINTMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-03-13,"—I was pleased to hear the Democrats view because it was only a few years ago that I had to deal with a problem of a Democrat senator knocking a hole through their electorate office wall into their business so that the person would not have to go around the corner to go from one to other. That was really enterprising, as I recall. 
—That puts the lie to the idea that Democrats are not in business. 
—That is right; exactly. I did say the other day in the context of this sort of debate that no-one wants to discourage former parliamentarians going out into a new career. Often I have described this place as the most expensive tertiary institution in the country—it basically is. People learn and pick up a whole range of skills here that make them in some way marketable out there in the work force. The obverse side of that is, of course, that many of our ex-parliamentarians make shortlists and because they were once politicians they get scrubbed so no-one will get offended. It should be understood that it does work both ways. 
This is not an argument about whether people should be able to go into another career. It is not even an argument about whether they can go into a career that is aligned with their expertise. It is simply the waiting period before going into a speciality. It is very tough to be a minister for defence and then within two months represent the largest defence contractor in this country. We say that that is just a little to tightly aligned. Even if you tried to put up Chinese walls in your own mind, it is very hard to forget the knowledge you have picked up in the previous few months in the portfolio. Whether the period should be when you start to forget— 12 months or two years et cetera—depends on the individual. In most cases, if people behave ethically, one to two years is usually a good clearing time. 
We have also had serious doubts about how ethical it is to take a job with an organisation having promised them $5 million a week before the election was called. People say that that decision was made for a range of reasons. We are not alleging it was made to get the person a job. But having made that decision to help that organisation you should not, as ex-minister for health, go along and become a lobbyist or adviser to that particular body. It is a matter of how tightly constrained it is. 
Senator Brown wants to move a motion today to make it a five-year period. I think that is a little too long. I would prefer the Prime Minister to set standards on this matter and have them enforced. There are ways of enforcing them. If a defence minister immediately went and worked for a contractor, the government could say that it will not do business with that contractor until the 12 months is up. If you legislate for this, then you put the matter in the hands of courts and we will get all sorts of interpretations that probably none of us would want and that probably would be a great waste of taxpayers' money. I think in the end that this is a standard much better set by the Prime Minister. There are oodles of examples in every political party, including the Democrats, where people have left this place and gone into another career. We have to precisely define what we mean. We have to define it in advance. You cannot have this suddenly now apply to two or three colleagues who have left this place and got jobs. What they have done is obey the rules as they currently exist.
I think that once a bit of the aggro goes out of this, once a bit of the politicisation goes out of this issue, the Prime Minister should have a rethink and start to develop principles that he can announce at a later time when it is not a matter of political controversy—mid-term or somewhere like that. Let us face it—we do not want the only alternative for ex-politicians to be that you have to take a diplomatic post. I always believe it is good to have two or three politicians in diplomatic posts. They often do the job very well. There have been very few failures over the years. It also keeps the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on its toes. But I think we are at the absolute maximum at the moment—we would need a politician to retire before we could appoint another one. 
—That is very unfair to Senator Herron.
—No. Obviously, if the Ambassador to Ireland and the Holy Sea retires we would have an appropriate gap for Senator Herron. Again, that would be a waste of his ability if he took up that post. Nevertheless, he may well do so— good luck. I do not criticise that but I do not want that as the only alternative: to leave this place and vegetate, to leave this place with a government patronage job—that should not be the only alternative. This can be very simply dealt with by defining how closely aligned a postparliamentary career is with your previous job.",SENATE,<title>FORMER PARLIAMENTARIANS: BUSINESS APPOINTMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-13,"—The motion before us is to suspend standing orders to determine the urgency of this particular motion. As all other speakers have said, I think, the urgency has not been demonstrated and the government has many other pressing bills that need to be dealt with today, not the least of which is the RFA Bill—which we are desperately trying to get to a vote. Neither the parliament nor successive governments have imposed constraints on former ministers as to what their employment should be after taking up office. It has been left to the judgement of individuals.
There is no reason to think that former ministers from either side of politics have abused the public trust by taking unfair advantage of their past positions. There is no evidence of an individual taking advantage of their past positions. There is also no reason to doubt that former ministers would act with the utmost propriety. The government does not consider that it is reasonable for former ministers to be subject to a five-year prohibition on employment opportunities; although, there seems to be a split in the Labor camp between Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner on Labor's position. Senator Faulkner indicated that Mr Crean had a view. I suspect that, without legislating or moving motions here, the Labor Party will have very good opportunities to put this principle into effect. Senator Faulkner, regrettably you hold government in every state in Australia—all Labor governments—so you and Mr Crean will be able to ensure that retiring Labor ministers do as he suggests we should do federally. That will be a good test of the Labor Party's position on this matter. The government opposes the motion to suspend standing orders.",SENATE,<title>FORMER PARLIAMENTARIANS: BUSINESS APPOINTMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-03-13,"—Let me bring us up to date with where we are in the debate. Senator Brown is seeking the suspension of standing orders and to do so he has to justify the urgency of the motion before us. We should not travel too far into the merits of the case other than using collateral matters to explain why the motion requires urgency. So far as Senator Brown went to those matters, I think it is fair to say he dealt collaterally with the reasons and the justification of why it is an important matter, even an urgent matter. However, as Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray outlined—and even Senator Macdonald towards the middle part, but he got a little clouded— there are a number of other important matters that exceed this matter.
As Manager of Opposition Business, I remind the Senate that the RFA bill is the first bill before us and that we are still dealing with it. We must allow sufficient time for it to proceed. It is an important bill and it does need to be dealt with. Minister Macdonald, having carriage of that bill, can certainly attest to that. In fact, the minister can also assist in that process by ensuring that during the committee stage his comments are kept to a minimum—that is, to only respond to questions from Senator Brown and the like. I implore all of those involved in the committee stage of the RFA bill to acknowledge that there is a time and a place to put the issues, and to deal with them expeditiously rather than with longwinded explanations that may be a political solution, but we are talking about the committee stage in relation to more technical aspects of the bill. If all parties confine themselves to that we may be able to get through the RFA bill and onto the other parts of the legislative program so we can go home in the autumn sitting at some point. 
Senator Brown, I note that your motion is urgent, but it is not as urgent as my interest in ensuring that the RFA bill is dealt with and that we also get on to the remainder of the legislative program. I also say with some degree of confidence that we can rise to Senator Macdonald's challenge. It is what we would expect. Senator Macdonald has gone to that in saying that he will implore the Prime Minister to be the first to look at the utilisation of a code. From the suggestions he has put out about Labor ministers, I take it the Prime Minister would be the first. You would expect the Commonwealth to be the first to deal with a ministerial code. You would expect that the code would be championed by the Prime Minister. It is a little disappointing that he has not come out in answer to the criticisms that have been levelled at Dr Wooldridge and Mr Reith and said, `This is the new ministerial code of conduct that I would have as Prime Minister of this country.' Instead, we have the defence given by Senator Macdonald that the states should be the first to do it. I know the Attorney-General sometimes uses that argument but I would have thought the Prime Minister should be the first to put it forward.
In addition, we have a difference between Senator Brown and the Democrats in terms of how they would progress the matter. The Democrats appear to seek a legislative solution and Senator Brown seeks a ministerial code by the size of it similar to the UK model. The Labor Party, as Senator Faulkner has set out, has a better solution than has been put forward and it should be adopted. From here we should be able, rather than debate these collateral matters—there is no urgency sufficient to justify this matter being dealt with now—to get on with the business of the Senate.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-03-13,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, and at the request of Senator Stott Despoja, I move:
That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Stott Despoja moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion no. 7.
In support of my motion I would indicate two factors to begin with. Firstly, notice of this motion was given practically four weeks ago. Secondly, I followed the courtesy of writing to the Leader of Government Business, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and every party or independent member in the place. I was seeking to get a view as to whether they supported or opposed my motion. In the normal course of events I would have also been willing to consider any reasonable amendments that might have been put to me. 
I have had no response from anyone. I appreciate everyone is very busy and I do not necessarily take offence when there is no response. But I would at least expect in these circumstances, if there were opposition to it, I would have been advised and advised why, and a vote against would simply have been recorded. Just to remind senators who might not have it before them, the motion concerned reads as follows:
That the Senate calls on the Government:
(a)	to cancel the present retirement travel entitlements, including Life Gold Pass and severance travel entitlements, for all senators and members of the House of Representatives retiring after the commencement of the 40th Parliament, and their spouses;
(b)	to give consideration to restricting, rationalising and eventually phasing-out these entitlements presently applying to senators and members of the House of Representatives who retired prior to the 40th Parliament, and their spouses; and
(c)	to note that this motion does not apply to the office of Prime Minister.
It is a view of the Democrats and it is a view of very many in the community that the kinds of travel entitlements to which previous senators and members are entitled are an an excessive perk. Recognising that, the Prime Minister did indeed, following the publication of Audit report No 5, 2001-02: Performance audit:Parliamentarians' entitlements 1999-2000, move to restrict somewhat the entitlements that existed at that time recognising there was public dismay and anger about these matters. It is anachronism and it is inappropriate. 
For those senators who have not read the relevant report, you will find some good sections outlining them—sections 167 onwards, for instance. But the fact is they cost nearly $2 million a year and are regarded as an excessive gift to people, given what is a satisfactory salary and an extremely generous superannuation condition. My party and I can see no justification for them whatsoever, unless of course you enjoy the reputation of having your snouts in the trough, which I do not. 
—Don't take it.
—I take the interjection from Senator Boswell and I presume he approves of the spouse of a former member of parliament who travelled over 70 times in one year on the back of the Commonwealth purse. I presume he approves of that person, that spouse.
—For many charitable purposes, Andrew. Be fair.
—It was not a charitable instance in this case, Senator Abetz. It was in the pre-1977 era. Now, really, when I get that sort of interjection from you, Senator Boswell, I am extremely disappointed because if you like that sort of attitude then go out and justify it to the voters of Queensland, who have assumed that you have the reputation and quality to actually advocate the proper use of entitlements by former members and senators.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-13,"—This is another motion to suspend the standing orders so that this matter can be dealt with now. We have just had a debate on a motion about similar issues when Senator Murray's leader agreed that that was not a matter of urgency. We have had speeches from a number of senators also saying that that previous matter was not a matter of urgency and I suggest, with respect to Senator Murray, that this matter is not a matter of urgency either. We have a senator about to make his maiden speech. There is a matter of public importance that is listed for debate this afternoon which we have not yet started on. We have the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002 that we are desperately trying to bring to a vote and a conclusion. Further debate on these issues, important though they may be in the mind of Senator Murray, really should not proceed at this time. Those of us who have wanted to have had a little discussion on the matter put up by Senator Brown on entitlements of parliamentarians. I think we have all been able to make our points known on that and I would urge the Senate to reject this motion forthwith so that we can move on to the business of the Senate that has been scheduled.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARIANS' ENTITLEMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-03-13,"—I thank Senator Murray for his courtesy in providing the opposition with a copy of the motion he has put before the chamber, which of course he has done. It is true to say—and I thank him for it—that he has given adequate time for parties in the chamber to give consideration to a response, whether they will vote for this motion or against it.
The truth of the matter is—and I do not think Senator Murray is going to be surprised to hear this—I do not want to vote for it and I do not want to vote against it. It is not that simple. And this is one of the problems with the procedure that we have in the Senate. If you have very substantial changes to a question then the blunt instrument of a notice of motion where the Senate either agrees with it in its entirety or is forced to vote against it often does not suit political parties, often does not suit senators in the chamber. And if you have got very substantial amendments to make which change in many ways the thrust of what a senator like Senator Murray is trying to achieve—in other words, your amendments are not minor amendments, they are major amendments—then that becomes an unacceptable way of dealing with issues. I have got to say and be frank about this, Senator Murray, it was the opposition who called this motion, your motion, not formal. We did so because we have a longstanding view that the fundamentals of what you are proposing, namely your calling on the government to take certain action in this area, is contrary to what we believe is the best way of proceeding with these sorts of issues.
We have argued long and hard, and it has generally been accepted both inside the parliament and outside the parliament that it is better having governments or the parliament not dealing with these sorts of issues. It is actually better getting these to an independent body like the Remuneration Tribunal, whether it be about increasing or improving the entitlements of politicians or whether it be about reducing them, as is the case in relation to this which goes to reducing the entitlements of former parliamentarians. That is what it is about. But it is still best dealt with not by the government or, frankly, by the Senate or the parliament. In our view it is best dealt with by the Remuneration tribunal. 
I do want to say this, and I know that Senator Murray supports this principle. One good thing that has occurred now is that we do have transparency in relation to the way these entitlements are being used or abused. These matters are now tabled so we know. My view—I think Senator Murray at times has agreed with this but I do not want to put words in his mouth—is that that level of transparency leads to far greater accountability. That sort of scrutiny that is able to be applied both within this building and outside really does constrain the use of these sorts of entitlements, and it ought to be encouraged.
—Transparency came as a result of this side of the house.
—Including the opposition; I accept that. I hope you accept the principle I am putting in relation to transparency leading to accountability in this regard. I have got to say this. I am not suggesting this is the case in relation to this motion. Sometimes senators—and the Australian Democrats have even been guilty of this—put up motions knowing full well they cannot get up in this floor. That is why an alternative government—you would hope a government but certainly an alternative government—has to be able to live with a proposal, not be hypocritical about it, be consistent about it and adopt a position that you are willing to accept in government. We say: don't shoot this off to the government. They couldn't manage it anyway. They have been shown to be utterly incompetent in these sorts of issues. Get it off to an independent tribunal to make these decisions. That is not even going to the substance of the motion but to the principle behind it, which we have major concerns with. For that reason we will not grant urgency, but are always happy to debate the issues out.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARIANS' ENTITLEMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-03-13,"—I am getting a bit nostalgic about the Democrats today. I can remember, back in 1987, during the federal election, all the MPs were assembled at Customs House when the window cleaners' equipment broke and there were three of them dangling there for their lives, hanging on the side of the building. The TV cameras from all four channels all rushed in. What did the Democrats do? They got a sign that said `Vote Democrat' and every time there was a camera they ran around and put that sign in front of it. I thought that was the greatest act of political opportunism I had ever seen. Congratulations, Senator Murray, you have topped it today with this resolution.
The whole point about this sort of travel is that, if it is being abused, we crack down on the abuse. The first change brought in was that there were only 25 trips a year as opposed to unlimited trips. Prior to that, we changed the definition. Why did we change the definition? Because one of your former leaders was using this particular emolument to go on a speaker's tour and the cost of his airfares was going in his pocket. I would get very nasty about that, except one person from the Labor Party and one person from the Liberal Party were doing it at the same time, so it is mutually assured destruction to go down that path.
This was an entitlement granted by the Remuneration Tribunal. It is regarded as an overall part of the package. You want to get some brownie points by removing part of it. It will not be replaced by anything—at least not in a historical sense—and you will get praise in the press for a day until they turn on you on some other issue. Enjoy the brownie points, but I do not see why MPs, under public pressure, should have to give up all their entitlements piece by piece. Frankly, my constituents would like me to walk to Canberra. They would like me to pay for my own meal on the way—fair enough. They do not like me very much, or you; they don't. It is not because of this particular entitlement; it is because it has been institutionalised in this country to dislike MPs. It makes them feel better—good!—but we have a duty not to give in to that sort of mob approach. This is just one aspect of it; it is not a very important one. I would not mind having to account for how often I have used entitlements for my spouse. It would be lucky if it was one Canberra trip a year in 21 years, whereas some people have used 200 in that time. 
—You are a current member; that is fair enough.
—I am a current member. I am also a gold pass holder. I admit that right now; it is unlimited. I have been a gold pass holder for five, six, seven or eight years.
—You are current.
—I am saying I have not used entitlements I could have used. I have never tried to maximise them at any level. I have not used my charter allowance—not one cent of it—in the last 15 years.
—You should get out in the bush more.
—Senator Allison, if you want to get to abuse of entitlements, everyone knows where the Democrats in Victoria are run from. They are run from your office, and you know it.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Oh, really? No paper from your office has ever been used for the Democrat party? No photocopying cartridges, identically? Rubbish. You have some good liars on board. You may be right, but then there are few people who have been telling fibs to me about the operation of the Democrats in Victoria.
In the end, if this resolution is carried it will go to the government and the government will say, `This is a matter for the Remuneration Tribunal.' Nothing will happen with it; absolutely nothing. Senator Faulkner is right: we should not set our own entitlements. That is absolutely right. The Remuneration Tribunal should set them.
—Increase or reduce.
—We should not increase or reduce them, as Senator Faulkner says. Leave it to an independent body to determine them, and then at least we would be isolated from some criticism in relation to this. Today it will be the gold pass, tomorrow it will be some other issue, and then, Senator Murray, you will find yourself under a whole heap of pressure to give up something you may not want to give up. I do not think that is a very rational way of approaching things.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARIANS' ENTITLEMENTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,19,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—What an example of the pressure that comes on in this place to have everybody fall into line and go quiet on politicians' entitlements. Senator Allison, I know you will not be coerced in that fashion, and I want to compliment Senator Murray from Western Australia because he is the foremost advocate of making sure that parliamentarians' entitlements are meet and not excessive. I have just heard that we do not change our entitlements here. I have been in here when we have put through entitlements for fridge magnets on literature, for increased amounts of publishable materials and all manner of things. Of course we do; we set it all the time. It is in our domain to respond to public concern and occasionally to—
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Could I ask you to draw Senator Brown's attention to the fact that this is a motion on the suspension of standing orders, not on the substantive matter of the debate.
—This is a point of order that is taken regularly on all sides of the chamber, so I do not direct these comments specifically to that point of order from Senator Macdonald, but there is now a longstanding convention, acknowledged by Madam President and those presiding, that in order to try and achieve quick passage of business in this place the substance of broadly substantive issues beyond urgency are canvassed in a suspension of standing orders debate. As people know, one of the ideas here, when we changed the standing orders and limitations were applied, is to allow some breadth in this debate so that we could get over it quickly. If, of course, Senator Macdonald had taken a point of order saying it was incredibly boring and we ought to get on with the other business, I would probably have agreed with him, but I cannot let that point of order go because it is nonsense. It is nonsense, and many senators on both sides of the chamber know it is nonsense. 
 (Senator Bartlett)—Senator Brown, as you are no doubt aware, your remarks are required to be related to the substance of the matter.
—I think it is an urgent matter simply because it has been in the public domain; it is a matter that Senator Murray brought up a month ago and it is time that it was dealt with.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-03-13,"—Allegations have been made this afternoon about me by Senator Ray and I seek leave to make some statements with respect to those allegations.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Leave will be granted to Senator Allison, of course, but not before this suspension of standing orders motion is dealt with. That is the proper course of action. Of course you will get leave, you know that, but if we can deal with the matter before the chair we can then move to that. If you seek leave, you will receive leave from the opposition, but we have to get the procedures right in this place and be consistent.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on the point of order: it was apparently okay for Senator Ray to make these allegations during the debate and I cannot see why I should not respond.
 (Senator Bartlett)—You can speak on the motion, if you like, and respond as part of the motion.
—Okay then, I will speak on the motion, even though it has nothing to do with it. Senator Ray has made a serious allegation that I must respond to as quickly as possible. He says that my office is supporting the party. He has absolutely no evidence to support that claim and I deny absolutely and emphatically that there is any substance behind his allegation. It is the case that the Victorian division of the Australian Democrats has its office in the same building as I do. Senator Ray is wrong again when he says that the division is upstairs; it is not. My office is on the first floor and the divisional office is on the ground floor.
Senator Ray should be acquainted with the fact that the state office has its own photocopier, it has its own rizograph machine and it has its own telephones. It has its own materials, which it uses for party political purposes. I make it absolutely clear to my staff—and I am confident in the extreme that my instructions to my staff are carried out— that there is absolutely no question that any of my equipment, any of my materials or any of my entitlements are to be used for party purposes. So I challenge Senator Ray to put on the table the evidence for making such allegations—because I know there is no such evidence.
Quite frankly, I am getting rather fed up with this sort of innuendo that I have heard from Senator Ray from time to time on this subject. There is no law against my electoral office being in the same building, in the same street and in the same suburb as the divisional office. I am sure that there are plenty of instances where Labor Party members are similarly co-located or even just in close proximity. I reject absolutely the connection, the allegation and the inference—it is more than an inference—that has been made by Senator Ray. Again I ask him to not make such allegations unless he has evidence. I know that he cannot have that evidence, but if he thinks that he has it then he ought to put it on the table.

Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>BUSINESS</title>,<title>Rearrangement</title>,Business,22,1
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2002-03-13,"—This is a very important matter because it concerns what is, in our view, the most important and pressing environmental issue in Australia—that is, land clearing. Queensland and New South Wales account for more than 80 per cent of the native bush cleared in Australia. Recent research indicates that Australia is clearing 687,800 hectares of native vegetation every year. Approximately two-thirds of this is virgin bushland. This is higher by 22 per cent than the earlier estimates of what was being cleared annually. This means that over 50 football fields of Australian native trees, wildflowers and wildlife habitat are destroyed every hour. On these figures, Australia now ranks number five in the world in land clearing rates, behind the developing nations of Brazil, Indonesia, Sudan and Zambia. Previously Australia was ranked sixth behind Mexico—but we bumped those Mexicans.
Land clearing is the greatest threat to biodiversity loss in Australia, with millions of unnecessary deaths each year of a host of Australian native species. On World Environment Day in 1998, a report was released which revealed the devastating impact of land clearing on animals. In Queensland alone, 68,000 long-nosed bandicoots, 22,400 sugar gliders, 17,000 brush-tailed possums and 7,500 greater gliders are killed every year by land clearing and millions more plants and animals die. 
In November 2000, the Council of Australian Governments endorsed a proposed National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality. The national action plan on salinity invests $1.4 billion over six years in 21 priority catchments. The plan has very noble goals: to prevent, stabilise and reverse trends in dryland salinity affecting the sustainability of production, the conservation of biological diversity and the viability of our infrastructure; and to improve water quality and secure reliable allocations for human uses, industry and the environment.
The Prime Minister at the time recognised how critical controlling land clearing is to the effective implementation of national action plans. The Prime Minister said in relation to land clearing in salinity risk areas:
Recognising the fact that land clearing in salinity risk areas is a primary cause of dryland salinity, effective controls on land clearing are required in each jurisdiction:
• any Commonwealth investment in catchment/region plans will be contingent upon land clearing being prohibited in areas where it would lead to unacceptable land or water degradation; and
•  the Commonwealth will require agreement from relevant States/Territories ... that their vegetation management regulations are effectively used or, where necessary, amended to combat salinity and water quality issues.
The Commonwealth has entered into a bilateral agreement with Queensland implementing the principles of the NAP as set out by the Prime Minister. What is extraordinary about this bilateral agreement is that it does absolutely nothing about land clearing in Queensland, despite the commitments made in 2000. You cannot have an effective action plan on salinity without action to prevent the causes of salinity. This plan does nothing to stop rampant tree clearing in Queensland, although the Howard government promised to stop tree clearing in those areas where it threatens to degrade either land or water.
The agreement sets no caps on clearing and imposes no moratorium on clearing in high salinity risk areas, nor does it set targets for land cover and protection of native vegetation. And it endorses Queensland's Vegetation Management Act, the act under which record tree clearing rates in Queensland have been facilitated. The state government continues to issue large-scale clearing permits for leasehold land. The Commonwealth is trusting a piece of Queensland legislation that the Howard government had previously recognised is not working. The $160 million for addressing salinity in Queensland, inadequate as that is when spread over seven years, is now in danger of being wasted on more working groups and more tree planting, while the bulldozers and chains continue to flatten the bush.
It is worth recalling that the Australian Conservation Foundation, in conjunction with the National Farmers Federation, recently estimated that the annual cost of repairing Australia's land and water—and that is primarily associated with damage caused by land clearing—would be approximately $6.5 billion every year for 10 years. The national action plan's $1.7 billion over seven years falls far short of that need. Based on the bilateral agreement with Queensland, it is likely to fall ever farther short in accomplishing its stated objectives. The irony, of course, is that for a little over $100 million the Commonwealth could have bought the controls on land clearing in Queensland that it says are necessary. Instead, it is spending $162 million in Queensland for a project that is not going to address the most critical factor in preventing salinity.
If the current government cannot deal with the most pressing environmental issue in Australia it is bad enough, but when they spend $162 million to pretend that they are it is even worse. Despite years of promises and political posturing, native vegetation is still being cleared at unsustainable rates in the Australian bush. It is clear that the Queensland ALP is not going to address the problem. Unfortunately, it is also clear that the federal coalition is not going to do it either.
Land clearing is a recognised threat to the Great Barrier Reef. Sediment and nutrient run-off into the reef from the various catchments are now recognised as having damaged the inshore areas of the reef. While the Commonwealth has set targets for discharges from rivers into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, it has imposed no requirements in relation to land clearing—ultimately the primary cause of degrading water quality within the reef area. 
Salinity is a huge problem, but in many ways it is a symptom of a greater underlying problem, which is the clearing of native vegetation. A major book published in 2002 by the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences includes a number of contributions that speak about poor land use practices in Queensland and the impact of those practices on our wetlands, rivers and oceans. For instance:
Land under sugarcane and, by implication, changes in land use, which involve clearing of trees have a detrimental impact on water quality ... it is clear that grazing is likely to be the principal contributor of sediment and possibly nutrients to the GBR. Johnson et al. conclude that reform is required at policy, planning, and enterprise levels if the impacts of terrestrial activities on the ecological, economic and social values of the GBR are to be minimised in the future.
It is also clear that unless a change in current land use policy, planning, and management occurs, then the area of freshwater wetland and riparian forest ecosystems in many of the catchments adjacent to the GBRMP will be reduced to a very low level. It is likely that many areas of remnant freshwater wetlands and riverine rainforest vegetation are already less than is required to perform as an effective and functional biological unit.
Even if we are not addressing salinity in Queensland as an environmental issue, even if it was not the government's No. 1 environmental issue, Australia's overriding commitment to protect the World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef would require that salinity, and with that land clearing, in Queensland is addressed. It is a tragedy that we see at this particular juncture a national action plan which actually fails to address the principal causes of salinity and is little more than a band-aid on the issue. What we are talking about is probably planting more trees when trees are being cut down faster than we can actually plant them.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-13,"—I was waiting to hear in Senator Cherry's presentation one word of congratulations to the Howard government for taking the most significant steps forward in environmental management in Australia's history. I was also waiting for perhaps an acknowledgment that the Natural Heritage Trust was the biggest and best contribution towards the environment of any government in this nation's history. But, with the Democrats, there is never a sign of responsible attention to detail, always criticism and carping, negative contributions.
The bilateral agreements under the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality were signed with Queensland on 1 March this year. In those agreements, Queensland has reconfirmed its commitment to prohibiting land clearing where it would lead to unacceptable land and water degradation. Queensland is addressing the commitment through a community consultation process to provide the development of regional vegetation management plans. The bilateral agreement also includes a commitment by the state to implement a jointly agreed rapid salinity hazard assessment process to ensure that by June 2002 robust information is available for the assessment of land clearing permit applications on a property by property basis. The bilateral agreement also provides the Commonwealth with access to data on vegetation clearing permit approvals to ensure that the state is fulfilling its obligations to halt clearing on land vulnerable to degradation.
The Commonwealth is satisfied that the Queensland government does have controls in place to prohibit land clearing that would lead to unacceptable land and water degradation. You will be aware, Senator, as will all senators, that the states, and in this case Queensland, have the primary responsibility for land management in the state, and that includes land clearing. Whilst that is the case, the Commonwealth is taking steps to secure national greenhouse and natural resource management outcomes. The Commonwealth national action plan already includes a state commitment to, as I say, at least prohibit land clearing in priority catchment regions where it would lead to unacceptable land and water degradation. 
The bilateral agreement fulfils the requirements of the national action plan intergovernmental agreement to prohibit land clearing in those circumstances. This always raises the question of property rights. The Commonwealth's position is quite clear on property rights. The Commonwealth has reaffirmed its commitment to address property rights and compensation issues and has announced in its election commitments that COAG will address definitions of property rights, including water rights, and mechanisms to deliver just compensation for the loss of these rights. The issue of property rights and compensation is being considered as part of the work program of the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council under the programs committee of the standing committee.
It is important to note that, while a number of states have effective regulatory regimes for land clearing in place, the main reason the national goal has not been achieved is that many states have not contributed sufficiently to the national endeavour. The goal cannot be achieved as long as Queensland land clearing rates remain at current levels, and New South Wales land clearing rates also remain too high. Significant improvements in other states and territories are also required. In calling for action by states and territories to address their responsibilities for management of native vegetation, the Commonwealth expects any action to follow soundly based science. Furthermore, any action must also provide for effective consultation with land-holders likely to be adversely affected by decisions to limit land clearing. It is the Commonwealth's position that, where rights have been removed, the states and territories must meet any legal requirements for direct compensation to property rights holders. This is a precondition before the Commonwealth will consider any adjustment position.
The Commonwealth reiterates that land clearing is primarily a land management issue and is the responsibility of state and territory governments. The Commonwealth has, however, indicated that it would be prepared to provide a financial contribution commensurate with the reduction in emissions from land clearing negotiated and implemented by the Queensland government. Achieving a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will involve a sizeable and sustained reduction in the `business as usual' clearing rates over the past decade, beyond that flowing from the vegetation management regime in the national action plan. 
What we are saying is that the Queensland government—as do all state governments— has primary responsibility for land management, for clearing management and for providing adequate compensation where rights are impacted upon. We have gone on to say that Queensland should pay compensation when rights are involved under its land management obligations and those obligations under the national action plan. But when there are reductions in land clearing in excess of that which will help meet the nation's greenhouse gas emission reduction targets then the Commonwealth is prepared to make a contribution. We do not want to tell the Queensland government how they should do that; we do not want to be prescriptive about how a further significant reduction in land clearing and, consequently, greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved. It is up to the Queensland government, which has the relevant on-the-ground knowledge, to do that, because it is best placed to further develop a workable and cost-effective scheme and engender the support and commitment of the Queensland community that is crucial to the success of the implementation of sustainable land use practices. However, the Commonwealth does require that any scheme to provide for emissions reductions is readily verifiable and consistent with internationally agreed definitions and reporting requirements.
As a result of the Commonwealth's insistence, there have been additional meetings between officials of both the Queensland and Commonwealth governments, and it seems that the matter is progressing. It is important that the governments should work together to incorporate robust emission accounting and to ensure international climate change considerations are fully addressed. 
We are waiting for a proposal from Queensland—that is, a proposal in addition to their land management regime and in addition to their obligations under the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality. Any additional obligations to reduce land clearing that will have an impact upon greenhouse gas emissions, the Commonwealth will contribute to. We want to see what Queensland proposes, what money they are looking at, and we have indicated that we would very seriously work with them on the project.
The motion before the chamber talks particularly about the NAP agreement. Of course, that is only part of the equation. That has a specific reference to salinity and water quality. Beyond that, there is the issue of greenhouse gas emissions, and that is a separate issue or a different issue and an extension of the issue on which we are in very close contact with the Queensland government. We want to make sure, given goodwill between all parties, that the Queensland government complies with its obligations and financial responsibilities, as every other state has done. Mr Beattie has attempted to play politics in this. He knows he should do things he is not game to, so he is trying to blame the Commonwealth. You know that is right, Senator Cherry. The Commonwealth is doing the right thing. We are not going to be bluffed. We want to be fair, but we want to make sure that Queensland does what needs to be done, pays for what it is responsible for, and then we will help in the broader question that follows to achieve the targets that Australia needs to achieve. The national action plan agreement is only part of the whole scene. We are dealing with the other issues in an extension of those issues, and I am sure we will get to the right conclusion, given the Prime Minister's commitment to achieving appropriate targets.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2002-03-13,"—This matter of public importance goes specifically to the issue of land clearing in Queensland in the context of the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality. This is a matter of public importance, but it is only part, albeit an important part, of the broader issue of natural resource management that is challenging all of us—governments and communities alike. The control of salinity and the management of water are very much matters of public importance, they are matters of economic importance and they are matters of environmental importance. As I said, the specific question of land clearing is a key aspect of the debate, but it is only a part. I understand that Senator McLucas plans to address that particular matter in her contribution to this debate.
The solution to the increasing problems of salinity control and water management are to be found in a comprehensive, cooperative and inclusive approach to the management of land and water. I am confident that, at the time of the COAG Water Reform Agreement back in 1994, there was a level of goodwill and cooperation between the then Prime Minister, the state premiers and the chief ministers. I am sure the same could be said about the relationship between the first ministers of the Commonwealth and the states when the first agreement on the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality was signed in November 2000. There may also have been some goodwill between the responsible federal minister and his state counterparts at that time. In fact, Mr Truss put out a media statement on 3 November 2000 headed `Truss welcomes commonsense agreement'. In that release, Mr Truss said:
It—
and he is referring to the COAG agreement on salinity and water quality—
means that for the first time the Commonwealth, states and territories have committed to working together on solutions to the specific problems of salinity and water quality.
The actual implementation of the national action plan has now stagnated, and there has been little progress on the fundamentals of the water reform program. These processes have stagnated because of the lack of goodwill and leadership shown by the Howard government, particularly by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss. Let me refer to a media report from the Weekly Times of 12 December last year. In that article, Mr Truss blamed the states for delays in getting the salinity action plan off the ground. He accused the states of cost-shifting, and he said that some of the states were not committed to new money for the program. He said that the Commonwealth was not prepared to wait for the states and was considering going it alone. More recently, we have had an attack on the states about water reform by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anderson. 
A key aspect of these programs to control salinity and protect our water resource is the determination of the property rights of individual land-holders. If there is a desire by the broader community to acquire a private right, whether it be water or vegetation preservation, then the owner of that right must be appropriately compensated. This point was recognised by all governments back in 1994. The water reform agenda was incorporated into the national competition policy agreement in 1995. So the issue of water reform generally and property rights in particular was well and truly on the agenda when this government came into office in March 1996.
By calling for a national debate on water reform at last week's ABARE Outlook Conference, Mr Anderson in fact highlighted the failure of the Howard government to give any priority to water reform in its first six years in office. The Howard government's failure to give this important issue the priority it demanded in 1996 saw the momentum generated by the COAG decision lost, and the reform process has stagnated ever since. There is no doubt that the federal government has a key role to play in all of this. In his address to the ABARE Outlook Conference, Mr Anderson said that the advancement of water reform in Australia required both national leadership and national standards. And that is absolutely correct. But that national leadership has not been provided by the Deputy Prime Minister, who had direct responsibility for water reform from March 1996 until October 1998. Nor has it been provided by the Prime Minister. This is a government that prefers to blame the states for everything. We now have the Prime Minister and Mr Anderson talking about getting all the states together to work out how best to balance the needs of farmers and the needs of the environment. Mr Howard and Mr Anderson should have settled that balance with all the interested parties years ago.
These outbursts, first by Mr Truss and then by Mr Anderson, may make good copy but the problem remains when the media buzz is gone—and the necessary cooperation between governments has been further eroded. It is clear that the Commonwealth-state administrative framework in place to manage these programs is not working properly. At the last estimates hearings, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry advised me that the funding allocation for the national action plan was set at $5 million for 2000-01 but that amount was not fully expended. Officers then advised that the funding available for 2001-02—that is, $65 million—had only been extended to the extent that some $7.75 million had been transferred to the state of South Australia. The officers further advised that at the time of that estimates hearing just $9.5 million had been expended—that is, less than $10 million in the first 18 months of a seven-year $1.4 billion program.
It is important to note that we are not talking about on the ground activity here; we are talking about funding commitments. It is also important to note that the government was getting clear advice well before November 2000 about the actual threat to rural Australia from dryland salinity. There was a report to the government by the Prime Minister's Science Engineering and Innovation Council in 1998. That report advised the government that at that time 2.5 million hectares were affected by dryland salinity, with the potential for that to increase to 15 million hectares in the next 30 years. In October 1999, the Murray Darling Basin Commission released the findings of its audit, and that put the issue back on the national agenda.
It is clear, therefore, that this is a problem that has been known to this government for some considerable period, and we are still a long way from even starting to address it. At the ABARE Outlook Conference, Mr Anderson also said there was a need for a uniform approach to the issue of water property rights, and he was right again. But a uniform approach means a national approach, and a national approach brings with it a fundamental role for the Commonwealth. As I say, that is a role which has been ignored by Mr Howard and Mr Anderson for six years. If I had the time, I could make a lengthy analogy between the failure of this government with respect to dairy deregulation and its inaction for years in the initial phases when action was needed. I will not at this stage, because I do not believe I have the time. 
But there is clearly a key role for all stakeholders in rebuilding Australia's natural resource base. Any program such as the salinity action plan must have the support of all stakeholders, from the federal minister for agriculture down to individual land-holders. This, I must say, must be active support. This active support can only be forthcoming if the roles of all parties are clearly identified and articulated. All parties must be educated about the nature of the program, how it will be implemented and what minimum standards are expected from the implementation of the program. There may also be a need for incentives to ensure active support in these programs and, as I have said, compensation must be provided where individual rights are to be acquired.
Finally, it is fine for the Commonwealth government and the states to develop national plans such as the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, but there must be far more to these plans than a well-worded communique or a joint press release. There must be on the ground outcomes. That means programs that have clear and achievable goals; programs that have clear priorities; programs that acknowledge the property rights of individuals and compensate those individuals where their rights are acquired in the broader community interest.
I must say that this government has failed the environment and rural and regional land-holders when it comes to the issue of national resource management and restoration. Why do I say that? Whether it be at stage 2 of the Natural Heritage Trust, whether it be regarding the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality or whether it be on the issue of water reform, this government has shown that all it is about is political division. It is about the implementation of its plan, built on driving political wedges between the stakeholders in the potential outcomes these important programs might produce, and it is all about the attempted transfer of financial responsibility—and who can forget the recent problem we had in relation to Natural Heritage Trust stage 2 funding, where the Commonwealth has been demanding a far greater contribution to that funding than was required under stage 1, putting that forward as a barrier to the progress of that program.
And so the priority of the Commonwealth is not to remedy the environment but to shift the burden onto the states, notwithstanding that the states may already have made other commitments in other areas. Whereas in the case of the Natural Heritage Trust stage 1 the Commonwealth was prepared to accept a responsibility because its political imperative then was to try to get the political brownie points for its program, it is now seeing, with Labor governments in place, that it is politically sustainable to challenge those states to make contributions which will tax their budgets and make it more difficult for those states to participate in delivering the outcomes that are needed to restore our natural resource base through programs like the Natural Heritage Trust.
But one thing is certain out of all this: all of the government's program is certainly not about agricultural sustainability and it is certainly not about environmental restoration. If that were the case, we would not be seeing, for example—under the national action plan, after having had this $1.4 billion program operating for about 18 months—our having had something less than $10 million expended, with no outcomes on the ground.
—But Queensland was slow to sign up.
—Senator Macdonald says that Queensland was slow to sign up. The fact is that, from the time in November 2000 when there was common agreement, this government has been playing politics and seeking to extract arrangements from the states that have not reflected what the needs of those states are and which have been designed to make it more difficult for the states to become involved in those programs. But I predict that, down the track, this government will put its expenditure programs back so that, at the next election, as part of its program for the coming three years, it can trumpet a reannouncement of some of the funds it has already committed. That is the program of this government, that is what it intends to do, and that is why it is more interested in playing politics and driving in political wedges than getting results on the ground and delivering agricultural sustainability and environmental restoration.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2002-03-13,"—That was an amazing speech. If one was listening to that, one would think that the prime responsibility of land management and salinity was a Commonwealth issue. If Senator O'Brien cares to consult his Constitution, he will find that it is not. It is primarily a responsibility of the state governments, who are not meeting their responsibilities and are trying to flick it back to us. You cannot mount any argument at all to deny that, under the Constitution, the responsibility for maintaining tree clearing and salinity is a state responsibility. Even when we come in and kick the tin, you do not accept it; you want more and more.
This motion before us now goes to the failure of the bilateral agreement between Queensland and the Commonwealth, in relation to the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, to address the matter of land clearing in Queensland. Clearly, here the Democrats have confused the two issues: the salinity issue and the tree clearing issue.
I will refer to the salinity issue first and say that our credibility is good. Last week the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland signed a bilateral agreement, under the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, to address the salinity and water quality problems in Queensland. Not only did we do that but also we put $700 million into supporting it. That is hardly an act of a government that is walking away from its responsibilities. That is an act of a government that is taking the responsibilities that have been given to it under the Constitution and going further with them. It is an act of a government that is saying, `Well, we've got to do something. This is an enormous problem. It is probably beyond the capacity of the states to handle.' But, Senator O'Brien, do not tell me for one minute that we are walking away from our responsibilities on this issue. I believe that every state, other than Western Australia, has signed this. But to commit $700 million to a problem that is basically a state problem shows the credibility—the overwhelming credibility— of the federal government and its commitment to address some of these environmental issues.
Yes, the land clearing is not as far advanced as the salinity problem is. But let us give credit where credit is due, and it is certainly due to a government that commits $700 million to a particular problem. As far as the tree clearing or land clearing part of the motion is concerned, there has been correspondence between Premier Beattie and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard. Even as late as 16 February, the Prime Minister wrote to the Premier and said that `the regulation of vegetation management is essentially a state responsibility', and that `the responsibility for the design and implementation of land clearing arrangements remains a matter for your government'—and it is: it is a state responsibility. Every other state government in Australia has met its responsibilities and come down with some sort of clearing regime.
But, unfortunately, even though all the other states have cleared much of their land, Queensland has not proceeded down that clearing path and has a lot of uncleared land. That is unfortunate for the Queensland farmers. They do not mind sharing the responsibility, but they are saying that all the burden is being placed on Queensland. I want to say this: farmers are great environmentalists, because it goes to self-protection. If they do not look after their land, they will not have any land: it will not produce anything, it will not grow a crop, if it is flogged to death. Quite often you will hear them saying that, with X paddock, you cannot flog it; you have to take the stock off it. I want to say this: there are no greater environmentalists than Australian farmers, because they have to be environmentalists. If they are not, they end up with their property greatly reduced in terms of its earning power. 
The Prime Minister has said that land clearing and tree clearing is a state government issue. He then says, `We do have a greenhouse problem, but the Commonwealth does not wish to be prescriptive about how further significant reduction in land clearing is undertaken.' So, in effect, the Prime Minister is saying, `Mr Beattie, you come up with a plan, you get the agreement of the graziers of Queensland with that plan, and we'll come to the party again and give you further assistance.'
I reiterate the first part of my speech— there will be $700 million for salinity and then a commitment in writing that we will come in and pick up some of the tab for tree clearing. But, first, Premier Beattie has got to put that plan to the federal government, and he has got to get an agreement on that plan from the graziers. The Prime Minister has committed himself to fund some of the costs for the land clearing decision in Queensland. 
This leads me to a problem we have in Australia with respect to property rights. Graziers and farmers were given water resources and they were given land title, and what went with those rights, those licences, those leases was `use it or lose it!' They were told: `Get out there and clear!' `Get out there and use the water!' `Get out there and irrigate!' `Grow cotton for the prosperity of Australia!' `Grow wheat!' Later on in time, we discovered that we had overcommitted those resources. People had put in infrastructure, but now they have to surrender some of those rights. They are doing it not on behalf of themselves but on behalf of Australians, because the amount of water resources was originally overestimated.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2002-03-13,"—The issue of land clearing is, I believe, the most urgent and potentially the most devastating environmental and, consequently, economic issue that we as a nation face. While it is certainly the case for the nation, it is also certainly the case for my state of Queensland. We cannot look at land clearing simply in the context of salinity alone. Extensive land clearing affects biodiversity and it affects land degradation, including salinity issues. It affects water quality and, of course, the global issue of greenhouse. Any government's response to the issue of land clearing, if we truly want to address this issue, cannot be compartmentalised into salinity alone. There needs to be a strategic approach that takes into account all of the relevant impacts across the ecosystem. It is not an issue that we can afford to waste time with; it is not an issue on which we can afford political argy-bargy. But the reality we face is that this is exactly the situation in which we find ourselves. 
I turn now to the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality. Labor supported the government's proposal to deal nationally with the issue of salinity when the Prime Minister announced the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality in October 2000. It is only sensible that a national response is required, given the geographical spread of the catchments and the need for a catchment based approach. It is also sensible that the states are involved in the response, but it is unfortunate that the attitude of the Commonwealth has militated against any activity or any solutions being delivered up to this time. 
Queensland was the first state to sign the intergovernmental agreement on the national action plan in January 2001. The fact that Queensland was the first state shows their preparedness to deal with the issue promptly. Queensland is in a much better position than the southern and the western states to deal with salinity. We do not yet have the major salinity outbreaks that are experienced in other states so Queensland has the best chance to develop measures which can prevent the devastating environmental and economic impacts of salinity. Prevention, I suggest, is much cheaper; it is surely more desirable and in fact more effective than rehabilitation that will have to be adopted in other states. However, there remains only a small window of opportunity for Queensland to develop effective prevention strategies. 
Last August, Queensland sent their signed bilateral agreement to the Commonwealth. Only two weeks ago, some seven months later, it was countersigned by the Commonwealth. Seven months that could have been used to further the work of preventing salinity in that state have been wasted. In fact, the only state the federal government had signed the bilateral agreement with before the federal election was the then coalition state of South Australia. We can only conclude that the Commonwealth is playing politics with the states on this issue. The fact is that the Queensland government was set to protect areas that were not only endangered but that were of concern under its freehold land clearing legislation.  
The Queensland Labor government had consulted and negotiated extensively with industry and environmental interests in the development of this legislation. It had also committed over $100 million to ensure that the legislation could be properly implemented. What it needed from the Commonwealth was matching funding to compensate those affected by this legislation. Having heard Senator Boswell's address, I have to say that he agrees with me. The Labor Party acknowledged that there was a role for the national government and in the last election considered their responsibilities and the national leadership that is required for salinity issues. They announced a comprehensive policy which would have delivered $100 million to Queensland to fund a partnership—a partnership between the state and the national government, and a partnership between land-holders and governments and the environment sector to deliver a sensible, achievable outcome. 
Land-holders and leaseholders would have been compensated for changed agricultural practices. Land clearing rates would have slowed, and environmental outcomes would have improved. However, the federal government has been demanding matching funding from the state governments for its National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality. However, when the Queensland government needs $100 million in matching funding to address the serious issue of land clearing, it claims that issue is a state responsibility.
Tree clearing not only impacts on salinity and water quality but can also reduce biodiversity and lead to significant greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists in developing the framework to control tree clearing in Queensland chose biodiversity to underpin the decision making process in that state. Degradation issues such as salinity were then overlaid over this biodiversity framework. The Howard government, I am afraid, does not seem to understand we need an integrated approach to address tree clearing that addresses not only salinity and water quality but also biodiversity and greenhouse issues. There is no consistency in the way the Howard government deals with environment and natural resource management issues. Its decision making is based on political expediency not sound environmental management. 
There can be no clearer example of this than Deputy Prime Minister Mr Anderson's ability to find $40 million during the election campaign for the Namoi cotton growers in his own electorate. During the Senate estimates, however, AFFA officials seemed to have no clear understanding of where the money was going to come from. They indicated that it may come from the national action plan or possibly from the Natural Heritage Trust. Mr Anderson can find $40 million for his own electorate, with no clear guidelines about how the money is to be spent or where it may come from. However, when a state Labor government develops legislation and commits over $100 million dollars to address the most serious environmental problem facing this country, Mr Anderson simply claims that it is a state responsibility. There is no strategic approach, no consistency, just political expediency from this government on environment and natural resource management issues.
What adds to my concern over this issue is that not only does tree clearing continue unabated but also this government has squandered half of Telstra in the process. The partial sale of Telstra, we were told, would address serious environmental and natural resource management issues. I am afraid it has not. The national action plan does provide an opportunity to address tree clearing where it leads to dry land salinity and erosion impacting on water quality. However I believe that the federal government should work with the Queensland government to develop a separate package to deal comprehensively with the issue of tree clearing. 
The National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality is devised to build on the Natural Heritage Trust. It is not a program designed to implement the legislative framework or the national strategic approach that is required to control tree clearing. The Queensland government has the legislation but it needs the Commonwealth government to match its funding so that it can compensate those affected. This is no less than the Commonwealth is demanding of the state in relation to funding for the national action plan or now the NHT.
I know that community groups in northern Queensland are frustrated with the federal government. During recent discussions with regional strategy groups, such as the Burdekin Dry Tropics Group which has developed a natural resource management strategy for the Burdekin catchment, members expressed frustration at the lack of action from the federal government. It has been 16 months now since the announcement of the national action plan and no money at all has hit the ground in northern Queensland. The community is extremely frustrated and it deserves to be treated in a more inclusive way. It is distressing that tree clearing continues at alarming rates in Queensland and urgent action is required to stop what is happening. The Howard government's attempts to blackmail the Queensland Labor government are not going to solve this issue. The Queensland government clearly has the capacity and the will to act on this issue but it needs federal government support.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality</title>,Matters of Public Importance,24,1
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2002-03-13,"—The motion before us refers to `the failure of the bilateral agreement between Queensland and the Commonwealth in relation to the national action plan for salinity to address the matter of land clearing in Queensland'. Senator Cherry spoke to that and, of course, erected a straw man and then demolished it. I was going to restrict my remarks to the motion but I will digress for a moment to respond to both Senator O'Brien and Senator McLucas and demolish them. Their party had 13 years to do something about salinity in this country and they did nothing. Senator McLucas comes in here and complains about the 16 months in which no money has come forward, and the seven months until the agreement was signed, but the reality is that this government was the first government in history to do something about the salinity problem. Then they digressed in other directions.
I will respond precisely to Senator Cherry and his straw man. The bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and Queensland, as Senator Ian Macdonald said, was signed on 1 March this year. Indeed, every state that has so far signed bilateral agreements with the Commonwealth to implement the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality does engage tree clearing quite comprehensively as a fundamental issue in dealing with salinity and water quality. More than that, the issue is also dealt with as one of the core issues in the overarching intergovernmental agreement for the national action plan from which the bilateral agreements have subsequently been developed. 
Clause 27 of the intergovernmental agree-ment prohibits tree clearing in priority catchment areas where it would lead to `unacceptable land and water degradation'. In the bilateral agreement itself there are numerous references to vegetation management aimed at achieving tree clearing constraints, again, not just in Queensland but in all other states that have become parties to the program. This is quite central to the entire approach being adopted by the Commonwealth and states in this historic effort to engage the salinity and water quality challenges facing the country. Clause 20.3 of the agreement with Queensland delivers a commitment from Queensland to ensure, to the best of its abilities, that regional vegetation management plans for the priority regions are completed in a way that informs the development of national resource management plans that will be developed to implement the national action plan and which will provide the key guide as to where clearing may or may not occur in the context of the national action plan. 
There are then a range of clauses to ensure both the Commonwealth and the state meet their obligations under that clause. For example, clause 20.5 provides for a rapid salinity assessment to be engaged in order to inform the development of the regional vegetation management planning process that is under way in Queensland under its own vegetation management legislation, which in turn will be a key contributor to the wider natural resource management plans of the national action plan process. As my colleague Senator Boswell quite rightly pointed out, in the Constitution that is a state responsibility—a key point that seems to have been missed by the speakers from the other side. Admittedly there are state Labor governments right throughout the country, and one would not want to think that they would be partisan in that approach and would have a different approach if it were any other government of another political persuasion, but one is constrained to think that that may be their reasoning.
The rapid salinity mapping provision is there to ensure the decisions made by Queensland in relation to tree clearing in areas covered by the national action plan might be well informed, even ahead if necessary, of the finalisation of the natural resource management plans where vegetation management will be a key element—and I pay due credit to the Queensland government for that. Clauses 20.7 through to 20.9 then deal with the issue of ensuring there is an appropriate level of information sharing between Queensland and the Commonwealth for both governments to feel confident each is meeting its obligation under the national action plan in relation to ensuring there is, as the intergovernmental agreement requires, no land clearing that leads to unacceptable land or water degradation. 
So there are in fact comprehensive references to tree clearing in the bilateral agreement as befits the clear understanding that such clearing is well known to be one of the causes of dryland salinity, which is what the national action plan seeks to address in terms of its impact not just on land degradation but on water degradation and in order to protect Australia's productive farm and grazing land as important contributors to our economy. So for Senator Cherry to claim the bilateral agreement does not address the issue of tree clearing is just plain wrong. If what he is really saying is that the Commonwealth should not have signed an agreement with Queensland to combat salinity and water quality problems in that state without some sort of agreement for a total ban on tree clearing then he fails totally to understand the national action plan. If his observation was rather that there is more to be done in relation to further constructive dealing with Queensland on vegetation management issues then he would be right and he should be perfectly confident that that work is indeed ongoing. But to claim that the bilateral agreement does not deal with the issue in relation to the matter at hand, which is the National Action Plan on Salinity and Water Quality, is just plain wrong and a misinterpretation.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2002-03-13,"—This amendment, on behalf of the Australian Greens, will ensure that there is parliamentary scrutiny of the regional forest agreements. Both the Labor Party and the government have said, `There are mechanisms for looking at the regional forest agreements and, when those agreements default in terms of management, employment commitments and the environment, the parliament will be able to look at it.' What both the Labor Party and the government do not say is that they will have no power to do anything about it. The whole thrust of this piece of legislation is to remove the current powers—and obligations which come with those powers—to manage, on behalf of the nation, and oversee the natural values of forests and to ensure that the states, which are getting more than $300 million out of national taxpayers to inject into the industry, expend that money judiciously and with good employment outcomes.
The evidence is clear that there has been job shedding on a very large scale, particularly in Senator O'Brien's home state, my home state of Tasmania. Despite repeated challenges to both the Labor Party and the government in here, this is not countermanded, because there is nothing to be said about it by Senator O'Brien on behalf of the Labor Party or by the government. Hundreds of jobs have been shed and hundreds of people have been sacked from the industry of native forest logging since Prime Minister Howard signed the agreement with the then Liberal Premier—which was taken up with even greater gusto by the now Labor Premier, Jim Bacon—in Tasmania, in which the Prime Minister said it would create 550 jobs and that, to that end, they would put $80 million for starters into the Tasmanian industry. In fact, a minimum of 450 jobs has been lost. Senator O'Brien is not going to deny that, the government is not going to deny that, yet we have this extraordinary situation where both of them will say, `We're doing this for jobs.' 
Senator O'Brien has today said, `Well, we might get some veneer made. The Finns are looking at the whole logs we're exporting to Finland and, if they're impressed, they might come and set up a veneer plant in Tasmania using regrowth.' What Senator Murphy has had to say about that is enlightening: that it has been tried before—and it has—and the promise is always kept there, dangling in front, but it does not turn out. The idea that a use, such as veneer, has to be found for regrowth points to another major fault with the whole way the forests in Tasmania are being handled—that is, where are the sawlog forests for the future? Huge amounts of Tasmania have been planted with Eucalyptus nitens. I challenge either the government or the opposition to get up and say this is good sawlog timber. It is not; it is fast-growing, imported eucalypt from the mainland, which is for pulp. 
It is not a sawlog driven strategy we have had in Tasmania; it is a pulp driven strategy—that is, a woodchip driven strategy— which denies and puts the lie to the idea this legislation is aimed at creating jobs, because the woodchip industry is a gross job shedder. That is why jobs have been lost since Prime Minister Howard made his hollow promise. The sawlog industry has been bypassed and, as we heard in that letter to Senator O'Brien from Mr Hayward from Wigeena earlier today, the fact is that over 90 per cent of the Tasmanian native forests is now being exported as woodchips rather than being utilised as sawlog. This is extraordinary because, in other countries, it would be the other way around: it would be 90 per cent going to sawlog and 10 per cent, as waste, going to woodchipping. This is a rampant misuse and waste of a once-only resource in the native forests of Tasmania. That is why Senator Murphy has felt impelled to take such a forward role in the debate—because he has been there at the coalface, he has represented the workers and he has seen the industry mismanagement with his own eyes. 
We need parliamentary scrutiny for exactly the opposite reason to the one given by Senator Macdonald on behalf of the government. He says, `It is a democratic bill; it will take away mischievous government intervention.' What he means by that is that it will take away the ability of governments to act at all in the national interest. Acting on the environmental interests of the Australian people is seen by the minister and by the Howard government as mischievous, whereas we know, in effect, that the Australian people have moved well ahead of both the National Party and the Labor Party and want to see what is left of these grand forests and their wildlife protected because they are enormous job creators in terms of the attractiveness of those forests—both to Australians and to people from all around the world.
It is instructive to look at the financial performance of Forestry Tasmania because that brings into focus why there should be a national overview. Remember that Forestry Tasmania has been in receipt of enormous public largesse, including from the federal taxpayer. In 1988 it received $51.44 million as a result of the Helsham inquiry settlement, and that came out of taxpayers' pockets right around Australia. In 1990, the then Labor Premier, Michael Field, tragically transferred the accumulated $272 million debt of Forestry Tasmania into the public debt. In other words, he took it off Forestry Tasmania, which had been growing this debt—to use Treasurer Costello's new verbiage—and put it into the public debt where it could not be seen but where, since that year, it has been attracting interest-free payments and, therefore, has been taking millions of dollars out of schools, hospitals, police stations and other public amenities in Tasmania. Tens of millions of dollars have been lost because of Forestry Tasmania's debt. 
Then, in 1997, after this regional forest agreement was signed by Prime Minister Howard, $110 million all up went into the Tasmanian industry—$64 million earmarked for Forestry Tasmania. In 1998, $52.197 million of capital and interest due on softwood loans from the Commonwealth was written off. If you put those together, you have well in excess of half a billion dollars going into the forest industry, and particularly Forestry Tasmania, out of the public purse in the last 14 years. Half a billion dollars in a little state like Tasmania! 
It is worth noting that Forestry Tasmania's pre-tax operating profit is well below what would be expected in the private sector. It had a 1.1 per cent return on net assets in the last available year, 1999-2000. It would be more profitable to put the money that has gone to Forestry Tasmania into an interest bearing bank account. The pre-tax profit of Forestry Tasmania of $8.3 million in that year is even less than it first appears, because it includes interest income of $2.9 million from investments, including $71 million of the RFA money. A big component of the profit Forestry Tasmania can show is actually interest out of the taxpayers' money going through the RFA into Forestry Tasmania. It is not from the selling of the forests at all, because that is being subsidised. The people making the profit out of the forests are Gunns Pty Ltd. They have a 35 per cent return on their investment while Forestry Tasmania mismanages the public domain of the forests and, even worse, uses the largesse coming from here to falsely give the appearance that it is making a profit when it is not.
Forestry Tasmania's profit has fallen dramatically over the three financial years to 1999-2000, despite increasing wood volume sold. Operating expenses have risen faster than operating revenue, despite the higher wood volumes—most of which come from native forests. It is just not possible to work out which components of operating expenses are blowing out, because the annual report does not give that breakdown. However, the recent borrowing of $14 million by Forestry Tasmania dramatically exceeds the amount borrowed over the last few years. I ask the minister, as surveillance now, not some delegated committee further down the line: why are the profits in Tasmania falling while the amount of wood cut and processed is increasing? Why are the returns so low on that asset? Why are the operating costs blowing out? What has happened to the public money? What is the pre-tax profit for this year estimated to be? Why did Forestry Tasmania have to borrow $14 million in the last year when it had only so recently received $110 million, or at least $64 million of the $110 million, from Tasmanian taxpayers? What is going on?  
I will return to this matter tomorrow, because when you look at Forestry Tasmania's so-called `profit', you find that it has been falsely aggregated by a reassessment of the value of the standing forests in Tasmania. From year to year they say, `The value of the forests has gone up by X million dollars. That is profit.' It is a very false accounting trick. If you take that out, Forestry Tasmania is running at a very great loss—despite the millions being injected into it by the public purse. Meanwhile, up the road in the private sector, Gunns Pty Ltd is making a killing through exporting the forests to the Japanese woodchip market at a huge windfall profit to itself because its infrastructure is paid for through Forestry Tasmania by the public. The other thing that Gunns Pty Ltd is so good at doing to enhance its profit line is sacking its workers. Where is the CFMEU and where is the Labor Party when that happens? They are silent.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2002-03-13,"—There is one minute left for this debate and, for Senator Ludwig's benefit, I rise now. If I did not, Senator Brown would use an obtuse standing order to speak for another 15 minutes. Whilst I am here to answer questions that are germane to the bill, none of the questions Senator Brown has put to me on this occasion are. I will take the next 40 seconds to point out another of the inconsistencies of Senator Brown's argument.
We were talking this morning about an incident concerning the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle—something that Senator Brown was blaming on the RFA. We now find, through interjection, that the incident occurred in 1992. As with so many of Senator Brown's allegations, the incident referred to occurred many years ago, and his use of the incident to criticise Tasmanian forest management therefore takes into account none of the improvements since that time. It does not take into account the National Forest Policy Statement and it does not take into account the RFAs and the better management since those times. It is just typical of Senator Brown's deliberate misconstruction of the real issues involved in this debate.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-03-13,"—It was a pleasure to see and hear Senator McLucas in the chair this afternoon. I want to make a few remarks this evening on a broad policy area, often known as population policy. The day before yesterday, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Population and Development met. It is a group of which I have been a member for some time and which is usually focused on population policies in our region. I was very pleased to be made the secretary of that group this week. I am hopeful that there will be a focus in this parliamentary term on population policy issues in Australia. I suspect that if media attention since last month's population summit in Melbourne is any indication, this is likely to occur.
What is more important is that the debate is an informed, serious-minded one and, most particularly, an open-minded one. While the national media attention is welcome, for the most part it has glossed over the finer detail of issues, including, some would say, the state of the environment. That has been a disappointment of the coverage. The link between population and environment is extraordinarily complex and deserves deep consideration. Within each component part of the population debate, such as the environment, there is great divergence of views. Take for example the argument that population size is not the dominant factor in environmental outcomes. Agricultural activity in this country is geared more towards our overseas markets. For example, Australians consume only eight per cent of the total Australian water consumed. The rest goes into our agricultural exports. 
While population size may not be a dominant factor in environmental degradation, it is very important as an indirect link. In a globalised economy, the bigger the population size, the more imports we require to be brought into Australia. It follows naturally then that we would have to ride our primary industries and our processing industries to drive our exports to pay for those imports. 
There is a range of views amongst environmental policy activists concerned with population. Some would describe as austere and perhaps technologically pessimistic the view of the Australians for a Sustainable Population Group, who basically want nothing short of immediate action to reduce our population. That, on the other hand, is tempered by bureaucratic analysis which, while being concerned about long-term sustainability, asserts that we will in fact face a critical stage in about 70 years from now. 
So those who have promoted panic in the recent past concerning resources have, on some views, burdened themselves and some aspects of the green movement as a whole with a credibility challenge. In the 1980s, for example, some environmentalists misinterpreted the findings of the Club of Rome as saying that the world's natural resources would be consumed by the end of the 1990s. Clearly they did that to spur reform. Instead, because the world has not ended as perhaps predicted, aspects of the green movement are not always treated as seriously as perhaps they ought to be. In the Australian just this week, for example, one columnist wrote:
... the notion that Australia can't hold any more people without choking implies that science, the supposed ally of the greenie, won't find new ways to protect or improve the environment in the future.
So, aside from those who oversimplify the debate, we have others who dismiss some very real concerns in the community. That is a tension that does not add anything but rather detracts from the seriousness of the debate itself. People have every reason to take a serious look at ethnic harmony, the economic negatives of unskilled migration— as they are often called—the environment and other factors. All of these issues deserve consideration. One does not need to be dismissive of problems in absorbing New Australians or of concerns about the environment to promote population growth. I think that any difficulty in absorbing New Australians is more than made up for by their long-term productivity and the enrichment they bring to Australia and to the national diversity, which will be a real asset in an increasingly globalised system.
We have only to look at, for example, the celebration of next week's Harmony Day. I have spoken before of the richness of our Australian community, particularly of course in Greater Western Sydney. Next week's Harmony Day coincides with the UN International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It has been growing bigger every year. As the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs has said:
The concept of Harmony Day grew from the Commonwealth Government's Living in Harmony initiative in 1999 and provides a valuable opportunity for people to celebrate Australia's cultural diversity and stand up against racism.
So whether for Harmony Day this year you are a supporter of Guides New South Wales, a fan of Killing Heidi, a member of the Returned Services League, a member of Scouts Australia or a supporter of Surf Lifesaving Australia, all those diverse groups will be part of the celebration of that diversity on Harmony Day next week.
On the issue of environmental concern, although I am in favour of an increased population for Australia over the next 50 years, I can also acknowledge that resource management is a serious problem, if not an immediate crisis. That is not about holding two opposing views; that is about balance. Our over-reliance on non-renewable energy and inefficient use of renewable resources have to be addressed. Real concerns about our environment should be the driving force for investment in new technology and infrastructure. It is entirely possible that a larger population would, in fact, mean more money to invest in green technology. I want to refer briefly to Minister Kemp's speech at last week's Ian Clunies Ross National Science and Technology Award presentation dinner where he said: 
... there are some very positive signs. Domestic and international demand for `green industries' is high. More Australian businesses and environmental industry customers are adopting a triple bottom line approach and voluntarily taking action to improve their performance—the environment as a business externality is being progressively internalised.
At a recent forum on research setting priorities, Australian scientists nominated the environment and sustainability issues as the top future research priorities. Clearly, there is a strong concern and a need and desire for knowledge.
An OECD study indicates that only half of the environmental technology the world will need in 2015 has been invented. In 40 years time there will be many well-to-do industries that do not exist today.
According to a CSIRO team that has reviewed the findings of the Club of Rome, it has always been a misinterpretation that `adjustment pain' would happen sooner rather than later. The CSIRO says that the club's position was that serious resource scarcity would occur in around 2070. But, clearly, from the blase comments in the press, typified by the one I referred to earlier, many remain to be convinced.
We need to bring together sufficient power and force to really deal with long-term problems that can be resolved only in a series of electoral cycles, not in one government term. One of the most pressing is changing our stock of infrastructure rather than only the invention of new technologies. That is a process that takes decades. The big inertia that holds back progress is the investment of dollars and technology that we currently have in our current infrastructure into new systems to the point that it actually has a real effect on cleaning up air and water.
The last time we had a major population debate in this country was post World War II, and we are all enjoying the legacy of the decision to boost our population through increased immigration 50 years on. The link that is often drawn between environmental damage over that same period and population size many would say is largely spurious. In fact, it is rather a problem that lies in environmental management. While the environment must be a factor in population forecasting, other considerations will also prevail. The effect that population growth has on our economy, the effects of the mix of our refugee, family reunion, skilled migration and general migration streams have on the economy, the issues of internal distribution of our population and international relations are the key issues that should be top of mind in Australia's population debate.
I am interested to note the involvement of Professor Borrie in a population conference to be held in Sydney this coming October. The 1973 Borrie report was the first indication that Australia's ageing population was a cause for concern and that government policy planning should take note of this issue. This had an enormous effect and was one of the things that led to, for example, the introduction of a superannuation system in this country and, in more recent times, many would say, a broad based indirect tax. I will look with great interest at that October demographers' conference because it does have the potential to deliver some real suggestions on population policy rather than just being another talkfest.
It is interesting to note that, since the conference in the late 1940s, we have had countless others which have been important for public airing of opinions and for sharing of information and theories but they have not really reached the sort of agreement that occurred in the 1940s. Since so much time has passed since World War II, it is also important to note that international relations does not seem to be the same sort of dominant consideration, notwithstanding the recently launched war on terror. The most recent Melbourne conference indicated in parts of its communique that there were other factors which they regarded as important to be part of an integrated policy framework. I look forward in this term to continuing to discuss the issue of population policy and exploring other challenges and developments in this area.
