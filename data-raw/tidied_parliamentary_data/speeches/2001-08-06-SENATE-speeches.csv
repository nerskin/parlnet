"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2001-08-06,"—Madam President—
—You've had a haircut.
—Order!
—I have had a haircut? You are very observant, Senator Patterson! I hope you are as observant about my remarks on the bill. In the House of Representatives my colleague the shadow minister for immigration has already indicated that the opposition support the Migration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001. The major provisions of the legislation are as follows. The bill clearly defines the application of the Criminal Code against all offences against migration law. The bill replaces references to certain general offence provisions in the Crimes Act 1914 with reference to the corresponding provisions of the Criminal Code. The bill clarifies the physical and fault elements of offences to facilitate the consistent interpretation of offence provisions. The legislation amends migration legislation to remove unnecessary duplication of the general offence provisions in the Criminal Code and amends certain offence provisions to expressly provide that they are offences of strict liability. If an offence is not expressly stated to be one of strict liability, then the prosecution will be required to prove fault in relation to the physical elements of the offence.
The bill itself is policy neutral and does not create any new strict or absolute liability offences. Because of those principles—and, as I said, my colleague in the lower house the shadow minister Mr Sciacca has already indicated this—the opposition support the bill. We understand that there may be an amendment from the Democrats. We await the arguments from the Democrats on their amendment, but on the information we have received so far we are not disposed to support the Democrat amendment. As I said, the opposition support this bill. We see no reason to delay its progress through the Senate. If the Democrats do have an amendment, we look forward to hearing in the debate what that is. We believe this bill should be supported and proceed forthwith.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-06,"—In speaking on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Migration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001, which amends the Migration Act, this is one of a series of bills which harmonises existing offence provisions with the new Criminal Code. The Democrats have been supportive of this harmonisation process, but we have indicated on a number of occasions that we intend to cast a critical eye over offence provisions that reverse the onus of proof or impose strict or absolute liability. On this occasion we will be moving an amendment to address an onus of proof reversal, and that amendment has been circulated in the chamber.
The provision in question places what is known as a legal or persuasive burden on the defendant to establish his or her innocence. This contrasts with an evidential burden which requires only that the defendant point to evidence which suggests a reasonable possibility that the matters necessary for the defence exist or do not exist, with the prosecution bearing the ultimate burden of proof. The amendment seeks to have this legal burden reduced to an evidential burden.
As a matter of common law, the principle is that the prosecution should always bear the legal burden. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in its 1982 Report on the burden of proof in criminal proceedings, set out well the rationale for this principle: 
The effect of placing a persuasive burden on a defendant is to create the possibility that the person can, and under the law must, be convicted even though the tribunal in fact is left with a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. 
It is a fundamental human right that a citizen not be convicted of a crime until it is proved against him or her beyond a reasonable doubt. Placing the onus of proof upon the prosecution safeguards a fair trial when the full weight of the state, with its considerable financial and human resources, are pitted against an individual. It is sometimes claimed that onus of proof reversals are largely directed at promoting administrative convenience or efficiency and achieving policy goals. In its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Law Institute of Victoria stated in relation to drug offences:
It is clearly the government's opinion, quite possibly backed up by public opinion, that the widest possible legislative trap should be set to catch the culprits, even at the cost of deprivation of common law rights. The difficulty with this reasoning is that emotive issues and matters of convenience are being permitted to take precedence over a system which has long been considered the only fair means by which to try defendants. The effect of a criminal conviction can be devastating and it is for this reason that not only has the onus of proof being placed upon the Crown but an onus which must be discharged by proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
In its joint submission, the New South Wales Bar Association, the Law Society of New South Wales and the Sydney University Law Graduates Association stated:
The use of the presumption of guilt is the result of a lazy attitude in a society which wants to see people, guilty or innocent, punished for alleged wrongs without bothering to ensure the facts establishing guilt are proved beyond reasonable doubt in accordance with long established principles of law.
Turning to the provisions of the legislation itself, item 39 deals with the offence of arranging marriage to obtain permanent residence. A defendant may claim by way of defence that he or she believed on reasonable grounds that the marriage would result in a genuine and continuing marital relationship. Under the bill as it stands, the defendant bears the legal burden of establishing, firstly, that he or she genuinely believed that the marriage would be genuine and continuing and, secondly, that the belief was reasonable in an objective sense. The defence under this section is an adaptation of the general mistake of fact defence, which carries an evidential burden because that is what is appropriate for such defences. There is nothing of substance to distinguish this offence from others that impose a purely evidential burden on the defendant. The maximum penalty for this offence is a $100,000 fine and 10 years imprisonment. 
The crucial point to recognise is that, if the legal burden is imposed on the defendant, he or she may be convicted even though the jury is left with a reasonable doubt as to his or her guilt. In the Democrats' view, this violates fundamental principles of our legal system and there are not appropriate or strong enough reasons for a legal or persuasive burden to be put on the defendant in these circumstances. So we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to change that to the defendant bearing an evidential burden in relation to the matters in that item which will relate to arranging marriages to obtain permanent residence. We believe that that is a more appropriate level of burden in any proceedings on that particular offence and we think that it is more appropriate in this bill. So, while we support the bill as a whole, we will be moving that single amendment in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-06,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 has a lot in common with a number of bills that have come through this chamber setting out crimes that are created within the legislation that particular departments administer. Here we have a bill dealing with migration—legislation administered by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I hope that the bill—I consistently make this remark in this context—does not change the general thrust of what has gone on previously in this area. In other words, I hope that there are no crimes created inadvertently through this legislation. If we presume that there are none, the issue then is whether or not particular offences should be offences of strict liability or ones for which intent has to be proved. 
The problem with strict liability is that a person is guilty of an offence no matter what his or her moral situation is. That is always a problem. Nevertheless, administration of the law would be proved difficult if all matters had to be proved so that an element of intent had to be established. The issue of intent should be established in terms of serious offences. Strict liability offences, where there is no moral element to be proved, ought be confined to matters of administration or matters that lend themselves to that sort of treatment. I hope that that distinction is made clear or has been taken into account in this legislation. I notice that the defence of harbouring is dealt with in this legislation. Item 33 reads as follows: 
Repeal the subsection—
`subsection' being subsection 233(2)—
and substitute:
(2) a person is guilty of an offence if 
(a) the person harbours another person; and 
(b) that other person is an unlawful non-citizen or removee or deportee. 
This goes to the issue that is current at the moment that people who should be outside the country have been, it is alleged, harboured by others. This subsection is directed at those people who do the harbouring. That is a common offence. In other words, if someone escapes from a prison it is an offence for somebody else to harbour him or her. In the old days, say of the English civil war and what have you, people were treated with the greatest severity if they harboured somebody from the wrong side—the wrong side being the side opposite to the one that took the person into custody. 
This provision illustrates the problems we are now facing. The issue of keeping unlawful non-citizens or removees or deportees in custody is becoming more and more difficult. In recent days problems have been thrown up at Villawood. The question arises as to whether the administration of this act is being done as well as it might. Why do we have all these escapes taking place, not only from Villawood but from various institutions around the country? Indeed, I think a couple of them, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, are in your state, which you so well represent. It becomes an issue for us as a parliament to ascertain why this should be happening. 
These detention centres are being run by Australasian Correctional Management, as I understand it, a company largely influenced by the Wackenhut organisation in America. It is a matter of some concern as to why this is taking place. When we first started detaining people who sought asylum—boat people—we did not have this problem. The problem is becoming more acute as time goes by, and I think it is time we had a look at why this is happening. There should be an investigation into the whole area. 
Concern has been expressed about what is happening in the detention centres and about the number of people who are escaping from them. In response to those concerns, the department tends to say, `We have to make the places more secure. That is the issue.' So you start off by having people confined within cyclone wire fences. Then you have to make them more secure, so you add razor wire, which in my day, when I was a lot younger, was considered a very nasty instrument to use to keep people confined, even in prisons like Pentridge. In any event, there is an escalation of the steps taken to secure people in these places. It is time that some inquiry was made as to why this is happening.  
Not only is that happening but there is a growth it seems in the manufacture of offensive weapons for use within these places. Just what is going on? Is the environment established by the camps at Villawood, Curtin and Port Hedland the proper one for people who are going to become Australian citizens later? As I understand it, at the moment most of these people go on to become residents of Australia. Perhaps after three years they become Australian citizens. 
It is not a good thing to bring people, who will be living among us, into the country and then put them behind these very secure fences. This is emphasised in item 33 of the legislation. The situation is at the point where there has to be new legislation brought in to punish those who might give succour to people who escape from these institutions. The people who have escaped are not criminals. They have not been convicted of offences. If they had been convicted of offences they would be in jail. So we have legislation which creates offences. If I wanted to invite you to my house and home, there would be no problem with that. If I wanted to bring in a person who has escaped from jail, who has a criminal conviction, I would be harbouring. But in this situation we have people who are not convicted of any offences—if they get out of a place and they are harboured, the person who harbours them could end up in jail for a considerable period of time.
Not only is there a growth in the number of people escaping from these prisons—which is what they have become: once upon a time we would have called them detention centres but it has gone beyond that now—but we are creating a situation where the number of crimes a person can commit and the severity of the penalty imposed is increasing. The whole thing is beginning to snowball. So we have a situation where new crimes are being created, where new penalties are being imposed, where more and more people are being dragged in to face the music, as it were. Ten years ago this sort of thing was not happening. What is going on in this system? Is that the right way to conduct a program that deals with people coming to our shores?
The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs should look at this. There is a strange attitude in this department. I have had recent experience of this with respect to a person who wants to come here to study. There is a requirement by the department—I think this is in China somewhere—that it take 16 weeks to assess as to whether a person should be brought here as a student. This is a person who wants to study at Melbourne University, an eminent institution, where, may I say, my son Sean lectures in contract, with great aplomb and skill.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—It is obviously hereditary, Senator Cooney.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President.
—On the mother's side!
—What has happened is that the university—
—Respond to that so that it goes into the Hansard for your wife, Barney.
—Yes, I will. Thank you.
—I think she deserves that.
—Yes, she does. You are absolutely right, Senator. My wife is a woman of outstanding ability. As Senator Patterson will tell you, my wife has been a solicitor for over 40 years—the most eminent in Melbourne! The university has its requirements. It wants these people to come to Australia and we want them to come to Australia. Here is a person who will pay thousands of dollars in fees to come to Melbourne University, the pre-eminent intellectual institute in this country, but he is not able to get here on time because the base in China cannot get his visa processed in fewer than 16 weeks. If he wanted to go to England or the United States, it would be much quicker.
—I will give you a briefing on it and tell you why. 
—Thank you. It is, as you would know, Senator Patterson, a matter of some concern. When this matter came to the attention of my office, inquiries were made, and it seems that is the problem. It is very difficult, and you would understand being an eminent academic from Monash—
—You have misread me, Senator Cooney, I am not an academic.
—He is talking to me now.
—I see. Senator Cooney, you should direct your statements through the chair.
—Yes, I should. The fact that you are not an academic, Mr Acting Deputy President, does not in any way detract from your intellect and brilliance; it is just that Senator Patterson has those same qualities but in a more formal, academic fashion. That is how I was putting it. In any event, I am glad that Senator Patterson will brief me on that because it is pretty important. I think it is a concern that there is escalation in terms of the security that we have to impose to keep people where we want them. There is an escalation in the number of crimes. I think it is a pity that, no matter what the area, to secure a position we have to create new crimes. What is innocent conduct today should, in my view, only be made criminal conduct for the most serious of reasons tomorrow. This legislation starts ratcheting up the number and the seriousness of the crimes concerned.  
The general thrust of the bill is simply to give the legal underpinning to the legislation that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs administers by way of a code rather than by way of the common law. As Senator Schacht has indicated, nobody complains about that. There is no opposition to that. If it is the decision that the law be underpinned by code rather than by the common law, so be it. But, in so far as this legislation does what I have complained about—create new crimes and add to the seriousness of the penalties that attach to the crimes—that becomes a very significant issue.
I conclude my remarks on the matter. Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am very eager to hear Senator Patterson answer the issues that have been raised.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2001-08-06,"—I express my wholehearted support of the government for the Migration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001. However, I feel the whole issue of illegal immigration has been bogged down in political correctness and warm and fuzzy garbage. Australia is being dragged kicking and screaming into a globally orchestrated population realignment that is neither of our making nor of our choosing. It is about time to take the reins of our own future, take our destiny back under our own control and no longer play the defenceless player in a global agenda sanctioned by the United Nations.
The unregulated movement of illegals—predominantly boat people—with the covert sanction of the United Nations, together with the active participation of sophisticated transnational criminal groups, is resulting in one of the largest hoaxes ever perpetrated on the Australian people. This has got to stop. The estimated potential worldwide supply of this illegal criminal cargo is upwards of 60-odd million. Australia has seen the increasing trend for these illegals to land on our shores each year, much to the financial and social detriment of all Australian citizens. I emphasise that. Each illegal criminal that lands on our shores takes away from the Australian government's ability to provide social, health and education services for the Australian people. 
This country is noted for its high standard of living, which is not only desirable for our own citizens but also highly attractive to overseas residents. I and the majority of Australians—that is, loyal Australians—have no objection to anyone desiring to better their circumstances and standard of living, but I believe that Australia has taken great exception to the abusive influx of the illegals that we are absorbing and the financial costs created for this country. Obviously the liberality of our immigration laws is of great benefit to—and open to monumental abuse by—not only those with criminal intent but also the criminal instigators of this abominable industry. The potential for future social unrest arising from ethno-national differences between incompatible cultures being forced to amalgamate and expected to live in harmony side by side upon our soil is of great concern. I would be very sad if, in 10 years time, in this wonderful country, we in Australia are facing similar altercations to those that are now predominantly perpetrated between these people in their own countries.
We must ask ourselves whether, under the banner of responsibility that we are entrusted with in this chamber, we have the right to abrogate our responsibility by continuing to do nothing or whether we carry out the designated duty that the Australian people have elected us to carry out—to protect this country from the blatant abuse of our hospitality and resources that is being presently perpetrated upon us and not allow these people to continue to get away with it. A responsible government needs to pursue amendments legislatively and to take action to protect the interests of Australia and its people. It needs to pursue this type of legislation together with the abandonment of any agreements or treaties that are proven to be against our best interests and solely for the benefit of foreign manipulative bodies motivated by purely ulterior motives with no responsibility or requirement to consider the best interests of this country and its people. 
Through my office and through correspondence, I have heard repeatedly the response of the Australian people towards the influx of illegal criminals. Their attitude is that they are far from accepting the abuse that they are expected to cop. These people, through their commonsense approach and their loyalty to Australia, have put forward the following actions that they find need to be undertaken. First, all illegal boats arriving should be stopped from going ashore. Second, boats should be provided with food, water, fuel and medical provisions and then given a Royal Australian Navy escort out of our waters. Should the occasion arise whereby these vehicles are suddenly unable to go any further due to engine disablement, then I, on behalf of the people who have contacted me, pass on the suggestion that they be given a set of oars. 
There is no doubt that the conditions that we have here in Australia are very desirable to those people overseas. I place clearly on record that I have a great compassion for those genuine refugees—and I repeat the word refugees—who go through the process: they go through the internment camps, they wait their turn and they apply to legally enter this country. They, no doubt, like a lot of other people, have some understanding of the benefits of entering Australia.
I would like to focus on some of the facilities that are available in the detention centres. For entertainment, Woomera Detention Centre provides eight televisions, one in each recreation room; an educational complex; three videos; and 10 computers, six of which are educational. There is band equipment for karaoke and there are radio cassettes. These people are provided with 15 copies of the South Australian Advertiser, 15 copies of the Australian, 10 copies of the Arabic El Telegraph and three copies of the Bamdad Weekly. These people are provided with newspapers at the expense of the Australian people. 
Sports equipment is provided for soccer, volleyball, basketball, badminton and table tennis. There is gym equipment and there are weight-lifting machines. These people also have excursions organised. There are three excursions per month from Woomera, involving approximately 160 people. These are the conditions that these people at Woomera are complaining about. I also believe—I have it on reasonably good authority—that the local supermarkets are open out of hours so that these people can purchase the goods that they wish to have. If we look at the health facilities that are provided at Port Hedland, there are two general practitioners. They are available between eight o'clock and six o'clock on weekdays and are on call 24 hours. Six nurses are available, as are psychiatrists, psychologists and dentists. The conditions within these so-called detention centres are considerably better than the Australian people have been made aware of. Recently, I travelled to South Australia but unfortunately I was not granted permission to look at the internal sections of the Woomera Detention Centre. Although I believe that Woomera's remote location is suitable, I believe we should consult with the residents of Woomera in a more forthright manner about their concerns about the proposal for certain detainees to be facilitated within the Woomera housing areas. 
I reiterate my great concern that the illegal criminals coming into Australia are creating an enormous cost burden on the Australian people, taking away from this government's ability to provide services to the elderly by way of nursing homes and impacting on our ability to provide education for our own children. I believe the Australian people have very clearly shown in some of the polls that have been conducted around Australia that they believe these illegal criminals should immediately be sent back to their countries of origin—particularly, I emphasise, those who have come past safe havens; in other words, for those who purposely move past other safe havens between their country of origin and Australia there should be no process of assessment. I believe they should immediately be returned to their place of origin.
My definition of the terminology `immigration' is people who change their place of abode—their homeland, in this case—and legally transfer to a new homeland. That is what immigration means. What we have here is, to a large degree, a clear breach not only of Australian law but also of the laws relating to their homeland, in that a considerable number of those countries have restrictions on the transfer of funds out of the country. For these illegal criminals to be able to pay the smugglers they must have accrued quite large sums of money outside their country, so they are breaking the laws of their own homeland. It is for that reason that I say that they clearly are not illegal immigrants; they are illegal criminals. I commend the government on this bill and look forward to the debate in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2001-08-06,"—As has been said, this bill will make all the necessary amendments to the offence provisions to ensure compliance and consistency with the general principles of the Criminal Code. These amendments will not change the meaning or operation of any offence provisions, and the bill is an important step in a process that will bring greater consistency and clarity to Commonwealth criminal law and will also give Australians greater certainty, protection and confidence under the criminal law.
The debate today on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 has ranged a little wider than the actual topic of the bill. I know that when the Dairy Adjustment Levy Bill used to come into parliament when I was in opposition, I gave passionate speeches about the specialty cheese industry, so I guess I have to sit here and listen to Senators Cooney and Harris stray a little from the actual intent of the bill.
Senator Cooney made some comments about detention, which might be more appropriate in the debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Immigration Detainees) Bill 2001. He also made some comments about the student visa program, particularly the student visa program out of China. I offered to give him a briefing on that.
We have implemented quite extensive changes to the student visa program, in very close consultation with the industry. I visited every university that had prequalified institute status and all other universities that had high numbers of overseas students. We have spent around nine days in meetings with the AIEPB, the Affiliation of International Education Peak Bodies, dealing with this issue. We acknowledge that there is an issue relating to processing student visas in China. For Senator Cooney's information, there has been an increase of over 46 per cent in visas for people from China in the last program year. The problem is that that 46 per cent is also reflected in an increase of about 46 per cent in visa rejections, because of people who come in with fraudulent documentation and incomplete visa applications. So the increase also reflects an increase in visa applications which are not acceptable.
One of our other problems is that we have reached our physical limits in the post in Beijing. Senator Cooney referred to `the strange attitude of the department'. I cannot accept that comment. The officers in the student section of Immigration have worked day and night for nearly two years on the reforms. The officers at posts work extraordinarily hard in processing student visas. For Senator Cooney to say that they have `a strange attitude' is, I think, unfair.
Let me explain what has happened. In China, we have searched and searched for additional space. We thought we had space, and then we found that it did not meet our occupational health and safety requirements: it was not earthquake proof. We have had enormous problems in finding space. One of the things we are now looking to do is to try to preprocess some of the visas back here in Australia. We have worked tirelessly trying to find ways to solve the problem. We have been hamstrung by the fact that we cannot find reasonable and appropriate accommodation in Beijing to house our staff in the manner in which they should be housed—in office space that is safe and secure. We have been dealing with that, while seeing an enormous increase in the market, particularly in China. 
We have seen that increase because we have seen universities and other education providers promoting Australian education, which is now about our eighth largest export earner—about equivalent to wheat and greater than wool. We have been working to find the ways and means to speed up the processing across all posts, but there has been an exponential growth, and we have been limited by physical constraints at the Beijing post. I hope that may explain the situation to Senator Cooney. 
What we have been saying to providers is that they need to get applications in as quickly as possible. We have instituted a prequalified institution program, where institutions deemed to demonstrate that they have worked in the market and that they receive applications which are complete can have their visas processed in 20 days. We introduced that as a pilot scheme, and it has been extended. Those who can demonstrate that they have a record in a particular market—they may be very good in China but not so good in India or vice versa—of having bona fide students who put in applications without fraudulent documents and actually come and comply with the student visa here and either apply for an appropriate visa or return home, can achieve peak qualified institute status and are then guaranteed a 20-day turnaround. 
We have worked to try to achieve that. We have had seminars with all the educational institutions to tell them about the problems we have had with people putting in fraudulent documentation. We have developed a much better working relationship between the department and the education providers. That relationship was not there before. People saw Immigration as some sort of block to people coming in. I would hate there to be any question about the fact that the officers of Immigration are determined to work towards increasing and improving the number of students coming here to study, provided they are bona fide students who intend to come here to study, to comply with the visa conditions—that is, to not work more than 20 hours during term time, to attend their classes and then to return home or to apply for an appropriate visa. That is what the officers of the immigration department are looking for, and that is what I am looking for. We do not always have that. I am quite happy to arrange for the department to give Senator Cooney a briefing on the issues. They are quite complex, and we have been dealing with an enormous increase in the volume of applications.
With regard to what Senator Harris said, I would also like to offer Senator Harris a briefing. He said two things. As for one of them, I regret his emotive reaction. I regret his comment that we are continuing to do nothing. That reflects incredibly badly on senior officers of the department and the minister, who has worked tirelessly with the Chinese, Indonesian and the Cambodian authorities. I happened to be in Cambodia only two weeks ago on a private visit and I met with the minister for the interior. Because of cooperation with Australia and the work of officers from Immigration and Foreign Affairs—in particular Louise Hand, the ambassador—the Cambodians have managed to catch five, I think, of the snakeheads, as they are called there, the people smugglers, the people at the forefront.
That did not happen by chance. That happened because there was enormous cooperation between the Australian and Cambodian authorities, work that has been ongoing. To sit here in this chamber and say that there has been nothing done is nothing short of misrepresenting the facts and fuelling the views of the sort of people who have totally unacceptable and unworkable solutions, like shooting all the people in the boats. That is what I have been told by some people. When I stop and talk to them, I say, `If your sons or daughters were on the patrol boat and they came across a boatload of unauthorised arrivals—children, women and men unarmed—whom are they going to shoot first? The children, so they do not see their parents shot? Always shoot their parents first?' When it is actually put in those terms, they do not think it is such an easy solution. The solution that Senator Harris put forward, to turn the boats around, is an easy one with which to whip up a bit of enthusiasm around the community, but it is not possible to do that.
These simple solutions sound fine, inspire a bit of aggro and whip people up, but a more sensible debate is the debate about this being an international problem and that Australia has had an increase, but nothing like the increase we have seen, for example, in Ireland, whose Prime Minister I talked to when he visited here. Ireland had 4,000 people during the first half of last year, between January and May. Belgium: I have forgotten the population but they have had a significant number. We are talking about tens of thousands. To whip up the argument that it is totally out of control here—an emotive reaction—is not right. It is a problem—it is an international problem—but to say that we have done nothing is nothing short of misrepresenting the facts.
I have a briefing paper which I will offer to give to Senator Harris and which outlines the facts rather than the fiction, and I am happy to have him briefed on what has been done, because to say nothing has been done is nothing short of appalling. We see it as an issue. When I was in Cambodia, those people—257 of them—were being put on a boat. Some children had dysentery. There was not enough water for the people on those boats, and they were going via Indonesia to pick up some more people. Some of those people had been solicited to join those boats. So it is an issue, but it is not the sort of issue that Senator Harris is making it out to be. Again, to say that nothing has been done I find unacceptable, not only because the minister has worked assiduously to address this issue because he believes that people who come here on our refugee program should come in an orderly fashion through the UNHCR. To whip up negative views and indicate that the departmental officers have done nothing is nothing short of unacceptable. They have worked tirelessly in addressing this issue at an international level, cooperating with other countries to reduce the flow of unauthorised arrivals so that we can actually have integrity and we can make decisions about who comes here in cooperation with the UNHCR under our refugee program. I hope that when Senator Harris has had a briefing he will see what has been achieved and may be a little bit more constrained in his comments about the `fact' of the government continuing to do nothing. I will offer him that briefing. I would not normally speak on these issues but I thought both of those remarks had to be commented on even though they were not directly related to the bill. I commend the bill to the chamber. 
Question resolved in the affirmative. 
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-06,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-retirement Commutations) Bill 2000 makes amendments to a number of public service superannuation schemes, including the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Superannuation Scheme, to make arrangements for the payment of the superannuation surcharge—more commonly known as the `superannuation tax'. The changes will allow members of the schemes—
—I hear Senator Kemp chuckling away. There is no reason to laugh, Senator Kemp, when you look at the disgraceful performance of your government on this issue. I think you lost this issue long ago.
—You voted for it.
—We did not vote for it actually—not here anyway. The changes will allow members of the schemes who have taken their pension and been levied with a vicious surcharge debt after retirement to have the debt removed as a lump sum from their entitlement. That enables them to pay the debt as a lump sum, resulting in their pension being reduced over its lifetime to pay for the surcharge debt. I would emphasise that the legislation we are considering does not confer any advantage on public servants or, for that matter, politicians in respect to the payment of the surcharge.
The changes we are considering follow changes made in 1999 to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the regulations under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act that established this measure for the majority of superannuation members. So it needs to be understood that the arrangements being talked about here are already in force for other superannuation funds. There is no special benefit or privilege being conferred on the members of the funds this legislation is considering.
We consider that these changes in themselves are non-controversial, but it needs to be pointed out that the saga of the so-called superannuation surcharge is a long tale of deceit, hard truths, pain, anger, waste and broken promises. This is in fact the next instalment.
—Which you plan to keep.
—Senator Kemp, we have had 15 pieces of legislation on the so-called superannuation surcharge to get us to this point. We have had debates about what a tax is—and Senator Kemp well remembers those, and so does your predecessor, Senator Short, who could never quite come up with a definition in his 18 months in the job—and we have had discussion about whether the government has broken its promises and about the inefficiency in the collection of this tax. In a number of cases, we have witnessed some low income earners having to foot the bill for this superannuation tax. Labor will not be opposing this bill— 
—which is about improving the capacity of certain members affected by the so-called surcharge to pay the so-called surcharge. You will need my help a little later, Senator Abetz, when you are dealing with this bill—you look at the amendments we have got coming along. I remind the parliament of what an inefficient measure this surcharge is. I also note—and I would like everyone in the Senate to note—that this is one of the most inefficient taxes ever designed in world history. I will come to more of that later.
—If the wholesale sales tax is inefficient, Senator Abetz, I am afraid the so-called surcharge takes the record for inefficiency in so-called tax reform. It is often the case, as members of superannuation funds would understand, that a surcharge assessment arrives well after the period in which it was accrued. This is not a problem in itself while you are an active member of a superannuation fund and the trustees can levy it against your entitlement, but when it arrives after you have left the fund the bill still has to be paid. This legislation, once it is passed, will allow the debt to be offset against your ongoing pension instead of your having to face a large once-off bill which you might not have the money to pay for. This will then result in the pension being reduced over its lifetime to pay the surcharge debt, easing the financial burden of payment on those members who are impacted in this way.
The superannuation surcharge was introduced in the 1996 budget. It was in direct breach of the undertaking given by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, of his 1996 election promise not to introduce any new taxes or increase existing taxes. The so-called superannuation surcharge is a direct breach of the promise given by the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the 1996 election. And of course we all remember the `never, ever' promise on the GST. It was alleged that the surcharge would result in greater fairness in the superannuation system. When the surcharge tax was introduced, despite warning after warning from the Labor opposition and a vast number of industry and individual groups in the community about the problems in the application of the surcharge, this government ignored those warnings. And here we are today dealing with the 15th piece of legislation resulting from the surcharge tax.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2001-08-06,"—On 28 June 2001, Senator Ridgeway asked me a question relating to a report by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. I took that question on notice and I now seek leave to incorporate the answer into Hansard.
Leave granted.
The answer read as follows—
Senator Ridgeway asked the Minister representing the Minister Representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 28 June 2001, during Question Time two questions in relation to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Report on Indigenous Funding.
Senator Abetz, the Special Minister of State, has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:
I can confirm that the then Acting Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator the Hon Rod Kemp, and the Minister for Reconciliation and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Affairs, the Hon Phillip Ruddock, MP, received the Commonwealth Grants Commission's Report on Indigenous Funding. 
The Government is currently examining the contents of the Report and does intend to release the Report publicly following this consideration.
The Government is committed to ensuring that indigenous programme funding is delivered on the basis of need.
That is why we set aside $5.7 million over two years to enable the Commonwealth Grants Commission to conduct the inquiry.

That the Senate take note of the document.
I would like to discuss the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business report, Inquiry arising from the Senate estimates hearings of 4-5 June 2000 into matters concerning the Job Network. Much of this issue first arose at the budget estimates, although those observing the experiment of the Job Network would realise that it has a tardy history that goes back somewhat longer. It was at the time of the last budget estimates that I, along with Senator Carr, raised with the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business the issue of Leonie Green and Associates and the placing of people with labour hire companies. I also raised with the department the possibility of people being paid to look for their own job opportunities. You would think that the department—which, in the words of its secretary, Dr Shergold, was suffering `research fatigue'—could emphatically and immediately tell us what was acceptable and what was not acceptable behaviour under the Job Network scheme. As we can see from the interim and then the final report, this has not been the case. 
I did not comment on the interim report when it was tabled in the Senate on the last sitting day of the last session because I wanted an opportunity to digest what was tabled in that report. Unfortunately, we have had to wait for the full report before we have got anything worthy of the departmental inquiry. During the budget estimates we were met with indifferent answers: that it was okay to have a labour hire company attached to a job placement provider and that, as long as the 15 hours of paid employment over a five-day period was met, the department was quite happy to dole out taxpayers' money. Dr Shergold promised to immediately go away and begin an investigation of the allegations and to investigate if any complaints were being received by the department. From that promise we have now received an interim report, as I mentioned, and a final report, which has just been tabled now. 
But what were the results of this investigation? The interim report—all three pages of it—quickly identified that some 200 job matching payments had been claimed for people involved in canvassing for jobs, which is not permitted under the contract. It then went on to state that the department was still investigating whether the work undertaken met the `15 hours over five days' requirement, whether job splitting had taken place and whether unemployed people who had participated in the system gained any real advantage from the experience. Most disturbing was the interim report's admission that the department's own investigation and compliance unit had identified a potential problem with job matching placements at Leonie Green and Associates labour hire company earlier in the year—in February—and had begun an investigation but had failed to bring the investigation to the attention of senior management. 
The final report verifies that a number of claims were illegally met through the Victorian offices of Leonie Green and Associates. Media reports have suggested that some $70,000 has been paid back. The report also states that the work undertaken by unemployed people through the labour hire company, and the conditions under which the work was undertaken, do not `sit well' with contractual requirements and that this area will be an ongoing problem. A number of things in this report do not sit well with me. In particular, the report's recommendations do not in any way seek to understand if the Job Network is subject to wide-ranging rorts or if competitors of Leonie Green and Associates have thought up other schemes that may not be consistent with the spirit of the Job Network contracts or, indeed, might simply be `inappropriate', in the words of the report.  
My understanding of what I asked the department to do in the estimates hearing is that I wanted an investigation of the allegations surrounding Leonie Green and Associates, and I wanted to know whether there were similar practices elsewhere in the network and how widespread those practices were. Sadly, my request has not been met. It appears the report's basic assumption is that the Leonie Green and Associates incident is an isolated one and that the remedy is simply a matter of refining policy to ensure that such misunderstanding of practice does not occur again in the future. 
In the pursuit of administrative refinement, the report makes a number of recommendations of changes to procedures within the department that it hopes will provide, to quote the report, `a high level, independent point of review', which I believe Minister Brough says will be implemented. Recommendation 13 of the final report calls for a fraud and compliance committee to act as a `high level, independent point of review' in the department. This is obviously to ensure that issues under investigation are brought to the departmental head's attention before the next round of estimates. What amuses and concerns me is that the word `independent' is used to describe such a committee. The schedule at the back of the report reveals that everyone on the committee is from the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. There is nothing independent at all about this committee.
One of the opposition's points since the inception of Job Network is that the working of the Job Network should be transparent, to deter rorting, and that there should be an independent agency people can turn to when they have problems with the Job Network. Currently there is only the department. The department is judge and jury and, when the Job Network contracts come around, executioner. This report is the result of a constrained investigation. It does not attempt to find out who in the department should have ensured that issues to do with Leonie Green and Associates were properly investigated. It does not attempt to find out whether there are any other rorts in the Job Network and it definitely does not try to address the fundamental flaws in the Job Network system. 
Let me go briefly to two components of this report that leave me very concerned. At point 11 of the report the inquiry concluded that a significant number of job placements made by Leonie Green and Associates were inappropriate, and in some cases there was evidence of breaches of the contractual obligations. So we have inappropriate cases that are not actually breaches of the contractual arrangements. While the inquiry concluded at point 11 that some of the strategies introduced for job seeker placements were inappropriate under ESC2, others that have come to attention during the inquiry and which appear to meet the letter but not the spirit of the system raise wider issues of policy. These issues of policy are being addressed separately. What of those issues of policy? The report barely covers them. If we go to the conclusion we are told that some emerging practices have highlighted the need to review policy settings and ESC2 conditions, including the code of conduct. 
I would like to know what those emerging practices are and, given what has transpired to date, I think the public needs to know what those emerging practices are. We raised a couple during the Senate estimates in relation to IPA Personnel Pty Ltd and Drake Employment. All we have been told is that the department has not identified any information raising concerns about their use of labour hire companies for placements and that no evidence emerged during the inquiry that suggested any breach of contractual obligations by these two providers. No evidence emerged, but did we look? We should look. After what has arisen in relation to Leonie Green and Associates, we should be looking very carefully. Unfortunately, the government's response has been consistent with its response to the Job Network overall to date. 
This report, as is the case with other investigations, has been severely constrained. If this is the best the department can do in getting to the bottom of the recent crop of Job Network rorts, which have made their way into the media, it is complicit in concealing those rorts which, it appears, will just continue to dwindle out, as the Salvation Army example has done in recent days. In the department's report Job matching: policy revisions of 24 July, which is the policy response to the document I am commenting on, it is claimed that there is no evidence of widespread manipulation of job placements. I assume the department and the minister signed off on the policy revisions but how do they know that there are no other manipulations going on? They have not even justified how Leonie Green and Associates could ask to have job matching placements brought forward in order to `fit' her bulk recruiting exercise. How can she bring forward unemployed people to boost her figures and boost her performance data?

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I rise to speak on the Report on enquiry arising from Senate estimates hearings on 4-5 June 2001 into matters concerning Job Network. The issues in this report were originally pursued through the Senate estimates committee, and Senator Collins has already drawn attention to that. I think it has been a valuable exercise in demonstrating that parliamentary committees do in fact work. It highlights the total inadequacy of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to administer the government programs in these areas. It further highlights just how inadequate the government's philosophy is in regard to these issues. 
I think this whole series of events has to be seen in the context of the government's policy of so-called mutual obligation where it attempts in many ways to punish people who find themselves unemployed and to place upon them, as Mr Abbott has said on many occasions, the onus of responsibility for their dire social circumstances. This is a government that takes the view that poverty and unemployment are the fault of the individual. It is individual failing and not the failing of a social system that produces these economic conditions in which so many Australians live in poverty and in social distress. What is the government's response? It is to set up schemes, such as we have seen with this measure, to provide assistance to particular groups of people whose obvious purpose in life is to provide good news stories. The report says:
... as a result of the meeting between Leonie Green and Associates on 24 January where they provide to the government good news stories ..
This is so they can highlight to the public the government's concern about these issues while, by the same token, involving themselves in shoddy and totally inappropriate behaviour. What we have clearly learned through this report—this was alleged at the Senate committee hearing, and hotly refuted at the time by the department and contemptuously rejected at the time by the senior officers—is the total inappropriateness of the government's administration in this area and of the encouragement that has been given to these Job Network providers, this favoured group, to engage in these sorts of unethical practices through a whole series of meetings throughout this year.
At a provider's breakfast in January this year, we saw the department publicly defend Leonie Green and Associates when allegations were raised about inappropriate behaviour. It felt it was necessary to provide appropriate support to one of its specialists, in fact a favoured group of people. Leonie Green was the chairwoman of a representative group. She is the person who, clearly, has been provided with some assistance by the department and, as I understand it, she has also been provided with advice from the minister's office to the effect that, if numbers can be kept up, special favours will be shown in the next round of contractual arrangements.
We have here a very serious question about the probity of the administration of public policy in this area, not to mention the ethical considerations that are involved whereby people are placed in positions which are clearly, as the minister now acknowledges, job splitting and serial placements. We have seen clear cases of behaviour which demonstrates that the keen interest here is to secure money, and to exploit the circumstances of the unemployed by the provision of minimum work in such a way that one can clearly see the government's ideological program being advanced.
I do not blame Minister Brough so much in this regard. I blame Minister Abbott. He was the one who got out there and promoted this sham. He was the one who got out there and said this was a successful measure because it provided choice. It provided choice for a particular group of Job Network providers to exploit the Commonwealth, to exploit the unemployed. It provided no choice for the poor unfortunate individuals who were caught within the clutches of these organisations. What we heard was Minister Abbott ranting, in his usual ideologically obsessed way, about the failings of individuals and about the capacity of the government to assist failed individuals rather than dealing with the assistance that is needed to provide real options for people. We heard today in the Senate that the government is still trying to cover up this action. While this report is only a first stage—I have no doubt we will return to these issues throughout this parliamentary session—it clearly indicates the department understands now just how they got it wrong. In this report, the department says:
... in the course of the inquiry various practices used by Job Network members have come to our attention. Strategies are in place which indicate an increasing trend for Job Network members to use fees paid under the various contracts, particularly in up-front payments and retainers, to purchase assistance for Job Networks. 
It goes on to say:
... some emerging practices have highlighted the need to review policy settings, including the code of conduct.
We know, in Sir Humphrey speak, that that means they have uncovered a shocking rort, and this government's attention has had to be drawn to it by a Senate committee. It is an appalling failure by the government not to address this serious policy failing. The government stands condemned for its actions. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-06,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
This report, like the one to which Senator Carr and I just spoke, is another example of the Senate estimates committee dredging through the detail of what has been a contemporary public debate about a political issue. There has been much said and written about this government's calling of a royal commission into allegations of violence, intimidation and other criminal activities in the building and construction industry. But to take a step back, and in the words of Canberra Times journalist, Ross Peake:
This is a stunt with pike, worth inestimable points on the political scorecard. 
He described the calling of the royal commission as `an expensive over-reaction'. A clear Senate estimates question whose purpose, again to quote Ross Peake, was to create `a highly choreographed stoush'. He goes on to say:
And that's precisely what Howard wants - ranting and raving by the union movement to demonstrate to middle Australia that it is a dangerous and subversive force.  
He may be fairly close to the point, but only time will tell whether the PM gets his highly choreographed stoush. The government's campaign to get some dirt on the building unions does not commence on day 1 of the royal commission. It started in April, when the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business commissioned a report to provide the political cover for a royal commission into the building industry. This report is the report that the minister sought. It is strange that we cannot get details of precisely what the brief was. We have a government document tabled in the Senate. Through estimates and at other times we have sought the precise detail of what the minister sought in procuring this report from the Employment Advocate. There is simply a void. The Employment Advocate's report does not cover his brief, and so we are not in a position to assess the extent to which he has either been incompetent or had ideological blinkers on in relation to how well he covered the ground on this matter.
What we do know is that Minister Abbott requested a report from the Employment Advocate into practices within the industry—a request that Jonathon Hamberger, Peter Reith's former political adviser, happily complied with. As soon as it was politically expedient, the report was disseminated to the media. Why bother tabling it here? It has already been out there for some considerable time now. It was disseminated to the media, kick-starting the government's campaign for a royal commission. That report, which has now been presented, is the political and intellectual basis for the royal commission. 
I half expected that the government would come forward with something else as well. When I first read this report, I thought to myself, `There goes the likelihood of a royal commission, because there is no intellectual basis to this report and the government will end up being sorely embarrassed if this is what it regards as a suitable quality basis for a royal commission.' Alas, I was deluded. I obviously had higher standards and should not have expected so much of this government. Stepping back again to the debate about the royal commission, this issue —whether the report itself justifies the expense of tens of millions of dollars for a royal commission that is generally agreed to be a politically motivated exercise—is one aspect that has not received enough critical attention within the media. 
This report provides no justification for a royal commission. Regardless of what views you might have as to whether there should be a royal commission, this report in itself does not provide justification. There are many arguments and many issues to be considered beyond this report from the Employment Advocate, but the report from the Employment Advocate in itself is a sore embarrassment. It is a farrago of allegations, innuendo and hearsay. It is bereft of evidence, it is contradictory and it is biased. Had I been the minister and actually observed any Senate estimates when the Employment Advocate was before us, I would not have bothered asking him to provide a report that would be the basis for a royal commission. I can only suggest that the minister had not observed estimates and the Employment Advocate's performance there. 
This report was produced by the most compromised statutory officer currently on the Commonwealth payroll, an ideological warrior who cut his teeth kicking unions as Peter Reith's henchman. Dealing first with the source of the report, the Office of the Employment Advocate, it has long been the case that serious reservations about the performance of that office have been canvassed in this place and many others. The most comprehensive inquiry into the functioning of the Office of the Employment Advocate was conducted by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into the `more jobs, better pay' bill back in 1999. We received numerous documented complaints about the perceived bias of the office. In our report, beginning at page 229, we detailed a dozen of those complaints. Time precludes me from canvassing them here now, but I refer anyone interested to that report. One respected academic, Dr David Peetz, submitted to the committee that there was a clear bias in the operations of an organisation purpose built to promote the use of Australian workplace agreements where they were the preferred tools of deunionising employers. I do not believe that the central problem with the OEA has ever—perhaps can ever—be properly addressed. We concluded that the Office of the Employment Advocate should be abolished. 
Since that report, there have been many other instances of apparent bias or questionable practices on the part of that office brought before Senate committee inquiries and this place. I do not have the time to detail them today. This report is but the latest in a long line of political activism on the part of the office, particularly under the reign of the current advocate. The report itself is rubbish. It is biased, focusing on the activities of unions and all but ignoring the activities of employers in the industry. Employer activities covered but one very brief section of this report. I go back to my earlier point: it is impossible for us to know whether that was a deficit in the minister's brief or whether it was a deficit in the Employment Advocate's report itself. 
The report is lacking in any evidence, relying instead on unsubstantiated allegations and hearsay. It is full of assertions but remarkably lacking in any proof. Even with the data that are provided—for example, the particulars with respect to the number of complaints received by the Office of the Employment Advocate—once you go into the detail of the complaints and try to build up anything meaningful in relation to them, they soon lose their veracity. In answer to a question on notice during the estimates hearings, the Employment Advocate provided more detail about the total number of complaints they had received. Dealing with issues such as coercion in agreement making, very soon the data are about a third of the real impact. One should look at what those complaints relate to. The report says that the central aim is as follows:
During the course of conducting inquiries relating to the building and construction industry, officers of the Office of the Employment Advocate have received a range of information about the industry. In many cases, the Office of the Employment Advocate is unable to assist complainants as the matters raised are outside the OEA's jurisdiction. However, it is often not possible to effectively refer them to other appropriate law enforcement agencies as their matters will simply not be actioned with any priority or at all. 
This is the justification for the royal commission. The OEA asserts that there has been a failure in the policing within the industry by a wide range of government agencies and that, as such, a broader investigation—to use the words of the Employment Advocate—is required. This is a very serious matter. The Employment Advocate has made very serious and damning condemnations of unnamed law enforcement agencies, and that is the sort of thing that should be referred to a royal commission. It is not good enough that an officer such as the Employment Advocate can stand before the Senate and make these unwarranted allegations against our law enforcement agencies without any proof, let alone that they be used by this minister as a basis for a royal commission.",SENATE,"<title>DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT, WORKPLACE RELATIONS AND SMALL BUSINESS: EMPLOYMENT ADVOCATE</title>",<title>Report</title>,Miscellaneous,17,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2001-08-06,"—On the same matter, I draw to the Senate's attention that, if one looks at the broad sweep of Australian history on the question of royal commissions, one can essentially detect that three broad types of royal commissions have been established. There are the ones that surround events—for example, the 1891-92 royal commission in New South Wales into the great strikes of the nineties. That royal commission tried to understand an event after it had occurred. There are the royal commissions into perceived industrial problems. They can result in genuine reform or remedy. There were a string of royal commissions in this category which investigated the working conditions and the safety conditions in the mining industry from the 1920s through to 1946. Then there are the royal commissions that are established for expedient purposes, for short-term political gains. There is no shortage of examples of these. 
One of the common characteristics of these types of royal commissions is that the short-term political advantage usually turns up unexpected long-term political damage for those who have initiated these sorts of inquiries. They have a tendency to produce an explosive mixture, which in fact explodes in the hands of their sponsors. The current example, orchestrated by the Office of the Employment Advocate, is an example of the third category. This is at once a cynical and a devious exercise, and it is appropriate that it reflects the character of the current minister. At a time when the building industry in Melbourne, and this is today, has closed down because of the second death on a work site in four days, we hear nothing from this government about issues such as industrial health and safety. When we have a construction worker who is crushed to death by equipment falling from a crane in bad weather, and another who is crushed to death on another building site, what do we hear from this government? Silence. 
These are the casualties of Mr Abbott's inability to understand the realities of working life and his total incapacity to identify with the most human of emotions and the wish of workers to secure just and equitable work practices. In an industry which has been beset with questions of tax avoidance, a range of financial scams, cost cutting and a deteriorating safety record, what solution do they have other than to resort to the old red herring of intimidation and illegal union activity, in an attempt to divert attention away from the real problems which have been confronting the construction industry in this country?
What is the basis of this royal commission that the government has established? What we have is a series of assertions and statements by the `employer advocate' and well-known defender of workers rights, Jonathan Hamberger. He cobbled it together at short notice for the minister, with scant regard to truth or accuracy. We see from Mr Hamberger's own statements that there has been a rather curious transformation of the evidence, as he calls it. What began as an informal discussion paper put together in 11 days became a letter to the minister, which the minister leaked. The document we saw at the Senate estimates committee had the minister's stamp upon it—his notations were on the side of it—and it was provided to the media. No additional information has been provided in this report which, of course, carries the same date but has a different signature on the back of it. It is now signed by Mr Jonathan Hamberger, the `employer advocate', but the report we saw at the Senate estimates was signed by Mr David Rushton, Senior Legal Manager. 
We saw in that report, despite the best efforts, a series of innuendos and snide assertions that had been collected from various spies and pimps within the industry. We have seen no attempt to disguise the political intent of that report. We heard allegations of bribery, secret commissions, money laundering, use of illegal immigrants, theft and resale of construction equipment, false invoicing and fraud. You would have thought that all of these matters were of such a serious nature that they ought to have been automatically referred to the police. But, according to the Senate estimates evidence, only one case has been referred for legal action. 
Mr David Rushton, the senior legal officer of the Employment Advocate's office, did not feel it necessary to have these matters referred to the police. Surely that counts for something, when one looks at the seriousness of the claims that are being made. This is why I say that there are serious questions about the honesty and integrity of this report. The minister's duplicity can be seen in the inept performance of his paid servant, Mr Hamberger, at the recent Senate estimates, when I put a series of questions to him on these various matters. He said that he was not an independent statutory officer. I asked the question: 
Under what terms aren't you independent, Mr Hamberger?
He said: 
`Independent' is not a technical term of art in this context. I report to the minister; it is not a legal concept. I can actually be directed by the minister, under law, in relation to certain of my functions.  
I asked him:
Are you subject to the directions of the minister? 
He replied:
I am, under the Workplace Relations Act. 
I repeated:
So, in that sense, you are not an independent statutory officer. 
The answer was: 
If you like. 
Senator Collins asked him: 
Mr Hamberger, under what powers did you provide advice in this particular area?
He said:
It was just incidental to my overall functions ... the minister asked for a general report on the issues in the building industry, and it seemed somewhat churlish not to provide such a report.
So there we have it. It started off as nothing really at all—just a favour to a mate. He would try to say it was nothing political, nothing exceptional, nothing really at all. It became a partisan piece of distortion, seeking to provide the minister with spurious grounds for what has now become a royal commission. What we ought to understand here is that Mr Hamberger's obliging behaviour is to be seen for what it is: he has been seeking to provide advice to a government for use through various devices. He is not prepared to actually take any of it to the police, but he is prepared to use it as a vehicle for an assault upon trade unionism in this country and as a political device, as the Prime Minister has said, to make industrial relations the central issue in the forthcoming election.
We will have Petrov all over again. We will have a series of hearings just before the election, and there will be no opportunity for rebuttal and no opportunity for any serious cross-examination. That will all happen after the election. We will get the lurid headlines and we will get, in the government's mind, the short-term political advantage. We have seen the example of the Pakenham meatworkers in Victoria and, with the Abbey Group, we have seen the issues which have gone before the Federal Court, which found against the Employment Advocate for the use of secret tape recordings and various other illegal activities. We have seen all those actions which throw serious doubt upon the capacity of this statutory officer to actually fulfil his functions in a reasonable and objective manner. We now have clear evidence of his complicity in a politically partisan government strategy, by which the government seek to take short-term advantage in the run-up to what they believe to be a dangerously close election for them.
Is it appropriate for a statutory officer to behave in this way? The evidence is overwhelming: I think it is not appropriate. We need to come back to this point: if these matters are as serious as the government alleges, why have they not been referred to the police? As I say, if there is criminal behaviour involved in this union, not one allegation has been levelled against any serving official in the CFMEU. There are a number of matters which have been dealt with by the police, and no prosecutions have been made in those regards. We are entitled to ask what the political motivation of the officers behind this is. Why is Mr Hamberger alleging police incompetence, which seems to be the inference that is being drawn to explain why they have not taken these matters forward? Is he alleging political interference by the law enforcement agencies in this country? That is a very serious matter. Is he, therefore, able to come forward with all honesty and say that he should not have pursued these matters himself through the various Commonwealth law offices? None of that appears to be the case.
We are entitled to ask why it is that this statutory officer has linked himself in such a partisan way to what is quite clearly a shabby political exercise designed to advance the short-term interests of a failing government desperate to hang onto office and prepared to use the livelihoods of working people in this country by attacking their industrial organisations, in an attempt to hang on so as to be able to claw its way back into office for another term. I do not believe Australians will buy that. (Time expired)

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-06,"—We are debating the second reading of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-retirement Commutations) Bill 2000. Before question time I raised a number of issues relating to this legislation. Unfortunately, the legislation for the so-called surcharge, despite Labor's opposition in the Senate, passed through this chamber with the agreement and support of the Australian Democrats. As of August 1996 a superannuation contributions tax was applied to contributions made by or for members with contributions and income of more than $70,000 per annum. Contributions over the threshold attract an additional tax of one per cent per thousand dollars of contributions in excess of $70,000 up to a maximum of 15 per cent in the case of contributions where income and contributions are $85,000 or more. We should note that those figures have been indexed, and I think the current base start rate for the superannuation surcharge is approximately $82,000.
The alleged or stated purpose of the superannuation surcharge tax was to tax higher income earners. In fact, since its introduction, funds and the tax office have found that the collection of this tax is grossly inefficient and has resulted in increased fees and charges for all superannuation fund members regardless of whether or not they personally have to pay the new tax. The reason for this inefficiency is that it levies the superannuation fund for the tax. The fund has to administer this, which costs it money. That increases the administrative costs for the fund and those costs, in most cases, are paid by all fund members regardless of whether or not they have to pay the tax. Even if they are not earning over the minimum cut-off point for the introduction of the tax, they end up having to wear some of the impost. So it does impact on people earning less than the minimum threshold level. 
Another problem with the operation of the tax concerns instances where workers are on a base salary considerably less than the threshold amount yet, because they are earning extra money from overtime or other fringe benefits, they are levied with the surcharge. I had a series of complaints outlined to me by some workers in the mining industry in Rosebery in my home state of Tasmania whose base salary ranges between $50,000 and $60,000. However, if they then add on overtime and other benefits, their remuneration takes them over the minimum threshold point for the payment of the surcharge, which they pay. Their complaint, aside from being concerned about the surcharge, was that the overtime and other payments are not included for the purposes of the superannuation guarantee charge. So they pay the surcharge tax because of the definition of `income' but the definition of `income' for the purposes of superannuation guarantee is different and in fact much lower. So they are receiving superannuation guarantee on a much lower level of income. I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, this would be a common occurrence in the mining industry in Western Australia, and I note with some interest, whilst you are in the chair, that a recent council meeting of the Liberal Party in your home state of Western Australia, I understand, unanimously passed a resolution condemning the surcharge tax and its application.
In addition, some low and middle income earners have been forced to pay the tax because they have not provided their tax file number to their superannuation fund or to the tax office in the required time. That was a potential problem for up to 700,000 workers. People might say that people should phone the tax office and give their tax file number but, unfortunately, many people in the community are not aware that they have to do this, and they are accordingly assessed for the surcharge tax when they earn less than the minimum cut-off point. I understand 66,500 surcharge assessment notices have been issued to these people throughout Australia. Knowing that many of these people would not be required to actually pay the surcharge, the tax office has issued a get out of jail card to some 66,500 people, telling them if they rang and told the tax office their tax file numbers they would be reassessed. I would be interested in knowing the latest statistics on the number of people being assessed for the surcharge who earn less than the threshold level.
All of this only occurred because of the cumbersome vehicle that was devised for the collection and assessment of the surcharge. The government hoped to hide the surcharge by requiring the funds to collect it. I know that was their intention. It was a vain hope to hide the surcharge because certainly in the years since the introduction of this new tax it has become very widely known amongst superannuation fund members that this new surcharge has been applied. As time has gone on, the arguments, which, I might say, I have outlined on many occasions, and concerns that we in the Labor opposition have advanced about the implementation of the surcharge—its iniquitous impact, its costs, the various problems and the complexity—have proved to be justified and correct, but the government have stuck their head in the sand.
—Whatever the contemporary critics say, it just isn't on.
—They have just ignored our criticism, Senator Conroy.
—That is because they say you're `uninformed and ignorant'.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—May I suggest, Senator Conroy and Senator Sherry, that you carry on your private conversation perhaps at a later time.
—All I can say, Senator Conroy, is that we should look at all the evidence about the impact of this surcharge. Mr Acting Deputy President, may I can carry on a personal conversation with you?
—Please, yes; I urge you to do that, Senator Sherry.
—You well know the inequity in Western Australia, and I am sure you were a delegate to the Western Australian Liberal Party state conference that recently unanimously condemned this tax. It is good to see that people like you, Mr Acting Deputy President, are also continuing to highlight the various problems that have occurred as a result of this so-called surcharge.
As I said, it is an extremely cumbersome vehicle; it is a very inefficient tax. This was introduced in 1996 at a time when the Liberal-National Party was arguing that we should have a more efficient tax system. But, according to figures provided to me by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, in its first year this tax cost—wait for it—$190 million to implement and collect. This is to collect a tax that in the first year only raised, I think, about $300 million. It is the world's best example of an inefficient tax, introduced by this government. If you add the fact that the tax office spent $23 million to collect the tax and set up systems to do so in the future and that a further $3.4 million was spent by the Department of Finance and Administration, you end up with $230 million in total costs, both directly through the tax office and indirectly through the superannuation funds, to collect this tax. Reports of these costs have been brushed aside by Australia's longest serving Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, who is responsible for explaining such government successes as the `no GST on high rollers' and why the surcharge is not really a tax. He told the Age back in 1999:
The government always recognised the surcharge would involve some cost to the industry.
Well, it certainly did. 
The government was in the happy situation of knowing that someone else would do its work. This is the government which has made a skill and virtue of offloading its administrative work to others, to which any small business owner who spent January labouring over the BAS, engaged in unpaid tax collection on behalf of the government rather than breach the collection of the tax, and their families can attest. The funds also found that, while they had an increased administrative burden because of the tax, they also had an increase of around 28 per cent in complaints and inquiries arising from the so-called surcharge. So the government managed to outsource the administration and the explanation of the problem to superannuation funds. Notwithstanding all their effort on collection and assessment, the ATO got rather short of its expected revenue. In 1996-97, it issued $454 million worth of notices; it got back only $347 million by 30 June 1998. What a spectacular failure! The expected income in later years, however, has skyrocketed. Why has it skyrocketed? Because the government has extended the base for the calculation of this surcharge by including fringe benefits tax and other related remuneration.
There was an inquiry into the surcharge by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia, and in October 1999 it released the results of that investigation. It stated:
... the surcharge does not deliver well targeted equity. Administrative costs are so high that all fund members, not just those with surchargeable contributions, are adversely affected—survey evidence reveals that most funds spread the administrative costs of the tax across all fund members.
Interestingly, this was a similar recommendation to the one made by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services in its inquiry into the tax. The majority of that committee's members, the Labor opposition and the Australian Democrats—despite having voted for the tax, I think we should note—recommended that `an alternative collection mechanism utilising group certificates be adopted and that the advance instalments system not be adopted'.
In my concluding remarks and in respect to the second reading amendment that is being circulated in the chamber at the moment, the current budget papers give an estimate of forward revenue over the next three years. Included within that estimate of revenue is tax revenue from superannuation. That is fine, but what it does not contain is an estimate of tax revenue from the so-called surcharge. If the government is so proud of this new tax on superannuation, it should disclose what the estimated revenue will be from the so-called surcharge in the forward estimates. It should have been clearly disclosed in the budget papers; it was not disclosed. At estimates, I have asked the Assistant Treasurer to give us the figures in the forward estimates. He has refused to give us those figures. So much for the so-called charter of budget honesty. The government introduced a new tax, apparently very proudly, although with some exceptions, as I have acknowledged—for example, Senator Lightfoot's determined campaign against this vicious new tax. You are not alone, Senator Lightfoot, I must say; there are others who have complained about this tax publicly and in Liberal Party forums.
—Are you going to abolish it?
—You should ask Senator Lightfoot that. He is the one who is putting the complaints forward. If the government is so proud of this new tax, Minister, why won't you tell us what the revenue figures are in the forward estimates? In accordance with the charter of budget honesty, this is a figure that should be disclosed.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Sherry, could I interrupt you to advise that you will be moving an amendment before you sit down?
—Yes, I was intending to do that. I just got to the amendment and I have one minute left. As I have indicated, we will be supporting this legislation, because it is only reasonable that the application of the surcharge on public servants—and, I might say, politicians—should be in line with the options available to everyone else in the community. It does not confer a special benefit on public servants or politicians. I believe that the projected figures in the budget papers for the revenue from this surcharge should be made available, and to that end I will move a second reading amendment. There are a raft of amendments from the Australian Democrats. I move the second reading amendment on sheet 2311: 
At the end of the motion, add:
		“but the Senate:
	(a)	notes that the government:
	(i)	has not disclosed in the 2001 budget papers the projected revenue to be raised in the forward years from the surcharge/tax, but has it hidden in general tax revenue raised from superannuation; and
	(ii)	has failed to disclose the revenue figure at Senate estimates; and
calls on the government to disclose the figures forthwith”.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2001-08-06,"—The purpose of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-retirement Commutations) Bill 2000 is to allow beneficiaries under three Commonwealth superannuation schemes the option of commuting part of their pension in order to pay off a surcharge assessment received after they have ceased to be members of the scheme. It is part of the general untidiness of the surcharge that an assessment can arrive after the year is over and that that surcharge is the personal responsibility of the individual once they have left the fund. This bill allows beneficiaries of the scheme to elect to commute part of their pension to a lump sum specifically to pay off the surcharge assessment they receive after leaving the scheme.
The bill provides two methods for parliamentarians to do this. When a serving parliamentarian attracts a surcharge liability in a particular financial year, the Department of Finance and Administration enters the amount in a surcharge debt account it keeps for the member. Interest is added each year at a 10-year Treasury bond rate, and upon a member's retirement the superannuation trust pays the debt amount to the ATO and reduces the member's benefit accordingly. Alternatively, members can elect to pay off surcharge assessments as they go, with these amounts being credited to their surcharge debt account and the trust forwarding the payments to the ATO. The main point of schedule 1 to this bill is to add a commutation option for payment of surcharge liability where an assessment is received post-retirement. 
This piece of legislation has been fraught with difficulties from day one. Senator Sherry, I thought you said that it was the Democrats that supported the bill, suggesting that the ALP did not. It is my understanding that there was consensus in this place and that we all supported the bill.
—We voted against. I made the call. I remember it well.
—I see. The surcharge legislation, as we all know, is a tax, and the reason it was called a surcharge at the time was that the government did not want to admit to that. I thought the ALP supported it, but we certainly supported it on the basis that it was an equity issue and that high income earners enjoyed very significant tax concessions, so this was a way of reducing the inequities in the system. From our point of view, it was reasonable that high income earners should pay this tax, but we did oppose almost everything else in the bill, including the method of collection and the enormous administrative burden on superannuation funds. Our view is that taxes on superannuation ought to be applied at the time at which they are taken rather than during the process in this way.
When this bill was first presented in the Senate, the Democrats circulated our amendments, and at that stage the government indicated that the amendments were too complex to make a response to, so the bill has come up this month instead of in June. I trust that there has been time for a response in the intervening period. I note Senator Sherry's comments that he has just seen the amendments, but these are almost identical to those that were circulated some eight weeks ago. They provide the same superannuation benefits to same sex couples as those enjoyed by heterosexual couples, and there is very significant discrimination in the area of Commonwealth superannuation schemes. It is not so much the practice in the private sector schemes, but it certainly is in the Public Service, where same sex couples are simply not entitled to the pension which is available to heterosexual couples. We will also again take this opportunity to reform the parliamentary superannuation scheme. We dealt with legislation in the last sitting which preserved benefits until age 55, but again they were only for new parliamentarians: those who were elected at the next election. Even our new senator for Queensland—
—Cherry!
—Cherry!
—Yes, I do know who he is. He made the point at the weekend, before being sworn in, that he will be one of the last to be grandfathered under this scheme and that those who come in at the next election will not be entitled to what he is entitled to. Our amendments will not only pare back the generosity of the parliamentary superannuation scheme, which is what people complain most about, but also see that the preserving of benefits applies to all of us in this place who are making decisions on behalf of those who come after us. Instead of that situation, it will apply to each and every one of us. It will also allow parliamentarians to opt out of the parliamentary super scheme and go into an accumulation scheme similar to the one put forward in legislation by Mr Peter Andren in the lower house. As I said, it winds back the benefits available in the scheme to bring them more in line with the Public Service. We think that is a reasonable approach. I hope that the ALP and the government have had a chance to properly look at the amendments and make an assessment of them in order to be able to support the amendments when we put them up.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (POST-RETIREMENT COMMUTATIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2001-08-06,"—In closing the debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Post-retirement Commutations) Bill 2000, I wish to remind the Senate that the main purpose of the bill is to give retired public servants and parliamentarians the same options for payment of post-retirement surcharge assessments as they have for pre-retirement surcharge assessments. These options will enable the surcharge to be paid from these schemes and pension benefits to be reduced accordingly to take account of that payment. This option has been made available to many state government employees and parliamentarians, and private sector superannuation pension schemes are able to amend their rules to provide similar options for their retired members.
Comments were made by two speakers. I thank them for their contributions. At the end of the day, if the Australian Labor Party want to attack the surcharge, they have to ask themselves, in the unlikely event that they were to win government, whether they would abolish the superannuation surcharge. I interjected that question during Senator Sherry's speech. I know that that was disorderly, but Senator Sherry usually deals with interjections, if he can, as they come across the chamber. On this occasion, there was absolute silence. I think the people of Australia can take that as meaning that, if the Australian Labor Party were to win government, they would not wind back the superannuation surcharge. Recently, in a very good letter to the Advocate—it was not a good letter; part of it was good—Senator Sherry acknowledged that the GST is here to stay. I am sure that Senator Cook would not have approved that letter to the editor. Nevertheless, after all the ranting and raving, Senator Sherry acknowledges that the GST is here to stay.
Similarly, the Australian Labor Party rant and rave against the superannuation surcharge, but guess what? It is here to stay, even if they are elected to government. Who would the surcharge apply to? The superannuation surcharge is a charge of up to 15 per cent levied on the surchargeable employer superannuation contributions of higher income earners. The surcharge is payable if a person's adjusted taxable income for a financial year is greater than the surcharge threshold, which currently is $81,493. You pay the full 15 per cent once your adjusted taxable income is $98,955. You really have to ask yourself: which battlers are the Australian Labor Party trying to look after? It appears to be all those who earn more than $98,000 per annum. They are the battlers to whom the Labor Party are supposedly going to give tax breaks. It is similar to their `pretend' opposition to the GST, saying that it is unfair, and people like Chris Murphy of Econtech analysing the impact of the GST and telling us that it is the poor souls who struggle on $213,000 or more per annum who are disadvantaged by the application of the GST and the new tax system. 
Here we have the Australian Labor Party against our initiatives on the basis that the people the GST hurts are supposedly all the poor struggling souls who earn more than $213,000 per annum and, with this 15 per cent surcharge, all those people who struggle by on $98,955 per annum. I would have thought that is not necessarily the constituency that the Labor Party usually try to play to. They are simply playing to an audience without making any commitment whatsoever to changing the surcharge or the GST—they are both here to stay. You can see what the Labor Party's game is—to try to cause havoc on the way through. If they were in government, not much would be different.
Senator Allison made some comments in relation to the changes that have been made and how they will not affect current sitting members and senators. As I pointed out during debate on the last sitting day, there is now interesting consideration of those matters in the High Court where it could well be argued and sustained that, if you were to take away rights that had accrued, you would in fact be taking away, in the High Court's terms, some property rights which would then be compensable.
—That's what the surcharge did, too.
—No, Senator, that is not a right in the same terms. Nevertheless, if the Australian Democrats are so genuinely concerned, I invite them—I am not sure how many previous Australian Democrat senators have done that; indeed, it will be interesting to see what Senator Woodley does, seeing that he has just retired—to say that this is so unconscionably high that they will pay some of the superannuation surcharge back into general revenue. I invite the Australian people to consider the duplicity of saying that something is immoral but, as it is there, they are going to take full advantage of it. If people oppose it, they should say, `It is terrible and, if ever I'm a beneficiary, I will give that proportion back to the taxpayer, as I believe is appropriate.' Tellingly, not a single member of this parliament has, as I understand it, repaid superannuation after it has accrued to them. So to all those people who like to beat their chest over this issue and say how high and mighty they are, I invite them to put on record, when and if they retire, how much they would pay back to the Australian taxpayer. I daresay that proposition will be met with deathly silence. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate.
Amendment agreed to.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (POST-RETIREMENT COMMUTATIONS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-06,"—I rise to speak on behalf of the Australian Democrats to the Environmental Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, which predominantly amends the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989, includes some amendments to the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 and has a few very minor amendments to some other acts. The amendment to the hazardous waste act is designed to close a loophole that became apparent in 1997 when the prosecution of an unlawful export of computer waste was scrapped because the exporting company had no presence and no assets in Australia. The Democrats welcome this attempt to close the loophole, although we do have some concerns that it does not close it as comprehensively as would be desirable. We have, therefore, circulated a couple of amendments to address that loophole.
The current bill fails to address several situations which one can easily imagine occurring. The new offence provisions in proposed section 40AA of the bill apply only to corporations that purchase hazardous waste; they do not apply to partnerships, individuals or other legally recognised entities. The Democrat amendment aims to ensure that any purchaser of hazardous waste is subject to this new penalty provision, which is the intent contained in it. The current bill requires that the purchasing corporation have a presence in Australia, either as the principal office or as a registered office. The purpose is to ensure that Australia will have jurisdiction over the purchasing corporation in the event of a prosecution for unlawful export of hazardous waste. 
The problem that the provision does not address, in the view of the Democrats, is that a registered office does not mean that the purchasing corporation has any assets which can be recovered in the event of a successful prosecution, and it does not necessarily mean that the purchasing corporation has a director subject to Australian jurisdiction, enabling prosecution under the director liability provisions of section 40B in the current act. The amendments circulated on behalf of the Democrats will ensure that the purchasing entity has a presence in Australia, has assets in Australia and, if it is a corporation, has at least one company officer based in Australia. While the Democrat amendments will further close a loophole that obviously needs closing, we also have a second reading amendment. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“and that the Senate calls on the Government to ratify the Basel Ban Amendment to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, an amendment which would prohibit the export of hazardous wastes from OECD countries to non-OECD countries”.
This second reading amendment addresses a broader and more important issue in relation to the trade in hazardous waste. It is critical to understand that most of the environmental problems associated with the trade in hazardous waste would be avoided if the Basel ban amendment were to come into force. The amendment, agreed to in 1995 by parties to the Basel convention, would eliminate the export of hazardous waste from OECD countries to non-OECD countries—countries that have made it clear that they do not want to be the dumping ground for the world's toxic and hazardous waste. This ban would end what one commentator has called `the age of toxic colonialism'.
Ten years ago a memo was leaked from the World Bank. In that memo, Mr Lawrence Summers, one of the directors the World Bank, argued that underdeveloped countries were `underpolluted' and that from an economic perspective it made good sense—in his words `impeccable logic'—to dump waste in poor countries. It was not only cheaper for the dumping countries but, the logic said, it was also cheaper for the poorer countries because the value of health, environment and life was so much less. The world quite appropriately greeted that memo with horror—a pretty clear statement that this type of crazy logic was not acceptable from civil and civilised countries. Yet Australia's ongoing failure to ratify the Basel ban and implement the ban in the hazardous waste act supports that ideology and that logic. Not only have we taken the low moral ground in relation to an Australian position but we have also engaged in some heavy-handed attempts to convince others to oppose the ban or to subvert it by proposing amendments that would effectively kill it. 
What makes this position even more appalling is that Australia does not currently even have an export trade in hazardous waste. We cannot even argue that a ban would harm those involved in toxic trade. So, instead of taking an ethical position, we have been taking an ideological one—an extreme free trade logic, if you like. One really has to ask what kind of logic it is that says it is okay to dump hazardous waste in countries that have no expertise to handle, store or process the waste and have no resources to deal with the health or environmental effects of the waste. Australia must be responsible for the hazardous waste we produce, which includes its disposal. If we do not want to deal with it in Australia, perhaps we need to become stronger about insisting on reducing the amount we produce. While the Australian Democrats support closing loopholes such as the one that is the subject of this bill, we have to say that closing loopholes while the doors are still open is not good environment practice. 
We will also support the amendments to the Fuel Quality Standards Act. We understand the amendments are intended to ensure that failure of enforcement officials to strictly comply with regulatory requirements, such as labelling of samples, does not become the reason that prosecution cannot proceed. We understand it is intended to strengthen, not weaken, enforcement of the act. We obviously, however, will review the regulations and look at them closely once they are tabled.
I will speak further to my amendment when we get to the committee stage of the debate. In terms of the second reading amendment that I have moved, it is important that the Senate makes a clear statement of belief that the government should enforce our treaty obligations for the control of transboundary movements of toxic wastes and ratify all current amendments to the Basel convention.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I rise to speak on the Environmental Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001 and also the Australian Democrats amendments to the bill. Can I say at this stage that the opposition will support the legislation and also both of the amendments. I will try to canvass some of the points in respect of the amendments in this particular part of the process rather than to get back into them later in the committee stage. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Hazardous Waste (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1989, to amend the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 and to make minor machinery changes to other portfolio legislation. 
Amendments to the hazardous waste act will ensure that Australian companies cannot use a current loophole that allows them to avoid the act's requirement by selling hazardous waste to foreign companies. Amendments will make it an offence to sell such waste to a foreign company unless an export permit is in force. Other amendments to the hazardous waste act will allow ministerial orders to be made in a more effective and appropriate manner in incidents of this kind. They will also deal with administrative matters such as clarifying the definition of hazardous wastes. We believe that these amendments to the act are an improvement on the existing legislation in the sense that it bans or stops the export of waste to any overseas corporation that does not have an existing permit and registered office in Australia. However, it does not take into account partnerships or individuals, and there are concerns that the loophole has not been completely closed through this amendment. The Australian Democrat amendment goes some way towards rectifying this problem, and it is for that reason we support that amendment.
Although we do get an improvement in the legislation, we believe the legislation does not go far enough. Many of the most significant environmental implications of hazardous waste trade would be avoided if Australia ratified the Basel ban amendment, decision III/I of the Basel convention, which prohibits the export of hazardous waste from OECD countries to non-OECD countries. The government has failed consistently to ratify this treaty. This is another one of those international agreements where Australia is dragging the chain and where Australia needs to act. There is virtually no trade in hazardous waste to non-OECD countries from Australia. Therefore, there is no reason not to progress the amendment decision through Australia's treaty making processes. For that reason, we will support the Australian Democrat second reading amendment, which does urge Australia to ratify the Basel convention. 
I note here that, in 1992 on winning government, we signed the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal. Our commitment to this international instrument extends to more recent developments. Our platform for the 1998 election stated:
Labor in government will: 
·	ratify and enforce our treaty obligations banning the export and transboundary movements of toxic waste and will ratify all current amendments to the Convention including the Basel Ban.
This amendment has been open for ratification since late 1996. Currently 25 countries have ratified it, and there is no reason why Australia cannot do the same.
This bill also makes further amendments to the Fuel Quality Standards Act. Overall, Labor supports the act and considers it a positive step towards greater protection of the environment and of human health. Indeed, we supported the passage of the act with significant amendments some time ago. But we are still waiting for the government to introduce standards that deliver the full potential of the legislation. In 1997 a government study estimated the cost of deaths associated with fine particles, one of the many air pollutants to which most Australians are subjected to daily, to be at least $3.7 billion a year. This is indeed a serious health issue. It is an issue of concern to many Australians. Public opinion surveys consistently show that air pollution is the No. 1 environmental issue of concern to urban Australians. 
The amendments to the Fuel Quality Standards Act that are before us today are primarily concerned with the analysis of fuel samples and evidentiary matters in relation to such samples. The amendments propose a number of technical proposals that go to certificates and what is admissible as prima facie evidence. These amendments protect the rights of defendants to have reasonable notice but they do tighten the legislation. We support them for that reason. As I said, Labor supports the bill. It is an improvement on the status quo. However, we also support the Australian Democrats as an indication of our support for more force to be given to the legislation. It is one of those pieces of legislation that in government we will have to revisit to ensure that the Basel convention is not only ratified but also implemented in its full sense. ",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2001-08-06,"—I thank honourable senators who have participated in the debate. The only issue at this stage is Senator Bartlett's proposed second reading amendment in relation to the Basel ban amendment. I recall that I have answered questions on this before in the Senate, but not for a long time. I will very briefly reiterate the Australian government position on the ban amendment, which I think was the position we inherited from the previous government. In any event, as honourable senators will know, we have expressed reservations about the Basel ban amendment which would ban all exports of hazardous waste from parties listed in annex VII to all countries not so listed. We were among those countries who said at COP5 that the criteria used to assign state parties to annex VII should be based on the extent to which parties had the necessary technological expertise to ensure environmentally sound management. The parties had already decided in February 1998 in decision IV/8 to explore issues relating to annex VII through a detailed and documented analysis. I gather that is taking place but that progress has been slow and difficult, and a consultant was not engaged until August of last year to undertake a major part of it. So what is occurring is that the parties are continuing this exploration of the issues attached to assigning state parties.
On that basis, it is still the Australian position that we will not consider ratification of the Basel ban amendment until analysis of issues relating to annex VII has been completed to our satisfaction. However, in an Australian context, it is worth reminding the Senate that Australia already has strict legislation which prohibits exports of hazardous waste to countries which do not consent to their input or in circumstances where the environment minister is not satisfied that the waste will be managed in an environmentally sound manner. I am suggesting that, in relation to any export from Australia, if the concern is the incapacity of a developing country to properly manage such waste, it should not be an issue because the Australian government, through its minister, has a specific obligation to consider the capability of the recipient country. In relation to the ratification of the amendment itself, we are one of a number of countries that are still exploring all issues through a process that has been agreed and is currently being implemented.
Amendment agreed to.
Original question, as amended, resolved in the affirmative.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2001</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2001-08-06,"—The Senate has addressed issues to do with the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 many times and in many different forms. I thought that on this occasion it would be useful to reflect on precisely what we are dealing with, and to take a moment to pause in this debate and consider the lives of the people that we are considering in legislation of this type. Work is a fundamentally important part of life. After our primary relationships, be they with our parents, our partners or our children, there is no more important relationship in our lives than the relationship with our workplace. A job provides us with an income, of course, and that is crucial to our wellbeing. But a job does much more than that. `What do you do?' must be the most common question answered in any conversation. `I am a politician', `I am a union official', `I am a social worker'—our whole sense of identity and self-respect, our sense of fundamental worth and the way we define our role in the world are most often derived through our work.  
When this is taken away from us and we are told that our services are no longer required, we can lose all of these things, both material and intangible, that work provides. It has either happened to you or it has happened to somebody you know, and the results can be devastating. Economic insecurity, personal instability and a loss of self-esteem are often the result. It is hard to feel good about yourself when you do not know how you are going to feed your kids. Given this, it would be simply cruel to allow the power to dismiss a worker to be unfettered, to allow it to be exercised by a whim of the employer rather than for good reason. No civilised society should allow that, and most civilised societies do not. But this government, in all its wisdom, thinks that an unfettered approach is okay. They may claim that that is not the case, but that is exactly the effect of proposals such as the exemption for small business and some other elements in this bill that I will come to later.
In all important aspects, this bill is about taking away the rights of workers to contest dismissals when they are unfair and unjust and about giving unfettered discretion to an employer to dismiss. This legislation is about stacking the decks in favour of employers who do the wrong thing—employers who do the wrong thing, let us be clear—and it is about making it tougher for an unfairly dismissed employee to pursue a remedy, by putting up blocks in the path to justice.
In reflecting on the justification for this legislation, the first issue is to see whether there is any need for it, as it is in analysing any legislation. Surprisingly, the industrial relations legislation put forth by this government often fails this most basic test, because often an ideological cause rather than a fact is being dealt with. That again is the case here.
These issues have been covered many times in many other debates on the termination of employment or unfair dismissals. Yet again, the purported justification for this legislation has been trotted out as being that it will create more jobs. This myth has been trotted out pretty much every time that the minister has uttered a word on the subject of unfair dismissals. I will not bother quoting examples on this occasion, because I think this issue has been done to death. It travels down from the Prime Minister to Minister Reith and also even to other government senators in committee hearings, and yet, in all these years, the government has not come up with one skerrick of evidence to support such an assertion.
The only factual basis we have to challenge that is the case of Queensland, where legislation was introduced and then removed, with no impact on jobs. All the government does is throw around a figure of 50,000 new jobs. `On what basis?' we ask: it was a figure plucked out of the air by Mr Rob Bastian, the head of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA. Mr Bastian admitted, under questioning from Senator Murray during a Senate hearing, that he had no scientific basis for the figure; rather, it was his extrapolation, calculated from unsolicited off-the-cuff comments by businesspeople contacting COSBOA telemarketers. As it happens, there is some evidence that completely refutes Mr Bastian's assessment. We have many times revisited the Australian workplace industrial relations survey conducted in 1995. Unfortunately, for something more recent, we are still waiting for a commitment from this government to again conduct comprehensive workplace research.
Unlike Mr Bastian's guess, the AWIR surveys are the product of proper statistical methods and a large sample—much larger than one person. We have referred to these statistics on many occasions, and I will not revisit them again now. The most relevant piece of the AWIR 1995 survey, which, strangely enough, was unpublished by the government—although it was reported in an ACCIRT reference—was a survey into reasons for not recruiting employees during the previous 12 months. In that survey, only 0.9 per cent of respondents nominated that they had not recruited employees due to unfair dismissal legislation.
Senator Murray has also referred to this material on a number of occasions. In the conclusion to the last report on this matter, he concluded that many of small business employee relationship problems continue to be those related to owner manager skills, to training and to experience in managing people, rather than those related to the legislation covering termination of employment. 
The coalition have been relying on Mr Bastian's guessing abilities ever since he first uttered his unfortunate comment, which I think he regrets. They have even managed to embarrass him in the process, so much so that a few months back, at the end of the last session when we were originally expecting to be dealing with this bill, he completely distanced himself from the government's use of this guess.
—Do you mean your copious notes are not up to date?
—I am sure that the senator is familiar with the tradition for second reading speeches. The Australian Financial Review reported the following:
At one point, Mr Bastian concedes he was on the nose with Labor. But he says this was a result of remarks he made about the number of jobs that would be created if unfair dismissal laws were introduced. He claimed the comments were taken out of context by the then Workplace Relations Minister, Mr Peter Reith.
So right back to the source: he is being quoted out of context. There you have it: the argument most relied on by the government in support of its claims for bills relating to termination of employment is, in fact, the result of poor Mr Bastian being verballed by Mr Reith. 
The great irony of all these theoretical arguments and survey results is that we do not even need to rely on them to consider the merit of this bill. As I mentioned, when the coalition government in Queensland did introduce an exemption similar to the one sought here for small business—or slightly different ones to those contained in this bill but still picking up the theme of what is sought by this government for small business—it had no impact on employment rates at all. Yet this bill is still premised on the basis that it will create employment.
These proposals, which seek to benefit small business at the expense of workers' rights, are unfair and are part of the government's crusade in support of its view that small business cannot be expected to meet reasonable standards of fairness towards employees. Going back to Senator Murray's point, their management standards, skills and training are often the important factors here, not their need to be exempted from applying fair standards.
On the one valid empirical analysis of the causes why employers are not employing, a minuscule proportion of employers would point to unfair dismissal provisions. Essentially, that is the lack of justification for this bill. Now let us turn to the proposed cure for the non-existent illness. As I said earlier, the provisions of this bill fall into two broad categories, those that take away the right to pursue an unfair dismissal and those that make the pursuit of that right more difficult. As for those you could categorise as taking away rights, this bill contains a number of provisions that reduce the number of eligible employees who can claim for unfair dismissal. Going back to the small business area, this government's particular obsession, there is a provision that, in determining whether a dismissal is unfair, the commission should give regard to the size of the employer's workplace. This is a different way of achieving an exemption for small business from unfair dismissal provisions. Minister Reith has been tilting at his windmill for years with no success.
This provision implies that small businesses cannot be expected to carry out fair procedures in the termination of employment. The problem with such a provision is twofold. Firstly, it completely ignores the fundamental principle that laws should be applied equally to all. We do not excuse small businesses from having to collect the GST, for instance, and to fill out the business activity statement; they are not excused from paying Workcare or Workcover. So there is no rational justification for excusing them from the need to act fairly in dismissing employees. All this indicates is the attitude of this government to sacking employees: it is not important enough as an area for justice to be applied equally. The second point follows from the first. If you do not check unfair dismissals in this area, it will be abused. Again, in the words of the then minister back in 1996:
Let us face it: from time to time some employers will do the wrong thing. They will get no truck from us. There ought to be in place a system to properly safeguard the interests of employees. 
Otherwise, they can wait four years, by which time doing the wrong thing will be made a badge of honour by the government. It is not the interests of all employees that they are concerned about:
We are prepared to make exemptions if you happen to work for a small business.
Another amendment in the bill in this first category seeks to provide that a determination on the grounds of operational requirements is taken not to be harsh, unjust or unreasonable. This would exclude all employees terminated allegedly for redundancy whether or not the circumstances were fair to that employee. A redundancy typically involves two decisions: first, that the retrenchments will be made and, second, which employees will have their employment terminated. If the second decision is made on the grounds that are unfair, an employee should have a right to a remedy. Again, this is an invitation for exploitation.
The following are examples of provisions in the bill which curtail workers' rights, the second category. With respect to independent contractors, proposed new subsection 170CD(1A) has the effect of excluding independent contractors from a remedy if they are unfairly terminated. There is monumental hypocrisy in the government's position on this issue: they are happy to treat independent contractors as employees for taxation purposes but they are not so keen to provide them with any of the benefits of being an employee, like protection from harsh, unjust or unfair dismissal. In another area, the demotion of employees, proposed new subsection 170CD(1B) excludes employees who are unfairly demoted from claiming a remedy even though the demotion also involved a wage decrease, albeit not a significant decrease, and in effect amounted to a termination of employment.
In the next area, applications out of time, proposed new subsection 170CE(8A) narrows the criteria to be considered by the commission in deciding an application for extension of time for lodging an unfair dismissal application. This has the effect of changing the current test for accepting applications lodged out of time `from requiring the commission to assess whether it would be unfair not to do so' to `it would be equitable to accept the application'. This in effect reverses the current burden of proof and flies in the face of hundreds of years of common law principles. 
Another area is conciliation certificates. In the words of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, this bill attempts to discourage the pursuit of unmeritorious claims `which are designed to put pressure on the other party'. The principal way they seek to achieve this in this bill is by discouraging an employee from proceeding with an application if, at the conciliation stage, the commission thinks they might not have a reasonable chance of success. This sounds, on the face of it, fair and reasonable but only if you have no idea of what unfair dismissal conciliation is and does.
Conciliation is not a fact finding exercise: the evidence is not presented, it is not explored and it is not weighed. The two parties or their representatives sit at a table with the commissioner and each tells their side of the story. Some commissioners ask questions; some do not. Some commissioners actively try to settle the dispute; others leave it up to the parties. What is consistent is this: no common law country would allow someone's legal rights to be determined by the unsworn evidence and untested witnesses that this process relies on. It is a good way to get the ball rolling for a settlement, but that is about it. The employer representatives who appeared before the Senate inquiry into this bill were divided on the merits of this proposal. The best argument against it actually came from the Australian Industry Group, who pointed out that these proposals were more likely to frustrate the process than to assist it, and the reason why is simple: 
If you raise the importance of the conciliation process, if you raise the stakes, the parties will have to put a similar amount of time, effort and energy into that that they put into the trial.
I think the ACTU put it best in their evidence to the committee where they said:
These provisions will have the effect of transforming initial conciliation proceedings into minihearings, rather than genuine opportunities for the parties to reach agreement and avoid litigation. With the right to arbitrate at stake, applicants will have no choice other than to put their evidence before the commission and insist that the proceedings be conducted in a judicial manner. This provision will have the perverse effect of completely destroying the very benefits that a conciliation process provides.
Another area is contingency fees. One of the more bizarre proposals in this bill is that representatives acting on behalf of the applicant, the worker, must disclose if they are acting pursuant to a contingency fee arrangement. This is bizarre for two reasons. Firstly, there is no other jurisdiction in this country that requires such a criterion—not one other. This is a Minister Reith experiment. Secondly, it has no apparent purpose and certainly no justifiable purpose. The only possible effect it will have is to prejudice the consideration of a case if the commissioner is the one who might be disposed against contingency fees.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
—When we broke for dinner, I was dealing with contingency fees and making the point that there is no other jurisdiction in the country that has such a requirement and that I do not really think that this is the area to start such an experiment. In many respects, the effect could be quite prejudicial on cases. There will be a few questions when we get to the committee stage about how such situations, as proposed in the Democrats' amendments, might be avoided. It is also interesting to note that the government's bill does not have a similar provision for the defendant, although I understand that the Democrats are seeking to rectify that.
The other main area I want to cover is that advisers are not to encourage applicants to make or pursue certain applications. That provision would impose a fine on a lawyer, agent or union official if they encourage an employee to make or pursue an unfair termination application if, on the facts that have been disclosed or that ought reasonably to be have been apparent to the adviser, the adviser should have been or should have become aware that there was no reasonable prospect of success in respect of that application. If this proposal were to pass the Senate, it would create the remarkable situation where an applicant could be ordered to pay the costs of the defendant and, on top of that, their adviser to pay a court imposed penalty. There is no good reason for this. The only justification provided by the government—that it will discourage speculative and unmeritorious claims—is barren justification. There already is a provision in the act that punishes an applicant and, if they are subject to bad advice, they can take action through law societies or at common law. Again, with respect to termination of employment law, I think this is not an area that we should be applying such experiments. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my remarks. (Time expired)
Leave granted.
The speech read as follows—
Other amendments will prevent the Commission and the Federal Court from including in any damages amount, a component by way of compensation for shock, distress, humiliation, or other analogous hurt, caused by the manner in which the employee's employment was terminated; confer express power on the Commission to dismiss an application in respect of a termination of employment if the applicant fails to attend a proceeding; confer power on the Commission to require an applicant to lodge an amount as security for any costs that might be awarded against him or her.
It is difficult to see how the proposed amendments creates “.. a system to properly safeguard the interests of employees” as alleged by Reith when he was in Opposition. (Hansard, MPI 31/5/95)
International Obligations
Australia is a signatory to the International Labour Organisation's Convention concerning the Termination of Employment at the Initiative of the Employer.
This forms Schedule 10 to the Workplace Relations Act 1996.
Article 7 of the Convention requires an employee to be provided with an “opportunity to defend himself (sic) against the allegations made” in relation to “conduct” or “performance”.
There is no exception in the Convention to exclude an employee the opportunity to defend themselves for operational reasons, unless in exceptional circumstances, as proposed by this Bill.
The proposed amendment in the Bill is contrary to Australia's international treaty obligations.
Conclusion
During the course of the Senate Inquiry into the `More Jobs, Better Pay' Bill, Labor rejected the provisions of the Bill relating to unfair dismissal on the basis that: -
“Labor senators agree with these criticisms by practitioner and community organisations of the ways in which the proposed amendments act to limit and obstruct access to fair and affordable remedies against unfair and unlawful dismissal. Taken together, these proposals would:
cut off claimants from sources of financial and legal support, 
force them to represent and defend their own interests,
make the system more complicated,
make settlement more legalistic, and
tilt the balance of influence in unfair dismissal cases squarely and thoroughly on the side of the employer. For these reasons, Labor senators oppose the amendments.”
I oppose these amendments for those reasons then, and I oppose them for the same reasons now.
And a final note to the Government: even COSBOA is moving on from this outdated and pig-headed approach—one of Mr Bastian's contributions before a Senate inquiry on these matters was to say this to all of us: “try to redefine the debate”, in other words, move on.
This Government would do well to listen, instead of trotting out the same old proposals time and again.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2001-08-06,"—I rise to address the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000, which I think is one of either 13 or 14 workplace relations bills racked up in the ether, waiting to be dealt with in this place. Prior to 1993, state tribunals dealt with unfair dismissals, with workers having to show that the dismissal was harsh, unfair or unjust in order to obtain relief. There were few, if any, calls for the abolition of these essential rights of workers. In 1993, Victoria's Kennett coalition government moved to significantly lessen access and relief for unfair dismissal. In response, the federal Labor government moved to override the Kennett legislation using the external affairs power. To access the external affairs power, the federal Labor government needed to stick very closely to the terms of ILO Convention No. 158, which holds that an employer must have `a valid reason' for dismissing an employee. This introduced a large number of procedural requirements and a more complex jurisdiction than the old state laws. Employers strongly opposed the provisions because of the change in onus. An unintended effect of the employers' high profile campaign was to massively raise worker awareness about their rights to challenge unfair dismissal, with a consequent higher increase in applications for reinstatement.
During the 1996 election, the coalition promised to replace Labor's laws with `a fair go all round' for employers and employees. While little detail was provided at that stage, it was clear that all workers would have access to the regime and that the test for unfair dismissal would be closer to the pre-1993 rules. The Democrats, prior to the election and since, supported the coalition's policy direction. During the election campaign, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA, asked the coalition, the Democrats and the ALP to support an exemption for small business. It is worth remembering that all three parties—the coalition, the Democrats and the ALP—refused to support an exemption for small business in 1996 on the basis that it would breach the fair go all round approach. The Workplace Relations Act subsequently passed through the Senate in 1996 with the Democrats' support, implementing the fair go all round approach. The unfair dismissal regime contained in the Workplace Relations Act 1996 relied mostly on the corporations power, rather than the external affairs power relied on by Labor under the 1993 legislation, and that allowed the act to avoid the procedural difficulties of the ILO convention.
It is worth reminding ourselves what the key changes were on unfair dismissals by the Workplace Relations Act 1996. They were: firstly, a change in the onus of proof; secondly, hearings to be in the commission; thirdly, costs may be awarded against employees; fourthly, an application fee to apply; fifthly, viability of an employer was to be taken into account in damages; sixthly, procedural fairness not to be a mandatory requirement; seventhly, probationary employees were excluded; eighthly, for casual employees the exemption was extended; ninthly, specified term contracts exemptions were excluded; and, tenthly, state systems were reinstated. It is a fact that two-thirds of all unfair dismissal applications are under state law and only one-third of all unfair dismissal applications concern small business.
To give you an idea of the effect of the changes of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 on federal unfair dismissal cases, the total for Australia in 1996 was 15,083—a big escalation on 1995, which was 10,736. So it really was accelerating at a very rapid rate. That is the important point to remember: that trend was reversed. For the year 2000, the total number of unfair dismissal cases in Australia dropped from 15,083 to 7,680. In the ACT—which was, both before and after, under federal legislation—the drop was more modest but, nevertheless, was very clear. It dropped from 536 in 1996 to 236 in the year 2000. Another jurisdiction which was federal both before and after the change was the Northern Territory, where it dropped from 407 in 1996 to 307 in the year 2000. 
One of those jurisdictions, though, which remained very high was Victoria, which was 6,169 in 1996 and in the year 2000 was 4,606. In my own state of Western Australia, the drop was dramatic: in 1996 it was 1,849 and in the year 2000 it was 401. So, even in a state where Richard Court's coalition ruled, the almost automatic direction that business went for unfair dismissal applications was state not federal, and that is because of the nature of the legislation and of business itself. I have found, throughout an analysis of this area over a number of years, that small businesses in particular, but businesses generally, are universally ignorant as to whether they fall under state or federal legislation—with regard to this area, anyway—which is to be expected. The issue of unfair dismissals is another sound reason for one of two remedies: either to get rid of the states altogether—no bites from the senators here on that one—or, secondly, to introduce just one industrial relations law or workplace relations law for the entire country.
However, the coalition discovered that this was an awfully popular drum to beat and introduced a number of bills and regulations over time to deal with this issue. One of those was the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998, which attempted to attack this area as well. In the exploration of those issues, something became very clear to me which probably should have been clearer before—that is, businesses regard it as an essential right of theirs to hire and fire at will. For many businesses, if there was one unfair dismissal application, that is one too many. That basic philosophical difference between the political parties which prevail in the Senate and most businesses and business organisations has to be clearly acknowledged. There is an underlying desire by businesses for power over employees. Against that, we need to reinforce the rule of law, natural justice and human rights in employment relationships. Whenever it gets a bit testy and vested interests loom large in this place or people exaggerate the issues, we need to come back to the objective role that we have as legislators, and that is to ensure that those essential issues of the rule of law, of natural justice and of human rights in employment legislation are protected by legislators. We remain strongly of the opinion that the historical record and the current practice of employee termination by numbers of businesses are such that it remains necessary to provide an accessible and workable remedy quicker and cheaper than the courts to redress unacceptable dismissal behaviour. 
That does not mean to say that we do not recognise that there are problems in terms of process, time or cost or in terms of fairness. In a letter to Senator Jeannie Ferris from the Australian Small Business Association which was tabled in the Senate at that time in 1998, Mr Siekmann said that fairness in the legislation is not the principal problem; the fairness of the legal system is. In other words, it is how the law is dealt with that needs a bit of tweaking and adjustment. It is for that reason that the Democrats are keen to view this legislation in a positive light, although in many respects we intend to gut it and divert its direction in a number of areas.
We think that the nature of unfair dismissal legislation should not be affected unduly by exaggerated claims about its job creating or job inhibiting characteristics. Senator Collins, in her second reading remarks, covered this area to some extent. If there is anything which has really damaged this area of assessment, it is this area of exaggerating either the detrimental or the positive effects of particular policies proposed. 
Again referring to the review in 1998: in submission No. 12 from the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the witness concerned put the problem that the Senate must always address in this area in a nutshell. He said:
It is too great a risk to forgo actual existing rights (which have a moral underpinning to them) based on a highly hypothetical premise that there might be an economic benefit.
We always have to remember in this place that what Senator Lees just referred to as the `three legs of policy' need to be attended to—that is, the three legs which comprise economic, environmental and social concerns. Human rights and issues of fairness have a value in themselves over and above their economic consequences.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 was introduced 14 months ago, in June 2000. It contains slightly reworked provisions from one schedule of the 18 in the omnibus third wave More Jobs Better Pay 1999 bill we rejected outright. I refer to it as the third wave because the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 was the first wave, the Workplace Relations Act 1996 the second wave and the More Jobs Better Pay bill the third wave. This bill aims to streamline unfair dismissal procedures, to reduce costs and to prevent lawyers in particular unfairly prolonging proceedings. As an aside, although he writes in a somewhat idiosyncratic manner at times, whenever I think about lawyers who do things unfairly I think of Evan Whitton's writings and the sins of lawyers to which he likes to point. Of course, not all lawyers are sinful and not all lawyers are unfair. I know many who are great pillars of both justice and of our community. But where it occurs we need to address process issues.
In my extensive February 1999 minority report to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 I took the opportunity to highlight some legitimate concerns we had in relation to process, time and cost of unfair dismissals and the need for the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to be amended. Minister Peter Reith drew on those concerns and included them in his More Jobs Better Pay bill, but in my view he twisted them to a much more substantial watering down of access to arbitration of unfair dismissal claims than I ever intended.
Simply put, we take the view that there is a problem with the unfair dismissal system in that too many employers are effectively forced to pay hush money during the conciliation phase in respect of unmeritorious cases. Part of that is driven by contingency fee based lawyers, and there are technical and process areas that are abused. We also take the view that numbers of employees are oppressed by the same types of legal tactics. An employee in the lower order of wage earners who does not have much financial capital or reserves and who desperately needs to get on with another job cannot easily withstand even a couple of months of legalised dillydallying provoked by the employer and by his or her advisers. So on both sides of the coin employers can be disadvantaged and employees can be oppressed.
For a number of years we have consistently been on the record as saying that, while we will never give way on the right to unfair dismissal protection, we will support sensible and fair improvements to process, time and cost issues. I have personally been subject to a great deal of attack simply because we will not give way on this issue of rights. We will not and, for as long as I am in the Senate, I will not. It just will not happen.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 is not quite as harsh as Minister Peter Reith's 1998 proposals, but we still feel it needs considerable amendment. We still cannot support some provisions in their current form, because they effectively reduce needed protection or they reduce the field that is covered. The Democrats have put amendments, and circulated them in the Senate for the Senate's consideration in which we oppose 14 items and amend 18 others. Of the remaining items, most are in the applications and savings provisions. We have redirected quite strongly the substantial provisions. 
As is usual with workplace relations matters, there is strong small business and business support for the bill in its unamended form, and there is strong employee organisation or union opposition to many of its provisions. We feel, however, that the route that we are suggesting we take, of adjusting the bill considerably, will produce a modest and moderate outcome which should improve the workability of the bill without eroding rights or entitlements and without allowing the continuation of practices which were frankly unfair to both employees and employers in matters of process. That is all I have to say to you at this juncture. I look forward to the continuing debate.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2001-08-06,"—It is my pleasure to follow Senator Murray. Although I might not agree with some of the things he has said, he has always acted in a very principled way in relation to the rights of employees and independent contractors in unfair dismissal and termination of employment matters. As you may recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, some months ago we discussed what appears to be a similar bill to the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000. That bill, the unfair dismissal bill, was put before the parliament and subsequently rejected.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 deals with the rights of employees and the rights of independent contractors. It appears that many of the coalition senators who spoke to the unfair dismissal bill—and I assume it will be the same with this termination of employment bill—have never dealt with men or women who believe that they have been unfairly or unjustly dismissed. This legislation proposes to take away significant chunks of the current legislation that allows men and women who believe they have been unfairly or unjustly dismissed to go before an independent tribunal and to argue the case that they should be either reinstated or compensated for that termination.
I make no bones about the fact that I was a full-time official of the Transport Workers Union of Australia for 18 years before I entered the Senate. I am not ashamed about it. In those years I dealt with a number of unfair dismissals or claims by people who felt that they had been unfairly and unjustly dismissed by their employer. On a number of occasions when grievances were brought before me by members who felt that they had been unfairly or unjustly dismissed, as a practising union official I felt that I might have in fact acted in the same way if I had been their employer.
There were many instances over a number of years where I was involved in representing the workplace. On many occasions there would be industrial action in support of someone being reinstated and subsequently there would be hearings before the New South Wales industrial jurisdiction. I remember many of those men who were subsequently reinstated, either through the action of their peers and the support of their workplace or by the intervention and adjudication of the New South Wales industrial commission.
I remember the first case I was involved in concerned a chap who drove for Pioneer at the Walgrove depot in Western Sydney. He had made a mistake with his vehicle—there was no-one injured but there was some damage. He had been with Pioneer for some 16 years and they terminated him on the spot. After the case went before the commission, he was reinstated. He rang me about five years ago when he retired from Pioneer. He worked for them for another 15 years and they were happy with his contribution as an employee. They were very pleased with his attitude as a worker and they kept him on. He got the gold watch and chain—or whatever you get when you work for a significant public company like Pioneer.
So the ability to go before an independent tribunal and argue a case for reinstatement is not necessarily the end of the world for employers or employees. In fact, as I myself have seen over many years when I have been involved in those circumstances, more often than not people that have been reinstated serve out the rest of their working career with the company that sacked them and, as I said in the case of the chap who worked for Pioneer, are loyal and valued employees. Except for those situations that happen sometimes in the heat of the moment which employers may regret, the system that we have in New South Wales has meant that disputes have been able to be satisfactorily adjudicated and that people have been able to resume their working careers with the companies that they have been associated with for some time. So it is not always a one-way case.
But, as has been mentioned on a number of occasions by contributors to this debate, this capacity for reinstatement mostly exists under state tribunals. This is for good reason, because only in the last few years have people who have been unfairly or unjustly dismissed had an ability to go before the federal jurisdiction. As I said during the debate on the unfair dismissal bill, my recollection of how you were able to be reinstated under the federal jurisdiction prior to the Labor government's reforms in the 1990s was that, if you went before the federal arbitration commission and you had a finding by the judge or commissioner that a man or woman had been unfairly and unjustly dismissed, they could only recommend that they be reinstated. If you then wished to have that recommendation adhered to, you had to make a separate application to the Federal Court and go and argue the case there to make sure that that man or woman was reinstated. That is clearly uncivilised, and that was identified by federal Labor when we were in power and supported by the Australian Democrats.
If you go through the basic tenets of the legislation that is now being proposed, you would have to be a bush lawyer to understand what you were supposed to do. If you look at the provisions that have been made available to us, you will see that there is a change to the nature of the cases and that in fact the conciliation period will now become the mini arbitration tribunal phase. It appears to me that you will have commissioners, judges and deputy presidents trying to adjudicate in corridors on matters. That is certainly not fair or just, and the Labor Party reject that. The current system is workable. As Senator Murray has said, it would appear that the number of unfair dismissal applications has been reduced. The reason that there was such a glut of them was that many men and women in this country were denied an opportunity to go and have their fate as a permanent employee determined by an independent tribunal. So we believe this works fairly well now and that it should not be tampered with. 
There is the issue about the size of the business being taken into account. I talked earlier about Pioneer, a major public company that employs thousands of people. Of course, it is unionised and it has established grievance procedures and an industrial relations or human resources department where people are advised on how they should act. But there is probably more unfairness and more opportunity for injustice where people are working in small workplaces. More than likely, the balance of power is not in any way shared between the work force and the employer but is overwhelmingly in favour of the employer. If we remove the provision that small workplaces be dealt with differently from large ones, we will find that far more repressive than anything we could imagine, because they are the places where the intimidation, the harassment, the injustice does occur. It would indeed be very unfair and oppressive for the government to persist with legislation that would preclude small workplaces.
As has been mentioned by Senator Collins, small workplaces are not necessarily put off by the fact that they have got the opportunity to have their unfair dismissal cases end up in some arbitration commission because, as I said, a number of them still have state jurisdictions and those state jurisdictions are able to deal with these things anyway. It is no big deal except in some parts of Australia where there has been an overriding attachment to federal jurisdiction. The claim that 50,000 jobs are at stake or will be created if this is passed needs to be independently established.
I want to speak now about the ability for independent contractors to have access to the provisions of this bill. The independent contractors that I have dealt with over many years were in the transport industry. Those men had purchased their own equipment and worked for one company, as they still do, in all parts of Australia. Those men had their equipment, their vehicles, painted in company colours so that you would not know whether the man jumping out of the IPEC van that pulls up out the front of the Senate tomorrow morning is a lorry owner-driver or an employee driver. He would have a uniform on from IPEC, he would have a two-way radio or some sort of communication in his vehicle and he would work as directed by the IPEC operations people. He would be required to present himself at the IPEC yard or depot from a certain time in the morning and be available until a certain time at night.
If his vehicle is a painted wagon, as most of them are, he would not have the ability to go and deliver a parcel or an item for any other courier or transport company in this region. You could not imagine TNT or Star Track Express or others being comfortable with an IPEC vehicle turning up out the front of this place with their goods on board to be delivered here. In a lot of ways it is simply a fiction that these men and women are independent contractors. In this sort of situation they are to all intents and purposes directed by and wholly responsible to the company whose uniform they wear and whose company colours their truck is painted in. They are subject to direction for certain hours of the day. Why should they be precluded from being reinstated? 
It took a long time in New South Wales for lorry owner-drivers to be able to reinstated by the New South Wales commission. As I may have said in my previous speech on unfair dismissals, it took two trips to the Privy Council in London to make sure that these men and women were recognised as employees under industrial relations law. Right now in New South Wales if you are unfairly dismissed as a lorry owner-driver you are able to go the commission and the commission is able to reinstate you if its feels you have been harshly or unjustly dealt with. And why shouldn't you be? These people have as part of their contribution to their employer purchased a vehicle so that the employer will not have any of the operational costs of running that vehicle for the required number of hours per day.
In fact, the New South Wales legislation goes a little further, because in New South Wales goodwill payments have been paid and have been recognised by companies. As a result of legislation introduced into the New South Wales parliament by the former member for Auburn, Peter Nagle, there is a contract of carriage tribunal in New South Wales. Lorry owner-drivers who are terminated for whatever reason—whether it is downturn of business or because they have been unfairly or justly dealt with—can go before this tribunal and argue about the goodwill that their company knew they had paid and get compensation for it.
It is mere fiction that independent contractors should not have access to these legislative reforms. They are good hard-working men and women in our society. They drive small vehicles up to the heavy rigs. Unfortunately, a lot of them vote Liberal. I will seek to change that over the next few years. They are entitled to the same rigours and benefits of the law as any other man or woman in this country. It is outrageous for the coalition government to introduce legislation that will severely hamper and damage access to justice for these men and women. The Labor Party rejects this bill—again it is one of those bills that the government just seems to want to bring forward to see how often some of us will get up and have a chat—on the ground that it is unfair and unjust to people who believe they have been terminated unfairly and unjustly.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Buckland, Sen Geoffrey",ALP,2001-08-06,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 is a vestige of the government's second wave law, the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs Better Pay) Bill 1999, often referred to as the mojo bill, which was effectively withdrawn by the government in December 1999. Here we are again with a part of that bill. 
The mojo bill was rejected in 1999 because the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats opposed the bill. The then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, was on a quest to introduce bills that dealt with specific policy matters in contrast to having them contained in one large bill, as was done with the second wave. In essence, this bill entails something like 50 amendments to the unfair and unlawful dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The proposed amendments are, to a large extent, the same as those in schedule 7 of the mojo bill. These amendments contain a range of provisions which will, according to the government, reinforce disincentives to speculative and unmeritorious unfair dismissal claims, introduce greater rigour into processing claims for remedy against dismissal by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and remove unnecessary procedural burdens that such applications place on employers.
The previous speaker, Senator Hutchins, is correct: there seems to be among those who have drafted these amendments a lack of understanding of what actually goes on in the workplace, out there in the real world, where Australian men and women are honestly seeking to earn a living for themselves and their families. There is a great misunderstanding, it seems to me, as to what claimants of unfair termination are actually all about. The amendments do nothing to introduce any degree of fairness across the board. If there is any `fairness', it is biased towards the employers. The harsh reality is that, of those who are terminated in the workplace, only a very small percentage indeed ever get through to the stage of having their termination arbitrated or adjudicated upon by a judge or a commissioner. In the vast majority of cases where an employee has been terminated, the issues are resolved in-house—that is, between the employee, their representative and the employer—because most companies that are genuinely out there seeking to do the right thing have procedures in place that set out very clearly from the date you are first employed what the expectations are, what your obligations are and, in turn, what the obligations of the employer are. Those sorts of things are generally enshrined in the awards and they work very well. 
This bill seeks to up-end that good working relationship. Those cases that cannot be resolved directly between the employer and employee and their representative go through the process of conciliation. I believe that any worker who believes that they have been harshly dealt with has the right, at least, to go before a commission for conciliation. Again, in the majority of cases that go before the commission for conciliation either a resolution or a decision is made by the applicant—the worker—that it is quite foolish to pursue their claim any longer and that they will not get relief if the matter is arbitrated. But there is a flaw in that process—not on the part of the commission or on the part of the advocates who put their case. The flaw is the limited time that is available to put your case. My experience—and I have had some experience in this arena, although the majority was in the South Australian jurisdiction—even before the federal commission is that you are very fortunate to get much more than 20 minutes because there is just not enough time. In that 20 minutes, all you can do is state your case as best you can. You do not have the opportunity to draw out the evidence that supports your claim. As a result of that, any recommendation coming from the commission is based on your side of the story and their side of the story. Those that get that far generally do need sufficient time to have the evidence put before the commission for proper assessment. This bill almost eliminates any rights the worker has to do that.
The government's rhetoric in justifying this bill is of streamlining processes and removing burdens on business, but the majority of this bill is a direct attack on workers' rights to access termination laws. It is not directed at providing more efficient and effective procedures to ensure that the government's stated objectives of a fair go all round is achieved in practice. There is no fair go all round in this bill. It is highly loaded towards fairness to the employer and unfairness to the employee.
These amendments would without a doubt obstruct access to fair, affordable remedies against unfair and unlawful termination, they would cut off claimants from sources of financial and legal support, they would force applicants to represent and defend their own interests, they would make the system more complicated—experience tells me it is complicated enough without making it more so—and they would make settlement more legalistic. Even today, you need a solicitor or barrister to take a matter before the federal Industrial Relations Commission for unfair or unlawful termination for you because of the technicalities of the act as it stands now. These amendments will see applicants requiring the services of senior QCs because of the complications that this bill introduces. The amendments will tilt the balance of influence in unfair dismissal cases squarely and thoroughly on the side of the employer—nothing for the employee.
The then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, in his second reading speech on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Unfair Dismissals) Bill 1998 in November 1998, said:
There is no doubt that the small business community has repeatedly called for a fairer deal ... they are saying right across the Australian small business community that if they had a fairer deal they would go out and create jobs. 
I think some 50,000 jobs might have been mentioned. But the Howard government continues to lose trustworthiness within small business even with that statement. This is clearly illustrated by the results of the May 2001 Yellow Pages Business Index which recorded the lowest level of support for the Howard government's policies since it was elected in 1996—not just the termination of employment laws but that is one of them.  I quote from that business index: 
Small business confidence levels are at one of the lowest levels since the establishment of the index—adding to the three previous quarters' negative results. 
According to the survey results, small business is most concerned about: 
·	lack of work and sales; 
·	the GST; and 
·	cash flow.
That is somewhat worrying because when this bill was introduced we were told that we were going to get some 50,000 jobs and that if there were better unfair dismissal laws jobs would be created. But the unfair dismissal laws do not rate a mention in this index. The main concern is lack of work and sales. Where are the jobs created? Small business do not see them. The GST is affecting small business and of course it is affecting their cash flow. Without cash flow you cannot go out and develop and increase your business; you are restricted in what you can do. The Yellow Pages Business Index goes on to say:
The GST has had a negative impact on consumers' and business' capacity to spend, thus the declining level of business activities for small businesses—the weakest industry sectors for this quarter were manufacturing (-31%), wholesale trade (-31%), and building and construction down (-23%). 
Coupled with the decline in sales and capital expenditure during this quarter, small firms have a right to be concerned about the Coalition's ability to manage the country's economy and stimulate jobs growth. 
That statement is not contained in a party political from the ALP; that is from a recognised and respected business index that is relied upon by many and that is very thorough in its obtaining of information. There was no mention in any of that of unfair dismissal laws causing small business not to employ. There is also nothing from small business telling us about the wonderful 50,000 jobs that were going to be created. As I travel around and meet people that I deal with—and I have many friends in small and larger businesses through the state of South Australia and also in some very large national companies—
—I have got friends, Senator Ludwig—limited in number as they may be. None of those companies is putting on full-time employees. They are taking on labour hire employees. There is no permanency; employees work when the work is there—`Don't turn up tomorrow because we have not got anything for you'. They are taking on casuals or part-time employees. Many small businesses are reducing the hours they work to try to keep the same employees all the time. Again, where are our wonderful 50,000 employees? I think the wool has been pulled over the small business community's eyes by the coalition government. 
Has the Howard government given small business a fair go? The bill illustrates the hypocrisy of this government. For example, the Minister for Small Business, Ian Macfarlane, prior to the implementation of the GST, stated: 
... we were keen to make sure that we did not disadvantage people with a bit of motivation, a bit of initiative, who want to get out there and earn an income, who want to make sure that they can provide jobs for people in the future—small business who are starting out ...
After the GST was implemented, the Minister for Small Business, in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 February 200, is reported as saying: 
I'm not sure how many small businesses went ... out of business because of it, but I certainly know that marriages were strained, small business were taken away from ... running their small business ... 
In the same article, Mr Macfarlane was reported as saying that the government was sorry for foisting such an `undue burden' on small business. Further in the article he is reported as saying:
It was an unwelcome imposition ...
Nowhere is small business worried about the impact of unfair dismissals. In reality there is very little impact on small business through unfair dismissal. It is only when the employer or owner-operator of a small business sticks their head in the sand and refuses to talk to those who seek to remedy the problem, and they are the employers who have that mean streak in them right from the start. I could talk about my favourite fish and chip shop again, but I will spare you the burden. 
Once the Industrial Relations Commission judges that an employee's application is likely to succeed, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 almost eliminates their right to appeal that. They are required to put money up-front if they want to take on the employer, and all this on speculation because no-one has yet heard the evidence that supports their claim. Responsible unions and responsible solicitors will say the same thing to an applicant when it comes to unfair dismissal—`If you are genuine, your case will be heard; if you are not genuine, if there is any element of doubt, we do not want to know about it and pursue it for you because it wastes our resources and our time.' 
It is a rigorous process that unions and solicitors representing workers go through to ensure that there is no wastage of time and that the worker is not subjected to further pain and suffering as a result of their termination by taking them down the garden path and subjecting them to the rigours of cross-examination. Some of us get very emotional about this issue because we have worked in the field. It disappoints people like me that the drafters of this very ordinary legislation have not been in the field themselves. It is an issue that goes to the fundamental rights of Australian workers. It goes to their fundamental right to be heard. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I rise to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000. I heard Senator Buckland talk about emotions. The way this bill was presented last time and the way it has been presented this time naturally raises emotions. The late amendments from the government show it to be a negative piece of legislation while at the same time the government mouths that it is part of the reform agenda. I am not going to get emotional about it. It is a bad bill. It is as simple as that. The bill provides for no assistance to workers, no encouragement to work. The only encouragement it provides is for employers to utilise the legislation in an adverse, mean, ad hoc and discriminatory fashion. It does that quite easily if they can understand it—and I use that qualification with some justification—if they can follow through and use it to their advantage. One of the difficulties is that the bill is complex. Why is it complex? It is complex because it takes the role of the commission, the independent umpire, and says, `We are going to circumscribe the activities of the independent umpire in these myriad ways to prevent it from making decisions which are fair on the facts.' 
The legislation becomes necessarily complex as it tries to wend its way through the workings of an independent commission—to second-guess how the commission will deal with the legislation and how the commission will apply fair rulings in relation to unfair dismissal, rather than leaving the area unfettered, rather than leaving the area to the jurisdiction of the commission. 
This bill is just a rehash of the `more jobs, better pay' bill. I suspect that this chamber has heard a number of speakers already go through that debate. The real debate is about this ad hoc, mishmash piece of legislation that is being put up again. You would think that by now the government would have got the message, tried to follow through and tried to understand that all it is doing is making it more difficult to administer, making the job of the Industrial Relations Commission more complex, by trying to circumscribe its operation. It knows it, the advisers know it, the government know it. Yet the government still sit there. 
The minister said quite adamantly in the second reading speech that this is a wonderful piece of legislation that will assist all the relevant parties. It is designed to assist only one: small business. But, as I said, it only assists it if small business can work its way through the complex piece of legislation. I doubt very much that small business will sit down and read it. You can then ask who else it is designed to assist. Perhaps it is designed to assist big business, the big end of town, which Mr Howard tends to pander to. In the end, they will say something similar to what I say: it is a complex piece of legislation and we are far better working through terminations in a fair and equitable way. It is a pity that the government has not taken a leaf out of its own book and done exactly the same.
The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 is back in this chamber. As I said, it is part of the so-called reform agenda that has been put up by the government and that was called the second wave laws. It reappears again in 2001, having slid off the agenda in 1999. The government, in effect, should have taken its cue at that time and left it off the agenda. You would have to say that Mr Abbott is bereft of any new talent within his department, in that all it has done is drag it back up again—dragged it back up from 1999 out of Reith's filed agenda and said, `Look, we'll polish it up and serve it up again,'—perhaps while he is thinking up something new like another royal commission or inquiry.
I suspect that tonight or tomorrow we will hear the government trying to justify the reintroduction of the bill as part of their desire to reform the industrial relations system—perhaps, in my words, to gut it. The government have been single-minded—I will give them that—in trying to unravel our once excellent industrial relations system. Prior to 1996, for a time our system of industrial relations achieved a fair balance. There was a need for some finetuning and for dealing with contemporary needs that may arise. This government chose not to continue the good work that had preceded it—not to build on the process that commenced way back in 1990. I suspect that some of the advisers would remember the reform agendas that were commenced during that period and that brought us significant advances in both productivity and employment. This government chose to cloak its agenda with a catchy title. It seems to choose catchy titles to cloak its dastardly agenda with—for example, theWorkplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999.
This was a particularly unrealistic endeavour. It was, in my view, a course that was designed to be confrontational. The government knows that, but it still persists. It is not a true reform agenda at all. This government has missed the boat. It has missed a golden opportunity to bring about real improvements in the industrial relations system. The desire of this government—unashamedly, I think—has been to wind the system back. 
It is now many years since the original 1996 workplace relations bill was introduced. The industrial relations system is no better; in fact, it appears worse. It is becoming more complex and more legalistic, and I suspect it is unworkable on the ground. The system is spinning out of control. You can see what starts to happen. There are amendments upon amendments. Even this evening we received another amendment from the government in relation to this bill which tried to introduce a qualifying period. We are enduring, as I understand it—and I hope that at the committee stage the government might be able to expand on what it intends to do—a situation where it appears that all the government intends to do is find a piece of time where you will not be able to file for reinstatement. Three months seems to be the suggested period. So more complexity is being added to the industrial relations system as it currently exists. 
My advice—freely given, although I suspect it will not be taken—is to move on from this agenda. If you want to deal with industrial relations, deal with it in a bipartisan way. State governments have. State governments have committed themselves to real reform to improve their industrial relations systems. State governments have looked at task forces, have progressed an industrial relations system. My own state, Queensland, has adopted a tripartite process—perhaps this government does not understand the meaning of that—to move its industrial relations system on, to commit to a real process of reform that encompasses the employee, the community, employers and government need.  
I thought there might be a fresh breath of air from Mr Abbott, providing a different approach to industrial relations. It does not seem to have come to pass. It appears Mr Abbott is simply following the failed agenda of Mr Reith, who has moved on. Perhaps Mr Abbott has taken his eye off the ball and allowed the department once again to set the agenda, perhaps as a delaying tactic, perhaps as a mechanism to allow a bit of time so that he can ponder what his industrial relations system should look like. But, given that this piece of legislation is flawed and given what we are dealing with, it is a matter that should be rejected out of hand. It was rejected by the Senate committee and by the Senate previously, and I hope the Senate will reject the legislation in this process. 
Let us just have a look at the flavour of what this bill seeks to do. This is the reform agenda. It seeks to ensure that employees eligible for a remedy under federal laws are ineligible to apply for a state remedy. It wants to take away what they might call forum shopping, but it does not want to ensure that every person has a right to seek a reinstatement. It wants to rule out the entitlement of a person engaged in a contract of services—take contract for services out of the agenda. It wants to remove employees and contractors who—and in some instances they look like employees—wish to avail themselves of fairness in the industrial relations system. You really must take heart from the fact that it wants to separate out employees and independent contractors, but provides no real definition of what an independent contractor is. It only adds more complexity, as we then have arguments about what an independent contractor is or is not. 
The bill also encourages an employer to resort to the use of demotion as a strategy rather than dismissal. That is what it does, quite simply. It precludes an employee who has been demoted from seeking an application for termination of employment, where the demotion does not result in a significant reduction in remuneration. What is a `significant reduction in remuneration'? It does not in any way, shape or form say what `significant' is. We are left with another area where lawyers will argue for a very long time about what is a significant demotion and whether a demotion sideways is in fact a demotion out of the area into a lower job. How much difference in remuneration is significant will depend a lot on the circumstances. There again it adds to the complexity of the area. 
It also closes out the ability of the AIRC and the Federal Court to consider out-of-time applications for termination. That is what it in effect does. It circumscribes that area very narrowly. It tries to adopt a position analogous to that of the commission and say, `We will step into the shoes of the commission and we will determine for you and tell you—the commission—how you should treat out-of-time applications.' Unless you jump through these hoops, and the commission should take note of that, then it remains out of time and there is no remedy. 
In the past, where there were procedural irregularities, merit would have overcome that. In this instance, the amendments appear to say that procedural irregularities will prevail. It allows the commission to cut off the right of an employee to have a matter heard, because the commissioner, without full evidence being tested, might form a view that the application had a substantial prospect of being unsuccessful at arbitration. That is very interesting because it creates a situation where, when you go to a conciliation conference, when you go to represent an employee or when employees represent themselves, you need to bring everything to bear. You need to take the time and energy of the commission to fully consider the whole of the legislation. To do otherwise might prejudice the case. If the commission does not hear the whole case during the conciliation process, the commission might adversely form that view, in which case you would lose and be out the door.
It is not an example that I care to often turn to, but my experience has been that at conciliation the prospect of the employee winning the case sometimes looks a bit poor because the employee, for a range of reasons—lack of experience, knowledge, understanding of what the commission's role is and lack of ability to accept what is happening, or the employer likewise having the same failings or shortcomings—is not prepared for the full proceedings or the conciliation conference itself. Sometimes in the past, the commission has looked over its glasses, so to speak, and said, `This appears to be a very dubious case to be running.' But it is at that point and after that point that some hard questions are asked about whether the matters should proceed. Often the case is that more tends to come to light and a second conciliation conference is often sought, but by then the views of the parties have hardened. This bill denies the opportunities to ensure that, if there is a case, it is fully aired.
It also directs the commission to take into account the size of the employer's business in considering whether the termination is unfair, so now we have size as a determining factor. The commission then has to ask, `How big is your business?' Does it go to employee numbers? Does it go to turnover? If the business is a car yard, does it go to the number of cars that the business has in its yard? Does it relate to the amount of debt the business might owe? It might owe more debt, being a big business because of the debt. Of course it does not really say that, but they are all the connotations that might be attached to it. 
It directs and circumscribes the activity of the commission to delve into the business. But what if the business is not as what might be first sought? Does the commission then have to put orders on the business to show all, to tell all? Once again we have the area where litigation may abound, where people want to determine the size of the business, as to whether that is a true factor that should be taken into consideration in respect of a reinstatement, once again adding clouds of confusion to an otherwise simple matter of filing for reinstatement and seeking to have it heard by an independent body.  
In addition, it confers power on the commission to require a representative who has been retained pursuant to a contingency fee agreement to divulge that. That is another area: is this a new move by the government to place that requirement in all places where litigation might occur or where all contingency fees might occur? It is certainly a matter I will be pursuing during the committee stage, to find out whether it is now government policy that lawyers who use contingency fees should be required to divulge that fact in all proceedings in all federal matters, in immigration matters and right across the board. Is this a matter that the government sees as a necessary requirement? Then one would ask the question: `What is the evil the government is trying to challenge?' Perhaps the government could provide some assistance in demonstrating what is the aim or objective of that piece of the legislation. And it widens access to cost orders!
Let us reflect for a minute. During the last few minutes, have I said anything positive about what this bill will do? I will second guess the answer: no. That is because the bill is not about a positive change or about bringing about a fair industrial relations system. It is not about what the title suggests it is about; it is about a diminution in the rights and entitlements of employees, and that is clear. You can see that by the next section, where it confers power for the lodgment of an amount of security for costs. That is what we will now have to do. An employee may be terminated without due regard to their financial position and they may not have sufficient funds to provide security of costs, if the employer seeks that. You will then get a position where the employee accepts what might otherwise be an unreasonable or unfair termination, without being able to pursue it in a fair, reasoned way. All these matters will bring about a system which harks back to the kind of situation you might have found in a 19th century coalmine, a situation where the employer used the whip hand to say to employees, `This is the process you will go through if I dismiss you: you should cop it now and go.' The whole premise of this piece of legislation is negative and quite derogatory in relation to employees.
On 27 June 2000, Mr Reith said this bill would introduce greater rigour into the process of the AIRC. This belies the true nature of the bill. In response, Labor senators during the course of the bill rejected the provisions of the bill relating to unfair dismissals because, paraphrasing, to act as a limit and obstruct access to fair and affordable remedies against unfair and unlawful dismissals is what the bill seeks to do in no uncertain terms. The conclusion was that these amendments would make the system more complex and legalistic and would shift the balance of influence in unfair dismissal cases to employers.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2001-08-06,"—What to add after that tour de force by Senator Ludwig is the question I must face. I think the speeches we have heard so far, beginning with Senator Collins and ending—up till now—with Senator Ludwig, have been very learned and very effective and very much on the ball.
Originally, there was a contract of employment which set up a relationship between the employer and employee. That concept has gone back over the centuries, and there has been an eternal struggle between the worker, who contributes his or her labour and intellectual or bodily capacity and skills, and the employer, who can administrate well and who provides, hopefully, management skills of a high nature, capital and organisational ability generally. What is happening is that products and ideas and services are being produced for the purpose, amongst other things of course, of obtaining money and, where money is an issue, there is always going to be a fight as to what a proper distribution of that is. In the 19th century, we had the works of Karl Marx, who was going to distribute money in particular ways; in the 20th century, there has been a swing to the neo-liberal philosophy of saying that the marketplace is what determines the issue. That swing back to the neo-liberal position where what is said to be important is the agreement determined by market forces has led to problems. 
Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, you and I belong to a party that says there is more in life than money, that mammon is not the only thing that man lives by. I should say `woman' as well, but the Bible says that man does not live by bread alone. There are other things that come into the equation. In the employment contract, what should come into consideration is not only the amount of money paid by way of wages but also the conditions under which a person works. There is also the issue of human dignity: there ought to be proper respect between the employer and the employee, and the relationship between the two should not be looked on simply in terms of the hard cold elements of a contract. 
The contractual relationship is modified by statute in many ways. The classic example is the Trade Practices Act, which says, for example, that a business should not use its weight in the market to unjustly oppress its competitors. It says that people should be honest in their advertising and that there ought to be rules, in addition to the terms of contract agreed upon between the parties. Fundamentally, at the base of things, there is this contractual arrangement but there should be some outside force which, either through legislation or the decision of a court or an arbitrator or a similar body, adjusts the relationship so that there is a perception as well as a reality of fairness in the system, no matter what the contractual arrangement is. I think it was Senator Collins who was talking about the necessity of perception, besides the reality of things.
Mr Acting Deputy President, during recent times, as you know, we in this chamber have been struggling over the issue of unfair termination where the employment contract has finished and the employee is sent upon his or her way. There is a system established in this society which decides what is fair and right in a contractual arrangement, modified, as it is in most cases these days, by legislation or by precedents set by the courts. That way is to have the matter decided by an independent body which says, `In this case the employer was in the right and had every reason in the world to terminate the agreement' or `In this case the employee had right on his or her side and should be rewarded accordingly.' That is what the wrongful dismissal legislation as brought in by our party, for example, is all about—trying to get fairness. You would have to say that the government wants to take out the element of fairness that is built into that. The second reading speech talks about reform. That is not reform. This is a retrograde step. This is an attempt to get back to the Combinations Acts, and it should be understood in that context. This is bad legislation not only because it might treat employees unfairly but because it is an attack on the time honoured system that we have in place to decide what is fair in any particular situation; that is, the courts, the tribunals and the commission. This is an attack on that long entrenched system. 
The legislation before us is one sided. I can illustrate what I mean by that by going to item 40, which introduces subdivision G—`Unmeritorious or speculative proceedings'. It says there is going to be a penalty through the payment of costs available in certain circumstances. People reading the legislation might say that, if there has been a reckless and grossly negligent piece of advice that has led people to waste the time of the commission or of any body for that matter, it is reasonable enough to have penalties for that. But when we look at subdivision G, the only unmeritorious or speculative proceedings that are going to be subject to an order for costs are those to be brought by the employee. There is nothing in this that I can see in any event—maybe the parliamentary secretary will point it out to us later—which enables a tribunal or a decision making body to visit an order for costs on those advisers who advise the employer to resist a claim which is quite clearly justified. Why is that? In a system where there are two parties, both parties to the same contract, both parties to the same proceedings, why do you have that situation treated by this legislation in a way which makes penalties available only against the advisers of the employees? Why is that? If speculative and unmeritorious claims are so bad—if that is the situation—why doesn't this legislation move in and apply a penalty not only to the advisers of one party but to the advisers of the other party as well?
A lot of workers go to firms that are staffed by people who do not charge comparatively big fees and who struggle to see that justice is done for people who are usually very poorly resourced. They are the sort of people who normally act for the workers, as contrasted with those advisers that act for the employers, which are usually big and wealthy practices. I have got nothing against big and wealthy companies or big and wealthy practices, but you would have thought that the big and wealthy solicitors would be in a better position than the smaller legal firms to withstand an order of costs, yet this legislation seeks to punish the smaller firms. Why? Because they are acting for employees—that is why—and because the government say, `We really would like to see a situation where employees are not represented. We are happy enough to have employers but not employees represented.'
Subdivision G, I think, illustrates in a very big way what this legislation is all about. This is not legislation to adjust the balance between two parties to an agreement; this is legislation to ensure that the weight and burden of running an action are very much on the employee and on his or her advisers. It is a shame that the legislation—flawed as it is in that way, loaded as it is in that way, with a culture of oppression of working people—should come before this chamber.
We talk about small business. Small business is a very difficult process to run. You have to be good at managing in order to run a small business or, for that matter, any sort of business. It is hard work, it requires great skills, people can lose millions of dollars and things are hard and frustrating. I hope I come into this chamber with an understanding of the pressures on small business—the need to get enough money to pay the rent, the wages, the various taxes that are imposed upon them, and to run the GST with some sort of ability, which is very hard. You have to prepare your GST statement and your income tax statement. All those things are terribly burdensome on business and on small business in particular. But there is also a burden on employees—people who are starting to make their way in the world, people who want to earn money so that they can bring up a family and pay the mortgage on a house, get a car, and perhaps even get a little holiday home. I hope we are the sort of society that would allow that to happen. We are the sort of society where there is a reasonable distribution of the income that comes into the country. You have to look not only at the situation that small business may be in, but also at the situation that employees might be in. There is a lack of security in jobs these days. It is terribly hard to arrange to bring up a family of any size. Families are too small these days. As a grandfather of a single grandchild, families are much too small these days, may I say, and there is very little you can do about that, that I can see.
—Start again.
—I might have to do that—that is the sort of prospect that is facing me. Perhaps I will have to. In any event, I think it is important for the future of this country and for the future of families in this society that some security be given—security for the small businessman certainly, but also security for the people working there—and, for that matter, security for big companies, because they produce a lot. But for some reason there is an obsession in the minister's department that somehow people at work should not be entitled to live as decent and self-respecting citizens of a free, democratic and fair society. We have somehow got to put them in a position where they can be sacked easily and where they cannot get together to come to an arrangement with their employer. When they elect their leaders in the unions—as they do—those leaders must be denigrated. This is a culture that seems to have been built up in this department and with the ministers that head the department. It is a culture which I think is a tragedy for this country, because it denigrates the standing of a very important section of this community, and that is the working person, whether the working person be a man or a woman that goes on to a building site—and, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, two people were killed on building sites in Melbourne this weekend—or whether it be people who work in a factory which produces automotive parts and who are looking for some security in their work. 
We, as human beings, are vulnerable to all sorts of things. We have all the emotions, worries and concerns that are often published in great novels, for example, but also in learned works. We are subject to all those things, but for some reason this department does not take that reality on board. It seems to think that the contract is all and that the common law will solve all problems. The common law judges themselves understand that they cannot do all that needs to be done to make this fair. What is wrong with having a process whereby people can go to an independent tribunal and have a matter decided by the commission? 
People say, `Oh, look, if you go down there, the easy way out of this is to pay a certain amount of money to get rid of the matter.' Of course, matters are settled and people do not like settling because they have to pay out money. No doubt, they feel that they have been placed in a situation where that is the only outlet for them. It is a bit like getting a parking fine or a speeding fine, I suppose—you really have to pay it because, if you fight it, you are going to be in trouble. That is the system. It is not only people with wages at stake and with the termination of their employment at issue; it is all sorts of people, whether they are contracting for a house to be built, a car to be bought or services to be done. All those matters are liable to raise disputes, the same as this. This is not exceptional; this is just another matter, another sort of issue, that goes into making up those things for which we have a system in place to properly discharge the issue in favour of fairness.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2001-08-06,"—I rise to speak in this debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 following Senator Cooney, who touched on a number of the issues that of course concern me—that is, particularly the issues of fairness and equity and, of course, the issue of security of employment, which this is all about. This bill is about weakening the security of employment, weakening the fairness and weakening the equity that people can expect in their relationship with their employer. Any reasonable person would expect there to be fairness in the system. Any reasonable employer would also expect there to be fairness and equity in the system. But one must start from the premise that the equation is loaded on the side of the employer far more than it is on the side of the employee. When one looks at the second reading speech that accompanied this bill, one finds the statement:
The current provisions in the act are based on the concept of a `fair go all round'. 
That is the basis of the current act: that everyone should get a fair go. No-one would believe, when they read this bill, that everyone is going to get a `fair go all round'. That is going to disappear. If you look further in the second reading speech, it goes on to say:
This bill is designed to maintain the fair balance between the rights of employees and employers while addressing some of the procedural problems that have become evident during the operation of the act. 
So the second reading speech says that the bill wants to maintain the fair balance between the rights of the employees and the employers whilst addressing procedural problems. Of course, none of these procedural problems are evident in the second reading speech. None of them are evident anywhere in the explanatory memorandum or in anything else that is associated with this bill. One can only think, `What are the procedural problems?' One's mind could boggle at what this could mean. The second reading speech goes on to say:
The bill contains a range of provisions designed to reinforce disincentives to speculative and unmeritorious unfair dismissal claims, to introduce greater rigour into the processing by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of unfair dismissal claims and to remove unnecessary procedural burdens that unfair dismissal applications place on employers.
If one takes a look at that, there are three main elements. The first is `to reinforce disincentives to speculative and unmeritorious unfair dismissal claims'. As others have already canvassed in this debate, the number of unfair dismissal claims has already fallen. Most people, when they find themselves dismissed, do not necessarily run off straightaway to seek redress for their unfair dismissal. There are very few speculative and unmeritorious unfair dismissal claims that I know of in my experience. There might be the odd one here or there, but to have a full bill try to address this issue is just a complete nonsense. 
It goes on: `to introduce greater rigour into the processing by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission of unfair dismissal claims'. How much rigour can one have? If there are procedural steps that need to be taken in the process of a claim for an unfair dismissal, and if those procedural processes are transparent and allow for transparency of the process, then show where they are at fault but do not come in with a sweeping statement that there are procedural problems and that these need to be overcome by getting greater rigour in the process so as to make it more difficult for people to pursue their just and fair rights in seeking reinstatement before the industrial tribunal. 
Last but not least, it refers to the `unnecessary procedural burdens that unfair dismissal applications place on employers'. None of these have been enunciated. The quantum of them, to the best of my knowledge, has not been enunciated. The degree of these procedural burdens has not been enunciated anywhere, to the best of my knowledge. So we have a bill which is set to put more obstacles in the path of people who are seeking a legitimate redress to their dismissal. It has been my experience that the vast majority of unfair dismissal claims never make it to a union, an industrial relations consultant nor to a lawyer. None of those groups ever see the majority of people who are unfairly dismissed, let alone make it to an industrial commission on their behalf. As I said, the second reading speech talks about procedural problems but none of those are enunciated, as far as I could see, in either the explanatory memorandum or in anything to do with the second reading speech.  
The system was and always will be loaded against the employee. That is the nature of the system. The employer has always operated from a position of superiority. As the employer has always had the position of superiority in the master-servant relationship, some substantial time ago that brought about the formation of unions such that, where people were not able to individually defend their rights, they collectively joined together to defend their rights. One of those rights, of course, was their right not to be unfairly dismissed or sacked from their employment. 
Over a long time, unions—and I am proudly president of the branch of my union in Queensland—have maintained their role and their function in protecting the rights of people who have found themselves unfairly dismissed. But those are workers at the lower end of the pay scale. One should not be under any illusion that unfair dismissal laws relate solely to them. They also relate to people at the higher end of the earning scale. This is where, in many instances, industrial relations consultants and lawyers, over a long time now, have been out to make a killing and have been as robust in the defence of their own clients as the unions would be in the defence of their members. So one cannot single out the union movement when it comes to the issue of unfair dismissals. It now traverses a broader spectrum of people in the workplace.
To help balance the equation, there has always been an opportunity for people to seek redress where they feel that they have been unfairly treated or unfairly dismissed. As I have already outlined by reading from the second reading speech, this bill goes nowhere to ensure that there is a fair go all-round and goes nowhere to ensure that there is a fair balance between the rights of employees and employers. People should stand up for their rights as workers, whether they be in the lowest paid of jobs or whether they be in the highest paid of jobs. To assist the worker through the maze of legal obstacles that, in many instances, are designed to intimidate the worker pursuing their rights and, in some cases, make it impossible for them to claim their basic rights, there must be the help of industrial organisations such as unions or industrial relations consultants and/or lawyers.
But at the end of the day, as I have said, very few unfair dismissal claims are ultimately taken to the commission stage. Most, if not the vast majority of, unfair dismissal claims that I have ever had to handle are settled by negotiation. Those negotiations can be protracted in some instances, but invariably they do not touch the industrial commission in any way—they are settled by amicable agreement. In some instances the employee is reinstated and in others the employer and the employee part company. There is an agreed outcome and that makes, in many instances, the need for the industrial commission quite unnecessary.
There are many unfair dismissals that go unchallenged by the employee who has been unfairly dismissed. That is a feature of society not only today but over a long time, so why we have this beat-up of a bill is beyond me. My experience also tells me that in the majority of cases workers want their unfair dismissals resolved quickly or as quickly as is possible in the circumstances. No-one goes down the path of making an unfair dismissal claim against their employer with a view to it being a protracted, drawn out and extensive process. People want something that can resolve their problems simply so that they can get on with their lives.
The reference in the second reading speech to the procedural problems in the process and to the disincentives to speculative and unmeritorious unfair dismissal claims is a smokescreen. The truth of the matter is that people do not want to go down that path. They get no joy from it and there is no fun in it for them whatsoever. People want to get on with their lives. They do not want to be tied up bargaining before an industrial commissioner, because that brings no joy to their hearts at all. A very interesting part of this legislation is at paragraph 26, which inserts the new subclause:
(da) the degree to which the size of the employer's undertaking, establishment or service would be likely to impact on the procedures followed in effecting the termination.
We are now getting down to the nub of the issue, and that is that people in small business want to take it out on their employees. I am going to quote a small case with which I had experience a number of years ago, and that will show how this particular piece of legislation could, in effect, be used against employees. At paragraph 27, at the end of section 170CG, the bill adds:
(4) If the employment of a particular employee or group of employees is terminated on the ground of the operational requirements of the employer's undertaking, establishment or service, the termination is not to be taken to be harsh, unjust or unreasonable, unless the circumstances are exceptional.
I find that exceptional in its own right. What is `exceptional'? `Exceptional', as far as I know, is not defined. The explanatory memorandum to the bill states:
Item 27 proposes the insertion of the new subsection 170CG(4). This amendment would preclude the Commission from making a finding that the termination of an employee or group of employees was harsh, unjust or unreasonable where the respondent employer establishes that the employment was terminated on the ground of the operational requirements at the employer's undertaking, establishment or service, unless the circumstances are exceptional.  
That is a blank cheque to the employers to say, `Do what you like.' Who is going to find that the circumstances that are raised are exceptional? The case that I am about to cite is a real case. It is a case that I dealt with. It is the case of a young 16-year-old female who was employed as the sole person in a business in a shopping arcade. She was under the threat of dismissal if she closed the doors of that shop at any stage throughout the trading day, which was invariably from 8.15 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., for reasons which included things such as having to go to the toilet or going to lunch. We had to intervene on behalf of this young lady. I can see what the employer in this case would be claiming to be the operational requirements. The operational requirements would be to leave the door open: `Do not close the door. If you close the door, you will get sacked.' How is this person to prove exceptional circumstances if she gets sacked because she goes to the toilet? It was not uncommon for this young woman to have blood running down her legs during her menstrual cycle. As grotesque as that is, I am not talking about 50, 60 or 70 years ago; I am talking about within the last 10 years. This person lived in fear. The operational requirements of that business were to keep the door open: `Do not close the door and, if you close it, you will be dismissed.' We had the devil's own job to convince this young person that she had reasonable rights to defend herself against the harshness of the employer. When she did ultimately assert her rights—admittedly under a different act—she found herself dismissed. We had to go through the process of seeking the reinstatement of this person. I cannot be convinced that the shonks out there will not run a battleship or a big truck through this act and burst it wide open, because they will create circumstances to suit themselves for operational grounds and operational procedures and the court will have nothing to go by as to what is considered exceptional. The next paragraph in the explanatory memorandum states:
An employee who claims that his or her selection for redundancy was for a prohibited reason [ie in contravention of a ground or grounds in subsection 170CK(2)] would not be prevented from seeking relief in the Federal Court of Australia for a remedy in respect of unlawful termination. 
So what? That is great. But that is a recipe for employers out there who know nothing about fairness and who know nothing about equity, who know nothing about having a just conscience to run rampant and to run over the rights of people in our society. That, to me, is completely unconscionable and should be resisted under all circumstances. The government has not made out a case, in either the second reading speech or any other material that I have had access to, as to why this bill should be passed. The only reason that the government could want this bill passed is for ideological purposes. But it suits the mantra of the government to seek to make out that there is a problem when in effect one does not exist. I believe that this bill serves no purpose in providing people with a fair, just and equitable system and in giving people the security of employment that they are entitled to. It unbalances the equation. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2001-08-06,"—The Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 which is before the Senate deals with stripping away from Australian workers entitlements they have at the moment to protection from unfair and unjust dismissal. At the very heart of this legislation is an attempt by the Liberal-National Party to create two classes of Australians before the law, one class who will have certain rights in respect to unfair dismissal and another class of employees who will have no rights. I cannot think of a piece of legislation that deals with protections before the law in any respect in this country that does what this bill proposes to do. 
The bill proposes to amend the 1996 legislation. Unfair dismissal laws are a comparatively new inclusion in Commonwealth law. Interestingly—and I will return to this point a little later in my contribution—prior to unfair dismissal laws existing in the federal jurisdiction, they had existed in state jurisdictions, certainly since the creation of states and since allowing states to have their own industrial legislation. As I said, unfair dismissal laws are a comparatively new inclusion in Commonwealth law. They were inserted by the former Labor government. The laws that we are now amending are not Labor's laws, however. The laws that this government seeks to alter are its own industrial laws, laws which the former minister for industrial relations, Mr Reith, proclaimed as a good solution to the problems that the government claimed existed in 1996. The then minister, Mr Reith, said:
We have delivered a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round ...
This is the second occasion that this government have sought to rewrite their own unfair dismissal laws. They sought to do it in the last parliament, they sought to do it in an earlier bill in this parliament and now they are seeking to do it again. On every one of these occasions the parliament—and the Senate—has rejected this government's approach, and so it should. The Labor Party rejects this current bill and will be voting against it. The bill is designed to ensure that workers have less protection and fewer rights in circumstances in which they are dismissed in what would otherwise be determined as unfair and unjust circumstances.
The people of Australia are entitled to ask why this government would want to deny workers access to rights they currently have, rights that protect them against circumstances where they are unfairly or unjustly treated in dismissal, rights this government—the Liberal-National government—confirmed on them. That is more so the case given that these laws are comparatively new laws, enacted by this government and the minister, Mr Reith, and proclaimed by Mr Reith as good laws that deliver `a workable system for dealing with unfair dismissal on the basis of a fair go all round.'
The unfair dismissal laws this government inherited when it came to office in 1996 have themselves been through a process of revision. When Labor first introduced unfair dismissal laws in its 1993 legislation it realised there were some problems with its operation and administration. Subsequently, the Labor Party amended those laws and substantially altered them so that many of the concerns that were identified and raised with the Labor government by various groups in the community were addressed. 
We now deal with the third variation of these laws and the government wants to make further radical change. How does the Liberal-National party justify this effort to reduce Australian workers' rights? The principal argument advanced is a claim that the government will somehow create more jobs. This is a novel approach to job creation. This is the dismissal led jobs growth plan. This is where you create more jobs by making it easier to sack people from the jobs they already have. It is an absurd proposition.
If there is some link between unfair dismissal laws and jobs growth or unemployment, you would think that now, some years on, we would be able to identify that trend with empirical evidence, with some hard data. In fact, the opposite is the case. If you have a look at the unemployment figures since unfair dismissal laws have operated in the Commonwealth jurisdiction you will find that unemployment went down. These laws were introduced by Labor in 1993-94. At that time the unemployment rate was 10 per cent. In the year that followed their introduction unemployment fell to 8.4 per cent.
If these unfair dismissal laws were supposed to prevent jobs being created, if they were supposed to make unemployment worse, you might have thought the unemployment figures would show it. In the many debates that have occurred on previous occasions on this issue no-one on the government side has been able to justify the claim. In fact, the record shows the opposite to be the case. Not only did unemployment fall in the 12 months after Labor introduced its first set of unfair dismissal provisions; it continued to fall in subsequent years. There is no indication, no statistical data, to demonstrate that these laws are an impediment to employment, none whatsoever. What we have is a bald assertion—in fact, an ideological obsession.
As I mentioned earlier, unfair dismissal laws have been common in all states of Australia for generations—not just for four or five years but for decades. For generations the right of workers to protect themselves against unfair and unjust dismissal has been a common feature of state industrial laws, and they have worked well. There is a significant degree of hypocrisy on the part of the government in the way it has handled these matters. In 1995 the then shadow minister was speaking about changes he wanted to make. He said in the House Hansard of 31 May 1995:
Right at the outset I say that there ought to be a proper course of appeal for people who are sacked so that they can ensure that their grievances are properly heard. Let us face it: from time to time some employers will do the wrong thing. They will get no truck from us. There ought to be in place a system to properly safeguard the interests of employees. 
This is one example of this government saying one thing and then proceeding to do exactly the opposite. When it comes to the issue of what impact this has on jobs, there are a couple of contributions we should refer to. The government have time and time again not just said that this would create jobs; they have told us how many jobs it would create. The claim is made that getting rid of unfair dismissal laws for small business would create 50,000 jobs. This is not something that the Liberal-National party have said once; they have said it repeatedly. They have said it on a number of occasions outside of the parliament and also in the parliament. In February 1999, the then Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, said:
Because, if you do that—
that is, if you do not support the unfair dismissal exemptions for small business—
you will destroy the job prospects of 50,000 Australians in small business. 
This was an unqualified claim of 50,000 jobs. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, the next week in parliament—on 15 February 1999—was a little more circumspect. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is far more astute at saying things to produce a perception different to the facts. The former Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business is far more blunt: he is more inclined to endorse the use of the appalling tactics we saw in the waterfront dispute of balaclavas and security guards with baseball bats and dogs. The following week the Prime Minister, when he decided to pursue the issue, said:
 ... if you can get rid of the existing unreasonable, unfair dismissal regime you can generate more jobs. 
Let me remind the Senate that this regime, which the Prime Minister describes as `the existing unreasonable, unfair dismissal regime', is his own law. It is the same regime that his minister described as `a fair go all round'. But now it does not suit them to hold that view. It is exactly the same law described by the Prime Minister in 1999 as `unreasonable and unfair'. He went on—and, as I say, he is a bit more circumspect when it comes to figures—to say:
A figure of 50,000 more jobs has been mentioned by representatives of the small business community.
This mythical figure of 50,000 jobs exists because one man made a statement that 50,000 jobs would be created. Mr Rob Bastian, the Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia—COSBOA—made a statement that, if you got rid of unfair dismissal laws, 50,000 jobs would be created in the small business sector. I think that the Senate is entitled to ask how he arrived at this figure. Where did he get 50,000 jobs from? He guessed. He thought that it would be a good figure. How did he guess it? Off the top of his head. He said, `I reckon about one in every 20 businesses will employ an extra person.' Why one in 20? He does not know. It just seemed to him to be a good idea at the time. Mr Bastian, off the top of his head, said—with not one piece of data from a survey, research or anecdotal evidence; he had nothing to support the claim—that 50,000 jobs would be created.
In most debates on policy as serious and as important as this, his claim would be dismissed as ludicrous and shunned. It is amazing that not only is that not the case but also there are people, such as the minister with responsibility for the portfolio and the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, who have repeated it and repeated it knowing that there was not one shred of evidence to support it. That demonstrates just how callous this government has been in pursuing this issue—effectively, manufacturing an issue where none exists. It also indicates that this debate has nothing to do with economics and the viability of small business, nor anything to do with industrial relations. It is to do with a radical ideological agenda that this Liberal-National Party government has sought to run on industrial relations in a very divisive way since it took office.  
There is one piece of empirical evidence which no-one can dispute and that is the Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, normally referred to as AWIRS. It is the only authoritative survey that has been conducted of workplaces in this country in the last 10 years. It is the most comprehensive survey on workplace matters that has been done in the last decade and arguably much longer. The survey brought up some evidence about what influences a small business to decide whether they will employ people. Responses were given in answers to a question on the reasons for not recruiting employees during the previous 12 months. This is the response from small business—that is, the people that Mr Bastian claims to represent. The most significant reason given as to why companies did not employ an extra person was that they did not need any more employees. The response of 66.2 per cent was, `We just don't need them.' That is fairly understandable. If you do not have demand for your product or service, you do not employ any more people. The next highest response of 23 per cent was, `Not recruited due to insufficient work.' Again, commonsense would tell you that is why business would not employ. `Not recruited due to lack of demand for the product' was the response from a further six per cent. There was a big drop from the second to the third, but when you combine the three responses you get about 95.8 per cent. In fact, the survey allowed multiple answers, so the figures effectively add up to more than 100 per cent. 
We can see from this the only authoritative survey carried out in respect of small business in this country that, overwhelmingly, employers said that the reason they do not employ more people is that they do not need the workers, they have not got the work for them and there is not enough demand for their product. These are very sensible reasons, none of which the Liberal-National Party government has ever accepted. It has never engaged in a debate such as the one we are having this evening. I invite it to do so.
The survey actually contained a reference to unfair dismissal. `Not recruited due to unfair dismissal laws' received a total response of 0.9 per cent. Less than one per cent of small business operators in Australia in the most authoritative survey conducted said that was the reason they did not employ someone. Bear in mind that this was a multiple answer and they could tick more than one reason. Less than one per cent found this to be the factor—not even the most important factor, just any one factor.
One of the key aspects of the bill before the parliament is to change the way in which unfair dismissal applications are dealt with by the commission. At the moment matters go before a conciliation hearing. Some people in this parliament have had some experience with conciliation hearings. Those who have would know that these gatherings are informal with a minimum of legalese. They are discussions in which both sides talk usually very frankly and very often they will come to a resolution because it is an informal gathering where there is give and take. Generally you are able to sort out your problems by getting to the central issue without overburdening the process with legalities and formalities. This legislation turns that process on its head. The bill says that if a worker takes a matter to the conciliation hearing and the commissioner decides that the case is unlikely to succeed then the worker will no longer have the right to pursue that matter to get an actual judgment, to receive a determination. That will ensure that conciliation is the first and final part of the process, and it will require parties to conduct the full case with all the legalese that comes with that.
This bill proposes the commission must take into account the size of a business when determining the merits of the case and the outcome of the case. This is a backdoor way of trying to get the parliament to agree to something that the parliament has now on at least two occasions refused to accept—that is, if you work for a small company with a limited number of employees, whether that is defined as 15 or 20, depending on the government's mood you are somehow to be given fewer rights. That means you can be dealt with more harshly, you can be sacked unfairly and unjustly and not have the same rights as a person in identical circumstances working for another company or for a larger employer. Let me give as an example a bar attendant in a small club which has five or six employees. If such attendants are threatened or harassed in their employment, they have no rights to go before a commission, whereas employees in a large club in identical circumstances have the right to be heard before the commission. There are two levels of rights with this legislation creating second-class citizens. It is a morally bankrupt principle; it is a sound reason why this legislation should be rejected.",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2001-08-06,"—In the very short time that is available to me this evening, I want to continue the theme that Senator Sherry has just been expounding that this government is intent upon legislating to create second-class employees—that is, second-class in terms of their rights. I suppose you say the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill 2000 has been before the Senate on a previous occasion and I suppose the government believes that, like the dockers, you have to win some time. But the reality is that, if there is any justice in terms of the legislation currently before the Senate, this bill will not be passed. It will be rejected for the very simple reason that there can be no justification in singling out those people working for small business—no doubt they are earning on average less than employees in larger businesses and with fewer long-term prospects—who are required to be more flexible and more valuable employees to keep a small business afloat and then to insult these employees by saying, `Yes, but because of the size of the business in which you work, your rights to seek redress if you are unfairly dismissed will be curtailed.' This is what this legislation is all about. It is amazing to think that, in the period leading up to the federal election, this government cannot find something more likely to deal with the real needs of the community such as, for example, correcting some of the mess that has been created with its business activity statement. I have not met anyone in the community who has been satisfied with the government's response on the business activity statement to date. 
Debate interrupted.  ",SENATE,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2001-08-06,"—I would like to speak tonight about my very good friend former Senator John Woodley, who retired from the Senate very recently. This is the first opportunity any of us have had to speak about him. I know one of the reasons he retired as he did—that is, he did not tell anybody he was leaving until after the Senate had risen—is that he does not fancy valedictory speeches. But, too bad, I am going to do one anyway and I know there are others who want to speak about John tonight as well.
John started off in this place in 1993 and he was, as I understand it, the only new senator elected at that election. He had spent his life until that point mostly as a Uniting Church or Methodist minister and mostly in outback Queensland. I know he spent a couple of years in the Navy doing national service and he enjoyed those years, and he really loved the time he spent in the Queensland outback and as a church minister in Queensland. I am pretty sure he quite enjoyed the time he spent in this Senate as well. His first bit of business in this chamber was speaking to an opposition motion on rural Australia and his last bit of business was the dairy assistance bill. I could give senators three guesses as to what his favourite portfolio was, but everyone would get it right.
John once stated that he would try to get as many quotes from the Bible in Hansard as he possibly could, so the whip could always rely him on when we needed a speaker on pretty well anything. Because of that, I have my Bible here with me this evening and I am going to finish off with a couple of quotes from the Bible which I think are accurately descriptive of John. I have a few statistics here from Hansard which I am sure John would enjoy. He made the most interjections bar one of any Democrat senator ever—so far. His first interjection occurred on his second day as a senator. Now that is very disorderly of him, and he is not a disorderly sort of person. It is quite amazing, but he could not help himself with interjections. Despite the large number, not one of John's interjections was offensive, and we have been through all of them. They were much more likely to be supportive of his fellow Democrat senators. It was very nice standing here giving a speech and hearing a very loud `Hear, hear!' coming from next to me or words to the effect that what I was saying was the most brilliant piece of oratory that had ever been heard—despite the fact that it was not, but it was very nice hearing it. He was gently chiding of the government and the opposition and was very funny in his interjections. I remember he once congratulated Senator Crane on his ability to smile in an interjection, which was interesting.
One of those interjections was his offering to go with Senator Herron to have a Chinese meal. I do not think Senator Herron took him up on that offer, but I should tell Senator Herron that John does not appear to be any less busy now than when he was in the Senate. So Senator Herron may still miss out on that treat! Although, I recommend that he go to Queensland and have a meal with John, because that is always a very pleasant thing to do.
John came to Democrat senators' assistance on a regular basis in debates. He was always protecting us from others in this place. Madam President, I know that he gallantly came to your assistance on a few occasions, particularly in question time. He has also been very supportive of Senator Boswell, although there was one occasion in 1997 during a very stressful and very lengthy native title legislation debate when he called Senator Boswell `a dope'. I think that is the worst he ever got in abusive terms. I know that afterwards he genuinely regretted saying that. John once said that he believed that his Democrat colleagues suspected him of being `too reasonable', so he resolved to be unreasonable sometimes. But I am sorry to say that I think he failed miserably in that attempt. John was never anything but reasonable, and he is still not anything but reasonable. 
He has an obvious interest in both animals and food. I am sure all of us here remember his `cooked chicken' campaign, and the campaign on dairy and the campaign on sugar. Anyone who has been in Democrat party meetings will not forget the campaign on the mahogany glider, which he kept up for years—it felt like years; it may only have been months.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—It is `years'. I am sure that the fact that we still have mahogany gliders in this country is almost solely due to John and his famous mahogany glider campaign. His persistence did usually pay off. One example was his reference to a committee of the impact of native wildlife farming. The motion took so long to get through the Senate that one whip was heard to remark that the wildlife concerned were probably extinct by the time it got through. But at least we were having the debate. There is one very lovely quote from Senator Vanstone where she says that John was `very sweet when he got excited', which is so very Senator Vanstone to say such a thing; but it is also very true.  
John took his pastoral duties very seriously. He publicly absolved Andrew Bartlett's sins during Andrew's first speech. I am confidently told by Andrew that he has not sinned since. I think that is an excellent record. Absolutely no sins ever since then! 
—John absolved him of all his sins. Senator Schacht, I suggest that you might like to talk to ex-Senator Woodley. It would probably do you an enormous amount of good. 
I will miss John enormously in this place. I sat next to him for years. He could always be relied on to cheer me up. He could usually be relied on to have eucalyptus drops—not that we would ever eat in the Senate chamber because that would be highly disorderly—most of the time. His work in the Senate has been totally dedicated. Everyone knows how hard he worked, particularly as the chair of the rural and regional committee. He is a very hard worker and a very decent human being. His compassion is pretty legendary, especially in the Democrats. He has been a member of the Democrats for a very long time, almost since our inception. He was the president of the Queensland branch for many years and our national ombudsman during one of the most difficult times we have ever had. He carried that through extraordinarily well; it was such a difficult thing to do. We were all most grateful that he was there at the time. He has promised that he will come back and see us in Parliament House and also visit me in my Sydney office. I am really looking forward to him popping in for the first time.
I would like to finish with a couple of quotes from the Bible, which I thought was a very appropriate thing to finish on. When John first started as a senator in the early nineties, I said a few words of a quote that I liked from the Bible but could only vaguely remember, and he knew immediately where it was in the Bible and what the whole quote was about. It is a rather nice one. I think it sums John's attitude up very well. I will quote it to the Senate. It is from Proverbs 25:21:
If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
For thou shalt heap coals of fire thus upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.
I try to do that. It is not that easy, I have to say, with some people but I am still trying—and I will keep trying, John. I would like to finish with a rather nice quote that, I am pleased to say, I found myself. It is from 3 John 14 and 15. I was just going to sit down after quoting that reference so that everybody would have to run to their Bibles and read it out, but I will read it out anyway, just in case you do not all run to your Bibles, which would be a fairly shocking thing. It reads:
I hope to see you soon, and we will talk together face to face. Peace to you. The friends send you their greetings.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Valedictory: John Woodley</title>,Adjournment,26,1
