"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-08-21,"—At the request of the Chair of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Senator Tchen, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today he shall move:
That the Iraq (Reconstruction and Repeal of Sanctions) Regulations 2003, as contained in Statutory Rules 2003 No. 97 and made under the Customs Act 1901, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 and the Migration Act 1958, be disallowed.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the committee's concerns with these regulations.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Iraq (Reconstruction and Repeal of Sanctions) Regulations 2003, Statutory Rules 2003 No.97
The Regulations implement the obligations imposed by United Nations Resolution 1483 (2003).
Regulation 3 defines the term “senior Iraqi official” as (a) former President Saddam Hussein or (b) “another person who was a senior official”. This definition is central to the definition of the term “government asset” which, in turn, is central to offence creating provisions in the Regulations (see regulations 10 and 11). The phrase “another person who was a senior official” is unclear. Given that the term is tied to offence-creating regulations, the Committee has sought advice from the Minister on whether a clearer definition is possible.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I think it might be better for the senator to seek leave to make a short statement rather than deny formality. It may be more expeditious. If she were to do so, it would certainly be granted by us.
—I think the intention is to have the motion declared formal, then to make the comments and put it to a vote. Are there any objections to it being taken as formal? There being no objection, I call Senator McLucas.
Senator McLUCAS (Queensland) (9.36 a.m.)—I move:
That the time for the presentation of the report of the Select Committee on Medicare, and on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003 be extended to 30 October 2003.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I know that the Senate Select Committee on Medicare is particularly important and that there has been considerable interest in it. But I am concerned about this extension, and I am concerned about part of the reason for this extension—that is, the referral to engage a consultant. I do not really have a problem on the basis of the committee wanting to get a consultant to have a look at a certain aspect of the inquiry—that is fine. But I think the consultant should in fact be an independent person or group of people. Unfortunately, in this instance we do not have that situation at present with the Senate committee.
I think that is a great shame because it potentially tarnishes the report that they will give to the committee at the cost of nearly $25,000 of taxpayers' money. I refer to the fact that Professor Swerissen, who is heading this inquiry, has a very long association with the Labor Party as a staff member. He also has a very close association with a Labor minister in Victoria. Professor Duckett has also had a very long association with the Labor Party. He has already put in a submission to the inquiry and has stated his case—very much against everything that the government is doing. That is his right but we cannot then pretend that he is an independent person. The same applies to Mr Livingstone, another person who is part of the referral. He is certainly a person who has written some very derogatory things about the package. Once again, that is his right. I am not denying anyone their right to have a voice against the package. I am saying that the reason this inquiry is being extended is that these people are being asked to make an independent assessment of the package, yet we cannot even get from them the assumptions on which they will make that independent assessment. I requested, first, that the committee look at the assumptions that would be the basis on which they would form their conclusions and, second, that the committee engage someone who is truly independent. I want to put on record the government's position in this regard. We do not oppose the seeking of information; we oppose the fact that this information is potentially tarnished already by the publicly stated positions of the individuals who will be making the assessment.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I would like to make a few points. We asked the department questions on this issue when the department came before the committee and we were told they had done no work, had done no modelling and had no information. The committee have looked around and I believe we have found an organisation whose own standing depends on providing us with verifiable, detailed information. I suppose we could keep looking but the committee are trying to get this done as quickly as possible.
As for Senator Knowles's last comment about not having the information as to how it will be structured, that is part of the brief. Because the department could give us nothing on any inflationary effects and just kept saying there were none—but could not show how they came to that conclusion—we obviously needed to develop a model of how we looked at the issue. That is part of the cost. This is an organisation that has done this sort of work before. I find it quite disappointing that we have taken three individuals and somehow implied that they are not able to be independent and professional. I understand that Stephen Duckett actually worked for Jeff Kennett. I do not think who a person has worked for is in any way relevant. I think we need to look at three highly professional people.
—Meg, get a grip on life.
—If the minister is going to get upset just because these people were amongst those who attended the health summit, I am very disappointed. We have the opportunity to get some information that the committee need in order to do our work. On the point Senator Knowles raised about timing, this is not going to hold us up. One of the things that is holding us up is the volume of submissions and information that we get at each of the hearings. The committee secretariat are under enormous pressure. We have already had someone seconded from the department to assist but the secretariat are working 10-hour days already as they begin doing the outline of the report. This is not something that we have dreamed up just to delay the process. It is essential that we get some more detail and information, particularly when we cannot get anything out of the department.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I made some remarks in relation to the timing of committees reporting on bills yesterday in the debate on the tabling of the Selection of Bills Committee report. Again we have here, from a management of the Senate's business point of view, a significant piece of legislation, a significant piece of the government's program, and the Senate is being kept from being able to deal with it until, effectively, the last fortnight.
—This is not our fault.
—I am just making a point; I am not having a go at anybody. We will be back here in November and we will have a list of the normal 40, 50 or 60 bills that we want to bring forward. We will have lectures from people saying that we should sit more weeks and do this and that. These sittings contain roughly 10 weeks of sitting time: we are sitting two weeks on and two weeks off, with one exception, through to December. In this motion before us today is a request for an extension of time for a committee that has already had the legislation before it for many weeks. It would have, if it were to report on time, yet another three weeks from today to consider the bill or bills and it is seeking an extension of a further seven weeks, which takes the reporting date out to 30 October, as I read the motion. Although it is not public at this stage, we have a proposal to extend the estimates hearings in November, which will effectively take out the week commencing 3 November. 
—It will be extended by one day.
—Two days. We will talk about that.
—What are you talking about?
—We are actually talking about the program, Senator Forshaw. It will probably not bother you.
—It does; I'm on the committee.
—It is an important issue because you will be here complaining, Senator Forshaw, about the management of the program and why you are sitting up until four o'clock in the morning. Your party is about to vote for a resolution to extend the reporting date for one bill for a further seven weeks. My view is that this is a form of delay and obstruction. If it is not, it is very bad management. I cannot see why this committee should not be able to report by say, if it needs an extension, 7 October to give us that October fortnight to deal with these bills. This motion means that the bills cannot be dealt with during the September sittings and they cannot be dealt with during the three weeks we sit in October. Depending on how we resolve the estimates hearing, which is what the banter across the table was about, that leaves us either one day in the week of November or no days, and then the final fortnight in December. With this bill and a number of other bills that have again been delayed in committees, we are effectively ensuring that a range of major packages will not be considered by the Senate until the final fortnight.
Quite frankly, if you need an extension for this committee—and I have heard what Senator Lees has said and I respect it—then I think it would be reasonable to have an extension but to have an extension of a further month and not a further, effectively, two months. In other words, we should have the reporting date of 7 October, which gives you six weeks to extend the inquiry and still gives the Senate the opportunity to deal with these bills in the October sitting period, not to effectively delay consideration of the bills until the end of November. That is a reasonable thing to do. It means the Senate can actually manage its program and it also means that the bills are going to have an enormous length of time before a committee. All I am asking for is a reasonable approach, not one which is clearly unreasonable and which will make the program very hard to manage towards the end of the year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-08-21,"by leave—The proposals from the government are the most significant changes to affect Medicare since its inception. We have had over 190 submissions to this inquiry and by the end of next week we will have had 11 days of hearings, and they are not yet completed. We have been to all states of Australia and we will be taking evidence from the Northern Territory as well. The community is asking for a broader debate about the effects of the government's proposals on Medicare, not a shortened debate. Many of the submissions, including some of the most significant submissions, have said that we need a long-term inquiry into health care in Australia. 
The Manager of Government Business has said that the Senate has referred a piece of legislation. He needs to be reminded that there have been two references to this committee, very extensive terms of reference and then, subsequently, the legislation. As the chair of the committee, I asked the secretariat to develop a time line in order to properly consider the extensive work that community members, academics and people interested in health care in this nation have done and to enable them to give evidence to the inquiry. It is only right that we do those pieces of work justice. They have advised the committee that it is only possible to deliver the report in the week of 27 to 30 October and it is right that we take that advice.
Senator Knowles made comments about the approval by you—and I thank you—for us to seek advice from the Australian Institute for Primary Care. I think her comments on some of the individuals who will be doing that research are unfounded. I asked Senator Knowles and other members of the Liberal Party to offer an alternative institution or group that would be able to provide the quality of advice that we require, and nothing was forthcoming. The Australian Institute for Primary Care are a well-regarded academic group. They have proposed to us that they will need four weeks from the date of contract to complete their work. It is understood that the date of contract is today, and four weeks from today will take us past even the reporting date of 9 September.
As I said, the community wants a bigger and more in-depth debate about Medicare, not a shortened or curtailed debate as the Liberal Party have attempted to do right from the instigation of this inquiry. The Liberal Party did not want understanding of what the effects of their Medicare package would be. As Senator Lees has said, the department has not been forthcoming with any evidence about the inflationary effects of the government's proposals on health care in this nation. That is why we have had to commission work from external bodies. It is a sensible and reasonable request for an extension.
—It is delay and obstruction on your part.
—Order, Senator Campbell.
—I refute absolutely that this is an unreasonable request for an extension. We need to do justice to the submissions that have been given to us and to the need for debate about health care in this nation, and curtailing this in the way that the Liberal Party are proposing is improper.
—It is not curtailing it. You have had three months for this inquiry.
—Order, Senator Campbell.
—You have not read one of the submissions, so why don't you shut up.
—Senator Forshaw, that was uncalled for. There is too much noise across the chamber.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. I ask you to ask Senator Forshaw to withdraw that unparliamentary remark.
—Mr President, I think that is a ludicrous point of order. I suggest to you that the term `shut up' is not unparliamentary. What is unparliamentary, of course, is a senator shouting across the chamber. You may care to make that point. All interjections are disorderly and the opposition will not tolerate the situation if opposition senators are called to order when government senators continually interject and are not called to order. 
—Senator Faulkner, I have been trying to restore order to the chamber. Shouting across the chamber, as everybody knows, is disorderly. Shouting across the chamber from both sides is out of order. Can we get back to the debate and get on with the day's business?
—Senator Knowles made some comments about the assumptions that the Australian Institute for Primary Care will have to make in order to complete the work that they have begun. Senator Knowles should have read the contract proposal from the Australian Institute for Primary Care. It is advised in that proposal that additional time would make it possible to test parameter assumptions with key health economists and health service researchers and to improve the quality of the data. We would need extra time, and Senator Knowles knows that. We have decided not to take that option. We know that the quality of work from this institute will be sound. I only wish that the department had been forthcoming with information so that we would not have had to progress down this track.

Leave granted. 
—Senator Knowles had indicated that she was going to deny formality and have a debate on this. There was an agreement between all parties that we would not deny formality on the basis that we would allow statements by leave. This is a clear breach of that undertaking and understanding. Clearly, the opposition whip does not like to have this debate. If we had wanted to we could have denied formality but in good faith, having made that decision at the request of the opposition whip not to deny formality and to have statements by leave, we stuck by that. We have now had a breach of that agreement. What it says to the coalition is that in future when we get undertakings from the opposition whip they cannot be trusted and cannot be taken at her word and that in future we will have to deny formality and have a full-blown debate.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. I indicate that if the Manager of Government Business in the Senate is going to get so het up about this, we will grant leave for anyone who wishes to make a contribution to this debate for however long it takes.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I thank the opposition for their reconsideration of this matter. I also note that Senator Lyn Allison might wish to make a comment. I have some new evidence, information and argument to put to the Senate so that the matter can be reconsidered very carefully. Firstly, I want to agree with Senator McLucas's comment about the fact that this is an important inquiry. Of course Medicare is important and that is why we are considering this matter very carefully.  
The issue is not the importance of the inquiry; the issue is the integrity and the independence and the objectivity of those conducting the research—that is, the Australian Institute for Primary Care and in particular Professors Duckett, Serjeantson, Livingston and Weeks. Let me make it clear that Professor Duckett has already made a submission to the inquiry that is critical of the government. Secondly, Livingston, in the public arena in a left-wing publication, Dissent, has been highly derogatory about the Medicare proposals put forward by the government. So two of the main consultants to the inquiry have already got preconceived views. They are by no means independent or objective. That should be taken as read.
The other point that I want to make is that our instructions to the Australian Institute for Primary Care were quite clear. Our instructions stated:
Do some research on the government's proposals and the opposition's proposals and the inflationary effects, if any.
They responded by saying:
Thank you for asking me for advice on our capacity to conduct research on the inflationary effects on health care costs for consumers that are likely to emerge.
This is a point that I brought up in the committee, and I bring it up again now for senators. They have a preconceived view that there will be inflationary effects—and we said `if any'. So the instructions are very important. I think they have preconceived views that there will be inflationary effects, and of course there is nothing in the Medicare package that forces doctors to charge more. Senator Kay Patterson has made that point very clearly time and again. So we are spending $22,000 of taxpayers' money. There are other alternatives out there and I say for the benefit of Senator McLucas that one of those is Econtech. That point has been raised and it is put again to the Senate chamber. I think you should reconsider very carefully your position.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-21,"—by leave—It is unfortunate that we are having this debate. I think that the committee has tried very hard to be cooperative with the government. I want to respond to Senator Ian Campbell's remarks earlier, which I was not in the chamber to hear. I understand that he is aggrieved at what he says is my agreement to deal with the bill sooner than the end of October. What I did say, in answer to his question in a whips meeting the other day, was that I would talk with the chair, as I did, and consider whether we could bring the bills on for debate prior to reporting on the more general terms of reference. Indeed, the committee talked about a kind of two-stage process whereby we might be able to deal with the legislation and do a short report about it and then do a more general one further down the track. Having thought about this carefully and having discussed it with the secretariat, the chair is of the view that that is not going to be easy—it may be impossible. I accept that. 
All I said to Senator Ian Campbell was that I would give an undertaking to explore the idea, which I did. I have indicated that I accept the arguments. It is in our interests to do this as quickly as possible. I do not want to spend the rest of the year travelling around the country on this inquiry—worthy though it may be. As Senator McLucas says, there are good arguments for extending it to an even more general inquiry. 
I want to respond to some of the remarks that have been made by both Senator Knowles and Senator Barnett with regard to the so-called political bias of those people we have chosen to provide us with information about the inflationary effects. It is clutching at straws to suggest that, because `if any' was removed from the terms of reference, those who are producing this report will take that to mean that there will be some inflationary effects and they will therefore need to find them. What an insult to some of the most seriously professional people in the health sector to suggest that to include or to exclude those two words makes any difference. I find that extraordinary.  
I turn to political bias. It is an interesting time to be talking about political bias in this field. This week we saw a health alliance meet at Old Parliament House on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The government dismissed that group of absolutely eminent people in the medical sector as being political stooges. 
—She did not.
—The minister says she did not call them stooges, and maybe that is right. Nonetheless, they were tagged with the label of being political, having bias, or in some extraordinary manner just supporting a political point of view. Again, that is a huge insult to an eminent group of people who are serious about health in this country and who came together—for the first time ever, as far as we know—to debate where this country should be going. 
The reason we are having this inquiry is that the government has not done so. The government has not sat down with those people. It has not sat down with the people at the coalface. It has not sat down with the people who designed Medicare in the first place. Professor Duckett and the like have been denigrated by the government for simply speaking up about what they see as being wrong with this bill. I find that extraordinary. Essentially this committee is doing the government's work for it. The government should have been out there showing leadership, talking to these people about what needs to be done to solve the impasse between the Commonwealth and the states over the health care agreements, to ameliorate what we all know to be the inflationary effects of this package. That is what the submissions are saying to us. We have not had a submission from someone saying, `It is not going to be inflationary and here are the reasons why; we will spell it all out.' Maybe the department could do that, but they have been reluctant so far. In fact, they have said they have not taken the time—no doubt at government instruction—to do this. 
So the committee is in no other position but to say, `We need this expertise. We have all these submissions saying there are inflationary effects. How do we test that? Is it just anecdotal? Is it just political? Is it just people who do not like the government who are saying this? How do we test it?' We get expert advice to do that, and that is what we have done. 
Certainly my effort in this inquiry will be to bring forward the reporting date. I hope we can report earlier than that, and I think there is a chance we can, but at this stage that is the best estimate. Can I say something else about the secretariat arrangements. There are constant pressures on our committee secretaries and their staff. They work extremely hard. But if there are any delays in this place—I do not have evidence for this and maybe we should do a study on it—it is because the constant cuts imposed on the Department of the Senate mean that our secretaries cannot do this work faster than they currently do. If we had more staff, perhaps we could report sooner. It is very difficult. So if there is to be some inquiry into why this report is late, let us have a look at whether the Senate's secretariat staffing arrangements are adequately resourced. I think we might find that they are not.  
As I understand it, there is the capacity for the Senate to have four select committees going at any one point in time. We currently have two. Staff for the Medicare inquiry have been taken from other committees that are busy trying to write their own reports, which has put a lot of pressure on other departments. In this place we ought to have the funds to be able to set up two more committees and have them properly staffed. Where is that money? It is just not available. That is because we have taken 14 per cent out of budgets through so-called `efficiency dividends', or whatever they are called, over the last few years. So if there is to be a complaint about the speed with which we can do this work, let us have a look at the resourcing that goes into it.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I am disturbed about the direction of this debate. I know Senator Knowles and, despite her right-wing views on a number of things, she is a decent sort of person. I am amazed at the direction in which she is seeking to take the Senate chamber today. Senator Knowles, Senator Moore and a number of other senators and I have been involved in an inquiry into poverty and financial hardship. Senator Knowles would know as well as I do that the people who have been appearing before us to give evidence have said that the lack of bulk-billing in a number of areas, particularly in regional Australia, has been a significant factor contributing to their financial hardship. 
As I have said, Senator Knowles's actions today are certainly out of character. Despite the fact that during the inquiry that Senator Moore and I sat on an overwhelming number of witnesses were critical of the government and the government's actions and policies, Senator Knowles sat there and made sure that the government's position was at least articulated and upheld. I do not want to say too much today, because I know my colleagues, including Senator Forshaw, are about to make a significant contribution, but I would think that the actions of Senator Knowles are certainly out of character. I know that she is off to New York shortly and I hope that she represents the country well in that endeavour. I am a bit disturbed by the direction Senator Knowles has taken today. One of Senator Knowles's favourite sayings is `sawing through sawdust', and I hope that we do not do that today. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I seek to saw through the sawdust a bit more. I want to make a couple of brief points. Yes, this is one of the most significant changes proposed to Medicare since its inception, which is why the powers of the Senate to properly and independently scrutinise the legislation should be respected and exerted to the full. We need to ensure that the sieve that the Senate applies to this legislation is a very fine one, and I share the concerns of other senators on this side of the chamber that the process being used to do that is not one that will produce that result. I am concerned about the idea of commissioning this particular institute to conduct that work, in particular because several of the parties have had involvement in the issues already. Several of the parties to this study are already on the record on these issues and perhaps, most significantly, one of the parties, Professor Duckett, has actually made a submission to the committee.
—He is going to examine his submission, is he?
—Indeed, Senator Abetz picks up the very point. Professor Duckett and his colleagues will be asked in effect to comment inter alia on their own work. They will be asked to judge: did we get it right? Did we come to the right conclusion? It seems to me that in a wide world with many people with expertise, when there are many people who could conduct this kind of work, there are others you would choose to do that kind of study. Senator Barnett has put on the record today that Econtech is a well-respected firm already working in this field which could provide that expertise. None of the members of Econtech have already put a submission in to the committee. In those circumstances, why not choose those sorts of people? 
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Interjections are disorderly and particularly disorderly when they are not made from senators' designated seats. I would remind senators to come to order. Let's get this debate sorted out in a civil fashion.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. You are quite right: it is disorderly. What I have indicated is that Econtech is a tory front and I think that should be acknowledged in the chamber.
—There is no point of order.
—I am of the view that in this great nation of ours of almost 20 million people it is possible to find some professionals who are not tainted by existing contributions to this important public debate and who have not already put some particular position on the record in this debate. If you want to find somebody who is neutral, the last people you would go to are the ones who have been chosen by the committee. They are already clearly on the record as having a position and they are not the people to do this study. My recommendation is to find somebody else; that is not the view of the committee. In those circumstances, it is most unfortunate that we taint this process by not giving the committee the chance to properly analyse the evidence and the issues that are before it at the present time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—There are two issues at the heart of this debate. The first one is the issue of the extension of time for the committee to report. The second issue, which really we should not be debating here, is the decision by you, Mr President, to approve the decision of the select committee to have the research undertaken. I find it somewhat disgraceful that for the last half an hour we have had government senators, members of the select committee—Senators Knowles, Barnett and Humphries—attacking the decision of the President. I think that is outrageous. That was a debate that we had in the committee and the committee made a decision. The President has upheld the decision. That should be the end of the matter.
If we wanted to go on and talk about bias and so on we could be here all day talking about examples of the bias the current coalition government have shown in research projects that they have had undertaken. Let us look at just a couple. Who chaired the inquiry into energy? Former senator Warwick Parer. Who chaired the inquiry into Telstra? Dick Estens, a well-known long-time supporter of the National Party. He came up with the sorts of outcomes that the government wanted in the first place. And these senators opposite have the temerity to stand up here and talk about independence! What an absolute farce. Just a moment ago we heard Senator Abetz say, `We should have got the Institute of Public Affairs to do it.' The point is that the research needs to be undertaken. It is going to be done in as short a time as possible because the committee is concerned about endeavouring to get this report completed and tabled in the parliament so that we can then get on with debating the legislation. 
If we had had a lot more time, if the Senate Select Committee on Medicare did not have the pressure of the government's legislation before us, we would have been looking to have a lot more detailed research undertaken into this whole issue of the future of Medicare, particularly the inflationary impacts of the government's package and other issues that need to be examined. The reason we have had to take this step is that when we asked the Department of Health and Ageing to give us the modelling, the research and the data on their claim that this package is not inflationary they would not do it and they could not do it. This has been a major issue of debate throughout our public hearings. It was a very reasonable decision for the committee to take to have this research undertaken.
The other couple of points I want to make are with regard to the timetable for the committee. Let us remember that, firstly, the select committee was established on 26 June. As Senator McLucas, the chair of the committee, has said, it was given very broad, detailed terms of reference to look at the government's package, to look at alternative packages and to look at a range of other health care issues. One would have expected, in the normal course of events, such a select committee to have taken a substantial period of time to examine issues of that detail and to bring down a report. I can recall select committees established back in the days when we were in government doing that. One inquiry—into broadcasting, I think—chaired by Senator Alston ran for well over a year or two years, to my recollection. I stand to be corrected.
—It was attacking the ABC.
—The Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations—it just went on and on.
—Like you are now.
—Yes, and you have given me leave to do that, Senator Vanstone, so I am going to. The Senate needs to be reminded of these facts. In all the circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to have expected that this committee would have taken some time to examine those issues. The other aspect of this is that the legislation was referred to the select committee. Conscious of that—conscious that we have a duty to have that legislation debated in the Senate—we deliberately set out to ensure that that could be done and that the committee could do its work in as short a time as reasonably possible. It has proven to be the case that we need an extension for a few more weeks. At the end of the period of time that is being sought we would report on 30 October. That would be approximately four months for this committee to have done its work.
Let us look at the work it has been doing. As Senator McLucas has said, we have had over 190 submissions. They are not just form letters. Submissions of great detail have been given to us by various organisations—the AMA, various divisions of general practice, various community health groups, state governments and a broad range of interest groups involved in and interested in health care. We have had public hearings in every state, including Queensland when we go to Brisbane and Bundaberg next week. We will then go to Melbourne and come back to Canberra next Thursday for the final day of hearings. This committee sat for a good deal of time during the break and undertook a very tight and intensive program. Some of the members of this committee, including Senator Knowles and Senator Humphries, were also members of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into poverty and financial hardship—chaired by you, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins—which has been travelling as well. So there has been a lot of hard work put in by all members from all sides. 
Clearly that has also impacted upon the secretariat. The secretariat of the Senate community affairs committee are handling the logistics of the select committee on Medicare and also having to do all their other work, including the inquiry into poverty, so they have been under great time pressure. They have done a fantastic job of ensuring that both committees—the select committee and the Community Affairs References Committee—could get their work done. It has proved to be the case that we need more time. We need more time for the research work to be done and we then need the usual amount of time—and it is a very tight timetable—for the draft report to be prepared, for that to be examined by the committee and for any dissenting reports and so on.
The committee secretariat and opposition members of the committee have bent over backwards to meet a timetable that will allow this legislation to be debated this year. But today the government senators have tried to use the forum of the Senate to overturn decisions that were arrived at by the committee. They have never wanted this inquiry. They wanted to have major changes made to Medicare in this country and yet not to have a real public inquiry into them. They did not want it in the first place. They opposed the proposition to establish the select committee. They really did not want to travel and hear from the public, and today they are trying to put more roadblocks in the way of this committee doing its work. I urge the Senate to support wholeheartedly the extension of time for this committee to report. It is not unusual. In fact, if you go through the Senate records you will find many instances where committees dealing with—with no disrespect—public issues a lot less serious than the issues this committee is dealing with have had extensions granted simply in order to be able to do the job they have been charged with doing. On this occasion, this is a very reasonable request and it should be supported.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I want to add a couple of comments to the debate that has been fairly widely canvassed this morning. Senator McLucas has explained the circumstances of this request for an extension of time. The issue that really is of concern to me is the extent to which the government senators who are participating on this committee have been so critical of the proposal by the committee to seek some research from the Australian Institute for Primary Care. I think it is important to remind the Senate that, while government senators have been quite vocal about their concerns of bias by this group, the Australian Institute for Primary Care is a highly renowned group which has done extensive research in health economics. The research that has been proposed to look at the inflationary costs of this package relates to both the government's A Fairer Medicare package and the opposition's proposal. It is not as though the committee is trying to get the Australian Institute for Primary Care to have a very critical analysis of the government's proposal without examining the opposition's alternative.
The kind of work that is required to be done is for information that has not been provided by the department on direct health care costs to consumers. It is of concern to the committee that that information has not been made available to us. The research required is based on the fact that we know that direct health care costs to consumers associated with GP visits are a function of the fees that are charged by GPs, so any costs such as private health insurance that consumers incur to offset the risk of out-of-pocket expenses, which are the gap fees proposed by the government in health insurance, are going to impact on consumers. While Senator Barnett has taken quite an interesting line on the inflationary effect, if this research indicates that there are zero inflationary effects then the committee will be very pleased to receive that information. The research is to look at the estimate of aggregate inflationary effects on direct costs for consumers which are likely to be a function of the impact of proposed changes on GP fees and charges, including bulk-billing, the supply of GP services, consumers' use of GP services and consumers' use of GP substitute services, such as public hospital emergency departments; and information about bulk-billing, GP fees and charges, and consumer utilisation of GP services. We have a real problem in that there are a number of unknowns about the impact of the proposed changes on the factors that affect direct costs for consumers. That is the issue that we are really concerned about. 
We have had over 190 submissions to the inquiry so far and there is only one submission that is actually complimentary of the government's package, and that of course is from the department. Every other submission is quite critical of some factors of the package and of the legislation, and that is of concern to all committee members, not just those from the opposition. I think it is important that we do recognise that this extension of time is an important, genuine and valid request, and that members of the Senate do support it. It is important for us to get the work done well.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Select Committee on Medicare</title>,Committees,4,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—It is important to recognise that the process of making the decision about whom we would commission—the Australian Institute for Primary Care—was made at a private meeting of this committee. It was made after deliberation about alternatives. I actually offered Liberal members of the committee an opportunity to propose alternative people whom we could ask to do the work. There was nothing forthcoming from other members of the committee and so the decision was made. It is wrong to stand up in this chamber today, after these discussions have been held for about a fortnight, and offer an alternative now, suggesting that we could have asked Econtech. We have no information about their ability to do medical modelling. I think it has been very wrong for Liberal members of the committee to attack the professionalism of members of the Australian Institute for Primary Care. I think it is very disappointing that people's personal reputations can be denigrated in such a way when they are eminent people in health economic research in this country.

—I think the intention is to have the motion declared formal, then to make the comments and put it to a vote. Are there any objections to it being taken as formal? There being no objection, I call Senator McLucas.
Senator McLUCAS (Queensland) (9.36 a.m.)—I move:
That the time for the presentation of the report of the Select Committee on Medicare, and on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003 be extended to 30 October 2003.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,4,2,speech
"Knowles, Sen Susan",LP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I know that the Senate Select Committee on Medicare is particularly important and that there has been considerable interest in it. But I am concerned about this extension, and I am concerned about part of the reason for this extension—that is, the referral to engage a consultant. I do not really have a problem on the basis of the committee wanting to get a consultant to have a look at a certain aspect of the inquiry—that is fine. But I think the consultant should in fact be an independent person or group of people. Unfortunately, in this instance we do not have that situation at present with the Senate committee.
I think that is a great shame because it potentially tarnishes the report that they will give to the committee at the cost of nearly $25,000 of taxpayers' money. I refer to the fact that Professor Swerissen, who is heading this inquiry, has a very long association with the Labor Party as a staff member. He also has a very close association with a Labor minister in Victoria. Professor Duckett has also had a very long association with the Labor Party. He has already put in a submission to the inquiry and has stated his case—very much against everything that the government is doing. That is his right but we cannot then pretend that he is an independent person. The same applies to Mr Livingstone, another person who is part of the referral. He is certainly a person who has written some very derogatory things about the package. Once again, that is his right. I am not denying anyone their right to have a voice against the package. I am saying that the reason this inquiry is being extended is that these people are being asked to make an independent assessment of the package, yet we cannot even get from them the assumptions on which they will make that independent assessment. I requested, first, that the committee look at the assumptions that would be the basis on which they would form their conclusions and, second, that the committee engage someone who is truly independent. I want to put on record the government's position in this regard. We do not oppose the seeking of information; we oppose the fact that this information is potentially tarnished already by the publicly stated positions of the individuals who will be making the assessment.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I would like to make a few points. We asked the department questions on this issue when the department came before the committee and we were told they had done no work, had done no modelling and had no information. The committee have looked around and I believe we have found an organisation whose own standing depends on providing us with verifiable, detailed information. I suppose we could keep looking but the committee are trying to get this done as quickly as possible.
As for Senator Knowles's last comment about not having the information as to how it will be structured, that is part of the brief. Because the department could give us nothing on any inflationary effects and just kept saying there were none—but could not show how they came to that conclusion—we obviously needed to develop a model of how we looked at the issue. That is part of the cost. This is an organisation that has done this sort of work before. I find it quite disappointing that we have taken three individuals and somehow implied that they are not able to be independent and professional. I understand that Stephen Duckett actually worked for Jeff Kennett. I do not think who a person has worked for is in any way relevant. I think we need to look at three highly professional people.
—Meg, get a grip on life.
—If the minister is going to get upset just because these people were amongst those who attended the health summit, I am very disappointed. We have the opportunity to get some information that the committee need in order to do our work. On the point Senator Knowles raised about timing, this is not going to hold us up. One of the things that is holding us up is the volume of submissions and information that we get at each of the hearings. The committee secretariat are under enormous pressure. We have already had someone seconded from the department to assist but the secretariat are working 10-hour days already as they begin doing the outline of the report. This is not something that we have dreamed up just to delay the process. It is essential that we get some more detail and information, particularly when we cannot get anything out of the department.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,4,2,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I made some remarks in relation to the timing of committees reporting on bills yesterday in the debate on the tabling of the Selection of Bills Committee report. Again we have here, from a management of the Senate's business point of view, a significant piece of legislation, a significant piece of the government's program, and the Senate is being kept from being able to deal with it until, effectively, the last fortnight.
—This is not our fault.
—I am just making a point; I am not having a go at anybody. We will be back here in November and we will have a list of the normal 40, 50 or 60 bills that we want to bring forward. We will have lectures from people saying that we should sit more weeks and do this and that. These sittings contain roughly 10 weeks of sitting time: we are sitting two weeks on and two weeks off, with one exception, through to December. In this motion before us today is a request for an extension of time for a committee that has already had the legislation before it for many weeks. It would have, if it were to report on time, yet another three weeks from today to consider the bill or bills and it is seeking an extension of a further seven weeks, which takes the reporting date out to 30 October, as I read the motion. Although it is not public at this stage, we have a proposal to extend the estimates hearings in November, which will effectively take out the week commencing 3 November. 
—It will be extended by one day.
—Two days. We will talk about that.
—What are you talking about?
—We are actually talking about the program, Senator Forshaw. It will probably not bother you.
—It does; I'm on the committee.
—It is an important issue because you will be here complaining, Senator Forshaw, about the management of the program and why you are sitting up until four o'clock in the morning. Your party is about to vote for a resolution to extend the reporting date for one bill for a further seven weeks. My view is that this is a form of delay and obstruction. If it is not, it is very bad management. I cannot see why this committee should not be able to report by say, if it needs an extension, 7 October to give us that October fortnight to deal with these bills. This motion means that the bills cannot be dealt with during the September sittings and they cannot be dealt with during the three weeks we sit in October. Depending on how we resolve the estimates hearing, which is what the banter across the table was about, that leaves us either one day in the week of November or no days, and then the final fortnight in December. With this bill and a number of other bills that have again been delayed in committees, we are effectively ensuring that a range of major packages will not be considered by the Senate until the final fortnight.
Quite frankly, if you need an extension for this committee—and I have heard what Senator Lees has said and I respect it—then I think it would be reasonable to have an extension but to have an extension of a further month and not a further, effectively, two months. In other words, we should have the reporting date of 7 October, which gives you six weeks to extend the inquiry and still gives the Senate the opportunity to deal with these bills in the October sitting period, not to effectively delay consideration of the bills until the end of November. That is a reasonable thing to do. It means the Senate can actually manage its program and it also means that the bills are going to have an enormous length of time before a committee. All I am asking for is a reasonable approach, not one which is clearly unreasonable and which will make the program very hard to manage towards the end of the year.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,4,2,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-08-21,"by leave—The proposals from the government are the most significant changes to affect Medicare since its inception. We have had over 190 submissions to this inquiry and by the end of next week we will have had 11 days of hearings, and they are not yet completed. We have been to all states of Australia and we will be taking evidence from the Northern Territory as well. The community is asking for a broader debate about the effects of the government's proposals on Medicare, not a shortened debate. Many of the submissions, including some of the most significant submissions, have said that we need a long-term inquiry into health care in Australia. 
The Manager of Government Business has said that the Senate has referred a piece of legislation. He needs to be reminded that there have been two references to this committee, very extensive terms of reference and then, subsequently, the legislation. As the chair of the committee, I asked the secretariat to develop a time line in order to properly consider the extensive work that community members, academics and people interested in health care in this nation have done and to enable them to give evidence to the inquiry. It is only right that we do those pieces of work justice. They have advised the committee that it is only possible to deliver the report in the week of 27 to 30 October and it is right that we take that advice.
Senator Knowles made comments about the approval by you—and I thank you—for us to seek advice from the Australian Institute for Primary Care. I think her comments on some of the individuals who will be doing that research are unfounded. I asked Senator Knowles and other members of the Liberal Party to offer an alternative institution or group that would be able to provide the quality of advice that we require, and nothing was forthcoming. The Australian Institute for Primary Care are a well-regarded academic group. They have proposed to us that they will need four weeks from the date of contract to complete their work. It is understood that the date of contract is today, and four weeks from today will take us past even the reporting date of 9 September.
As I said, the community wants a bigger and more in-depth debate about Medicare, not a shortened or curtailed debate as the Liberal Party have attempted to do right from the instigation of this inquiry. The Liberal Party did not want understanding of what the effects of their Medicare package would be. As Senator Lees has said, the department has not been forthcoming with any evidence about the inflationary effects of the government's proposals on health care in this nation. That is why we have had to commission work from external bodies. It is a sensible and reasonable request for an extension.
—It is delay and obstruction on your part.
—Order, Senator Campbell.
—I refute absolutely that this is an unreasonable request for an extension. We need to do justice to the submissions that have been given to us and to the need for debate about health care in this nation, and curtailing this in the way that the Liberal Party are proposing is improper.
—It is not curtailing it. You have had three months for this inquiry.
—Order, Senator Campbell.
—You have not read one of the submissions, so why don't you shut up.
—Senator Forshaw, that was uncalled for. There is too much noise across the chamber.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. I ask you to ask Senator Forshaw to withdraw that unparliamentary remark.
—Mr President, I think that is a ludicrous point of order. I suggest to you that the term `shut up' is not unparliamentary. What is unparliamentary, of course, is a senator shouting across the chamber. You may care to make that point. All interjections are disorderly and the opposition will not tolerate the situation if opposition senators are called to order when government senators continually interject and are not called to order. 
—Senator Faulkner, I have been trying to restore order to the chamber. Shouting across the chamber, as everybody knows, is disorderly. Shouting across the chamber from both sides is out of order. Can we get back to the debate and get on with the day's business?
—Senator Knowles made some comments about the assumptions that the Australian Institute for Primary Care will have to make in order to complete the work that they have begun. Senator Knowles should have read the contract proposal from the Australian Institute for Primary Care. It is advised in that proposal that additional time would make it possible to test parameter assumptions with key health economists and health service researchers and to improve the quality of the data. We would need extra time, and Senator Knowles knows that. We have decided not to take that option. We know that the quality of work from this institute will be sound. I only wish that the department had been forthcoming with information so that we would not have had to progress down this track.

There was an agreement between all parties that we would not deny formality on the basis that we would allow statements by leave. This is a clear breach of that undertaking and understanding. Clearly, the opposition whip does not like to have this debate. If we had wanted to we could have denied formality but in good faith, having made that decision at the request of the opposition whip not to deny formality and to have statements by leave, we stuck by that. We have now had a breach of that agreement. What it says to the coalition is that in future when we get undertakings from the opposition whip they cannot be trusted and cannot be taken at her word and that in future we will have to deny formality and have a full-blown debate.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I thank the opposition for their reconsideration of this matter. I also note that Senator Lyn Allison might wish to make a comment. I have some new evidence, information and argument to put to the Senate so that the matter can be reconsidered very carefully. Firstly, I want to agree with Senator McLucas's comment about the fact that this is an important inquiry. Of course Medicare is important and that is why we are considering this matter very carefully.  
The issue is not the importance of the inquiry; the issue is the integrity and the independence and the objectivity of those conducting the research—that is, the Australian Institute for Primary Care and in particular Professors Duckett, Serjeantson, Livingston and Weeks. Let me make it clear that Professor Duckett has already made a submission to the inquiry that is critical of the government. Secondly, Livingston, in the public arena in a left-wing publication, Dissent, has been highly derogatory about the Medicare proposals put forward by the government. So two of the main consultants to the inquiry have already got preconceived views. They are by no means independent or objective. That should be taken as read.
The other point that I want to make is that our instructions to the Australian Institute for Primary Care were quite clear. Our instructions stated:
Do some research on the government's proposals and the opposition's proposals and the inflationary effects, if any.
They responded by saying:
Thank you for asking me for advice on our capacity to conduct research on the inflationary effects on health care costs for consumers that are likely to emerge.
This is a point that I brought up in the committee, and I bring it up again now for senators. They have a preconceived view that there will be inflationary effects—and we said `if any'. So the instructions are very important. I think they have preconceived views that there will be inflationary effects, and of course there is nothing in the Medicare package that forces doctors to charge more. Senator Kay Patterson has made that point very clearly time and again. So we are spending $22,000 of taxpayers' money. There are other alternatives out there and I say for the benefit of Senator McLucas that one of those is Econtech. That point has been raised and it is put again to the Senate chamber. I think you should reconsider very carefully your position.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,4,2,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2003-08-21,"—by leave—It is unfortunate that we are having this debate. I think that the committee has tried very hard to be cooperative with the government. I want to respond to Senator Ian Campbell's remarks earlier, which I was not in the chamber to hear. I understand that he is aggrieved at what he says is my agreement to deal with the bill sooner than the end of October. What I did say, in answer to his question in a whips meeting the other day, was that I would talk with the chair, as I did, and consider whether we could bring the bills on for debate prior to reporting on the more general terms of reference. Indeed, the committee talked about a kind of two-stage process whereby we might be able to deal with the legislation and do a short report about it and then do a more general one further down the track. Having thought about this carefully and having discussed it with the secretariat, the chair is of the view that that is not going to be easy—it may be impossible. I accept that. 
All I said to Senator Ian Campbell was that I would give an undertaking to explore the idea, which I did. I have indicated that I accept the arguments. It is in our interests to do this as quickly as possible. I do not want to spend the rest of the year travelling around the country on this inquiry—worthy though it may be. As Senator McLucas says, there are good arguments for extending it to an even more general inquiry. 
I want to respond to some of the remarks that have been made by both Senator Knowles and Senator Barnett with regard to the so-called political bias of those people we have chosen to provide us with information about the inflationary effects. It is clutching at straws to suggest that, because `if any' was removed from the terms of reference, those who are producing this report will take that to mean that there will be some inflationary effects and they will therefore need to find them. What an insult to some of the most seriously professional people in the health sector to suggest that to include or to exclude those two words makes any difference. I find that extraordinary.  
I turn to political bias. It is an interesting time to be talking about political bias in this field. This week we saw a health alliance meet at Old Parliament House on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. The government dismissed that group of absolutely eminent people in the medical sector as being political stooges. 
—She did not.
—The minister says she did not call them stooges, and maybe that is right. Nonetheless, they were tagged with the label of being political, having bias, or in some extraordinary manner just supporting a political point of view. Again, that is a huge insult to an eminent group of people who are serious about health in this country and who came together—for the first time ever, as far as we know—to debate where this country should be going. 
The reason we are having this inquiry is that the government has not done so. The government has not sat down with those people. It has not sat down with the people at the coalface. It has not sat down with the people who designed Medicare in the first place. Professor Duckett and the like have been denigrated by the government for simply speaking up about what they see as being wrong with this bill. I find that extraordinary. Essentially this committee is doing the government's work for it. The government should have been out there showing leadership, talking to these people about what needs to be done to solve the impasse between the Commonwealth and the states over the health care agreements, to ameliorate what we all know to be the inflationary effects of this package. That is what the submissions are saying to us. We have not had a submission from someone saying, `It is not going to be inflationary and here are the reasons why; we will spell it all out.' Maybe the department could do that, but they have been reluctant so far. In fact, they have said they have not taken the time—no doubt at government instruction—to do this. 
So the committee is in no other position but to say, `We need this expertise. We have all these submissions saying there are inflationary effects. How do we test that? Is it just anecdotal? Is it just political? Is it just people who do not like the government who are saying this? How do we test it?' We get expert advice to do that, and that is what we have done. 
Certainly my effort in this inquiry will be to bring forward the reporting date. I hope we can report earlier than that, and I think there is a chance we can, but at this stage that is the best estimate. Can I say something else about the secretariat arrangements. There are constant pressures on our committee secretaries and their staff. They work extremely hard. But if there are any delays in this place—I do not have evidence for this and maybe we should do a study on it—it is because the constant cuts imposed on the Department of the Senate mean that our secretaries cannot do this work faster than they currently do. If we had more staff, perhaps we could report sooner. It is very difficult. So if there is to be some inquiry into why this report is late, let us have a look at whether the Senate's secretariat staffing arrangements are adequately resourced. I think we might find that they are not.  
As I understand it, there is the capacity for the Senate to have four select committees going at any one point in time. We currently have two. Staff for the Medicare inquiry have been taken from other committees that are busy trying to write their own reports, which has put a lot of pressure on other departments. In this place we ought to have the funds to be able to set up two more committees and have them properly staffed. Where is that money? It is just not available. That is because we have taken 14 per cent out of budgets through so-called `efficiency dividends', or whatever they are called, over the last few years. So if there is to be a complaint about the speed with which we can do this work, let us have a look at the resourcing that goes into it.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I am disturbed about the direction of this debate. I know Senator Knowles and, despite her right-wing views on a number of things, she is a decent sort of person. I am amazed at the direction in which she is seeking to take the Senate chamber today. Senator Knowles, Senator Moore and a number of other senators and I have been involved in an inquiry into poverty and financial hardship. Senator Knowles would know as well as I do that the people who have been appearing before us to give evidence have said that the lack of bulk-billing in a number of areas, particularly in regional Australia, has been a significant factor contributing to their financial hardship. 
As I have said, Senator Knowles's actions today are certainly out of character. Despite the fact that during the inquiry that Senator Moore and I sat on an overwhelming number of witnesses were critical of the government and the government's actions and policies, Senator Knowles sat there and made sure that the government's position was at least articulated and upheld. I do not want to say too much today, because I know my colleagues, including Senator Forshaw, are about to make a significant contribution, but I would think that the actions of Senator Knowles are certainly out of character. I know that she is off to New York shortly and I hope that she represents the country well in that endeavour. I am a bit disturbed by the direction Senator Knowles has taken today. One of Senator Knowles's favourite sayings is `sawing through sawdust', and I hope that we do not do that today.

Yes, this is one of the most significant changes proposed to Medicare since its inception, which is why the powers of the Senate to properly and independently scrutinise the legislation should be respected and exerted to the full. We need to ensure that the sieve that the Senate applies to this legislation is a very fine one, and I share the concerns of other senators on this side of the chamber that the process being used to do that is not one that will produce that result. I am concerned about the idea of commissioning this particular institute to conduct that work, in particular because several of the parties have had involvement in the issues already. Several of the parties to this study are already on the record on these issues and perhaps, most significantly, one of the parties, Professor Duckett, has actually made a submission to the committee.
—He is going to examine his submission, is he?
—Indeed, Senator Abetz picks up the very point. Professor Duckett and his colleagues will be asked in effect to comment inter alia on their own work. They will be asked to judge: did we get it right? Did we come to the right conclusion? It seems to me that in a wide world with many people with expertise, when there are many people who could conduct this kind of work, there are others you would choose to do that kind of study. Senator Barnett has put on the record today that Econtech is a well-respected firm already working in this field which could provide that expertise. None of the members of Econtech have already put a submission in to the committee. In those circumstances, why not choose those sorts of people? 
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! Interjections are disorderly and particularly disorderly when they are not made from senators' designated seats. I would remind senators to come to order. Let's get this debate sorted out in a civil fashion.
—Mr President, I raise a point of order. You are quite right: it is disorderly. What I have indicated is that Econtech is a tory front and I think that should be acknowledged in the chamber.
—There is no point of order.
—I am of the view that in this great nation of ours of almost 20 million people it is possible to find some professionals who are not tainted by existing contributions to this important public debate and who have not already put some particular position on the record in this debate. If you want to find somebody who is neutral, the last people you would go to are the ones who have been chosen by the committee. They are already clearly on the record as having a position and they are not the people to do this study. My recommendation is to find somebody else; that is not the view of the committee. In those circumstances, it is most unfortunate that we taint this process by not giving the committee the chance to properly analyse the evidence and the issues that are before it at the present time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,4,2,speech
"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—There are two issues at the heart of this debate. The first one is the issue of the extension of time for the committee to report. The second issue, which really we should not be debating here, is the decision by you, Mr President, to approve the decision of the select committee to have the research undertaken. I find it somewhat disgraceful that for the last half an hour we have had government senators, members of the select committee—Senators Knowles, Barnett and Humphries—attacking the decision of the President. I think that is outrageous. That was a debate that we had in the committee and the committee made a decision. The President has upheld the decision. That should be the end of the matter.
If we wanted to go on and talk about bias and so on we could be here all day talking about examples of the bias the current coalition government have shown in research projects that they have had undertaken. Let us look at just a couple. Who chaired the inquiry into energy? Former senator Warwick Parer. Who chaired the inquiry into Telstra? Dick Estens, a well-known long-time supporter of the National Party. He came up with the sorts of outcomes that the government wanted in the first place. And these senators opposite have the temerity to stand up here and talk about independence! What an absolute farce. Just a moment ago we heard Senator Abetz say, `We should have got the Institute of Public Affairs to do it.' The point is that the research needs to be undertaken. It is going to be done in as short a time as possible because the committee is concerned about endeavouring to get this report completed and tabled in the parliament so that we can then get on with debating the legislation. 
If we had had a lot more time, if the Senate Select Committee on Medicare did not have the pressure of the government's legislation before us, we would have been looking to have a lot more detailed research undertaken into this whole issue of the future of Medicare, particularly the inflationary impacts of the government's package and other issues that need to be examined. The reason we have had to take this step is that when we asked the Department of Health and Ageing to give us the modelling, the research and the data on their claim that this package is not inflationary they would not do it and they could not do it. This has been a major issue of debate throughout our public hearings. It was a very reasonable decision for the committee to take to have this research undertaken.
The other couple of points I want to make are with regard to the timetable for the committee. Let us remember that, firstly, the select committee was established on 26 June. As Senator McLucas, the chair of the committee, has said, it was given very broad, detailed terms of reference to look at the government's package, to look at alternative packages and to look at a range of other health care issues. One would have expected, in the normal course of events, such a select committee to have taken a substantial period of time to examine issues of that detail and to bring down a report. I can recall select committees established back in the days when we were in government doing that. One inquiry—into broadcasting, I think—chaired by Senator Alston ran for well over a year or two years, to my recollection. I stand to be corrected.
—It was attacking the ABC.
—The Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations—it just went on and on.
—Like you are now.
—Yes, and you have given me leave to do that, Senator Vanstone, so I am going to. The Senate needs to be reminded of these facts. In all the circumstances, it would not be unreasonable to have expected that this committee would have taken some time to examine those issues. The other aspect of this is that the legislation was referred to the select committee. Conscious of that—conscious that we have a duty to have that legislation debated in the Senate—we deliberately set out to ensure that that could be done and that the committee could do its work in as short a time as reasonably possible. It has proven to be the case that we need an extension for a few more weeks. At the end of the period of time that is being sought we would report on 30 October. That would be approximately four months for this committee to have done its work.
Let us look at the work it has been doing. As Senator McLucas has said, we have had over 190 submissions. They are not just form letters. Submissions of great detail have been given to us by various organisations—the AMA, various divisions of general practice, various community health groups, state governments and a broad range of interest groups involved in and interested in health care. We have had public hearings in every state, including Queensland when we go to Brisbane and Bundaberg next week. We will then go to Melbourne and come back to Canberra next Thursday for the final day of hearings. This committee sat for a good deal of time during the break and undertook a very tight and intensive program. Some of the members of this committee, including Senator Knowles and Senator Humphries, were also members of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into poverty and financial hardship—chaired by you, Mr Acting Deputy President Hutchins—which has been travelling as well. So there has been a lot of hard work put in by all members from all sides. 
Clearly that has also impacted upon the secretariat. The secretariat of the Senate community affairs committee are handling the logistics of the select committee on Medicare and also having to do all their other work, including the inquiry into poverty, so they have been under great time pressure. They have done a fantastic job of ensuring that both committees—the select committee and the Community Affairs References Committee—could get their work done. It has proved to be the case that we need more time. We need more time for the research work to be done and we then need the usual amount of time—and it is a very tight timetable—for the draft report to be prepared, for that to be examined by the committee and for any dissenting reports and so on.
The committee secretariat and opposition members of the committee have bent over backwards to meet a timetable that will allow this legislation to be debated this year. But today the government senators have tried to use the forum of the Senate to overturn decisions that were arrived at by the committee. They have never wanted this inquiry. They wanted to have major changes made to Medicare in this country and yet not to have a real public inquiry into them. They did not want it in the first place. They opposed the proposition to establish the select committee. They really did not want to travel and hear from the public, and today they are trying to put more roadblocks in the way of this committee doing its work. I urge the Senate to support wholeheartedly the extension of time for this committee to report. It is not unusual. In fact, if you go through the Senate records you will find many instances where committees dealing with—with no disrespect—public issues a lot less serious than the issues this committee is dealing with have had extensions granted simply in order to be able to do the job they have been charged with doing. On this occasion, this is a very reasonable request and it should be supported.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,4,2,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I want to add a couple of comments to the debate that has been fairly widely canvassed this morning. Senator McLucas has explained the circumstances of this request for an extension of time. The issue that really is of concern to me is the extent to which the government senators who are participating on this committee have been so critical of the proposal by the committee to seek some research from the Australian Institute for Primary Care. I think it is important to remind the Senate that, while government senators have been quite vocal about their concerns of bias by this group, the Australian Institute for Primary Care is a highly renowned group which has done extensive research in health economics. The research that has been proposed to look at the inflationary costs of this package relates to both the government's A Fairer Medicare package and the opposition's proposal. It is not as though the committee is trying to get the Australian Institute for Primary Care to have a very critical analysis of the government's proposal without examining the opposition's alternative.
The kind of work that is required to be done is for information that has not been provided by the department on direct health care costs to consumers. It is of concern to the committee that that information has not been made available to us. The research required is based on the fact that we know that direct health care costs to consumers associated with GP visits are a function of the fees that are charged by GPs, so any costs such as private health insurance that consumers incur to offset the risk of out-of-pocket expenses, which are the gap fees proposed by the government in health insurance, are going to impact on consumers. While Senator Barnett has taken quite an interesting line on the inflationary effect, if this research indicates that there are zero inflationary effects then the committee will be very pleased to receive that information. The research is to look at the estimate of aggregate inflationary effects on direct costs for consumers which are likely to be a function of the impact of proposed changes on GP fees and charges, including bulk-billing, the supply of GP services, consumers' use of GP services and consumers' use of GP substitute services, such as public hospital emergency departments; and information about bulk-billing, GP fees and charges, and consumer utilisation of GP services. We have a real problem in that there are a number of unknowns about the impact of the proposed changes on the factors that affect direct costs for consumers. That is the issue that we are really concerned about. 
We have had over 190 submissions to the inquiry so far and there is only one submission that is actually complimentary of the government's package, and that of course is from the department. Every other submission is quite critical of some factors of the package and of the legislation, and that is of concern to all committee members, not just those from the opposition. I think it is important that we do recognise that this extension of time is an important, genuine and valid request, and that members of the Senate do support it. It is important for us to get the work done well.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Extension of Time</title>,Committees,4,2,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—It is important to recognise that the process of making the decision about whom we would commission—the Australian Institute for Primary Care—was made at a private meeting of this committee. It was made after deliberation about alternatives. I actually offered Liberal members of the committee an opportunity to propose alternative people whom we could ask to do the work. There was nothing forthcoming from other members of the committee and so the decision was made. It is wrong to stand up in this chamber today, after these discussions have been held for about a fortnight, and offer an alternative now, suggesting that we could have asked Econtech. We have no information about their ability to do medical modelling. I think it has been very wrong for Liberal members of the committee to attack the professionalism of members of the Australian Institute for Primary Care. I think it is very disappointing that people's personal reputations can be denigrated in such a way when they are eminent people in health economic research in this country.

"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-21,"—While we are waiting for Senator Lundy—I understand it is an opposition amendment that we are next going to be dealing with—I am very concerned that Senator Brown has just put out a press release, and indeed his press conference was supposed to be about now, claiming that this new legislation that forms the much stronger body, the Australian Heritage Council, `delists thousands of places off the Register of the National Estate'. I want to put on the record that that is in fact untrue. The Register of the National Estate will continue. In fact, there will still be the opportunity, if a place meets criteria, for more places to be added. There are in fact now three new lists and places may be moved onto other lists. So places can be on several lists. There will continue to be the World Heritage List, of course, and while Australia can make recommendations for places of high significance to go onto that it is not in our hands as to what is listed on the World Heritage List. Obviously, we would be very keen I would imagine to get several additional places on there shortly. We will also have a National Heritage List and a Commonwealth Heritage List. Places eligible for the Commonwealth Heritage List will obviously be places on Commonwealth property but they will also be able to stay on the Register of the National Estate. I think it is very disappointing that Senator Brown should put out a document that is so misleading.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2003-08-21,"—by leave—I move opposition amendment (5) on sheet 2847:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 12, page 5 (line 3), after “included in”, insert “the Register of the National Estate, under the Australian Heritage Commission Act 2003, or”.
The opposition opposes item 13 in the following terms:
(6)	Schedule 1, item 13, page 5 (lines 7 and 8),to be opposed.
This requires the Australian Communications Authority to be obliged to consider the impact of communications facilities on the environment whenever a place on the Register of the National Estate is affected. The government proposes to remove this provision, and I note also that there are some similar amendments from both the APA and the Democrats subsequent to this amendment. Labor's amendment will ensure that the impact on heritage places will continue to be considered.
I take this opportunity to point out that Senator Brown is not the only one to have put out some media statements. It is probably appropriate for me to briefly reflect on the comments of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Their media statement issued yesterday said:
The ACF today expressed disappointment that the Government's heritage protection bills had passed the Senate without crucial amendments. 
`The Australian Heritage Council Acts are a shaky foundation for heritage protection and in some areas a backward step for our natural, cultural and Indigenous heritage,' says John Connor, ACF's Campaigns Director.
The media statement goes on to say:
`The legislation white-ants the independence of the Australian Heritage Commission, politicises the selection process for places on the National and Commonwealth Heritage Lists and removes key government decisions from scrutiny.'
That is certainly Labor's view as well. I commend the opposition amendments to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COUNCIL BILL 2002</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",APA,2003-08-21,"—I will be opposing the opposition amendments. However, I draw the committee's attention to two amendments that are in fact identical and I ask again whether Senator Allison would be prepared to move them jointly. I therefore foreshadow that we will be moving those amendments, if that is okay with Senator Allison. I think they are a technical improvement—only a little but certainly an improvement—on Labor's amendments.
Senator Lundy quoted from the ACF's media statement. I realise we are running out of time for this bill—I think this is day 7 we have been dealing with it—so I will be brief. However, I cannot let it go without saying that the ACF is out on its own on this issue. It is supposedly the umbrella organisation for conservation. There is no-one else under the umbrella. I will quickly list some of the other organisations that are supporting this legislation. They are: the Australian Heritage Commission; the Australian International Council on Monuments and Sites; the Australian Council of National Trusts; the Institution of Engineers; the Heritage Committee; the Federation of Australian Historical Societies; the Australian Academy of the Humanities; the National Heritage Chairs and Officials representing all the states and territories heritage councils—and they are all in support of this legislation; the Royal Australian Institute of Architects; the Australasian Society of Historical Architecture; the Australian Institute of Archaeology; Museums Australia; the Humane Society International; WWF, the World Wildlife Fund for Nature; and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust.
As I noted yesterday in one of my other statements, there are myriad smaller organisations waiting for this legislation to get through because they believe the sites that they are particularly interested in—and I specifically mention here a lot of Indigenous sites—will be far better protected under this legislation.
 (Senator Marshall)—Senator Lundy, we will be putting the question on amendment (5) separately and dealing with that first. The question is that opposition amendment (5) on sheet 2847 be agreed to.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2003-08-21,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill 2003. In thanking honourable senators for their contributions, it would not astound them if I were to say that we do not necessarily agree with all those contributions. Nevertheless, in the spirit with which we approach this matter, we do thank them for their contributions. There are two second reading amendments moved by Senators Nettle and Carr, and they of course have the normal contributions that one expects from second reading amendments.
The bill before us today builds on the government's commitment to Australian higher education. As honourable senators would know, the bill provides $7.3 million in 2003 to assist the Australian National University to rebuild its world-class research facilities at Mount Stromlo Observatory. Senators will remember well the Canberra bushfires that swept through the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics site earlier this year. The research school has long been recognised as an important player in national and international astronomy, providing leading edge training for students as well as world-class pure and applied research facilities. The government is pleased to be able to assist the university through this rebuilding phase.
The bill updates funding amounts in the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 for indexation and the latest estimates of HECS liabilities. The bill also provides the next tranche of additional funding to the Australian Research Council, as announced in the $3 billion Backing Australia's Ability initiative. The bill also makes a series of administrative adjustments to the Australian Research Council Act 2001 in order to streamline processes and financial management of the Australian Research Council, its advisory structures and its research programs. The government, in consultation with the opposition, will be moving an amendment in relation to the power to vary the funding split between the ARC's research programs—the Discovery program and the Linkage program. At this stage can I thank the opposition for their cooperation in relation to that amendment. I wonder about the benefit of the opposition in this nation, but every now and then they do come good and they are of assistance. We thank them for their contribution to that particular aspect of the legislation.
The current legislation requires the minister to vary the funding split between the research program categories as appropriate. A formal variation is required every time funding becomes available because of a change in the status of grants, no matter how minor the change—for example, when a grant is handed back in because a researcher ceases work on the project. The bill streamlines this process by allowing the minister to specify a funding split range, thereby reducing the need for the minister to regularly make new determinations. The government amendment—which, as I indicated, is a result of discussions with the opposition—proposes to limit the funding split range to a maximum of five per cent above or below a specified single percentage of the funding cap. Funding split variations to date have largely been minor and within this range. I commend the bill to the Senate.

—How long?
—Very short.
—One minute?
—I do not know.
—Well, how long?
—You wanted to get a second reading vote by 12.45. I expect that we will be able to do that if you do not waste time now.
Leave granted.
—Yesterday, when the government brought this bill on, there was considerable confusion in the chamber. This was a result of incredibly poor management by the government. It was a result of the government basically not being able to organise its own affairs and not being able to communicate effectively about what it wants to do with the legislative program. As a consequence of that action—of the government providing the opposition with about three minutes notice—there was a change in the order of opposition speakers. As a consequence I was not able to move the second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition. Now the situation arises where Senator Nettle's amendment becomes the substantive motion and the opposition's second reading amendment becomes a foreshadowed second reading amendment. I would like to indicate that we cannot support the Green's amendment and therefore we will be voting against it. I ask that the chamber consider supporting the Labor Party's second reading amendment when it is put subsequently.
Question negatived.
Senator CARR (Victoria) (12.38 p.m.)—I move the opposition's second reading amendment standing in my name:
At the end of the motion, add:
“but the Senate condemns the Government for:
(a)	the failure of its policies to tackle the real issues facing higher education in Australia, including in the following areas:
(i)	the increasing financial burden its policies are placing on students and their families, and the related growth of student debt,
(ii)	the continuing inability of universities to enrol qualified students who wish to take up a publicly-funded place,
(iii)	the inadequate provision for growth in higher education, especially in the period 2004-2007,
(iv)	the inadequate planning for meeting key areas of skill shortage through higher education, including teaching and nursing,
(v)	inadequate indexation of university funding,
(vi)	inattention to the links between higher education and technical and further education, and
(vii)	a lack of focus on quality, innovation and global changes in higher education; and
(b)	underfunding the rebuilding of the Mt Stromlo observatory”.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2003-08-21,"—The National Transport Commission Bill 2003 proposes to establish a new National Transport Commission with broader responsibilities than the current National Road Transport Commission. The new NTC will be responsible for road, rail and intermodal transport. The Commonwealth, state and territory heads of government all support the creation of this commission, and the Labor Party supports the bill. Many of the changes replicate the original NRTC Act that was passed by Labor and are sensible.
What I want to talk about today is ultra low sulphur diesel fuel. Part of the GST deal between the coalition and the Democrats was to promote environmentally friendly fuels. As you would be well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall, the government ratted on that deal with the Democrats but finally passed the Energy Grants (Credit) Scheme Bill two years later than was required by that deal with the Democrats. As part of the bill, ultra low sulphur diesel fuel was made exempt from an additional 1c per litre excise. From January 2004 the additional excise will be 2c per litre and in 2006 ultra low sulphur diesel fuel will be mandatory. The current rate of excise on ultra low sulphur diesel fuel is 38.143c per litre and there are significant concerns with this diesel. The problems are threefold: the first is the efficiency of the fuel, the second is the fuel's effect on maintenance costs for vehicles and the third is the lack of availability of the fuel in many areas of Australia.
In relation to the first part, fuel efficiency, ultra low sulphur diesel fuel has been shown to be considerably less efficient than ordinary diesel fuel. This means that, while the fuel is less polluting, the additional fuel required effectively eliminates any environmental effects. It is not clear that there are any financial benefits to transport operators from the introduction of this fuel or the excise. The government's efforts to decrease gas emissions are simply not sustainable. Rather than actually having an impact they give the impression of making a difference when in fact I do not believe they do. 
There are a number of legitimate concerns regarding the effect of ultra low sulphur fuel on vehicle engines. In the United States the introduction of ultra low sulphur fuel resulted in vehicle faults across the country. Here in Australia there were serious problems with low sulphur diesel when it was first introduced in December 2000. Problems which arose both here and overseas include the fuel system leak. The fuel can cause deterioration in fuel pumps and seals which were made prior to 1994. Considering that fuel pump seals last between eight and 15 years there is a legitimate concern that seals which should be entirely usable will be rendered useless by the use of ultra low sulphur diesel. BP, which is currently one of the only two producers of diesel in the country and which produces the low sulphur diesel fuel introduced in December 2000, have assured truck operators that the same problem will not occur with this low sulphur diesel. The effect of this low sulphur diesel fuel on fuel pumps and seals is a direct result of the process of removing sulphur from the fuel. The process reduces the natural lubrication of diesel fuel which results in the deterioration of fuel pump systems. Industry groups such as the Bus Industry Federation have recommended that owners of pre-1994 vehicles should consider replacing elements of their fuel system to allow them to use the low sulphur diesel. 
In relation to availability, in the last edition of a magazine called Owner Driver, which is exclusively sent out to men and women who operate single lorries, I read about the availability of this fuel and the opportunity for them to have access to the rebate. Currently BP and Caltex are the only producers of this diesel in the country but both BP and Caltex have only made their fuel available in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Kalgoorlie. If there are any excise disincentives for business and individuals using standard diesel fuel they should at the very least be provided with the same opportunity to pay a lower excise. Legislation has been passed but it is out of step with the ability of the low sulphur diesel producers to provide the fuel required to avoid the additional excise. In fact, the head of the Australian Trucking Association, Mr Chris Althus, believes that the policy to encourage the use of ultra low sulphur diesel is failing. He has suggested that the policy will not meet the forecast market share of 30 per cent. The Energy Grants Credit Scheme regulations provide for transitional relief for the agricultural sector while the new system is being implemented. However, truck operators have not been provided with any such relief.
I know that sounds quite technical, and I hope the departmental people who are here listening take on board my comments because the industry is not convinced that this is going to lead to the great environmental or economic savings that have been tied up in some deal between the Democrats and the government. Indeed, in the end, the availability of this fuel for truck operators is limited to a number of cities in Australia. One of the big ports in Australia, Melbourne, does not have the opportunity for this fuel. I am not sure when it will be available to them, to enable the people who operate the equipment to have the opportunity to have reduced fuel costs.
I was at a dinner put on by the executive of the Australian Trucking Association the other night—I was the only senator there. I was told by a number of the executive members—and I am well aware from my background—that their margins are between one per cent and 1½ per cent. So when we are talking about a cent a litre off the price of fuel, that is a significant cost to those operators and, if they are barred from having that opportunity to have access to that, then it is not going to lead to any economies of scale that allow for reduction in costs of transport throughout the country. It is a sad thing when a government gets tied up in all sorts of environmental issues and it does not take into account what really ends up being the consequences of its actions. 
As I have said, the transport industry is not convinced about the efficiency of this fuel. They are not convinced about how much it is going to cost them to maintain their vehicles and, indeed, as I have mentioned earlier, it is not even available to a number of ports in the country. This bill is about the National Transport Commission. It is an entirely supportable bill. It is great to see that in the last 20 years both Labor and the coalition have been cognisant of the importance to our country of road, rail and the intermodal parts of transport to make sure that we can deliver efficiency in this country and give service to people.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2003-08-21,"—The primary purpose of the National Transport Commission Bill 2003 is to establish the National Transport Commission as a replacement for the National Road Transport Commission. Like the NRTC, the commission will be an independent statutory body and will report to the Australian Transport Council, which comprises Commonwealth, state and territory transport ministers. The proposed act will be supported by an intergovernmental agreement which is currently being finalised for council ministers' signatures.
The cognate bill, the National Transport Commission (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2003, supports the introduction of the NTC Bill by effecting necessary and agreed amendments to other Commonwealth legislation and providing appropriate arrangements for a seamless transition from the NRTC to the commission. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-08-21,"—My question is directed to the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. Does the minister recall telling the Senate yesterday that the Howard government had given $71.2 million of extra funding to the ABC for regional programming? Wasn't this allocation from a previous budget, not the 2003-04 budget, and won't it run out in the current triennium? Isn't it a fact that the ABC asked for this money to be renewed in full, as part of its latest triennial budget bid, and the minister specifically declined to renew that funding? Why did the minister provide such misleading and inaccurate information to the Senate in pursuit of his war on the ABC?

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-08-21,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, isn't it true that the Howard government cut the ABC's base funding in its first two budgets after coming to office, and that this base funding has never been fully restored to the ABC? Isn't it also true that the ABC gave the minister adequate warning that it could not sustain all of its current activities unless the government provided additional funding in the 2003-04 budget? Why, then, did the minister falsely claim in the Senate yesterday that the axing of Behind the News was the ABC's fault, when all of the evidence indicates that the ABC had no choice but to cut programming in the face of the cumulative effect of the Howard government's funding cuts?

"Alston, Sen Richard",LP,2003-08-21,"—The National Interest Initiative, as the ABC choose to call it, was, I think, for $71.2 million over four years. It expires, I think, at the end of next year. The ABC want to bring that into line with the triennial funding arrangements. They did seek to have a commitment for that, ahead of its expiration. Before the last federal budget the managing director advised me that the ABC were seeking $15 million per annum— being $7 million for multi-channelling and $8 million for local drama production—from the government plus the continuation of the National Interest Initiative from 2005-06 to ensure that there would be no impact on the current level of ABC programming. 
What I did say was that that was the first time outside the normal triennial budget process that the ABC had received additional programming information, I think for 20-odd years. That was certainly money that the ABC got which it would not have been expecting to get or entitled to get in the normal course of triennial funding arrangements. That is the point I was making yesterday.  ",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice,23,1,answer

You opposed us every inch of the way. So do not for a minute pretend the ABC was singled out for special treatment—it was not. No claimant on the public purse is entitled to say, `Give us what we ask for, so we can do what we want to do.' The ABC is in no different a position. The ABC makes a claim; it gets money allocated. It was allocated $762 million in the last year and it has a three-year commitment. Therefore, it has the capacity to find $800,000. It did not consult, it did not look at any other options—it simply announced it to the presenter by email. So everyone out there knows it was the ABC's deliberate decision to take money from that iconic program, rather than from a range of other areas.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-08-21,"—I acknowledge Senator Harris's query and I appreciate his courtesy in contacting my office. There are 11 questions on notice that I think are troubling Senator Harris. They do concern a range of very specific taxation arrangements. The questions are very technical and stray into areas bordering on requiring a legal opinion or legal interpretation—for example, requiring different interpretations between tax schemes litigated in various court cases. A number of the questions contain up to 15 parts. I think it is fair to say that getting the information and advice to respond to the questions is time consuming. It has been necessary to seek advice from the Australian Taxation Office in relation to many of the questions which concern detailed tax administration. This aside, I appreciate Senator Harris's position. Following his request to my office, I have asked for responses to be expedited and tabled at the earliest opportunity.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2003-08-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the explanation.
The questions that I have put to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer relate to the issue that we now refer to as the mass marketing schemes for tax deductibility. If we look at the history of these schemes, their purpose originally was to provide research and development funding for prospective businesses to be able to set up and develop, both to provide work for those corporations and to return to the taxation department those tax breaks that were originally given. The scheme obviously has been working for many years, but around the mid-1980s private rulings were given by the taxation department on a series of different programs. They ranged from growing tea-tree up in my area in Mareeba to the growing of olives and substantive investment in grapes and vineyards. All of these continued quite successfully. I must admit that some of the operations did not turn out to be viable, but that is always a possibility when people invest in these types of programs. However, the real problem with the mass marketing issue came just prior to the 1998 elections, when the ATO decided to reverse the private rulings that had stood, some of them, for well over 10 years. This has created some enormous hardship for those people who were involved. In reversing the private rulings on some of these schemes, the taxation department also issued, at the same time, rectification notices.
It is my belief that there are somewhere in the vicinity of 65,000 Australians who have been affected by the reversal of these private rulings—65,000 Australians who considered that they were working within the confines of the requirements of the tax act. The rectification notices that have been issued are quite substantial. They range, predominantly, between $75,000 and $150,000. These notices have been sent to ordinary, law-abiding, taxpaying Australians through no fault of their own—because they had received advice from substantial legal and accounting firms right across the board. Many of the firms that were giving advice to the people who contributed to these schemes were also giving advice to the ATO. So there is something of a conflict in this process under which the people who have had the private rulings reversed and who have been given rectification notices have enormous debts to pay, but the firms which gave the advice to these people have not, to my knowledge, received a single disciplinary notice or any admonishment. To my knowledge those firms are still advising the Taxation Office. The questions that were put to Senator Coonan were put on behalf of those people who have been affected by these schemes.
People from all walks of life have been affected. It would not be uncommon to meet somebody, such as an air hostess, who has been caught in this situation. I know of people who have had to sell their family homes in an attempt to settle this matter with the ATO. There are a considerable number of people who are still fighting this process. It is a process that I believe is totally unjust. If the ATO were to pursue people who applied for tax deductibility relating to research and development after the private rulings were changed, that would be acceptable because those people would have made that decision knowing what the Taxation Office's position was. But this is not the case. These people have had the rulings reversed on them, as I said earlier, sometimes up to 10 years after having entered into these schemes.  
Some of the corporations on which the ATO reversed these rulings are still operating today and paying tax. Therefore, the initial concept of providing research and development money to these companies has been successful. Yet the people who have participated in those successful schemes have not been treated differently from anybody else: they have received rectification notices which automatically put them in the position of having a debt to the tax office. Those people are being pursued as I stand in this chamber today. It is grossly unjust. It was on those bases that I put those questions to Senator Coonan. It was in an attempt to resolve this issue, which, as I said earlier, impacts on the lives of up to 65,000 Australians. It is an issue that has to be resolved. It should be resolved quickly and it should be resolved in favour of these people who believed that they were contributing to the benefit of Australia.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,"<title>Question Nos 450, 451, 1014, 1340, 1341, 1342, 1343, 1548, 1549, 1558, 1559, 1594</title>",Questions Without Notice,24,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-08-21,"—I would like to say a few words with respect to the questions that Senator Harris was referring to. As someone who was chair of a committee that conducted two inquiries into this matter, I have a reasonable knowledge of some of the issues. I have a great degree of sympathy for the people who got caught in the mass marketing schemes affair and the outcome that the tax office has sought to inflict on them. The reassessment of many of the taxpayers' tax assessments— which was done supposedly under the anti-avoidance measures of the tax act—led to a court case with regard to what the tax office deemed to be representative cases of the great bulk of the mass-marketed schemes. They prosecuted that case successfully. However, there have been a number of other cases that have gone to the court in which the tax office has failed. In fact, I think there have now been three cases—which one could also deem to be representative of the great bulk of taxpayers involved in these schemes—in which the taxpayers have been successful. That is the real problem.
As a member of the Senate committee that dealt with the inquiry I proposed to the tax office that assessments be made of each of the individual schemes—not of each individual taxpayer—to determine whether those schemes were viable projects. The tax office indicated that that was something that could be done. Some of the people were caught in schemes that were really scams. There is no question about that. That also brings into question the administration of the tax act. This is not and was not a new phenomenon for the tax office. It was not something that blew into town one day; it was something that had been around and had been dealt with as far back as 1982. The tax office certainly was aware of the types of problems that could eventuate under the tax act. I do not have any argument with the tax office changing the tax laws to ensure that there is not a leakage of revenue from a taxation point of view and that tax effective investments that operate do so in a way that is beneficial to the general wellbeing of the country and in a way that ensures that the revenue is not being ripped off. 
What is interesting about all this is that there are still a number of schemes today being sold to people that are in effect allowing some people, mostly the promoters of these schemes, to take money from taxpayers that becomes the tax effective investment and use that money to purchase property for themselves. No other Australian can do that. No other Australian can purchase land or property and claim it as a tax deduction and yet this tax system is still allowing that to happen.
I agree with Senator Harris that the issue of the mass marketed schemes, as they have become known, was not properly dealt with. I can understand from the tax office's point of view that they sought a solution that would minimise the cost of dealing with what was a substantial number of taxpayers. But it was not the correct solution. Yes, they have offered up a settlement process and a settlement offer and, yes, a lot of people have taken that. But there is a range of people and the unfortunate thing is that the tax office is not prepared to accept the outcomes in respect of some taxpayers who have been successful in the court—that is, where there are other taxpayers involved in the same tax incentive investment the tax office will not allow those taxpayers the same rights as the taxpayer who has been successful in the court. Indeed, some taxpayers who have settled with the tax office were involved in schemes that have now been found by the court to be kosher in terms of tax law but the tax office will not reimburse the moneys that those people who went to the court were deemed to be able to retain. So it has been a very inequitable process.
It really comes down to a question of the government making a decision about equity in the application of tax law in this country. It was a very unfortunate era in tax administration. It clearly demonstrated the difficulties that the tax office administrators have in administering tax law in this country. The fact that it continues to happen demonstrates that there are still a significant number of difficulties within the tax office. But I do agree with Senator Harris: I would hope that at some point justice might prevail for those people who got caught in very unfortunate circumstances. They did everything in accordance with the law, including the seeking of what one might deem expert advice. In fact, tax rulings were issued, although when a private binding ruling is issued by the tax office it does only have application to the taxpayer to whom it is issued. But it questions a system in which a private binding ruling is issued to a taxpayer that allows for a particular claim under the tax act to that taxpayer but there are other taxpayers in the same circumstances who may not know about the private ruling and are paying tax different from the person with the private ruling. My view is that the rulings system is still fundamentally flawed. It still allows inequitable application of the tax law by the tax office. They are the sorts of things that are the responsibilities of governments to address. I hope that the government at some time might endeavour to do that.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-08-21,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Hogg today relating to the funding for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 
And a very good question it was. The genesis of this question was that Minister Alston yesterday in the chamber actually gave a very distinct impression that there had been additional funding of $71.2 million given to the ABC. I will read exactly what he said from the Hansard:
For the first time in 16 years we gave them an increase of $71.2 million for regional programming.
That was it—no caveats, no qualifications, nothing. He actually said that. Today he comes in and he admits—because he was forced to admit it by the question put by you, Mr Deputy President—that this $71.2 million was in fact given to the ABC two budgets ago and that it expires at the end of the next financial year.
Then we go to the issue of the horror budgets that occurred in 1997-98 and 1998-99 when the base funding of the ABC was cut. That base was never restored. Ever since coming to office this government has been attempting by stealth to bleed the ABC to death. In the first two years it was in office the government pillaged from the ABC, taking the $66 million from the ABC's base funding that I alluded to earlier and that $66 million has in fact never been restored.
The ABC has said quite clearly for some time that unless it receives additional funding it will be forced to cut programming. In fact we have been hearing this message from as early as 2002. We have heard it at estimates, we have heard it at public meetings, and we understand that the minister would have heard it, and did hear it, at private meetings. We all saw it articulated extremely clearly in the ABC's triennial funding submission. This message was given loud and clear: `If you do not increase our funding we will be forced to cut programs.' We on this side of the chamber heard the message and the public heard the message. It was only the government that did not hear the message, that refused to hear the message. 
We are used to the old excuse from this government, and particularly from the Prime Minister, that they were not told, and now we are seeing that even when they are told they do not hear. Look at what happened in the 2003-04 budget: in spite of this clear message, the government effectively froze the ABC's budget for the next three years and did not renew the regional funding initiatives, the $71.2 million from the previous budget that Senator Alston would have this chamber believe was new money. They have not renewed that and have effectively frozen that funding. Yesterday we heard the minister clearly imply that it was new funding. It is not. As I said before, the old funding has not been renewed through the ABC's triennial funding. 
So there you have it. The ABC warned the government: `Increase our funding or we will be forced to cut programs.' The government chose not to listen and is now trying to blame the ABC for the unpalatable decision the ABC has had to make. This is just another step in the government's assault on the ABC—an assault, I argue, that continues as a smokescreen for a minister trying to cover up his policy failings over the 68 complaints that he lodged about the coverage of the war in Iraq.
I note from a reply to Senator Santoro's estimates questions on notice that Minister Alston was not the only one to complain about the ABC's coverage of the war on Iraq. It seems that over 5½ thousand Australians also saw fit to complain. Fortunately, they did not see things quite the same way as Senator Alston and Senator Santoro did. Of the 5,500 who complained, over three-quarters were complaining about the scheduling changes. The numbers of people who rang to complain about bias were almost exactly the same for those who thought that the ABC was biased against and those who thought the ABC was biased for with respect to being pro-American or anti-American. So we have Senator Santoro coming in here doing a hatchet job, saying that 5,500 Australians complained about the ABC's coverage, but what most of them complained about was interruption to normal programming.  
So here we have the ABC defunded. We have the ABC vilified by the government. We have the minister coming in here trying to complain that it is new money when it is not. When will this stop? I think it will only stop when the minister actually pulls himself and Senator Santoro into gear and gets on to some real issues, which I would encourage them to do.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,25,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-08-21,"—The ALP never stops criticising the government over the ABC. It is ridiculous criticism. We have maintained funding at real levels for the ABC over the last years—
—What about the first two years?
—When we first came in, if you recall, Senator Mackay, we had something called `Beazley's big black hole' and to overcome that huge debt we cut departmental funding across the board by 10 per cent. The ABC as an agency of the government had that cut also. But since then ABC funding has been maintained and in real terms, in the current financial year, the ABC will receive $760 million in funding and in excess of $2.2 billion over the next three years. So I do not think that you can claim that the ABC is doing too badly at all under this government.
In fact the ABC has received additional funding for digitalisation. That will enable the ABC to go digital when digital TV is introduced on a broad basis. Digital television is already being broadcast by the ABC, and the ABC and SBS have received funding to set themselves up to provide digital television. The initial 10 per cent cut, as I said, back in 1996 reflected the poor economic management of the ALP. It is something that the ALP does not like to face up to and, as we can see, Senator Mackay is fleeing from the chamber at the very mention of the Beazley big black hole which the Howard government was left to deal with when it came to office. 
One of the key characteristic features of the Howard government has been responsible economic management. As a result of that responsible economic management this country now has low inflation rates, low interest rates, low unemployment and an economy which is the envy of all the other countries in the OECD. This country survived the Asian economic crisis thanks to the fact that the Howard government had been in office for two years when it occurred and fiscal responsibility was being exercised by the federal government. That stands in great contrast to the total irresponsibility shown by the Labor Party during the 13 years that it was in government when it left this country with that enormous $10 billion debt which resulted in those initial funding cuts across the board, including to the ABC.
The ABC has now maintained its funding and has received special funding for digital television. The ABC has expanded its regional radio and television services. The cuts which have occurred, one must say, have been strategic cuts made by ABC management to make the point that they believe the government should provide additional funding. But we in the government believe that the ABC should manage its affairs more effectively and that remains the objective of the government.
The ABC's board is performing political stunts in the cuts they are undertaking. They are not cutting programs which do not attract much attention; they are cutting programs which they think will impact politically on the government. But this government has responsible fiscal policies, and it has provided adequate funding for the ABC to continue to maintain its services in the next three years and provide digital television services. So, far from accepting any of the criticism Senator Mackay is attempting to level at the government, I simply make the point again that this government has shown great responsibility in the way it has managed the economy. Consistent with that general policy, ABC funding has been maintained at the levels undertaken by the government.

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2003-08-21,"—When assessing the performance of Minister Alston and this government with respect to the financing and management of the ABC, it is worthwhile looking at what Senator Alston put on the record in the years when the coalition was in opposition. I recall that, because I was a member of a Senate select committee inquiring into ABC management and operations, which reported in March 1995. This committee was chaired by Senator Alston. It is interesting to look at some of the recommendations of the majority report at that time. Recommendation 1 states:
The committee believes that the actions of government departments and agencies also have the potential to constitute interference with the program making integrity of the ABC. 
Senator Alston at that time was concerned about the possibility of interference in the management of the ABC. If you want to look at interference in ABC management, have a look at the record of this minister over the last six years. This is a minister who has put his political cronies on the board of the ABC, even though in this report he recommended that making appointments to the board was a process that should be overseen by the parliament. This is a minister who supported the disgraced failure Jonathan Shier when he was the Managing Director of the ABC. So when it comes to interference, Senator Alston's protestations of concern back in 1995 were just hollow words.
We go to the important issue of funding. What did the report of the committee, chaired by Senator Alston, say about funding? Recommendation 16 said: 
Where the parliamentary requires the ABC to undertake new charter activities or to expand existing charter activities, it should provide funds sufficient to ensure that existing activities are not adversely affected. 
That was Senator Alston's view then. This government has, as previous governments have in this new technological age, required the ABC to undertake new ventures and get with the digital age and so on. Senator Alston in 1995 was saying the ABC should be given more funding for that. But what did this government do when it got into office and what has it continued to do since? It has denied the ABC the appropriate funding to undertake those activities. As Senator Mackay said, they took $66 million out of the ABC's budget in the first year. Senator Alston had a proposal on the table that would have taken about $130 million out of the ABC's budget at that time. 
I remember Senator Alston in those days, when he was in opposition, telling us what a great service Radio Australia was. This government gutted Radio Australia. Senator Alston in this report talked about the importance of Australia Television, that new initiative undertaken by the ABC. What happened after this government came to power? It sold off ATV. The ABC had to sell ATV in order to save funding. Let us go through a few further recommendations of Senator Alston's report, called Our ABC. I refer to recommendation 22, in relation to the appointment of persons to the board:  
Before the appointment of a person to the board, the proposed nominee should be required to appear before a joint parliamentary committee to enable the parliament to scrutinise the person's credentials. 
Did that ever happen? It didn't happen with Michael Kroger. It didn't happen with any of the appointments this government has made to the board. It goes on and on. I refer again to funding. This is what the report said about funding: 
The committee, as does the ABC, supports the current triennial funding arrangements as a means of giving the organisation a greater degree of financial security, and certainly in medium term planning. The committee supports the maintenance of current funding levels in real terms and would support favourable consideration of any application for the provision of additional funds to ensure the viability of new joint parliamentary and ABC approved charter activities. 
Senator Alston has failed singularly to carry out any one of those recommendations of the report by the committee he chaired—a report called Our ABC. Under this government, ABC has now come to stand for `Alston's broadcasting corporation'.

"Santoro, Sen Santo",LP,2003-08-21,"—The government rejects utterly the major premise being put forward by the opposition, that somehow we have cut real funding for the ABC, our ABC. When I listen to the arguments put forward by senators opposite, I believe that they just do not understand numbers. There is something intrinsically wrong with their understanding of numbers. I will repeat in this place what I have said before and go through the numbers, particularly for those out there who are listening to the broadcast of this debate, so that they can be absolutely assured—
—Publish it.
—We will publish it. You are losing the argument, anyway. People need to understand what the real figures are. For the record, the ABC will receive a total appropriation of $742 million in 2003-04, plus $17 million for ABC Asia Pacific Television and funding for digital interference management. This total funding includes additional programming funding of $71.2 million over four years provided in the 2001-02 budget—and I stress that this is the first such additional programming funding that the ABC has received in 16 years. That is for the record, and it cannot be argued against.
The government has also committed to fully funding the ABC's digital transmission and distribution costs. Over the next decade the cost of enabling the ABC's digital television coverage to match its current analog services is expected to be over $600 million, again something that cannot be argued with. If you look at the situation in a triennial context, during the 2003-04 to 2005-06 triennium, the ABC will receive total Australian government funding in excess of $2.2 billion. This is a clear demonstration of the government's commitment to the national broadcaster and to ensuring that all Australians have access to the ABC's comprehensive services spanning television, radio and online, regardless of where they live.
There are also some other statistics that honourable senators opposite may be keen to listen to. The ABC says that in real terms its funding has been reduced by $5 million since 1995-96 and it cites the consumer price index as the mechanism that gives it the ability to come up with that figure. As I have said in this place previously, the CPI measures the changes in the prices of goods and services that households buy and not those that businesses buy. Using the CPI to determine whether or not the ABC's funding has diminished is not a valid index. When we compare the 1995-96 and 2003-04 prices of goods and services that the ABC buys, we see increases of well under one per cent a year. In other words, the ABC requires $504 million in 2003-04 to maintain its 1995-96 funding levels in real terms. In fact, the ABC's 2003-04 appropriation is $591 million after excluding $151 million in transmission funding and loan funds that were not part of the ABC's 1995-96 appropriation. By this far more appropriate calculation, far from having been reduced, the ABC's real funding has actually increased 17.31 per cent in real terms between 1995-96 and 2003-04. 
I know that senators opposite may say that we can get statistics and numbers to say anything but they are the facts. I have not heard any argument against that calculation since I put that proposition in this place. I am not going to hear any sensible argument because there simply is no sensible argument against it. If you want to do it, put it up and we will debate it more comprehensively at some other time. 
When the ABC cries poor, we need to know precisely what its priorities are. Let me say that the cut in the program that people have been complaining about was a decision of the ABC board. It is the ABC board that makes day-to-day operational decisions, determines its spending and programming priorities and every other priority that it sets. That is something that again cannot be denied. To better understand its priorities let the ABC confirm whether it is spending $1.4 million a year employing 18 staff to work on the 15-minutes-a-week Media Watch program. Let's hear why it has more than doubled its self-promotion advertising budget over the last four years from $4.1 million to $8.4 million. Let's hear why it has built studio facilities at Ultimo that are the envy of every commercial operator in the country. Let's hear why it has purchased underutilised digital outside broadcast vans in every state and territory. Let's hear why it pays 116 of its staff clothing allowances averaging $3,721 a year, a total of more than $430,000 year. Why are those priorities important when others are not, to the point where we see cuts in programs such as Behind the News that, as the minister said earlier today, are icons of broadcasting? We will keep questioning the ABC; we will keep asking it to be accountable.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-08-21,"—I heard Senator Santoro struggle to make the case. The trouble that he has is that he goes to the detail without the result. The result is, and we can see it today, that there are cuts to the ABC as a consequence of the Howard government's cumulative funding cuts over the last couple of years. The ABC has been forced to cut funding and programs because of the Howard government's funding cuts. I did not hear you deny that the Howard government cut $66 million from the ABC's base funding in its first two years in office. You also did not deny that, in the 2003-04 budget, the government effectively froze the ABC's budget for the following three-year triennium and did not fully renew one-off regional funding initiatives from previous budgets, totalling in the order of $71.2 million. We did not hear those figures.
Senator Santo Santoro was taking the figures and claiming them to be the whole case but, in fact, they are not the whole case. What the good senator needs to be able to do is to look at the detail in a way that would allow the proper debate to go forward. Instead what we have is Senator Alston's agenda, and I am disappointed that the coalition is going to support Senator Alston in this regard. The agenda is clear. What Senator Alston wants to do is to stack the ABC board with conservatives and to attack ABC journalists with ridiculous claims of bias. He then wants to sully the reputations of highly respected journalists and defund the ABC to a point where it is forced to axe popular programs like Behind the News. We have already seen that. 
He then wants to call for the ABC to introduce an independent complaints panel, which already exists, and to sully the reputation of the existing independent members of the ABC complaints panel. In addition, he wants to allow senior government figures to openly canvass advertising by and privatisation of the ABC. I heard that in coalition senators' speeches today. In essence, that is what is behind some of these issues. They are the issues that are on Senator Alston's agenda and he has been on about it for some time. He has not been clear and forthright with the public. What he has done is hide behind some coalition senators and allow them to have the argument. He does not come down here; he sends Senator Eggleston and other senators to promote the argument.
What Senator Eggleston says is that the ABC should manage its affairs. There is no doubt that the ABC is managing its affairs but it is managing them in a very difficult environment created by this coalition government—an environment that it should not and need not work in. The ABC and its board have been placed in this environment by the problems that the Howard government has given them. There is no doubt about it. What this is going to do is deny children the opportunity to continue to watch Behind the News. You really wonder why, now that the ABC has been forced to axe programming, the government has the gall to turn around and blame the ABC. Shame! Shame to turn around and blame them! You have put them under stress and you have ensured that they will be the ones you are then going to blame. It is a shame. Just today it has been revealed in the Business Review Weekly that the ABC is being forced to pay $54 million to the private broadcasting firm Broadcast Australia for a digital signal that is watched by about one per cent of Australians. The minister's failed digital television regime is sucking millions out of the budget. (Time expired)

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2003-08-21,"—The State Elections (One Vote, One Value) Bill 2001 [2002] was introduced by my Democrat colleague Senator Andrew Murray, from Western Australia. It seeks to ensure the usually widely accepted democratic principle these days of one vote, one value across all of the state upper and lower houses of parliament. Representation is one of the central features of a parliamentary democracy, yet we still have a situation in Australia, specifically in the state of Western Australia, where the basic principle of one vote, one value is not being implemented— and not because of the current state government's lack of trying.
The increasing recognition of the need for one vote, one value that has developed over time is in part due to many factors that are demanding fairer representation of groups and identities such as those based on gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality and disability that in decades gone by were discounted but are now shouting more than ever to be heard. There are other ways—indeed, better ways— of doing that than simply one vote, one value, but that is a basic principle. The voting system that is then used is even more important. That is why the Democrats also have a strong and long record in relation to promoting proportional representation, which is clearly the best system for providing fairer representation of people across a range of views and backgrounds in the Australian community. That system works most effectively if it is done in conjunction with one vote, one value. 
There is, of course, an issue there to mention in relation to the composition of this chamber and the different vote values from different states. This bill does not address that—basically because it cannot, because that current structure is in the Australian Constitution—but it can address it in relation to state parliaments. Obviously, whilst most state parliaments have introduced appropriate reform over the years to ensure one vote, one value, that has not happened in Western Australia and it continues to be frustrated.
For elections to be regarded as democratic, they must satisfy at least three criteria: they must be fair, they must be free and they must be periodic or regular. In focusing on the first criterion of fairness, an electoral system is considered to be fair if all eligible citizens are entitled to vote and cast one vote only per house at an election. The concept of one vote, one value goes to the very heart of equal suffrage. Every Australian parliament has now legislated for that and for the principle of relative electoral equality, except for both of the houses of Western Australia, which has the only remaining major and significant malapportionment.
WA's electoral history records a very slow and incomplete process of democratisation. In fact, women only got the right to vote in 1899; Aborigines had to wait until 1949 to get a voting entitlement; and, of course, the voting age was only lowered to 18 in 1973 both in WA and federally. It was not until 1962 that Aborigines were also given the right to vote in the Legislative Assembly elections in WA. WA's electoral system is a clear case study in electoral inequality. At the most recent WA state election in February 2001, the metropolitan average was 25,860 electors per district, while the non-metropolitan average was 13,409. So non-metropolitan voters had about twice the voting power of those in the Perth metropolitan area.
There are further extremes within that system, with one district, the district of Eyre, having the lowest number of electors, at 9,415, while the district of Wanneroo had the greatest, with 37,720—a ratio of about four to one. In the Legislative Assembly, non-metropolitan electorates account for 26 per cent of voters but over 40 per cent of the seats. We all recognise that it is impossible to get every seat with exactly the same number of people in it, because of population variations, but it is widely recognised and all parliaments including this one have adopted formulas to ensure relative equality over a period of time. In the Legislative Council in Western Australia, the upper house, the malapportionment is even more pronounced. The north metropolitan region has 360,000 electors and the mining and pastoral region has 66,900 electors—a massive discrepancy. These are, of course, multimember electorates, but nonetheless the number of electors within those electorates is clearly hugely disparate.
It is worth noting the efforts of the state Labor Party in WA to try to reform this situation. In 2001, the state Labor government introduced two bills which sought to repeal the current malapportionment and provide new mechanisms for drawing district and regional boundaries. As is the case elsewhere, including here in the federal system, electoral districts were to be redrawn to ensure that voter enrolment in each district was no more than 10 per cent above or below the average. If enacted, it would have meant that the voting power of all Western Australians would have been equal—or as reasonably close to equal as is feasible—and it would have meant that a smaller proportion of Legislative Assembly members would have represented the non-metropolitan areas of the state. These bills were modified by the state Labor government due to political necessity—which means to get the numbers to get support in the upper house—so a modified form of one vote, one value was then proposed for the Legislative Assembly, whilst the Legislative Council and its even greater malapportionment was essentially left unaltered. 
Those two bills, as amended, passed through both houses of the parliament in 2001, with an absolute majority in the Legislative Assembly but with only a simple majority of 17 members of the Legislative Council—17 votes to 16. The Legislative Council has 34 members and, together, the ALP and the Greens WA have 18 members out of the 34, but one of those was the President and, unlike this chamber, the WA President does not get a vote. They get only a casting vote, not a deliberative vote. Therefore, the President was unable to vote and unable to provide an absolute majority technically, even though they clearly had the numbers. This contravened an aspect of the existing act which required that bills relating to redistributions be amended only by an absolute majority. That issue, as senators would probably know, was confirmed in the Supreme Court.
After the Supreme Court judgment was handed down, the WA government persevered in trying to alter the constitution of WA to allow the President of the Legislative Council a deliberative vote, which would have meant that the ALP, together with the support of the Greens, would have had the 18 deliberative votes required to pass its reform of electoral legislation. For reasons that perhaps Senator Brown might elaborate on later—it has astonished me ever since—the Greens did not support that idea; hence, the opportunity for electoral reform, at least in the lower house of Western Australia, was lost.
The opportunity for reform in the upper house had been lost previously because of the inability of the Labor government to get the support of others in the upper house for reforming the upper house. I am not quite sure why people in the upper house who were elected under the old system did not want to support the change in the system, but that is what happened. I find that a great disappointment, because it really is, as I said, the last state in Australia that has those significant problems of malapportionment. I come from Queensland and, as many senators would know, Queensland was most famous for that for many years. A malapportionment was introduced by the Labor Party but was successfully modified, using the same principle, by the National Party to assist them in maintaining power in that state for a long period of time. It became notorious around the nation, and that notoriety was, in part, responsible for helping drive the willingness and the recognition of the necessity in other states to ensure proper electoral reform and proper, fair and equal electoral representation in both lower houses and upper houses. Of course, Queensland does not have an upper house, so there was no prospect to reform that. But that was another debate.
The upshot is that Western Australia is clearly the only state with that massive malapportionment, and that is something that this bill seeks to address. It is quite clear. Some may argue about this being an interference in state matters, but personally I am not someone who worries terribly much about the concept of state rights. I think that, if we have the power to do good, we should do it. Ideally, it is better to get the states to do it when they are willing to do it cooperatively, but frankly it is now 2003 and we still have malapportionment—it has been going on for over a century—so I think the time for trying to get cooperation is perhaps past, and we might need to try to use the powers that we do have. There is no doubt that we do have the powers, as was stressed by my Democrat colleague when he first introduced the bill. Australia has committed to trying to ensure the right to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections by universal and equal suffrage. The situation in WA is clearly not equal suffrage; it is not even close. There is a continuing attempt by WA conservatives to frustrate that equal suffrage, mirroring the efforts of their colleagues in Queensland in trying, for a long period of time, to frustrate equal suffrage. 
I am sure that others in this chamber who want to put a spike in this legislation will draw on the situation that the Senate itself faces and point to the fact that we have different representation from different states that returns an equal number of senators. I concur with that concern but, as I said, that can only be changed by a referendum relating to the Constitution of Australia. Of course, we have already done that equal representation in the House of Representatives, and the lower house in the WA cannot even achieve that because of the current political situation in Western Australia.
So it is an important principle that needs to be pursued, and I would have to say again that, since the 1960s, the ALP has had a strong record on this principle of one vote, one value. As I said before, the principle of equal suffrage is one that Australia as a nation has signed up to. Many other countries, including the UK, India, France, the United States and Canada, recognise that it is now an essential feature in representative democracies. It is time to bring the whole of the Australian electoral system in line with this. The US Supreme Court, as far back as 1964, gave specific support to this principle. The federal Labor Party first introduced legislation in the federal parliament back in 1972-73—
—Would you change the Senate numbers?
—I somehow knew you would try to bring up that point; I cannot imagine why. I have already addressed your interjection twice before you interjected. You cannot expect me to say everything three times just because you were not listening when I said it the first two times.
 (Senator Watson)—Order! Senator Bartlett.
—As you quite rightly point out, Mr Acting Deputy President, I should focus on the important message I am delivering here, rather than worrying about people who are not willing to listen. The Labor Party first introduced legislation in relation to this matter in 1972-73 in the federal parliament and, in recent years, the ALP have taken the matter to the High Court with respect to the WA electoral system. So I trust that they would support this move to use the powers that we have at the federal level to enshrine the one vote, one value principle nationwide, given the intransigence that continues to occur in Western Australia.
As I understand it, there is still a challenge in relation to the Supreme Court ruling, which I referred to earlier, in Western Australia. It may be that if that is successful at least lower house reform in Western Australia will be possible, but I do not think we can sit back and wait for that. This provides that opportunity. It provides a mechanism that I think would be welcomed by people throughout Australia who have an abhorrence of unfair electoral systems. Given the inability of the WA Labor government to get sufficient support in the upper house for legislative change that would provide one vote, one value, we need to go down this path. That is what this legislation does, and I therefore commend the bill to the chamber for its support.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2003-08-21,"—The Labor Party reinforces its longstanding commitment to one vote, one value. One vote, one value was first raised by Labor when we introduced legislation into the federal parliament in 1972. The one vote, one value system is a system which Labor has been advocating for over 100 years. We advocate one vote, one value because we believe it is the fairest system, although regional areas have been—as we have heard from Senator Bartlett—sometimes a considering factor. Labor has always supported a system of one vote, one value. Australians must be entitled to participate equally in the democratic process and in public life and administration. Labor supports constitutional reform to entrench the principle of one vote, one value for all elections to ensure equal participation for all, regardless of place of residence.
The Democrats have proposed the State Elections (One Vote, One Value) Bill 2001 [2002]. This bill seeks to give equal representation to all electorates based on the projected number of votes within the next four years. This bill is specifically designed to bring Western Australia into line with other states. Senator Bartlett's speech today effectively concentrated—for good reason, I suspect—on Western Australia. However, Senator Murray also spoke on this issue back in August 2001. He described at length the merit of the one vote, one value system of elections, adding only as an adjunct that the overriding factor is `the community of interest in the area'. Labor believes that the community of interest is an important factor in determining electoral sizes and one which should not be ignored in blind pursuit of the overriding principle. Whilst the practice of grouping rural areas with regional centres situated hundreds of kilometres away may satisfy the one vote, one value principle, this does not provide for responsive and effective representation. Electorates of this nature cannot satisfy the community of interest factor, given the vastly different issues facing the diverse communities within the electorate.
To perhaps expand on the debate, it is worth looking at both sides of the argument. As we know, the National Party in Queensland prior to 1990, perhaps I know it only too well, and the much smaller Liberal Party at the time—in fact, they are probably a lot smaller now—had a system of political boundaries which I will take the opportunity to go to a little later. But one can see that you can start with a system which might seem to provide electoral clarity and fairness but can quickly lead to disparity and unfairness.
Whilst the practice of grouping rural areas with regional centres situated hundreds of kilometres away may be able to coalesce into a community of interest, one of the big problems, particularly for the remote rural electorates, is that representational size should account for the representation in government—be it at a local, state or federal government level. Of course, you can have a huge area with sparse population and therefore lose community of interest. There has been a significant outcry from country communities over changes such as that. There have been diverse views, and it is worth highlighting some of them. One from the Country Shire Association included issues such as distance, physical isolation facing rural communities and lack of representation on rural issues, including services to rural areas. Of course, we know the National Party represents those areas and we can sometimes understand the lack of representation on rural issues, including services to rural areas. The National Party has, in my view, failed to progress those well. 
Labor understands that community interest is an important part of any electoral system. It is possible that the proposal before us today could extend geographical boundaries and dilute rural community input. I will go to the bill itself during this debate, but that is one of the things that you have to be careful of in constructing an electoral system that provides for one vote, one value. You do need to actually get it right, if that is the purpose of bringing the bill here. You need to be careful that you do not end up, like the Liberal Party, with a nomenclature that is opposite to the intent of the bill. I am sure Senator Murray, through Senator Bartlett, and the Democrats were not using the Liberal trick of reversing the nomenclature. But, when you examine the bill in detail, it is still open as to whether the outcomes will be fair, open and accountable at elections based on the principle of one vote, one value.
One could argue that a key effect of representation is an understanding of local electorate issues. The Labor Party holds the majority of seats in Queensland and not the National Party or the Liberal Party because it has taken the opportunity of listening and providing effective representation. The proposed changes, with fewer members representing larger electorates, may also impede the Legislative Council's and Legislative Assembly's ability to capture the views of a diverse and more demanding electorate. We should therefore be mindful of the effects of a one value, one value system in a country as vast and with a population as decentralised as Australia.
Going to the issue that was raised in Western Australia, the Western Australian Attorney General, Mr Jim McGinty, has long pursued the aim of introducing equality of electorate size in his own state, and we heard from Senator Bartlett the problems that Western Australia has had in trying to progress that issue. Even before moving into government, Mr McGinty challenged this in the High Court. The reason for his challenge was that there was a considerable difference between the number of enrolled voters in Western Australia's metropolitan districts and the number of enrolled voters in the state's non-metropolitan districts. In fact, that again reminds me so clearly of Queensland prior to 1990. He argued that the differences were so great as to weaken the basis of representative democracy.
While the judgment in the McGinty case makes it clear that there is no constitutional requirement for equal electorate size, this is not an unqualified term. The belief might be that one vote means one value. The High Court's judgment makes it clear that this is not constitutionally guaranteed. The High Court would find in some cases that a discrepancy in the number of electors between electorates could be so great as to offend the principle in the Constitution that representatives are elected directly by the people.
In Queensland, Labor is committed to fair and regular electoral redistributions based on the one vote, one value system. Of course, it differs from the bill that Senator Murray puts forward. I will go to it principally now but we will also examine the original EARC report of 1990, which I think also sheds some light on the debate we are having today and sheds some light on the proposed bill that Senator Murray has put forward. I should say that I suspect it is Senator Murray's bill but Senator Bartlett spoke to it first. I will be corrected if I need to be. 
—I will speak last for that reason.
—Thank you. I will continue then to call it correctly Senator Murray's bill. In Queensland the ALP had pushed for many years for the introduction of one vote, one value. This ideal was brought to fruition in 1989, after the Goss government came to power. The system allowed for a system of one vote, one value for the vast majority of the state yet retained the ability for the dispersed population in our western seats to maintain an appropriate system of representation. Under the revised arrangements introduced in 1984 of the states, 89 electorates were equal in size but five large and remote electorates had smaller quotas. This meant that in terms of voters the largest seat was 58 per cent larger than the smallest.
Preparing a redistribution, the Electoral Commission ensured that the number of enrolled electors in an electoral district was not over or under the average number of enrolled electors for any electoral district by more than 10 per cent if the district had an area of less than 100,000 square kilometres. For an electoral district with an area of 100,000 square kilometres or more, two per cent of the total area of the electorate is taken to represent the number of notional electors. This figure is added to the number of actual enrolled electors in the district to make the total number of electors fall within 10 per cent of the average number of enrolled electors for an electoral district.
The reason I have taken us carefully through those numbers is because we can see, as a counterpoint to the bill proposed by Senator Murray, that his tends to be a little bit more of a blunt instrument in trying to achieve that, whereas in reality you need to examine the issue far more closely to ensure that you actually do get it right. For example, an electorate district with an average of 250 square kilometres would have 5,000 notional electors. This is added to the actual number of electors when calculating whether the number of enrolled electors is within 10 per cent of the average number of enrolled electors. This is an issue that has been addressed at a local, state and federal level.
An example of a problem that can arise in respect of the one vote, one value system, given that the legislation refers to state seats, occurs in the state seat of Warrego, which has a population—as I understand it—to date of 21,462 enrolments, with an area of 237,619 square kilometres. You can see that it is a significantly large piece of land with a population quite dispersed. The National Party, in my view, has been unable to effectively represent those people during that period and continues to not represent them well. But it is an issue that remains with the state as far as state politics goes.
When you look at Senator Murray's bill closely, clause 4 provides for equal suffrage. It states:
A House of Parliament of a State shall be directly chosen by the people of the State voting in electorates as nearly equal in size as possible but, in any case, not varying by more than 15% from the quota of voters for each electorate for that House with any variation between the size of electorates to have regard to the community of interest of the electorate including ...
If you recall earlier we were talking about the community of interest and this is where you have to be so careful in ensuring that you do not derogate from the one vote, one value system and skew it by a community of interest too far outside of what the principle actually provides for. The difficulty, I think, with Senator Murray's bill in this instance is that the way that it has been provided for may in fact not achieve its purpose.
I will return, as I indicated earlier in my speech, to the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, which produced the report on the Queensland Legislative Assembly electoral system, volume 1, which went to November 1990. The background to that report is that the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, or EARC, as it was then known, was established by the Electoral and Administrative Review Act 1989. Its major function was to investigate and report to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for Electoral and Administrative Review and the Premier on a wide range of matters relating to public administration in Queensland in order to identify and recommend proper procedures and principles to apply in Queensland public institutions to ensure they are accountable, democratic and serve the public effectively. 
It takes me back to the period prior to that when you did have what can only be regarded as a process. This was highlighted in the Fitzgerald report, which said:
The fairness of the electoral process in Queensland is widely questioned. The concerns which are most often stated focus broadly upon the electoral boundaries, which are seen as distorted in favour of the present Government, so as to allow it to retain power with minority support.
Much more is said about that in the report, but that in essence provides a picture of what it was like prior to 1990—prior to when Labor won government and prior to when Labor introduced one vote, one value into the Queensland electoral system to ensure that `Joh's gerrymander' was no longer. The National Party, which supported and propped up that system, should recant that today in this debate and support the basic principles of one vote, one value to ensure that there are fair and appropriate elections.
The basic principles of electoral systems are set out in the report. I would recommend some of the National-Liberal coalition members to go back to that 1990 report. It is not out of date; it still has currency and ensures that we do adhere to the right principles and processes. The report talks about the concept of equal suffrage being firmly established in international law. Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says:
(1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.
(2) Everyone has the right of equal access to public service in his country.
Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICCPR, says:
Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions ...
It goes on to guarantee those rights. There is the issue that I said I would come back to of the 15 per cent tolerance. With the time we have available, I may have to truncate some of the issues that I was going to cover, because there were other issues that were raised in that report and they provide some insight into some of the arguments we are still having today about four-year terms, entrenchment of aspects of the Queensland electoral system, electoral system education, whether there should be mechanisms to ensure that a majority of votes produce a majority of seats and facilities for MLAs. Given Senator Abetz's efforts over the last couple of days, it still seems to be an issue.
Turning to the rationale for the weighting that has been adopted, Senator Murray has provided a figure of 15 per cent. In Queensland, as Senator Murray I am sure is aware, it effectively went to 10 per cent. The principles for that direction were provided more cogently in the 1990 Electorate Administrative Review Commission report. The report talks about the proper principles that should apply and whether any weighting is justified. When the commission considered that particular issue, they said that anything within the 10 per cent may be justified and, if it falls outside the 10 per cent, not only is it not justified but it may attack or undermine the concept of one vote, one value to such an extent that it is no longer a viable proposition to call the system a one vote, one value system with such a high weighting that could easily be skewed. They provided it a bit more eloquently than I have done, but the gist of the argument is that they concluded that there should be in Queensland, and there should be following those principles, the major features of a system which should provide for a 10 per cent quota, if we could call it that.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2003-08-21,"—I rise to respond to this private member's bill, the State Elections (One Vote, One Value) Bill 2001 [2002], sponsored by Senator Murray. During the very short time I have been a senator for Western Australia, I have come to respect and admire Senator Murray for the diligence in the scrutiny of legislation that he brings to this chamber. I acknowledge that Senator Murray has a strong ideological commitment to the issues contained within this bill that he is apparently sponsoring. I also have a strong ideological commitment to the issues canvassed and that lie behind the bill. I emphasise that my position is diametrically opposed to that of Senator Murray's. 
I pause to express my surprise that a Western Australian senator would seek to persuade this chamber, one constitutionally established as the states house, that the Commonwealth should be seized of electoral matters of state parliaments. Further to this, there appears to be a predisposition of this bill to address the state legislatures as if they were unicameral—again a curious outlook from a Western Australia senator. Given the considerable practical shortcomings of this bill, I feel bound to acknowledge it is nothing more or less than a political advertisement of his and, indeed, the Democrats' ideological disposition with respect to the electoral systems contained within our states.
In the time allocated to me I seek to argue against this bill on the following bases: firstly, that article 25 is already being fully complied with and is therefore superfluous and irrelevant to the states; secondly, that this bill if enacted would have no practical or legal application and in fact is entirely contrary to Australia's historical constitutional intent at both the federal and state level; and, lastly, that equal suffrage, properly and legitimately defined, means different things in different states and in different houses of parliament within those states.
Firstly, article 25 and, by implication, article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: the tenets espoused are so vague and broad in terms as a statement of principle that article 25 virtually has no direct application to most Western democracies, particularly where tenets such as these are a practical and fundamental part of electoral life. In other words, article 25 is a statement of motherhood. The contrary position is to advance that Australian states do not adhere to these tenets. Is the honourable and respected senator seriously suggesting that the states do not conform now with article 25? Article 25 says:
Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions: 
(a)	To take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives; 
(b)	To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors;  
(c)	To have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his country. 
It is obvious to me, and I expect it to be obvious to all senators, that article 25 is clearly adhered to by every state in our great Commonwealth. It seems that Senator Murray is clearly taking issue with the words `equal suffrage' in paragraph (b) of article 25. What is `equal suffrage'? My contention is that Australian democracy has its own brand of equal suffrage in each of the states, and in Western Australia we have a particular brand of equal suffrage. I want to take the good senator to the relatively recent High Court case of McGinty v. Western Australia (1996) 186 CLR at 140. The High Court was looking at article 25 in that very case. His Honour Mr Justice Dawson, in talking about the electoral systems contained within each of the states, said:
Once it is recognised, as in my view it must be, that electorates of equal numerical size are not a necessary characteristic of representative government ...
He went on to say:
... no Australian colony at the time of federation insisted upon practical equality in the size of electoral divisions and the view was then plainly open that problems of communication and access in geographically large electorates outside a metropolitan area justify different numerical sizes in electoral divisions. That is a view which obviously still prevails ...
He further stated:
... there is ... the contrary view which holds that the effect of unequal electoral divisions ... is to weight the value of votes in the numerically smaller divisions. But the extra weight is only in the consequence that an elector in a smaller electorate is required to share his or her representative with a lesser number of electors than in the larger electorate. 
	...	...	...
... to ignore community of interest in the creation of electoral divisions and to insist on mere equality of numbers will be likely ... to produce inequality rather than equality of voting value.
There we have it. Indeed, the same judicial approach is taken by the Supreme Court of Canada. Secondly, Senator Murray must, as he well knows, source this bill through a head of power. There are two heads of power which this bill seeks to use or, rather, should I say seeks to abuse. The first is the use of the external affairs power contained within the provisions of section 51 of the Australian Constitution. Unfortunately, this is not enough. He needs to further engage the powers contained within section 109 of the Constitution in order to override the present constitutional electoral enactments contained within each of the states.
To put this bill in its proper context, Senator Murray is seeking to use or, as I have said, abuse the Commonwealth legislative powers to the detriment of the states in a most arbitrary and centralist way. The last time the external affairs power was so abused we got the results that we saw in the famous case of Teoh, a heroin trafficker on a temporary entry permit. Upon conviction, his deportation was sought by the then minister for immigration, who happened to be a Labor minister. Whilst the accused was on remand he had fathered a child in Australia and the High Court overturned the minister's deportation order on the basis that Australia was a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and, as the minister had failed to consider the rights of the child in question, Mr Teoh was allowed to stay in Australia. This is the sort of result that you get when you seek to make domestic laws of our great nation subservient to international covenants and treaties and, indeed, seek to abuse the external affairs power. And who can forget the way such power was abused by former Attorney-General Gareth Evans when he flew an Australian Defence Force plane over Tasmania to spy on the developments at the Franklin Dam? Those are the heads of power that this piece of legislation seeks to abuse. 
The states have in all circumstances sought to establish their own legislative frameworks on electoral matters. In many instances, such legislation contains entrenchment provisions, which mean that such enactments cannot be changed without a constitutional majority as determined by each of the constitutions on the floor of each state legislature. What Senator Murray seeks to do with this legislation is to obliterate the legislative framework and the rights of the states to make their own electoral laws. I am very disappointed with the realisation that Senator Murray, through his sponsorship of this bill, has aligned himself with the current Western Australian Attorney-General, Mr McGinty. This is a very disturbing realisation. But what is worse is that there is no mention or acknowledgement of the different electoral systems for the upper and lower houses of our state parliaments. 
Senator Murray and, indeed, the Democrats obtain their political lifeblood and oxygen from this chamber, the Australian Senate, a house of review. This bill has a clear implication that the benefits of such a house are to be denied to the states—a most curious and, may I say, disingenuous and quite dangerous approach to legislators and their election within the states. In other words, the sort of work carried out by Senator Murray in vetting and analysing legislation in this place is to be denied to the states. The inherent stability flowing from an upper house elected on a different form of franchise would be denied to the states were this bill to be enacted. This is the practical effect of the definition of `quota of voters' for each electorate as contained within proposed section 3 of the bill. Indeed, this is the very inequity which Mr Justice Dawson spoke of in the McGinty case that I have cited. 
What is equal suffrage, which is at the core of the motivation behind this private senator's bill? Why did Mr Justice Dawson make the comments that he did? Is it equitable that 90 per cent of the population of a state of Australia, such as Western Australia, will never get to visit their national capital because the distance is three times the distance of anywhere else in the country? Is that equitable? Of course it is not. Is it equitable that a significant and important part of our nation—namely, Western Australia—prod-uces 30 per cent of the total value of our export income and yet gets less than 10 per cent of the national outlays? Is that equitable? Of course it is not. Indeed, to see any of our nation's iconic institutions requires a four- to five-day drive or a couple of thousand dollars in airfares for every Western Australian. Are there any members of the senior executive service of our great national Public Service in Western Australia? The answer is: of course not.
One only needs to look at the reactions of senators from other states in committees when they are asked to hold a committee meeting in Western Australia to see the bleating, the `oh dear, I'm busy' and the `I've got something important to do'—and yet we in Western Australia travel backwards and forwards three, four or five times a month. Is it equitable that you would simply dragoon a voting system to the states as if they were all of the same generic quality?
—Yes, but what about your frequent flyer points?
—Only a Victorian would consider the frequent flyer points. Another important aspect of this legislation is the fact that it totally ignores the situation on a federal level. It is well-known—but needs to be restated for the benefit of Senator Murray—that the Senate is hardly an example of electoral equality. If he is going to legislate, why would he not have included the Commonwealth legislatures? Let us take the most recent July AEC enrolment figures: Tasmania has one senator for every 27,716 electors, WA has one senator for every 100,597 electors and New South Wales has one senator for every 356,194 electors. This is a ratio of nearly 13 to one in Tasmania's favour—and yet we hear nothing from the Democrats and nothing from the Greens, who are the principal beneficiaries of that malapportionment. I think the word is `hypocrisy'. The hypocrisy abounds behind this piece of legislation. 
In the WA Legislative Council, using the final report of the redistribution commissioners, each MLC in the mining and pastoral region represents 13,711 electors. Each MLC in the north metropolitan region—that is a metropolitan region within Perth—represents 53,452 electors. That is a ratio of four to one—well short, I think, of 13 to one—and yet we hear nothing of the Senate in this legislation. It is an attack upon the states. Again the word `hypocrisy' bubbles to the surface for us all to look at and poke at.
In the House of Representatives, the Australian Capital Territory averages 109,718 electors per MHR, Tasmania averages 66,517 electors, WA averages 80,477 electors, Queensland averages 88,059 electors, South Australia averages 87,278 electors, New South Wales averages 85,487 and Victoria averages 87,701. The Northern Territory has 109,986 electors but, with two seats—one about to be abolished—the average is 54,993 electors. When South Australia loses a seat and Queensland gains one, their respective averages will be 95,212 and 84,914 electors in each. That means Tasmanian seats will be 43 per cent below the South Australian average. WA will be 18 per cent below the South Australian average and a lot more than Senator Murray's 15 per cent. Again the word—the catchphrase of the day—is `hypocrisy'. Why would the minor parties within this chamber come here with this private senator's bill, ignoring the obvious, undermining, underlying flaw in their argument—that is, that they are here because of malapportionment? You are here because of the very things you are seeking to complain about within this act.
—You are here, Senator Murray, because you got Liberal Party preferences.
—I am very much obliged to Senator Lightfoot for that interjection. That is the real reason! I am very much obliged to Senator Lightfoot.
—And I assure him, through the Acting Deputy President, that he will not be getting them next time.
 (Senator Watson)—Order! Senator Lightfoot, please!
—I am not surprised at Senator Ludwig's support for this peculiar attempt at legislation. There is similar contempt for hardworking people in regional and outback Western Australia. Since the mid-1970s, the Australian Labor Party have used the occasion of being in power in various jurisdictions to introduce changes to electoral arrangements—in other words, to disfranchise country people. That has been their signature, their calling card and the hallmark of every bit of power they have ever abused.
It was, therefore, no surprise when the current Western Australian Labor government set out to introduce a one vote, one value alteration to the Western Australian Constitution. By undertaking this action, eight seats of the 40 or so would have been shifted wholesale from the country to the metropolitan area. The changes would alter the balance between city and country from 34 to 23 to 41 to 15. It was also no surprise when the Liberal and National parties and various rural spokespeople, allied in a grouping called the Country Alliance, expressed their determination to fight this issue—even being prepared to challenge it in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. They have taken their resistance and challenge all the way to the High Court of Australia. Indeed, the recent pronouncements of the judges in the High Court were that the Country Alliance should have been afforded costs by the state government to conduct their opposition to this attempt to shift those eight seats into the metropolitan area. 
The main argument in this case is concerned with the inequalities of representation inherent in a position where some electorates are very small and some, particularly in a state the size of Western Australia, are huge. To further deal with the judgment of that case, the Clerk of the Parliaments of Western Australia took an application to the state Supreme Court. With a majority of four to one in favour of the clerk, who would have been acting unlawfully had he progressed the legislation in that form and in breach of the entrenching provisions that were proposed by the Attorney-General, the Hon. Mr Justice Steytler and the Hon. Mr Justice Parker stated:
It is clear that s 13 was not enacted for its own sake. As indicated there was a purpose for its enactment and that purpose, in our view, is material to understanding the intended meaning of its terms. It is also relevant to the understanding of this purpose, and to the interpretation of s 13, that, in the absence of a fundamental change to the manner of constituting the Houses of the Parliament, the 1947 Act could not be repealed, in the sense of finally revoked or annulled, and not replaced.
What they sought to do was to simply repeal the Electoral Distribution Act to get around the entrenchment provisions. It was a wholly disingenuous approach, and four judges to one found it exactly that way.
Were Mr McGinty's changes in Western Australia to get through, we would have three electorates the size of New South Wales. That is what we are looking at with respect to the sorts of underlying principles, which I must say I am very surprised to see Senator Murray bring to this chamber. With three electorates the size of New South Wales how on earth could you provide democracy, representation, a constituency connection and availability of a member of parliament? This argument speaks for itself. When you scratch away the very thin veneer of the ideological facade that it is and let the hypocrisy bubble to the surface, you will realise that this legislation should be utterly and completely condemned and doomed.",SENATE,"<title>STATE ELECTIONS (ONE VOTE, ONE VALUE) BILL 2001 [2002]</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2003-08-21,"—I am certainly indebted to Senator Johnston. I listened to his speech very carefully on the State Elections (One Vote, One Value) Bill 2001 [2002]. I knew things were crook in Western Australia under this proposed legislation—but they are not crook; they are frightening. I have always thought Senator Murray was a farmer's friend in some ways. He is a little offside on some green issues but on other issues he has generally supported rural and regional Australia. But today he abandons them—casts them adrift. I am very surprised about that because he will no doubt go out into rural Australia and say that he supports various things that are near and dear to them. But Senator Murray, without representation, you are cutting their lifeline right away from them.
This bill is to implement article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights so that the election for the state legislature shall be of equal suffrage. It then goes on to say there should be equal representation. I think those two statements are in conflict because you cannot have equal suffrage and equal representation. If you have electorates the size of New South Wales, you are terribly disadvantaged. Even in the home of the Westminster system, England, there are some seats in the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands that have as few as 40,000 electors and there are other seats in central London that have many times that. You cannot have equal representation if your voice is swamped. 
Senator Murray seeks to introduce a bill based on the civil and political rights for state legislatures being of equal suffrage. I do not know what it has to do with the price of fish over here. Senator Murray, you should be defending your state, not trying to cut it to pieces. You should be out there protecting the values and the assets of Western Australia. What you are doing is undermining them by bringing this legislation into this parliament. The bill refers to states and territories. You know very well that the last senator in just about every election is from the Democrats, as they round up everyone else's preferences and squeak in over the line as the last people elected, yet you want to disfranchise rural Western Australians and I suppose every rural seat in Australia. This bill recommends that electorates be:
... as nearly equal in size as possible but, in any case, not varying by more than 15% from the quota ...
One vote, one value is not possible. We cannot even get one vote, one value in the federal election. Queensland has 88,059 voters per electorate and Western Australia has 80,477. Senator Murray, perhaps you could propose that Western Australia loses a House of Representatives seat so that you could stand up for your principles. Tasmania has 66,517 voters and the Northern Territory has 55,000. I suppose you could reduce the number of seats in Tasmania and the number of seats in the Northern Territory. You are disfranchising the rural people of Australia.
For political democracy you have to have political representation. That is granted and given only through access to your parliamentarian. You can say that constituents can ring him, email him, talk to him on a mobile phone or talk to him through the Internet, but you are disfranchising someone if they cannot actually sit down, talk to and meet their parliamentarian. If your proposal for electorates in Western Australia the size of New South Wales were to be accepted, you would be taking away the right of constituents to access their member of parliament. Each constituent deserves access to their elected member. I know in this house we have had these debates before. It is almost impossible, as some seats are so large, for constituents to access their members. A Labor Party senator mentioned not so long ago the seat of Warrego. That seat happens to be held by a friend of mine called Howard Hobbs. The only way he can service that seat is by aeroplane, and he had to buy his own aeroplane. There is no other way that he can get around. Fortunately, Howard Hobbs is a reasonably successful grazier and has the ability to fund an aeroplane. But there are not too many people who can do that. That is the only way he is able to give his electorate true representation.
Under the federal system, our rural electorates are already larger, not only in area but also in numbers, than electorates in the cities. The rural seats are seen to be losing people so fast that they are padded up at the front end so at the end of four years they finish with numbers equal to those of the city electorates. That is designed to anticipate the population moving away midway through the period of time. So, on the one-vote, one-value system in the federal elections, the rural seats already have a higher quota level than the city seats. Areas that produce great wealth, foreign exchange and overseas sales are penalised. Western Australia produces 30 per cent of Australia's wealth and Queensland produces nearly as much, yet they are the areas that lose their representation. 
What happens when you lose your representation? We are all down here fighting for the government piece of cake—whether it is a road, a hospital, a school or whatever. Once you lose your representative, you lose your road or your hospital or you do not get another hospital or road. You are disfranchised in more ways than one. We who try and decentralise Australia, we who try and get people away from the shores of Australia, are disfranchised. Australia is becoming a big doughnut: most of the constituency is five, six or 10 miles from the coast. More and more people are leaving rural Australia. More and more people are going to the cities, and there is less and less money and infrastructure going into rural Australia because of the lessening of rural representation. People in rural Australia feel that desperately.
I do not want to raise the spectre of One Nation today, but that was one of the gifts that One Nation gave Western Australia. When people voted for One Nation, they weakened the Liberal-National Party coalition and put the Labor Party in. Then the Labor Party took away their right of representation. I hope that will always be remembered. I hope it is forever in the minds of the people who were silly enough to vote for One Nation. It has turned around and bitten them very seriously. The One Nation members sit there in the parliament and do not achieve anything, but they have let the Labor Party through the gate and the Labor Party are now disfranchising rural and regional Australia.
I knew in this debate the old issue of the gerrymander in Queensland would be raised. Let me say this: I have been in the National Party since 1974. The Labor Party have got various numbers of votes, but they always complained about the gerrymander. They always said it was the gerrymander that kept them out of power. If they could not progress, they said it was because of the gerrymander. The Labor Party did not achieve 50 per cent of the vote until 1989. Guess what? They won an election because they received the majority of the vote. It is now folklore that the coalition government relied on a gerrymander. They did not. When the Labor Party were able to achieve 50 per cent of the vote, they won government.
—What percentage do you think you got in the lower house? Was it 42?
—I have never worked out the percentage in the lower house. I am reflecting on the complaint that was always brought up by the Labor Party and picked up by you that the Queensland government governed by a gerrymander. It did not govern by a gerrymander; it governed by the fact that it always achieved—in coalition with the Liberals—more than 50 per cent of the vote. When that vote went under 50 per cent, the Labor Party took power. And they did what they always do, which is go and put the boot into rural Australia.
The Labor Party has virtually given up on rural Australia. They are not out there; they do not run in many seats. They get some poor old union hack who lives in Brisbane to go out to Warrego and then their mode of operation is to run dead, not spend a zack on the seat, not do anything and then pass their preferences on to an independent and abandon the bush. You pass your preferences on to an independent then, hopefully, push the independent in, knowing full well that you have no chance—but you have actually thrown the bush out. You do not even try in the bush. You go and have some sort of a rally and you call yourselves Country Labor. It does not do any good; you have given up on the bush. The practice is, `We won't run hard; we'll run dead. We'll get some poor old hack out of the machine, push him out to the bush—he doesn't even know where it is; he never goes out—and he will run dead and get 15 per cent of the vote. We'll go and back a popular mayor; we'll push our preferences in and hope he gets up.'  
—That is going to come back to haunt you one of these days, you mark my words, Senator Forshaw. I have been going into rural electorates for a long time. The other day I flew across a particular rural electorate. When I got in the plane I was not at the extremity of the electorate but 3½ hours later, after flying in a Baron at about 400 knots—I think they go—I got out of the plane at the other end of the electorate. It struck me: how on earth can you have equal representation under section 55, as you have offered? You would either have someone who absolutely has to run around out there, neglect their family, their home life and their children to service that electorate or, alternatively, they have to neglect the electorate. I point out that about three or four years ago two wives of National Party members were unfortunately killed in cars as they went around the electorates with their husbands while they were trying to service the electorates. That was the event which caused those particularly big electorates to be offered four-wheel drives—to balance that out.
You cannot have it both ways: people in these huge rural electorates cannot have equal access to their member of parliament if the electorates are going to be one vote, one value. When you have to get in a plane and fly 3½ hours across the electorate you cannot afford to do it often, although I know that there are parliamentary allowances to do that. People want to see their representative: they want to talk to them, go into their office and they want them to be at their functions— at their rodeos or football matches. They want to have access to them. By bringing in one vote, one value you can do it another way: you can reduce the size of electorates and increase the size of the parliament—that is not particularly popular. Or you can have some sort of tolerance, as they had in Western Australia. When you are taking eight seats out of rural Western Australia and putting them in the city of Perth, when all the wealth is created in those mining industries—in the iron ore industry and the gold industry out there—that is disfranchisement in the worst possible way.",SENATE,"<title>STATE ELECTIONS (ONE VOTE, ONE VALUE) BILL 2001 [2002]</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2003-08-21,"—I rise to speak on the State Elections (One Vote, One Value) Bill 2001 [2002], as it is cited, for an act to implement article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights so that the electors for state legislatures shall have equal suffrage imposed on them. It is rather sad that the architect of the bill—at least to some degree—is Senator Andrew Murray, a Western Australian. He is not only a Western Australian senator but a Western Australian senator who was elected on very few primary votes and relied on the distribution of preferences from those Western Australians in country areas—and some of those came from the Liberal Party in Western Australia. Some came from the National Party in Western Australia. This is the sad fact. It is a sad day for me to come in here to listen to a man—I am going to listen to him very shortly—who is I believe the only one in the Democrats who has not been a leader but has the talent to be a leader. Isn't it odd? The only man who has the talent, and he is the only person who has not been a leader in the Democrats. Now I hope that Senator Andrew Murray does look to the future. He is a man with a vision, he likes what he does here and he speaks a lot of sense in this chamber at times, but this is the worst document I have ever seen any Western Australian produce. This is something like the rather detested Attorney-General of Western Australia might do if he were a senator of this place, introducing a bill that disfranchises country people in Western Australia and other country areas of Australia. 
Let me get back to Senator Murray. Senator Murray seems to me, with his vision of the future, to be something of a male version of Cheryl Kernot. He sees that at the next election there is no question that the Democrats are going to lose seats. They are led by the worst leader of any party that I have ever seen in the nearly 48 years—I think it is— that I have been in the Liberal Party and the nearly 50 years that I have been interested in politics. That man is the worst I have ever seen. He is good for us. He is good for the Labor Party, because when you are the Labor Party you can concentrate with some satisfaction on a leader who is worse than your own leader.
The analogy between Cheryl Kernot and Senator Murray might be that Senator Murray could be looking towards jumping ship. Next time elections come up, who is going to lose seats? The Democrats are going to lose seats and the Greens will pick them up. We may pick them up on this side; I do not think they will pick them up on the Labor side. When Senator Murray gets up to reply, he might like to say categorically that he is not thinking of jumping ship at the next election or the election after that when he comes up for re-election.
Let me talk about the problems with a bill of this nature for country people, particularly country people like those in the outlying states of Queensland and more particularly Western Australia. This is ostensibly a states house, and I want to remind the Senate that this whole place was created by the states. The federal government was created by the states, by a concurrence of the six states. The last one to come into the Federation was Western Australia, which was not even recited in the first articles. New Zealand was. New Zealand pulled out and Western Australia came in under `other states' under the then new Constitution. 
Western Australia was a mendicant state until we had one of the greatest politicians this nation has ever seen, Sir Charles Court. When he was minister for the north-west, he introduced and opened up the vast iron ore fields of the Pilbara. They were the biggest in the world at the time and still are today. We have the big iron ore fields of Carajas in Brazil that rival us. Western Australia is not only the biggest producer of iron ore in the world, we also happen to have the biggest diamond mine in the world, which has mined on average over the past decade perhaps 50 million carats a year. Not only do we have the biggest diamond mine and the biggest iron ore mine in Western Australia, we also are the third biggest producer of gold in the world and the biggest producer by far of gold in Australia, producing over 90 per cent of the nation's gold. We in Western Australia are the third or fourth biggest producer of nickel in the world, producing 90 or 95 per cent, or perhaps even 100 per cent now, of the nation's nickel. Not only that, we have 50 per cent on average, and over that on occasions, of the nation's wheat crop. We are the biggest exporters of crayfish in the world. We are the biggest exporters of so many other items. 
Where do all these commodities come from that give us 30 per cent of the nation's national export income? They come from the bush; they come from the rural areas of Western Australia and of other parts of non-urban Australia. If you were a Western Australian, why would you want to introduce into this place such a bill that gives us, without lie, a clear picture of Senator Murray's view for Australia, part of the global one world government, part of the global one world where you have no boundaries? This is the start of it. Why should we be subject to international ruling and international covenants in a democracy that is one of the oldest in the world? Why do we need interference by a covenant that may not work for us? It may work for other nations but it does not necessarily work for us. Why would a Western Australian want to so damage the people in Western Australia by introducing a bill of this nature? Western Australia is unique not just because it has senators like Dr Eggleston and me— 
—Great senators.
—Thank you very much, Senator Boswell. It is unique because it is the most centralised political entity of its size anywhere in the world. Seventy-five per cent of people in Western Australia live between Yanchep Two Rocks and the city of Mandurah, right along that coastal strip of just over 100 kilometres. Western Australia is about one-third of the size of the United States; it is one million square miles—yet 75 per cent of its people live within a few hundred kilometres of the state.
Senator Murray's bill would clearly encourage people from the bush without representation to come into the city again, and that is something that I think governments of all hues in Western Australia should be condemned for. In fact, one of the previous ALP leaders, Frank Wise—I think he was Wise by name and wise by nature—in 1947 called one vote, one value `evil'. This was a Labor Party Premier. And of course it was evil. But that was when there were about 60 per cent of the people living in the area along the coast between those two places I mentioned. The reason the Labor Party Premier called it evil is that it is evil. It is evil for the development of Western Australia. It is evil because it disenfranchises people in Western Australia. It is evil because the people who produce the wealth would be, relatively speaking, unrepresented in parliament. It is evil for a whole host of reasons. But it puts a particular touch of irony on the evil that it should be a Western Australian senator introducing a bill that is so damaging to the people of Western Australia and particularly to those people who got Senator Andrew Murray here in the first place.
I suppose Western Australia is vastly different from Queensland in some senses but ideologically the same. We have a great empathy with Queensland. We have a great deal in common because we are great workers and we produce a great deal of this nation's wealth. But we do not have the decentralisation that Queensland has. We do have perhaps a Mount Isa called Kalgoorlie, but we do not have a Cairns, a Townsville, a Toowoomba, a Gold Coast or those other big decentralised areas that make it easier for people in the country to be represented in parliament. Because of the 75 per cent of people living in a single metropolitan area of Western Australia, that is impossible. 
We do have the biggest electorate in the world as a result of those demographics—the federal seat of Kalgoorlie. It is unfair that that should have only one person representing about 850,000 square miles, which is virtually impossible to get around. The state is so centralised that we have towns in Western Australia that are dying because the vast regional areas are underrepresented now. Towns like Menzies are almost dead; Leonora, Leinster and Laverton are towns that are dying. Meekatharra, Mount Magnet, Yalgoo, Cue are also towns that are dying. There are towns in the Kimberley that are dying, like Derby and Wyndham. They are dying because they do not have sufficient representation. 
This bill—which strangely fits well with the socialist government that is in Western Australia at the moment—will take eight seats out of rural Western Australia and put them in the city. Where is the equity for those people who work so hard? Where is their representation? Are they going to be represented by one person in a vast electorate, as they are in the federal electorate of Kalgoorlie? Barry Haase does an extraordinarily good job in that seat. If anyone travels more than I do in the outback of Western Australia, it has to be Barry Haase. He is never home. He is always travelling. He must have a lot more energy than I have.
—What about his family? They never see him.
—That is what Senator Murray does not take into consideration, Senator Boswell. The other irony with this bill is that—it fits so well with the Western Australian socialist government, to try to disenfranchise country people—it talks about one vote, one value. Why do the Labor Party—and the Democrats because they support the Labor Party; they are like Lenin with a lobotomy—not extend this to the trade union movement? Some 19 per cent of Western Australian workers are trade unionists, but they have 50 per cent of the say in the ALP. Is that one vote, one value? Is that fair? Why should other people who want to vote Labor and are socially inclined in that respect not have one vote, one value? 
I happen to know something about trade unions, although I do not want to sound immodest. I was in the Police Union when I was a member of the mounted police in South Australia. When I did a trade, I was in the plasterers union. When I was studying geology in Kalgoorlie, I worked for Western Mining and Newmont and had to join the Australian Workers Union, which is not a bad union as far as unions go. I was in Actors Equity—some people say I should still be there. I was in the Waterside Workers Federation when I was 13 or 14—I may have been the youngest ever in that union. So I know something about unions. Some of those unions were quite good; some were not. But the time in which we needed unions of that nature in Australia has long since past.
The point is: if there is going to be equity as those opposite see it, and as Senator Andrew Murray sees it, why is there not equity in respect of the trade union movement? Why is there not one vote, one value with their workers? Why should 19 per cent of the people who are unionised have 50 per cent of the say and 50 per cent of the vote? Until recently—until Mr Crean came out beating the drum about how he was going to bring back equity to the ALP and its voting system, and he dropped it by 10 per cent—they were still controlled by the trade union movement, which represents 19 per cent of workers. So I find one vote, one value rather hollow when it comes from people who are ideologically predisposed to the ALP as Senator Murray obviously is. Senator Murray's one vote, one value bill contains something of a contradiction, and the contradiction is with equal suffrage. His parliamentary draftsman put:
4  Equal suffrage
A House of Parliament of a State shall be directly chosen by the people of the State voting in electorates as nearly equal in size as possible but, in any case, not varying by more than 15% from the quota of voters for each electorate ... 
That is something of a contradiction. But where the bill says `as nearly equal in size as possible' to each other electorate but `not varying by more than 15 per cent', if a court were to interpret that—and I hope it does not get as far as a third reading speech—I would like to see the intent of that section. Which part of that section will be taken note of in a legal sense? Will it be `as nearly equal in size as possible', which is unambiguous except for the overrider which says `not varying by more than 15 per cent'? If that is the case, I wonder whether Senator Murray does not have his eye on the Senate where we have equal representation in the six states—12 senators plus two from each of the territories. 
They are looking at the upper house. The legislation that the Labor government in Western Australia have introduced—which I understand will be knocked back by the High Court—would downgrade the value of the country vote in the upper house there. If that happens, it will be the thin end of the wedge. The next attack will be on the Senate—there will be fewer than 12 senators for those states and they will be on a per capita basis. That of course would be disastrous. We do not want this legislation. I am surprised that a Western Australian has introduced it.
Today I had the great fortune of meeting with his Excellency Mr Jalal Talabani, who is the President-elect of Iraq. The new government will be putting together a plan—I am told it will be drafted this year—that will federate Iraq, giving the Kurds protection for the first time since the Balfour Declaration in 1914 or thereabouts—nearly 100 years ago. The Shiahs will have some say in their state, the Sunnis will have some say and the people in Baghdad—where there is quite a mix of ethnicity and sectarianism—will have some say. They were very interested in the Federation of Australia and they took back with them 10 copies of our Constitution. They believe—from what they have read and studied over the past year or so—that it is the most pre-eminent of all the templates that they could use for Iraq.
Mr Talabani is one of the most revered of the 25 million Kurds who live over an area about the size of Victoria but covering Syria, Turkey, Iraq and Iran. It would be great to see them have a system like Australia's. I explained to him that the system in Australia was one of the oldest democracies in the world, even though it is one of the youngest settlements in the world—quite a dichotomy. It is just over 100 years old. That seemed to appeal to them. But, with this kind of legislation being proposed in this chamber by a fellow Western Australian, I have some doubt now—if the legislation is supported by the Labor Party—about whether there is any use in me talking to his Excellency Mr Jalal Talabani with respect to that. I hope that it stops.
Senator Murray seems to be the only one laughing. In fact, I do not know whether it is quite a laugh or some sort of convulsion that he is having. Senator Murray thinks that the issue is rather funny. I can tell Senator Murray that there is no way on God's earth that he will ever get preferences from the Liberal Party again, now that he has come into this chamber and proposed the sorts of things he proposes to do to Western Australians—to disenfranchise Western Australians, to take away the vote from country people in Western Australia, and to use the superior legislative power of the federal government in order to do it. I am surprised and, quite frankly, I am hurt because of the view that I used to have of Senator Murray. I will ensure that the people of Western Australia receive some copies of the speech here, particularly Senator Murray's speech.
If there was one thing that drove me into parliament about 17 years ago it was that I thought that country people—people from the bush—were being dealt an act of inequity by successive governments. If there was one thing that I wanted to defend for them it was their vote. They are the hard workers. They are responsible for this vast amount of wealth. They are responsible for the parliament that has been built. That money comes from the bush. I like the city—I have a home in the city—but my heart lies with the bush. It does not lie with people like Senator Murray. I hope, Senator Murray, that you live to regret your introduction of this bill today.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2003-08-21,"—The speech that we have just heard takes ratbaggery in the Senate to new heights. As soon as I conclude my contribution, I am going to go out and check the lunar calendar. I must say that I thought that contribution a little odd, Senator Lightfoot, even for you. I want to speak about the issue of one vote, one value. It is an important issue. Conceptually, one vote, one value simply means that each person should just have the one vote and that each person's vote should be equal in value to every other person's vote. An important aspect of this is that the number of electors within electorates should as nearly as possible be equal. You would hope that the principle of one vote, one value would not be controversial in a democracy such as Australia. But it is controversial, as we have heard in the debate in this chamber today. While the Labor Party has been committed to the principle for 100 years, the anti-Labor parties—in particular, of course, the Liberal and National parties— have opposed it, and they stand exposed on this issue.
For a great deal of Australia's history mainland state electorates have had a marked degree of malapportionment, typically arranged to favour rural areas. Perhaps the most famous example of this was the electoral arrangement that was in place during the years of Sir Thomas Playford IV in South Australia. During his premiership from 1938 to 1965, Adelaide—three-quarters of the state's population—had just one-third of the House of Assembly seats. When we look at election results such as those of the 1968 South Australian election, it is no wonder that conservatives in this debate and conservatives at that time so warmly embraced malapportioned electorates. In that election the Dunstan Labor government, which received 52 per cent of the primary vote, was defeated by the Liberal and Country League, which received 43 per cent—only 43 per cent—of the vote. Not surprisingly, that scandalous result in South Australia led to a very significant public outcry, and the issue of malapportionment was central to the re-election of the Dunstan government in 1970.
Almost every reform proposed by Labor at the federal and state level to democratise our electoral system—to ensure that each person's vote was equal in value to every other person's vote—has been cynically opposed by the Liberal Party, the National Party, and the National Party's predecessors: the Country Party and the National Country Party. The Dunstan government reforms were opposed by the conservatives. They were only passed by the South Australian upper house on the votes of the Liberal movement, which of course is a splinter group that had moved away from the Liberal and Country League.
There is no better current day example of the Liberal Party's opposition to the simple democratic principle of one vote, one value than their trenchant opposition to democratising Western Australia's parliament. I want to quote Gough Whitlam, who, in his speech at the ANU Law Faculty dinner on 11 November 2000, noted:
Votes for both the Western Australian Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council are worth only half as much in metropolitan areas as in country areas. In metropolitan areas the enrolment for both Houses varies between 22 079 (Perth) and 36 624 (Wanneroo). In country areas the enrolment varies between 9 677 (Eyre) and 16 746 (Mitchell). By contrast, in next year's Federal elections Western Australians will enjoy one vote one value in all their 15 House of Representatives seats. 
Gough Whitlam went on:
Nowhere in the English-speaking world are there such unconscionable divergences as in the WA Parliament. It has only one redeeming feature; all members of the Legislative Council are elected for the same four-year fixed term. WA democracy is a monstrous misnomer.
That is what Gough Whitlam said, and he was right. It is widely known that the Labor Party has championed the fight for equality of representation in parliament since its earliest days—since its formation. In fact, we have stood for proportionality in electoral representation and the adherence to the principle of one vote, one value for over a century. In 1899 the Labor Party's platform supported universal suffrage and included a straightforward commitment to one adult, one vote. This was not only a commitment to the abolition of the property franchise and plural voting but also to redressing the gross imbalance between population and the distribution of parliamentary representation.
Over the years, there have been a number of people in Australian politics who have led the fight for one vote, one value, and the most prominent of those is undoubtedly Whitlam. He has stood like colossus in the fight for one vote, one value for almost 50 years, and I am pleased that more recently it has been the Western Australian Attorney General, Mr Jim McGinty, who has taken on the conservatives—this hidebound lot on the other side of the chamber—on this important matter. As early as 1955, Gough Whitlam saw one of the principal functions of parliament as being `to redistribute and equalise liberty'. He took it as `axiomatic that parliament must be flawed as an instrument for equality if it itself was based on inequality'. He described the fight for equal representation as his `longest campaign'. His comments of 1955 have as much relevance today as they did then.
Comparisons with similar democratic countries such as the United Kingdom, India, France, the United States and Canada support the proposition that electoral equality is regarded as an essential feature of representative democracy. Whilst there are different constitutional and parliamentary structures in the United States and Canada, decisions by the supreme courts of both of those countries provide legal and practical guidance as to how the requirements of one vote, one value can be satisfied in Australia. I agree with the strong words of former Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court Earl Warren who in 1964 said this:
... the right of suffrage can be denied by a dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.
	...	...	...
The fact that an individual lives here or there is not a legitimate reason for overweighing or diluting the efficacy of his vote. The complexions of societies and civilisations change, often with amazing rapidity. A nation once primarily rural in character becomes predominantly urban. Representation schemes once fair and equitable become archaic and outdated, but the basic principle of representative government remains and must remain unchanged. The weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives. Population is, of necessity, the starting point for consideration and the controlling criterion for judgment in legislative apportionment controversy.
The historic words of former Chief Justice Earl Warren were delivered in the 1964 landmark case of Reynolds v. Sims. One vote, one value was introduced in the United States for all federal, state and municipal selections and elections by that landmark decision of the Supreme Court in the early 1960s.
One vote, one value was introduced for elections in the Australian House of Representatives when a joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate passed the Representation Act in August 1974, and the High Court upheld the act in McKellar's case in February 1977. So although malapportionment was a common feature of early Australian electoral systems, today, thanks to the Labor Party, every Australian parliament has now legislated for the principle of electoral equality. The only true exceptions, of course, are both houses of the West Australian parliament. They stand as exceptions because of the rank and blatant hypocrisy of the conservatives—the Liberal and National parties—on the democratic principle of one vote, one value. 
The opposition strongly supports the principle behind the bill that Senator Murray is proposing, because we believe that Australia's electoral system should be consistent with international standards such as article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was signed by Australia on 18 December 1972 and ratified on 13 August 1980. Senator Murray's bill proposes to implement article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights so that elections for state legislatures shall be by equal suffrage. While the principle of one vote, one value is relatively simple, drafting a bill like this is not an easy task. I hope Senator Murray would agree with that.
—I do!
—It is a very difficult task and it is particularly difficult without the resources of government. I congratulate Senator Murray on persevering with this bill and this important principle. I want to assure him and the Senate that the Labor Party strongly supports his broad objective. Having said that, I want to say that we do recognise a number of flaws in the bill as it stands. The matters of concern to the Labor Party include issues such as whether references to `a house of parliament of a state' mean both houses in those states with bicameral parliaments, because, as it stands, I think the intention is ambiguous. I think that ambiguity is compounded by the wording `shall be directly chosen by the people of the state voting in electorates as nearly equal in size as possible'. An interpretation of that could be that a state could not use state-wide electorates, as occurs in the New South Wales and South Australian Legislative Council elections.
It is unclear how the proposed model in Senator Murray's bill would cope with the existing situation in the Australian Capital Territory. There are three electorates in the ACT, two electing five members and one electing seven members. I must say that the words in the bill `not varying by more than 15 per cent from the quota' does raise the question of how equal this makes voting. Senator Murray might deal with this issue in reply. I am not clear on why the deviation figure of 15 per cent is proposed, rather than 10 per cent. Ten per cent is the current deviation figure under Commonwealth law, as I think senators are aware. The Labor Party strongly believes that the maximum figure should be 10 per cent.
I think there may be a number of constitutional issues arising from the bill, the most prominent of these being the question of the Commonwealth parliament's power to make electoral laws binding upon the states. Cases decided by the High Court have established that the existence of states, state constitutions and state laws were preserved by the Constitution and, under the Constitution, they are recognised as independent bodies politic governed by their own constitution acts. They have also established that a Commonwealth law that affects the machinery of government of a state may offend the implied federal limitation that prevents the Commonwealth from interfering with the independence of the states. It is therefore possible that legislation based on the external affairs power, albeit an incorporation of a fundamental human right such as that in article 25 of the ICCPR, would be unsuccessful in changing the constitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. But we have only to refer to Senator Lightfoot—we have absolute expertise in him in relation to these matters! He seems to know the answers to these questions. Not only that but he can predict outcomes from the High Court! That is useful for the Senate, I think— 
—And he knows who is going to run Iraq as well!
—Yes, he knows that too! I think you would agree, Senator Murray, that it is a great benefit to have somebody like Senator Lightfoot here! As I said, if we check out the lunar calendar, I think some of these questions might be answered! The principle of one vote, one value is too important a principle for us to get this wrong in implementing the legislation. I believe we have an obligation to do this and do it properly.
In the view of the opposition, the best way to do this is to refer the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I am sure that the committee will receive submissions from eminent lawyers and others whose input will greatly assist the parliament's consideration of this important matter. I think that is the best way to get this bill absolutely right and I think Senator Murray agrees that it is a sensible way for us to proceed on this very important issue. I think it is the best way to enshrine the very important principle of one vote, one value. Therefore, I move:
Omit all words after “That”, substitute:
“the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 30 October 2003”.
I commend that approach to the Senate. But I state again the Labor Party's absolutely strong and resolute commitment to the principle of one vote, one value and to getting the objective of this sort of legislation agreed to, because it is important. I am glad it has been brought on for debate and I am happy to see it progressed in this way.",SENATE,"<title>STATE ELECTIONS (ONE VOTE, ONE VALUE) BILL 2001 [2002]</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-08-21,"—I am very pleased to be giving a short submission to this debate on the State Elections (One Vote, One Value) Bill 2001 [2002] because I too stand very strongly for the principle of one person, one vote, one value. Senators here might recollect that very recently I moved a motion in this house to have that principle applied to global democracy, and only the Greens supported it on that occasion. That said, we are dealing here with important legislation from Senator Murray, and it inherently has my support because it is based on the fundamental principle of democracy that all people are equal and therefore it follows that all votes are equal. 
Because I was brought up in the bush, I was brought up seeing a weighting for sectional interests, but it became very clear to me that those sectional interests very often meant a weighting towards the wealthy rather than towards the people in the bush as such. 
—This debate about loading in the bush came long before the debate about the Indigenous people of Australia, but I think they also warrant—and have always warranted—being part of the universal human norm, which is for one person, one vote, one value. If I am not wrong, Senator Murray has based his legislation on the universal political rights of people, as it has come from the United Nations.  
That said, I note that in Western Australia this has been a matter of controversy. The Greens supported the government's legislation to move towards but not completing the job of making one person, one vote, one value. It was held up in the upper house because the Labor government moved to give the President a deliberative vote on top of a casting vote. The important legal advice that the Greens have is that had the President of the upper house in Western Australia cast his vote at the important moment when the votes ended up 17 to 16 it would then have been 18 to 16 and the legislation would have passed the upper house. However, that vote was not used by the President, if I am right, because it was thought that under the 1890s arrangement for the Legislative Council he did not have a vote. But the legal advice is that where the Constitution comes into play the President did have that vote, and had the President cast that vote this legislation would have passed. The Greens were not in favour of a position which gave an equally elected member of an upper house two votes as against the other members' one vote. I understand that matter has been referred elsewhere.
—It was referred to Senator Lightfoot.
—Thank you, Senator Faulkner, for mentioning Senator Lightfoot. I would suggest to Senator Lightfoot two things: firstly, he understand that once you start to move away from the principle of one person, one vote, one value there is no other line; you open the way to electoral abuse and gerrymander. Secondly, he would do well to read resolution P6 of the standing orders of this place which says clearly that you must not put pressure on any senator making a deliberation on how to discuss a matter or how to vote on a matter.
I will be supporting the amendment of Senator Faulkner. It is important legislation that Senator Murray has brought forward; we do need to know that it is right. One thing that does concern me is that, because of the limited private members' time in the Senate, there may not be the will to allow this legislation to get through later this year or early next year.
—That is why we are better off sending it to a committee so that we can say— 
—It does not prevent the filibuster being brought in to prevent the legislation at a later stage from simply not getting—
—The opposition will not be filibustering it.
—But the government might—and that concerns me. It is good legislation and it warrants being looked at by the committee and the committee receiving input. I will be very interested to see the outcome of that inquiry and then to help proceed with this legislation which, as I understand it, applies to all states and territories— not just Western Australia. The only one cavil I might have with it is the 15 per cent component. I would have thought 10 per cent is far enough elasticity when you are dealing with the latitude that there ought to be in determining how big and how small electorates are. 
Finally, there is one thing that is really remiss in Western Australia—it is remiss in this parliament and all the mainland state parliaments as well—and that is, if you are going to really value people's votes, you have to have proportional representation; otherwise, as we saw in the last Western Australian election, big slabs of people who voted for the Greens, for the Democrats and for One Nation have no representation in parliament, and that is a very big section of the voting public. And the single member electorate system—the winner takes all system—robs people of their democratic right and the weighting of their vote. If the Gallop government really wants to look at an area which is manifestly robbing voters of their value when they happen to be voting for minor parties in the house of government, then they have to bring in legislation for proportional representation in the Western Australian parliament.  
The only parliaments that have got that right as far as the house of government is concerned are those in Tasmania under the Hare-Clark system—thank goodness for Andrew Inglis Clark, who we Tasmanians think penned the Constitution, who saw that the Hare-Clark system came in by about 1908— and the ACT, which has followed suit. New Zealand now has proportional representation of a different sort.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2003-08-21,"—Tonight I would like to say a few words about an innovative Western Australia company, Clinical Cell Culture, known as C3, and about an inspirational woman, Dr Fiona Wood.
—Adult cells, I hope.
—Indeed, Senator Boswell, and I assure you that they are not in any way stem cells. Clinical Cell Culture, although not a household name, has come to public attention in recent months as a result of the bombings in Bali which caused such horrific burn injuries to those holiday-makers and others unfortunate enough to be in the proximity of the blast zone. Revolutionary skin replacement products developed by Clinical Cell Culture were used in the treatment of quite a number of the bombing victims at the Royal Perth Hospital. 
I first became acquainted with C3, as it is called, in 2001 when I was approached to assist the company to arrange meetings with various ministers and their staff in Canberra. I was subsequently shown around the company's headquarters in Technology Park, Bentley and came away impressed by the enthusiasm and dedication of the staff and the innovative nature of the products they were developing. C3 was founded in 1999 by Dr Fiona Wood, the company's chief medical officer and executive director, and Ms Marie Stoner, the company's chief scientific officer and also an executive director. As well as being involved with Clinical Cell Culture, Dr Wood is a consultant plastic surgeon at the Royal Perth Hospital, Director of the Burns Services of Western Australia as well as being a mother of six children in her spare time.
The company and Dr Wood have been the subject of media interest, particularly since the Bali events. Recently Dr Wood was featured in the 21 June edition of the Weekend Australian magazine. According to one newspaper article, Dr Wood is described by colleagues as a forceful, dynamic and energetic woman. Having met her myself, I can attest to the truth of those comments. Clinical Cell Culture has set out its vision:
To become a world leader in the development of tissue engineered cellular products and set international standards in tissue repair and reconstruction and regeneration with the aim of improving patients' quality of life with minimal scarring.
The C3 company has developed a spray-on skin called CellSpray for the treatment of major burns and scarring. A small biopsy of skin is taken from the patient—about the size of a 20c coin—which is cultured and cells are grown, which are then resprayed onto the wound. CellSpray can be used by itself or for deeper burns in combination with skin grafts. CellSpray has a number of advantages over conventional treatments, particularly in the speed of treatment, lessening the risk of scarring. Cultured skin sheets can take up to 21 days to grow, which is the conventional way of providing grafts, but with CellSpray skin cells can be grown and then sprayed directly on the wound in as little as five days. According to the company, this time saving is crucial because to avoid significant scarring it is important to apply the skin graft within 10 days of injury. Dr Wood says that, if a wound heals in 10 days you have a four per cent chance of significant scarring. If it takes 21 days that scarring risk goes up to 75 per cent plus. Scarring does not just have a cosmetic or psychological impact; if it is severe enough it can restrict normal movement and mobility. Dr Wood's focus is on reducing scarring. She has said:
I believe that the treatment that we use does reduce scarring ... I want people to regenerate, not repair.
She further said:
I would say there is no such thing as an acceptable scar. The aim for us is to develop technology that leaves patients scar-free. That's our Holy Grail.
Because it is in a spray form, CellSpray is easily applied. An application over a large burn can take only minutes rather than the time consuming task of applying sheets of skin in surgery, which is the conventional way of treating such large burns. As well as reducing scarring, spray-on skin allows for shorter hospital stays and less follow-up surgery. Clinical Cell Culture has developed an express version of CellSpray, called CellSpray XP, for the treatment of less extensive wounds, where cells can be harvested in as little as 48 hours after the initial biopsy. This means that the patient can be treated within days of injury, improving the chances of an optimal outcome. C3 has said that, despite the efforts of other, large companies trying to reproduce CellSpray technology, the company is not aware of any product capable of duplicating the speed, cell yields or reliability of C3's CellSpray. It is a tribute to these people who have developed such advanced technology in Australia. 
In addition to CellSpray, Clinical Cell Culture is working on another product called ReCell which, unfortunately, is not yet commercially available. ReCell has been successfully used to treat a wide variety of skin defects, including small acute burns, laser resurfacing, vitiligo and other hypopigmentation diseases, scar revision and thick skin, such as on the sole of the feet or the palm of the hand. It is expected that the major use of ReCell will be to improve the outcome of plastic and cosmetic surgery procedures. The first product developed by the company C3, CellRepair, consists of skin sheets that can be delivered after only 14 to 15 days, compared with the 18 to 20 days that most of their competitors have been able to achieve so far. 
More than 1,600 procedures have been carried out with products developed by C3. The company says that CellSpray has been used to treat approximately 1,250 burns patients, predominantly in Australia and New Zealand but also in the UK, South Africa and Malaysia. An example of the use of spray-on skin has been to treat the face of a 13-year-old girl in England who, as a toddler, was burned in an accident. Products developed by the company were also, as I said earlier, used to treat more than 25 of the victims of the terrorist explosions in Bali. Those victims have done very well with the use of C3's products, with very little or minimal scarring in most cases.
From an Australian industry point of view, the products developed by C3 possess a significant export potential, particularly in light of the growing number of plastic and cosmetic procedures performed worldwide each year, but developing this export market has been hampered by the need to obtain regulatory approvals. The company is focusing on getting regulatory approvals for CellSpray in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, the United States and Japan. 
The company's ground-breaking work has been aided by a number of the Howard government initiatives and programs. For example, in April this year, Clinical Cell Culture was awarded a grant of more than $150,000 under the Biotechnology Innovation Fund to assist its research activities. In addition, the company has received more than $140,000 in research and development rebates and in excess of $130,000 in export rebates in this financial year.
In conclusion, Clinical Cell Culture is an example of an innovative Western Australian company that is making a positive difference to the health and wellbeing of Australians, whose products possess a significant export potential and will make a great deal of difference to burns victims around the world. I would like to extend the company my best wishes in its endeavours.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Clinical Cell Culture</title>,Adjournment,37,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2003-08-21,"—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	Australian Detention facilities:
(a)	Outgoing mail for detainees is processed every business day (Monday to Friday). Mail is delivered from Australian detention facilities to Australia Post within 24 hours.
(b)	Incoming mail is either collected from Australia Post, or delivered by courier, on every business day. Mail is generally delivered to detainees within a 24-hour period.
Offshore Processing Centres:
Australia has no detention facilities overseas, nor does Australia have Immigration detainees outside Australia.
(2)	(a)		Records from the Woomera Immigration Reception Processing Centre have been archived, including any records of mail received by detainees that may or may not have been recorded. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) is unable to commit the resources to identify if a letter took three weeks to reach a specific destination.  
Australasian Correctional Management Pty Ltd at that time had developed procedures concerning mail delivery. Although there is no specified timeframe for delivery of mail, similar to answer (1)(b) mail is generally delivered to detainees within a 24-hour period, unless affected by broader issues concerning the safety and security of a detention facility, or widespread disturbances as happened at the Woomera facility between July and September 2000. Either of these factors may have slowed mail services to detainees.  
(b)	Australia has strict privacy rules which permit the disclosure of information held on individuals by DIMIA only in very limited circumstances. While the Privacy Act 1988 prevents me from discussing details relating to the person you have listed in your question, any detainee placed under observation is watched by detention officers, or other specialised staff dependent on case management requirements, to ensure they do not commit an act of self-harm or commit harm to others or to ensure the safety of the detention facility.
(3)	Mail and medical care to detainees under observation are not affected under any circumstances. However, other amenities for detainees can be disrupted at times:
(a)	for practical reasons, for example where equipment or facilities have been destroyed or damaged by detainees; or 
(b)	in the immediate aftermath of significant disturbances in a detention facility where staff are fully focused on addressing the disturbance.
Access to amenities can be limited where such amenities are being or may be used or abused in such a way as to pose a risk to the safety and security of the detention centre. 
DIMIA has a duty of care to all detainees, staff and visitors which means that there may, at times, be limitations on amenities for those not involved in disruptions but this may be important for their own safety.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,38,1,answer
