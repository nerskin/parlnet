"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-04,"—The Democrats, having thought about expiration of the act and the sunset clause, have come to the conclusion that the shorter the better. As a result of that, I will not be moving this amendment and will vote for the next one, which is a shorter sunset clause.
—The next amendment is amendment No. 1 from the Australian Greens and Pauline Hanson's One Nation.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—I move:
(1)	Page 2 (after line 2), after clause 3, insert:
4  Expiration of Act
		This Act ceases to be in force on and from 1 January 2001.
The One Nation amendment, if passed by the committee, will bring into effect a sunset clause on the bill that will terminate the bill on 1 January 2001. I have had overwhelming correspondence in relation to this bill, and the entire substance of that correspondence has been by way of concern, alarm and in some cases demands for the Senate to defeat this bill. This is coming from people right around Australia; it is not confined just to Queenslanders. Opposition to this bill is widespread and comes from all states of the Commonwealth. The concern varies. It goes to issues of this parliament passing a bill that will bring about an instance where the Australian defence forces may be called upon to fire upon Australian citizens with lethal force. It goes to whether the bill itself is constitutional. It also speaks quite consistently to the fact that again the Commonwealth government is enacting legislation that is eroding the rights of the states.
I would like to briefly go to the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, which looked into the bill. During that inquiry, we had concern from the New South Wales government relating to this bill, particularly that they had not been consulted. Section 1.24 of that report said:
The NSW Government submitted that it was `concerned that the Bill may operate to override the National Anti-Terrorist Plan, which [it understood]—
that is, the New South Wales government—
was intended to operate over the period of the Olympics'.
The Victorian Premier wrote to the Senate committee as well. Section 1.25 of the report said:
In a late submission, the Victorian Premier wrote:
A significant reason for the delay is that the Commonwealth has not consulted with Victoria on this Bill, which I find concerning given that the Bill directly affects the States' roles and responsibilities when responding to terrorist and emergency scenarios. It is disappointing that my Government first became aware of such a critical Bill from a Senate inquiry.
So there we have the Premier of Victoria finding out about the bill during a Senate inquiry. The Premier went on to say: 
Victoria is not going to be in a position to consider whether to endorse the policy encapsulated in proposed section 51A, until the Commonwealth engages in a dialogue. The Commonwealth must explain why it is necessary to have legislated powers to intervene in State matters without a request for assistance from the State, and why the Defence Force warrants receiving the significant powers provided in the Bill. The Commonwealth also needs to clearly explain why its objective of streamlining call out procedures cannot be achieved by the Commonwealth amending its own relevant legislation and regulations and/or engaging the States and Territories in a rewrite of the SAC-PAV NATP protocols. None of these issues are dealt with in the Second Reading Speech or the Explanatory memorandum to the Bill. 
So the New South Wales and Victorian governments have clearly articulated that they were not consulted in relation to this bill. It is with these concerns that I have moved One Nation's amendment to the bill. It has been clearly indicated by the Australian people that their first preference is not to have the bill in the first place. Their second preference is that if the bill is going to be in place for the Olympic Games, the Paralympics and the World Trade Organisation meeting in Melbourne, then so be it. But if the bill is necessary to provide security not only for the Australian people but also for the participants in all of those functions then when it has done its job it should cease to have effect.
The bill itself, as I said earlier, raises issues relating to conflict with the Constitution. The Constitution clearly says in section 119 that the Commonwealth is required to provide security to the states. Quick and Garran go on to say: 
The Federal Authority is not required or empowered to interfere to protect a State against domestic violence, except on the application of the Executive Government of the State.
So, when the Constitution was drawn up, the position of our founding fathers was that section 119 could only be triggered at the request of a state. They go on further to say: 
But even if the State is unable to cope with domestic violence, the Federal Government has no right to intervene—
and I emphasise `no right to intervene'—
for the protection of the State or its citizens, unless called upon by the State Executive. If, however, domestic violence within a State is of such a character as to interfere with the operations of the Federal Government, or with the rights and privileges of federal citizenship, the Federal Government may clearly, without a summons from the State, interfere to restore order.
It goes on further to clarify that by saying:
Thus if a riot in a State interfered with the carriage of the federal mails—
and federal mail is a responsibility of the Commonwealth—
or with interstate commerce—
again, a federal government responsibility—
or with the right of an elector to record his vote at federal elections, the Federal Government could use all the force at its disposal, not to protect the State, but to protect itself.
That is the essence of why section 119 was inserted in the Constitution. It clearly articulates that the Commonwealth can only interfere where a state has requested such assistance. It also very clearly says that if the Commonwealth is going to interfere within a state it can only do so to protect Commonwealth property or, as Quick and Garran have articulated, it can only interfere within an area for which the federal government has responsibility.
The bill that we have before us carries none of those provisos other than the state police commissioner can request of the Governor-General for the ADF to be called out. There are other inadequacies in the bill which I will highlight later that go to, I believe, a lack of consultation or ability for the Federal Police to be involved in the process. Later I will be moving amendments to the bill in an attempt to rectify what I believe are those deficiencies. So the intent of One Nation's amendment is that, should the bill be carried, the bill would cease to operate at the applicable date, 1 January 2001.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—The Australian Greens also proposed to move that amendment. This whole debate on the eve of the Olympics began for the Olympics—that is, the bill before us could give the politicians in Canberra the ability to call out the armed services if something went wrong at the Olympics. Moreover, it could do so with or without a request from the state government if the Commonwealth felt that its international interests were at stake. Mr Moore, Minister for Defence, in the early part of the public debate said that the bill was for the Olympics, but we find that that is not the case. This bill is for ever and a day. Both the Labor and Liberal parties want at their disposal the power to bring out the Army for some foreseen or unforeseen future event. Effectively, they believe that the Army, acting as a police power, should be able to help them keep the peace, presumably over some domestic political issue in which they have a point of view in government to defend. 
I will not recount the points that were made during the debate last Thursday. I will add some points as we come to each of the amendments before the house. I cannot understand why Labor is not supporting this amendment. Labor is today saying that it has forced the government 4-0 to adopt its amendments. It seems to me that what, in effect, has happened is that Labor has gone a long way towards meeting the government and the government has gone a little way towards meeting Labor. The two big parties have made an agreement which sells out the public interest. It certainly sells out the huge number of people who have been sending mail to my office and who do not want the Australian Defence Force put at the disposal of federal politicians for unspecified events for ever and a day.
I repeat that, if this was an antiterrorist bill, okay—but it is not. This bill opens up the field in the future for politicians to use the Australian Defence Force against Australian protestors—peaceful or otherwise—and against strikers. It says that there has to be a likelihood of violence—we will get to that in a moment. I cannot believe that the Labor Party is supporting such legislation, but it is. It has made the required political manoeuvres, as far as it is concerned, to help it feel warm about something that it should feel a rush of horror about. However, the big parties have got together.
I believe that this is against the Constitution—that will be tested further down the line, no doubt. When we get to the appropriate juncture, I will read out one of the opinions as to why it is against the Constitution. In the meantime, I commend this amendment for a sunset clause, so that this bill, which will be there for the Olympics, the Paralympics and the World Economic Forum in Melbourne in a week's time, will become inoperative after that. In fact, it would become inoperative on 1 January 2001. The fact that both Labor and Liberal oppose—and we are going to lose—this amendment shows that they want these powers available for ever and a day. They say that they want to codify the circumstances in which the military is used against terrorists in Australia. I would have no problem with that, but this does not codify it at all. It sets out some wide parameters. The code is in the manual—which we have not seen; we were told that we would see it this week—that is going to replace the Manual of Land Warfare, which describes how civilians could be shot and how and when tanks could be used and describes a number of other things regarding the use of the armed forces. The unthinkable is the Australian Defence Force being arrayed against Australian civilians somewhere in the future at the behest of Commonwealth politicians.
I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence if his commitment of last week—that the new manual be made available to the Senate—can be made good today. Or is this going to be a case of, `We will show you the specific new arrangements for the use of troops after this debate is over,' when the public can no longer have meaningful input into the legislation because Labor has helped to get it through the parliament?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-04,"—The Democrats believe that the sunset clause is the most important amendment to this bill. Of course we will be trying to vote down the bill, but I do not think that we have the numbers. The reason I withdrew my own amendment on the sunset clause in favour of this amendment, moved by the two other senators, is that my original amendment was to take in CHOGM in Brisbane next year, and then do a report on that. Since then, the Democrats have been thinking about it, and we really think that the shorter the sunset clause, the better. This has a much shorter sunset clause.
I reiterate what I said last week: there is no need to hurry this through. There is very good security in place for the Sydney Olympics, and we do not expect it to be needed in the near future. It would be nice to get the rules straight, but we do not think that these are the rules that should be got straight. We think that we need different rules. We will be supporting this sunset clause, and we recommend it to everyone else in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—In support of Senator Bourne, Senator Bourne raised the issue of the judgment for the sunset clause being inserted into the bill. In One Nation's instance, it is because we firmly believe that there is an alternative. We are not saying to the Australian people that we want to go to a situation where there is no capability of protecting either the rights of the state or the rights of the Commonwealth—far from that situation. 
Senators, in debating this bill, have referred quite substantially back to the bombing of the Hilton Hotel. As a result of that terrorist activity—and it cannot be labelled anything other than that; whether it was carried out by perpetrators within or without Australia, that was a terrorist attack—the Standing Advisory Committee on Commonwealth-State Cooperation for the Protection Against Violence was put in place. That is now commonly referred to as SAC-PAV. In questions to Senator Amanda Vanstone last week, I requested of the minister some information as to the history of SAC-PAV. The purpose was to put on the record what SAC-PAV was brought into existence for and how it has actually carried out that function. The minister chose to relay to the chamber that SAC-PAV was just a committee. I do not wish to misquote Senator Vanstone, but she gave no effective detail as to the functions that SAC-PAV carries out. So I am going to what their own documentation that is provided on the Internet sets out:
SAC-PAV is based upon national cooperation and it has established nation-wide capabilities in such areas as crisis management, command and control, intelligence, investigation, bomb response, technical support, bomb scene examination, negotiation—
however, they do not elicit how far those negotiations go or what issues they negotiate on—
VIP protection, police tactical response and media cooperation.
So the purpose that SAC-PAV was brought into existence for is very wide reaching, and I believe sincerely that SAC-PAV has the capacity to respond in a timely and efficient way to any necessities that we have or that should arise in the Commonwealth. SAC-PAV's own information goes further to set out the development and training philosophy:
SAC-PAV development and training are aimed at developing capabilities that are available for, and can demonstrably contribute to the countering of politically motivated violence.
Activities are conducted according to endorsed national priorities for the development and maintenance of counter-terrorism capabilities.
Activities are conducted as part of a coordinated national program—
so here we have an organisation already in place that has, as part of its development and training philosophy, `a coordinated national program'—
designed to ensure the orderly development of appropriate capabilities in each State—
and I emphasise `in each State'—
and the most effective use of limited resources. All training is to be subject to rigorous evaluation.
So they have accountability and they have operations that effectively cover and work with all state organisations.
One question that I put to Senator Vanstone was in relation to what activities SAC-PAV had carried out. The answer was, `Well, the committee has not carried out any activities.' The committee may not have, but the people who form SAC-PAV certainly have. Again, they set out in the information that is freely available:
Exercises are conducted to test national and local response plans and to practise participating organisations in their responsibilities. Smaller scale exercises test the internal efficiency of a single level of the response machinery while larger scale exercises practise several levels at working together.
In asking Senator Vanstone that question, I was looking for some practical instances where SAC-PAV had actually carried out those functions. What we are forced to rely on now is the information from SAC-PAV's own web site. They are clearly saying that they conduct exercises in local areas to test local response; that they then have small scale exercises that can, and do, evaluate the efficiency of individual response teams—and that can be the state police, the Australian Federal Police, the Army, or the local emergency services; and that they carry out larger scale operations that look at the ability of those organisations to work together. 
So what is the government setting out, or claiming to set out, to do with this bill? I believe that it is setting out to do exactly what SAC-PAV does now. So we have the interesting situation where the government is saying one of two things: either that the operations of SAC-PAV are, in their way, insufficient to provide security for both states' rights and Commonwealth rights; or that the government knows something that it is not telling us about. It is with this in mind—the fact that SAC-PAV is there, that it is an efficient operating service and that it was put there to provide security for the Australian people and to protect them against any form of violence—that we are moving this amendment that will cause the government's bill to cease as of 1 January 2001. Therefore, we are not leaving Australia in a position of being vulnerable to any terrorist attack or of not having the ability, on a state basis, to control any domestic violence. In closing my remarks, I would just say this: I believe that SAC-PAV carries that role out efficiently, it is there and there is no need for this bill to continue beyond the proposed date that we have set for the cut-off.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—As the committee has heard from Senators Bourne, Brown and Harris, there is a certain logicality for those who are going to oppose this bill to support a sunset clause. That makes a little sense to me. It also makes sense to suggest that those who might oppose a sunset clause are senators in the chamber who are likely to support the passage of the bill. Having said that, let me say that the position of the opposition has been to support the bill if—and only if—adequate and appropriate amendments to the bill are passed.
We have maintained the position that we want a proper legislative framework for the exercise of the existing constitutional powers of the Commonwealth government to use the Australian Defence Force in domestic security situations. We have accepted in our approach to this legislation that the current situation is not a satisfactory one. That is why we have proposed amendments to this bill—very significant amendments—but we have done so from within the framework of trying to improve the current situation, because we find the current situation unsatisfactory.
The problem with a sunset clause in any piece of legislation is that, if you pass the clause, if you have a sunset clause, you then revert back to the situation that existed prior to the passage of the legislation. If you think the legislation is unsatisfactory, as I say, it is quite logical to support a sunset clause. The opposition's approach here is to try and improve significantly the government's bill. We do accept that legislation is needed in this particular area. It is for that reason that we have not found favour with the proposals that have been before the chamber—and a number of them do stand in a number of different senators' names. We have not found favour with those proposals for a sunset clause, because any sunset clause would have the effect of taking us back to the current situation, the status quo, which we have acknowledged we believe is unsatisfactory. If we did not have that approach, we would not vote for the legislation—unless the legislation were amended in a form that is acceptable to the Labor Party. I think I have outlined this approach to the committee previously.
But, having said that, I think it is important to note that the opposition certainly accepts that it is appropriate to examine the implementation and effect of this legislation. That is why the opposition has been so keen to have a thorough and adequate review process in place, which is a matter that the committee has dealt with previously. We have had this debate previously—it seems that we have been debating this matter now for a number of days—and I do not want to prolong the debate on this issue because I think some of the substantive questions before the chair, some of the arguments, are very similar to those that have been mounted previously. But I do think, on this important amendment for a sunset clause—and I do accept that it is an important amendment—it has been appropriate for me to outline the opposition's position.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—I note the coverage of a press release from the Labor Party today in which the relevant spokesman for the Labor Party, Stephen Martin, said to reporters: 
With less than a fortnight to the start of the Sydney Olympics, pressure is mounting for legislation to enable the defence forces to be called out in a civil emergency and for personnel to be protected from legal proceedings if a civilian is shot.
I ask Senator Faulkner whether he could elaborate on that. What are the circumstances in which civilians can be shot and in which members of the defence forces should be protected from legal proceedings? ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Perhaps for the first time ever Senator Brown finds himself in front of me on this issue. I have not seen the press release to which he refers, but if he cares to pass over a copy I will quickly scrutinise it. Senator Brown, I am disappointed that you have given closer attention to an opposition press release than I have. I feel absolutely ashamed that that is the case.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—While Senator Faulkner is doing that, I should add that Ben Oquist in my office, who is faster than light, can take the credit for me having that available. But it does raise this question: what are the circumstances in which people from the Australian defence forces will need protection from legal proceedings when civilians are shot? I would be happy to wait until after a resolution of this matter for that answer, as it is not specifically germane to the issue.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2000-09-04,"—This is the first occasion I have entered into this discussion, though senators will remember that on some previous occasions I have been very interested in the question of defence aid to the civil power. Even before the Hilton bombing inquiry, certain matters were being raised. But I want to put it very clearly on the record that my concerns are still there about the need to ensure horses for courses—the Defence Force is there mainly for a particular purpose.
I remind the Senate of a letter that was written to the Australian newspaper on 22 September 1989. I referred to that in a debate on 26 September 1989. It was a letter by Air Vice Marshal B.H. Collings. It raised a question as to whether the use of the Australian Defence Force is for the purpose of giving assistance to the civil community or whether it is an aid to the civil power. Of course, the distinction was clearly focused during the pilots' strike, as honourable senators will recall. The pilots went on strike without reference to the ACTU, the central trade union movement, or to the labour councils of any state and contrary to the best interests of orderly industrial progress and certainly the orderly industrial progress for which the conciliation and arbitration system was established. You had the survival of the fittest.
On that occasion, you had the state of Tasmania absolutely out on its own. It was being slowly starved of essential services. Because of the lack of transport to and from Tasmania, people could not get to and from the state for urgent reasons, such as seeing dangerously ill relatives and the like. It was proposed after quite a considerable period that the RAAF could be used not for aid of a civil power but for assistance to a civil community. I distinguished that, of course, from other flights over the state of Tasmania. Senator Brown, I am very interested—and you will excuse me for saying this—in how strong you are about this business now about the use of defence aid to the civil power. I did not see that strength exhibited when the RAAF was ordered by ex-senator Gareth Evans to fly over Tasmanian dams to get evidence for a federal court case, uninvited of course by the state government or by anybody else. Former senator Gareth Evans was titled Biggles after that, I think. Nevertheless, I am glad to see that you have taken another view now, Senator Brown.
—I took the same view then.
—Did you?
—Yes, I did.
—My apologies. I did not hear it at that stage. But I would like to ask the minister about the distinction. Where is the dividing line in this legislation—that is, the dividing line, as Air Vice Marshal Collings said at the time, between giving assistance to the civil community and providing aid to the civil power? By the way, I am inclined to vote for the sunset clause. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Through you, Madam Chair, I will respond to Senator Brown's question to me, and the minister will deal with the weighty issue that has been raised by Senator Harradine in his contribution. Senator Brown has been kind enough to give me a copy of what he described as a press release. It appears to me to be a wire story, Senator Brown, not a press release, under the heading `Labor confident anti-terrorist amendments will be accepted'. I think you quoted correctly from it. The story says:
With less than a fortnight to the start of the Sydney Olympics, pressure is mounting for legislation to enable the defence forces to be called out in a civil emergency and for personnel to be protected from legal proceedings if a civilian is shot.
Senator Brown asked me what that actually means. I have no idea whether my colleague Mr Martin, the shadow minister for defence, who is quoted in this story, said that. Those words are not in inverted commas, and it does not say that Mr Martin said it. He may have; I do not know. I can deal only with the information that you have so kindly provided to me. However, let me take that at face value and say to you that the approach the opposition is taking to the legislation is that there is an element here of providing protection to ADF personnel. You might ask: what is achieved in that regard? In simple terms, if this legislation is passed, it will become clear under which laws and military regulations ADF personnel operate if there is a call-out. That is one of the benefits of the legislation. I would be interested to hear your view, Senator Brown.
I do not know whether Mr Martin is quoted there—whether they are Mr Martin's words or just a journalist's words. The opposition have identified that there is a problem now, because the Commonwealth does have the power—as you are aware, Senator Brown—to call out the troops to protect the Commonwealth's interests. That is the current situation. We are concerned about the fact that, once the troops are called out, they are covered by a mishmash of Commonwealth and state laws and military regulations. So there is that particular problem. Let me be absolutely clear: in the very unfortunate circumstance of a call-out, as far as the opposition are concerned, we are not ashamed to say that we would want and expect ADF personnel to act responsibly and to act only with reasonable and necessary force. I am sure that view would be shared around the chamber in the unhappy circumstance of a call-out. So the protection that I think is being referred to here—but I suspect that, at the end of the day, Senator Brown, you will have to check it out with the journalist who wrote the story—is the protection that is brought by clarity in the laws and regulations relating to a call-out in this instance.
I would point out that Senator Brown has been most persuasive in indicating to the committee, and to the Senate in the earlier stage of the bill, some of the weaknesses in the current situation. He has quoted at length from some of the manuals and some of the other regulations that apply in this instance. We all have a pretty fair understanding of the inadequacy of the current situation. That is why, Senator Brown, that point has been made. Who made it? I do not know. Whether Mr Martin made it, I do not know. A number of other comments have been made in this wire story report that indicate that Mr Martin has made some statements to AAP in this instance. I suspect that, if they are Mr Martin's words—and time will tell; no doubt, he will let us know—he probably made them because of the sorts of issues that I have raised with you in response to your question and also because of some of the points that you have made about the inadequacy of the current situation. Beyond that, Senator Brown, on this important issue that you have raised in relation to the AAP story, I suspect I cannot give you further assistance.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—The root of the answer to Senator Harradine's question is found in section 119 of the Constitution, which states:
The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence. 
The question of domestic violence is really the basis of this proposed legislation—whereby you would have a call-out only if there were domestic violence or a situation which was totally beyond the control of the state or territory authorities concerned. That is described in clause 51C, which deals with a call-out, or clause 51A, which deals with a situation where Commonwealth interests are threatened. But it is very much an extreme situation, Senator Harradine, through you, Madam Chair. The proposed legislation in no way contemplates any scenario where you might have, say, the Australian defence forces involved in assisting the civilian community in the Katherine floods or where there might be an earthquake or some natural disaster of a similar proportion.
This proposed legislation clearly deals with the ADF potentially having to use force. As Senator Faulkner has indicated on behalf of the opposition, that would only be envisaged in those sorts of extreme circumstances. The government are certainly of a similar view. Nonetheless, we have to cater for these potential situations because, if we do not, it would be irresponsible not to. It would be an unhappy situation if it were to happen, but that does not stop us from catering for a situation of necessity such as is contemplated by this proposed legislation. There is a very distinct difference between the ADF helping in a general sense in a natural disaster and where there is domestic violence, referred to in section 119 of the Constitution. I will say for the record that the government oppose any sunset clause for much the same reasons that Senator Faulkner indicated earlier: the regime we have in place is imperfect, it was recognised by the Senate committee to be so, and the operation of the sunset clause would revert it back to this very imperfect situation. For those reasons, and the fact that we think we now have in place a review situation which is adequate, the government will oppose the sunset clause.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—The real problem, and Senator Harradine has raised this very well, is that there is a vast difference between the defence forces coming to the aid of civilians in the Katherine floods or in an earthquake and calling out the armed services against civilians who are protesting about something. That is the problem. And if we were to eliminate the second potential—
—That is what Labor's amendments are trying to address.
—Labor's amendments have failed to address that. If Labor cared to support the Green amendments, they would fully address that situation. That is the problem. Labor are clearly leaving open the opportunity for a future government to call the troops out against civilians who are protesting about something or who are on strike about something, because the politicians think there is a likelihood of domestic violence. Then you have to bring into play a whole range of laws and regulations which govern the use of the troops against civilians under those circumstances. That is what is at the heart of what is wrong with this legislation.
I have circulated an opinion from Mr Gary Corr, a barrister from Canberra. I want to read it because it covers this situation. It is not long, and I hope the Senate will indulge me in allowing me to do that. One of the things that Senator Faulkner spoke about was protecting the Commonwealth interest. That is not in the Constitution. `Use of troops in civilian circumstances to protect Commonwealth interests' is a very wide, unspecified term. I just want to read this opinion, which is contrary to an unspecified term like that being accepted for legitimate use under the Constitution.
 (Senator Knowles)—Senator Brown, would you like to incorporate the document? The government have indicated that they would support incorporation, if you sought leave to do so. I do not know if Senator Faulkner wishes you to read it.
—I think he should incorporate it.
—As it will expedite proceedings, I seek leave to incorporate a copy of the opinion given by Gary Corr.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows— 
OPINION
I am asked to advise on the Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000. In particular, I am asked to advise as to whether there is any constitutional impediment to this legislation.
Rather than examining the legislation to determine whether there is any constitutional impediment the better course of action is to assess whether there the legislation is supported by any head of power contained within the Constitution.
The obvious starting point is section 119 which provides:
The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion on the application of the Executive Government of the State against domestic violence.
The question is whether this section is an enabling provision or is proscriptive of the use of the Defence forces against civil unrest, or as it is described ""domestic violence"". On one reading of the provision the Commonwealth can only come to the assistance of a State with the concurrence of that State. However, that might not preclude the Commonwealth from acting to protect Commonwealth institutions contained within a State from attack or disruption arising from domestic violence. An obvious example would be the ability of the Commonwealth to protect military bases.
The protection of Commonwealth institutions by the Defence Force might not require acquiescence by the State concerned. The terms of the legislation, however, go further than protection of Commonwealth institutions. The preconditions for the use of the Defence Force are contained in the proposed section 51A and are: 
(a) domestic violence is occurring or likely to occur in Australia; and
(b) if the domestic violence is occurring or likely to occur in a State or self-governing Territory the State or Territory is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence.
""Commonwealth interests"" is not defined. Given the scope of Commonwealth powers and the extension of Commonwealth interests through the funding of what had previously been purely State areas of interest that particular term could be broadly interpreted.
Some possible examples are:
1. the Commonwealth has an interest in the proper conduct of foreign trade. This could be considered to extend to the prevention of violence on the docks interfering with such trade.
2. the Commonwealth funds Universities. The power might be used to prevent destruction of University facilities.
3. the Commonwealth responsibility for external affairs. The power could be used to prevent disruption of meetings of international organizations.
The other obvious power is the Defence power contained in placitum 51(vi). However, there are limitations on the use of this power Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth (1951) 83 CLR 1. It is unlikely that the Defence power could be considered to support the use of the Defence Force to quell domestic violence during a time of peace.
As previously discussed the Commonwealth could have power to protect its own institutions and property arising from either the Executive power (Chapter II), the public service and public places power (section 52) and the incidental power (placitum 51 (xxxix)). These powers would not extend to cover the broad term ""Commonwealth interests"".
It is my opinion that the legislation as currently drafted is not supported by any head of power under the Constitution.
And I so advise.
Gary Corr
Empire Chambers
29 August 2000
—Mr Corr concludes that the legislation as currently drafted is not supported by any head of power under the Constitution. If I can give a layperson's summary, the Commonwealth may be able to bring out the Australian Defence Force to protect installations, but when you get to the Commonwealth interest, which, unspecified, means almost any circumstance in Australian life, the Constitution does not provide for that. Under the heading `Protection of States from invasion and violence,' section 119 of the Constitution says:
The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.
The definition there is narrowed to domestic violence as civil insurrection—that is, tantamount to civil war. 
There have been a number of occasions where state governments have in fact called for the Australian Defence Force to be on alert or brought in, most of them early last century. One of them involved the very fiery issue of conscription in the First World War, when the Tasmanian government of Premier Lee asked the then Labor Prime Minister, Billy Hughes, to have the troops on alert in Launceston for the referendum in November of that year. A bomb had gone off in Beaconsfield. It is not known exactly what transpired, but the troops were not brought out and, as far as we know, were not put on the ready. The same happened on a number of other occasions, because that is the role of the police and that is the role these days of the tactical defence organisations. We know that, where the police are in danger of being outnumbered, they are very capable of bringing in other state police from adjacent states and territories. In fact the Federal Police in the ACT brought in the New South Wales police to assist them during the Springbok tour in the early 1970s, if I have got the time right. There are enormous opportunities for ensuring the peace. We do not have to go to this situation, where this chamber, or at least the big parties, are liable to be supporting legislation that I think is in breach of the Constitution. I do not know how that will be tested further down the line, but I think a matter so gravely important should be tested.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—Senator Brown has raised an issue in relation to the legislation being tested down the road. That is tantamount to shutting the stable door after the stallion has bolted. Senator Faulkner made a comment in responding to Senator Brown, saying that he hoped that the Australian Defence Force would act with responsibility and only use appropriate force. Every senator in this chamber would not only support Senator Faulkner but also like to ensure that that is a reality.
It is not in the best interests of the committee to allow this bill to proceed when there are so many uncertainties. Where do Defence personnel stand if, having been ordered to carry out an action, they then find themselves subsequently, down the road, possibly facing criminal action? I would like to again turn to the Bills Digest that was prepared on this bill. Just prior to the end notes, under `Practicability', it says:
However, the greatest area of concern may be practicability. Even if the lines of authority were clear, there may be questions about the capacity and training of military personnel to perform law and order functions and their capacity to integrate seamlessly into the relevant criminal justice system.
The Bills Digest goes on to say:
Moreover, there may be a tension between discretion and personal liability.
And that is where the problem with this bill lies: between discretion, on the one part—that is, the bill is drafted so widely without being specific—and, in this case, putting these Defence personnel in a position of personal liability. Just the uncertainty of that situation is sufficient for this committee to recommend that the bill not even go ahead. But, even more paramount, if it does go ahead, we have to clarify where the personnel stand. 
I will go back now to the Bills Digest. It continues:
As indicated, there are uncertain limits on the exercise of power by ADF members. If they fail to comply with statutory procedure, they are deemed not to have been entitled to exercise the powers.
So no matter where the power comes from for the Australian Defence Force to carry out the action that they have been ordered to do, if they do not carry it out in the appropriate manner, there are concerns as to whether they were entitled to exercise the power in the first place. The Bills Digest continues:
In effect, their actions are reviewable, although it is unclear whether they would be open to—
one—
judicial review—
two—
internal disciplinary proceedings or criminal proceedings.
So we have an opinion expressed through the Bills Digest where, should a member of the Defence Force find themselves in a compromising situation, the bill may not even indicate where the jurisdiction lies. The Bills Digest goes on further to say:
They may be personally liable for the consequences of their actions as if they were civilians. 
I return to an earlier question period that we went through with the minister in which we were trying to clarify very clearly where these Australian Defence Force personnel would stand. Will they be exposed to judicial review? Will they be exposed to internal disciplinary procedures, or will it be criminal proceedings?
Honourable senators interjecting—
—I take the minister's interjection: `What are we going to do? Sit here for the rest of the week?' That is definitely not contributing to the context of this debate. We are clearly asking the minister for an opinion as to where the Australian Defence Force stand if they are called out and if they are ordered to carry out an action and do so. The questions are: one, what are the instructions they are to follow; and, two, having followed those instructions, under what jurisdiction would they be assessed as to whether they carried out those instructions correctly?

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—I think Senator Harris ought to get an answer to those questions. I just ask the minister, because he did not answer my question: is the operations manual that will come into play with the passage of this legislation available to the chamber so that we can see it while we are discussing the legislation, or is the government going to keep it undercover?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—I keep coming back to trying to establish this point with the government. We are looking at whether or not this bill should proceed, and I think it is reasonable to have an understanding from the government about the level of consultation that has taken place on the bill. That is one of the major problems I have. When we have state governments saying that they have not been consulted on this bill, that is one level of concern—and, I must express, the major concern. But when we have organisations—whose function it will be, primarily, to carry out the role set out in the bill—that have also not been consulted prior to the introduction of the bill, I have additional concerns. So my question to the minister is: was SAC-PAV consulted prior to the government introducing the bill?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—Again I go back to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's review of this bill. Section 1.21 of their report, `Consultation with States and Territories', states:
Questions were raised during the Committee's inquiry about the level of consultation with State and Territory Governments about the Bill. Mr Geoffrey Dabb, Executive Adviser, Attorney-Generals' Department, told the Committee that ""the problems addressed by the bill were discussed, and there were views expressed within SAC-PAV (State and Commonwealth Committee for Cooperation in Protection Against Violence) about the need for legislation.""
So there were views expressed about the need for legislation—there is clearly no doubt about that. Mr Dabb goes on to say:
""You will recall that, when it was raised at the last meeting of SAC-PAV, and the possible imminence of the bill was put to the committee, there was general support.""
Mr Dabb, the report continues:
... emphasised that the Bill itself had not been referred to SAC-PAV or other State or Territory authorities.
So, yes, there may have been consultation with the states and territories in the lead-up to this bill, but I expressly ask the minister whether, once the bill was formulated, the government then went back to the states and territories and to those agencies and consulted with them.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—I understand there was consultation with SAC-PAV, as I indicated previously. The terms of the bill were not put to SAC-PAV at that time, but it has subsequently received from the Commonwealth the bill that is before us.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—I move opposition amendment No. 2, on sheet 1894:
(2)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (lines 27 and 28), omit the definition of domestic violence, substitute:
domestic violence, in addition to the meaning given by section 119 of the Constitution, means significant armed violence.
This amendment is to give definition to the term `domestic violence'. As you will know, Madam Chairman, the bill refers to domestic violence as having the same meaning as in section 119 of the Constitution. Section 119 of the Constitution says:
The Commonwealth shall protect every State ... against domestic violence.
But it does not define it; this is a means of defining it. The definition under the Greens amendment would be that domestic violence means, in addition to the meaning given in section 119 of the Constitution, `significant armed violence'.
I have moved this amendment because this bill, as we all know, effectively says that three ministers in the government shall be able to call out the Army if they think it is likely that there is to be domestic violence. Neither `likely' nor `domestic violence' are defined. They are keywords. They should be defined. If the legislation is to avoid the pitfall of having at its core keywords that are undefined, then we have got to fix it up. This amendment is minimal, but it is absolutely crucial to ensure that politicians in Canberra do not send troops into a situation where there is not a significant risk of armed violence. I commend this amendment to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,0,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—I would like to speak in support of Senator Brown's amendment relating to the definition of `domestic violence' and, in doing so, raise the issue of the intent of legislation. Ideally, bills that are being put through a chamber should be specific and the wording should bring clarity. The reason for that goes back to the separation of powers under the Constitution which sets out that there will be a parliament, an executive government and a judiciary. That separation of powers provision is there for very precise reasons. For that separation of powers to be able to operate, we require clarity in legislation, because it is the responsibility of this chamber and of the other house to give direction by way of acts of parliament. 
If we go to one of the earliest acts in existence—that is, the Acts Interpretation Act 1901—that act speaks very clearly in relation to ambiguity. In doing so, it brings into reality a situation that the judiciary will have to face as a result of the government bringing this legislation through, because I believe it certainly does not deliver clarity. In fact, I believe it is ambiguous to a large extent. While the Australian Defence Force will be required to operate under this legislation, we are also looking at passing a bill that will have the same effect, to a degree, on the judiciary. How is the judiciary going to administer this bill once it is proclaimed as an act?  
As I said earlier, the responsibility of the parliament is to produce acts that have clarity and direction. This act will cause situations for the judiciary because they are the ones who will have to sort out the mess in this bill that we are looking very much like passing eventually. The Acts Interpretation Act goes further and says that, where there are instances of ambiguity, the judiciary can take into account the debates within this chamber. Therein lies the basis for a considerable number of the questions that I put to the minister. They were put there so that, if we get into the unfortunate situation where Australian Defence personnel are brought before the judiciary in the Commonwealth, at least there will be some clarity and some direction for the judiciary in carrying out their duties. 
What is domestic violence? Is domestic violence something as simple as a husband and wife or, for that matter, any couple having an argument? Is domestic violence people who have assembled in an area with a common belief that happens to be opposed to the particular position of the government of the day? Is it somebody who picks up a stick on the side of the road? I believe not. I believe that our understanding of domestic violence is one that pertains between citizens of a country. 
As Senator Brown has articulated so well previously, this bill crosses two boundaries: it crosses the boundaries between domestic violence and acts of terrorism or threat to either state or Commonwealth property. Therefore, it is incumbent on this chamber to clarify very clearly what the government's intent on domestic violence is. I do not think that the government has in any way defined clearly what domestic violence is and I do not believe that it has clearly identified what a Commonwealth interest is. The two are intrinsically linked, because the bill clearly sets out that the Governor-General can, without a request from the state, call out the Australian Defence Force to protect Commonwealth property. The wording the government has chosen to use is `domestic violence'. The Governor-General will be faced with the same problem that ultimately the judiciary will find itself in, in that the Governor-General will have to make a decision on these terms. The responsibility on the Governor-General will be enormous because it will depend on his decision as to whether the Australian Defence Force is called out. I believe that that is inappropriate and that the government should reconsider the definitions in this bill. (Time expired)

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—I want to clarify a statement I made on 31 August in an answer to a question from Senator Lundy. I said:
The projected savings for contracts, with cluster 3 and group 8, are in the region of $265 million ...
In fact, the projected savings from the five contracts to date—beginning with cluster 3 and including the last contract to date, group 8—are in the region of $268 million. It should be noted that these savings are in addition to the projected savings of around $100 million over five years resulting from the outsourcing contracts let by the Department of Finance and Administration, the Australian Customs Service and the Department of Veterans' Affairs.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Information Technology: Outsourcing</title>,Questions Without Notice,4,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Special Minister of State (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to the theft of computer equipment from Commonwealth departments.
The quantum of theft and loss of computer equipment across the Commonwealth government is quite staggering. I think the Senate ought to take note today of the significance of this issue. In 18 months, $1,103,000 of mostly top-of-the-range equipment has been stolen or lost—that is, $835,887 worth of laptop computers and $276,508 worth of desktop computers and accessories lost or stolen. We have had answers to questions about thefts of computers from a range of departments, but answers from Environment, Foreign Affairs, and Prime Minister and Cabinet are still outstanding. They are 40 days overdue. Trade has already fessed up to seven stolen laptops worth $40,612, but the Foreign Affairs side of the operation has been suspiciously tardy on this issue.
Of the 10 departments and their agencies that have so far replied, the most concerning issue raised in answers to questions on notice is the question of security. The Department of Defence admit to 274 computers lost or stolen. They are unsure whether the 49 computers and laptops in the `lost' category were in fact not lost but stolen—and that is a farce, frankly, in itself. But worst still, 13 laptops had restricted or classified information on them, three laptops had commercial-in-confidence information on them and two desktop computers had restricted information on them. You have to say that this is a disgraceful situation. I think the government must provide assurances to the parliament, particularly in the run-up to the Olympics, that they have this situation under control—that no classified information and no national security planning information has got into the wrong hands. The answers that have been given by the Department of Defence are quite unsatisfactory. They are very, very windy answers indeed; they are very unclear. The sort of answer you get is that the material was `thought to have been classified'. These are weasel words and slipshod answers and they are unsatisfactory in this serious situation.
I think the Senate is entitled in these circumstances to at least an outline of the nature of the material that was on these computers—perhaps not the content but certainly the nature of the material. I want to know more about the investigation of these thefts as well. I note that only 87 of the 274 instances of theft in the defence department alone were properly investigated by police. I note a report in yesterday's Sunday Telegraph that there have been `hardly any breaches of Defence computer security by hackers'. Of course that is an equally slipshod situation—`hardly any' means there have been some. What where they, and have they been properly investigated? If Defence spend $8 million to protect their systems against hackers, they obviously have lost the plot on the theft of secrets on hard disks when laptops are stolen. This is a serious situation. The Senate is entitled to answers about this, particularly in the current climate with the sort of legislation this chamber is now discussing. I ask the government to come clean on these serious issues of the theft of computer equipment and the material, some of it restricted, contained on that equipment.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-09-04,"—We had here today one of the most incredible question times that I have witnessed in my time in this place. Senator Faulkner, I think, shortly after moving into opposition, became the chairman of the waste watch committee. I am not sure whether he still holds that title—he has lost most of the others he has held in his career; he loses portfolios like other people around this place lose hair. But putting Senator Faulkner in charge of waste watch, as we witnessed this quite puerile and pathetic effort he made in the Senate today about some stolen laptops—which, of course, the department will be investigating as a matter of course; I do not think they need any assistance from this failed former Keating government minister—and as we hear him talking about security, makes one think that it is sort of analogous to putting Sergeant Schultz in charge of a review of security at stalag 13. 
—You are aware that it is unparliamentary to reflect upon another member, so I would just urge caution, Senator Campbell.
—I will of course heed that warning, Madam Deputy President. But it really is a bit of a joke to have someone who, while in government, spent so freely, spent with both hands—not only spent taxpayers' dollars but went back for more to borrow money—and who contributed significantly to running up a $10 billion deficit being put in charge of waste watch. You do not see any serious work out of the waste watch committee because it is against the principles of people like Senator Faulkner not to spend money hand over fist, particularly when it is taxpayers' money—particularly when they were in power.
What did we have under Labor? Senator Faulkner was a minister in the previous Labor government, and that government was in power for 13 long, dismal, dreary years. And what did we have, Madam Deputy President? You would recall better than most. We had 13 budgets, nine deficits, and the average of those deficits was $10 billion in 1999 constant dollars—$10 billion a year for nine years. That is why we had massive interest rates, that is why we had massive tax increases. We heard Labor asking questions about petrol today. What did they do with petrol excise? They put it up by 7½c a litre. If Senator Peter Cook wants us to go out to Balladonia to the Balladonia Roadhouse—that fine institution on the Nullarbor Plain; I urge people to visit it—what should we tell the proprietors of the roadhouses at Balladonia and across the Nullarbor? We should say that Senator Peter Cook, Senator Faulkner and all those other failed ministers along that dismal, dreary frontbench put the excise up by 7½ per cent. Have they repented or apologised for putting interest rates up to over 30 per cent for many of those businesses out there on the Nullarbor Plain? Of course not.
—This is on computer theft!
—The Manager of Opposition Business says this is about computer theft. I ask the Manager of Opposition Business opposite to reflect on the motion that we are considering; we are to consider the answers given to all the questions to Senator Ellison today. And that takes me to Senator Lundy. Here we have another Labor senator who gets up and asks Senator Ellison—
—Senator, my understanding is that it was in relation only to the question relating to computer theft.
—Fine, I will restrict my remarks to that. It brings into question, in this broad-ranging debate about waste in government that Senator Faulkner alludes to in his question and his own comments, the fact that we had Labor members opposite asking questions in question time today about property, for example, and the leasing out of—
—What has this got to do with computer theft?
—We are talking about Senator Faulkner's question. If we now want to interpret how you take note of answers in a narrow fashion, then we will do that if it is a new ruling. Are you taking a point of order?
—Madam Deputy President, I raise a point of order. This matter before the chair is on the issue of taking note of the questions put to Senator Ellison on computer theft and the loss of quite significant security documentation contained in those computers. I would suggest that it is appropriate that government speakers, like opposition speakers, confine themselves to the issue relevant to that question.
—There is a fair degree of latitude allowed in the taking note of answers debate. However, it is appropriate to endeavour to relate your comments in some way to the answers given to the question that was asked.
—All of this suggests you have nothing to say. 
—Order, Senator Carr!
—Madam Deputy President, on the point of order, Senator Faulkner, as I heard it—I am happy to be corrected by you on advice—moved to take note of questions put to Senator Ellison. If he put an epithet on that that was linked to one question then I do stand corrected and will relate my comments purely—
—It did relate, I am advised, to one question only.
—I am not arguing the point now. I will now address my remarks to the motion, which referred to the questions put to Senator Ellison. If it was actually a question put to Senator Ellison, then that is a point. But, when it comes to waste watch issues, the government does not need to be reminded by a Labor Party which ran this country into deficit and which wasted billions upon billions of dollars of taxpayers' money year after year when it comes to waste watch issues. This is what Senator Faulkner seeks to do. It is an outrageous act of hypocrisy by the Labor Party to seek to paint this government as having any question to answer in relation to the loss of these laptops that Senator Faulkner refers to. Any loss of Commonwealth property is a very important issue. It is being dealt with, as the minister quite properly answered, through the proper processes. For Senator Faulkner to seek to make cheap political mileage on an issue of security is one of the lowest acts I have seen in this place.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I think that this is a very important issue indeed, because if one looks at the questions that were put on notice by Senator Faulkner to the various departments and the answers that have been received back, one will see the magnitude of the problem that is before us. This is particularly the case if you look at the stolen laptop issue. You will find—on the summary that I have—that two departments are quite outstanding in terms of the number of laptops that have either been lost or stolen. I refer to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, who say that they have lost 12 laptops and 51 have been stolen, and the Department of Defence, who say that 54 have been lost and 73 have been stolen. But out of that number that have been lost or stolen there has been a very poor recovery rate indeed. I think it is a poor day when we cannot stand up in this parliament and discuss an issue of such significance as this, because it goes to two issues: it goes to the issue of waste and it goes to the issue of security. 
If you look at the recovery rate of laptops in Defence, four out of 127 have been recovered. That is a substantial loss indeed. In the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, the recovery rate for laptops is six out of 63. So the recovery rate is very low indeed. Not only are we talking about valuable items in terms of their individual price but also in the case of Defence, as was rightly pointed out, we are talking about items which in some instances have quite sensitive material placed on them. If this were confined to laptops alone, it would be one thing, but it goes across the questions today to the whole issue of stolen computer equipment. Whilst in answering the broader question of stolen computer equipment Defence did not break the issue up into component pieces such as whether they were monitor-speakers, power packs or whatever else they might have been, in computer equipment stolen or lost, which accounted for about 145 items, again the recovery in Defence is relatively low - some 16 items. So again we know that in that area we are looking at—as Senator Faulkner rightly pointed out—13 instances where the information is thought to have been classified. Of these instances, 10 are suspected to be restricted and three commercial-in-confidence.
It raises genuine security issues that need to be properly pursued in this particular place. If there are breaches of security as a result of the new technology that we are using today, the information technology that is accessible to so many people, we need to be reassured that that technology is being guarded, particularly when it has such sensitive material as one can only assume from the answers that were supplied to Senator Faulkner. I think Senator Faulkner made the point quite correctly that it is not a matter of getting the actual information that might have been contained but getting the assurances that the information was not of national security importance or was not of a top classified nature. 
One fear that one always has today is that, with laptops being carted from place to place, they become a target for any person who wants to indulge in the theft of such an item, some hoping to take it for their own personal use, while others may be taking it for more sinister reasons. No-one is arguing that here today. One is raising the sheer question in this place today: what about the issue of security? What about the issue of waste? Clearly, coming out of Senator Faulkner's questions on notice to the various departments—and, as he said, some have not answered the questions yet so we do not know the extent of the problem—we do know, at least in the case of Defence and Industry, Science and Resources, that there has been a major problem since 1 January 1999 of stolen laptops and stolen computer resources. I think it is quite fair and reasonable to ask the government to give the assurances that need to be made.

"Mason, Senator Brett",LP,2000-09-04,"—I rise to acknowledge something important that Senator Faulkner has mentioned, as I am Chairman of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. Senator Faulkner has raised this issue on a number of occasions as well as Senator Ray and Senator Conroy. It is certainly an important issue that the government will have to pursue.
Senator Hogg mentioned the Department of Defence. Just to give a bit of background, in Defence a total number of 143 desktop computers have been reported lost or stolen from the period 1 January 1999 to 30 June 2000, and that actually represents less than 0.3 per cent of the approximately 55,000 desktops used by the some 66,700 largely full-time personnel and some 20,000 reservists across the Department of Defence. So it is less than 0.3 per cent. The total number of 129 laptops reported lost or stolen in this same period represents around 1.8 per cent of the approximately 7,000 used across the Department of Defence and, of course, it is departmental policy to investigate all losses and thefts.
What is the government as a whole doing about it? They were Senator Hogg and Senator Faulkner's questions. They are quite right: DOFA is responsible for developing that policy. DOFA has whole of government responsibility for fraud control but is limited to its role under the Financial Management and Accountability Act and associated financial management and accountability orders. Under that act, agency heads are responsible for the implementation of a fraud control plan which meets Commonwealth standards and are responsible for reporting to the portfolio minister on fraud control within their agency. The financial management and accountability orders 1997 further require agencies to prepare a report giving recognition to the guidelines outlined by the minister for justice, which include important things such as an assessment of fraud risks, an assessment of any previous fraud control plan and a fraud control plan based on the assessment of fraud risks.
Recently, the Australian National Audit Office completed a report into Commonwealth fraud and concluded that the majority of APS agencies had a framework in place that contained key elements for effectively preventing and dealing with fraud in line with Commonwealth policy. The extent of these arrangements range from the majority of agencies having undertaken fraud awareness raising activities amongst staff to a lesser proportion having specific fraud policies and fraud control plans in place and having undertaken risk assessments. This clearly indicates that the majority of Commonwealth agencies take their responsibilities for fraud control very seriously. However, in a number of areas, the Audit Office concluded that a significant proportion of agencies did not have appropriate fraud control arrangements in place, and the particular issue the survey results highlighted was the fact that many agencies had not undertaken a recent risk assessment to identify the existing risks and those emerging as a result of the changing environment in methods of service delivery.
That is the context of computers. But there is broader context than this, and that might be welfare fraud. Fraud is part of it.

—This Senate might reflect on the fact that this government has saved the Australian taxpayer a fortune, and all the way along the road the Australian Labor Party have opposed the Commonwealth's action with respect to fraud control. Why do they do that? Why do they protect rorters? As a social democratic party that used to have beliefs they believe that people should—
—You can do better than this. 
—Order! Senator Carr, would you please cease interjecting. 
—They should as a social democratic party believe this: those entitled to welfare should be given their welfare, those that are not should not. Why? It takes away money and entitlements from people that are not entitled to it. Everyone in your party, Senator Carr, should be in favour of the Commonwealth's line on fraud control. This issue is going to have to be addressed, and you are quite right to raise it in this house.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I really should be grateful to Senator Mason for making the point that we tried to make through question time today—that is, that the Department of Finance and Administration is responsible for financial management and accountability issues in the Commonwealth government. It is very clear from the responses to questions on notice that the department of finance has failed to cause the various agencies and departments of the Commonwealth government to take care with respect to accountability and fraud control—in this case, with a direct reference to the number of stolen laptops and computing equipment within agencies and departments. The issue of accountability is very dear to my heart, given comments made previously in this place in relation to the IT outsourcing program—which I will return to in a minute—but also in relation to general conduct and issues of commercial-in-confidence. We continually see the coalition government allowing agencies and departments to hide behind commercial-in-confidence as they outsource, contract out and continually divest themselves of doing the business of a public administration.
This is a very serious point, and it is quite astounding to see figures like this in a year when the opposition have continually drawn attention to the way the coalition government manage information technology. If you look through the list of departments and agencies, you will notice that a number of them have been outsourced to contractors over a period of time, including the Department of Finance and Administration itself, the Australian Electoral Commission, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Australian Customs Service and so on. All of these departments have registered some stolen equipment of one nature or another.
It astounded me to hear Senator Mason stand up and say in Defence's defence that it represents less than 0.3 per cent. I have no idea of the accuracy of these figures, but how pitiful is it when you hear a coalition senator stand up and defend some perpetration such as laptops or computer equipment being stolen on the basis that it represents only a minor percentage. I do not think we would get away with any such argument. I suspect if you actually draw out the same percentages in relation to the Department of Industry, Science and Resources—where no fewer than 51 laptops were stolen and 12 were lost and 22 PCs were stolen and one was lost—those percentages would look far worse than the flippant ones Senator Mason has been able to dredge up for the purposes of his contribution in this debate. I think an analysis of this demonstrates that over the last four years those questions of financial management and accountability, including how one manages the assets theoretically in the control of the departments and agencies, really do reflect badly not only on the respective ministers in those agencies and departments but certainly, as I pointed out before, on the Minister for Finance and Administration.
The final point I want to make is: what happens next? Do we continue to see a decline in this public accountability of the coalition government that we have experienced for the last four years? Or are they at the point of such a high level of arrogance that the government will just stand up and do what they did today—which was that, first of all, Senator Campbell tried to skirt the question and raise other issues in his response to our motion to take note of answers on the issue of stolen computers from government departments, and then there were a whole series of equivocations from the other senators responding to this motion— as we attempt to draw this to the attention of the public? 
In closing, I would like to make these points. It is a demonstration of democracy that we were able to get this information through putting questions on notice. It is the responsibility of the government, the coalition in power, to not only draw some degree of acknowledgment of this disturbing theft of computer equipment but also reflect in the broader context on what happens when you lose strategic control of information technology, which as most senators will acknowledge is the core business of a Public Service seeking to effect services on behalf of the citizens of Australia.

The statement read as follows—
This report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade - Building Australia's Trade and Investment Relationship with South America - is a report that is eagerly awaited by the countries of South America, Australian business chambers and businesses themselves.
There is little doubt that South America is dynamic and developing, leading to a multitude of business opportunities.  This was reinforced when members of the Committee's Trade Sub-Committee visited eight South American countries in March-April this year.  Members came away with the clear view that Australian business is really well placed to move into the market and capture market share.
One's perceptions of South America being a place that would not be attractive to Australian business are dispelled when this report is read.  There are powerful reasons for the market to be looked at seriously by Australian exporting firms.  With South America emerging as a region of considerable economic significance there is great scope for Australian companies to do business there.
The first focus on South America as a region of considerable potential for Australia was back in 1992.  While Australia's trade and investment relationship has grown with South America, it has not been a high priority. Through the Government's annual Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statements, there is now a focus on Chile, the Mercosur countries and Peru as important emerging markets for Australia.  The direct air links with South America, established nearly two years ago, provide both the means and the catalyst for developing and improving business links.
Time is of the essence!  Australia's competitors, including New Zealand, are well and truly in the market.  If Australia is serious about increasing its trade and investment relationship with South America then it must go beyond the promotional rhetoric and take positive action as its competitors are doing in the region.
The Committee's recommendations are focused towards putting legs under the relationship with the ultimate aim to improve Australia's export performance.  
The CER-Mercosur dialogue, the central mechanism for progressing Australia's trade and economic relationship with Mercosur must be reinvigorated.  It is necessary for the Australian Government to pursue, as a priority, the development of an Australia-Mercosur free trade agreement to allow Australia to tap into the Mercosur common market of some 215 million people.  Australia's competitors are reaping the benefits of such trade agreements with Australia losing any competitive edge.  Australia has to be in it to win it and energise trade initiatives and trade activities.
Australia has a critical link that is of significant value to South American countries - it is our Asia link.  Australia, as a bridge to Asia, is a concept that is big enough for the Government to take seriously as an initiative and the Committee recommends that a strategy be developed to establish Australia as a bridge to Asia for the economies of South America.
The Committee, as did the Trade Sub-Committee on its visit to South America, found that awareness or more correctly a lack of awareness is the single biggest issue impacting on the relationship.  In Australia there is little awareness of South America, including the nature and the size of the markets there, the scope of the opportunities, the complementarities with Australia and the move by the South American countries to be more competitive in the global economy.
To raise awareness and provide a long term focus on South America the Committee sees it is as vital for the Australian Government to establish a body that has the capacity to deliver initiatives and build the relationship.  The Committee recommends that an Australia-South America Foundation be established to initiate and support activities that promote substantial and enduring collaboration between Australia and the countries of South America, and serve Australia's long term interests in the region.
The Committee found it an anomaly that within the Foreign Affairs and Trade department South America and Canada are put together. The size and dynamism of South America warrant that it has its own focus and priority and that Canada is moved and made part of North America. 
In all, the Committee made thirty recommendations to build Australia's trade and investment relationship with South America.  Other initiatives include the formation of a South American Working Group; high level visits to the region; additional resources for our mission in Caracas; an exchange program for young executives; the development of a program to capture the expertise and skills of Australia's retired workforce; an increase in the Australian Tourist Commission's effort; double taxation agreements with more South American countries; Australian membership of the Inter-American Development Bank; and the provision of a budget allocation by AusAID for development projects in South America in cooperation with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Madam President, it is important that there be a significant focus at government level on the South American region as this will encourage people to go to South America and trade in South America.  This strategy has proved to be very successful in relation to Asia and the same commitment is required for Australia to reap the rewards in the markets of South America.
I commend the Report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,13,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-09-04,"—In speaking to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report entitled Building Australia's Trade and Investment Relationship with South America, let me say that, having been part of the committee process to take evidence here in Australia and also having been one of a group of senators who took it upon themselves to arrange to travel to South America and visit a number of countries—together and in two groups, if I can put it that way—it is very pleasing to see the product of the work that has been done being presented so well by the committee secretariat. I thank Ms Jane Vincent, who has done so much organisation of the work of the committee: its hearings, our visit to South America and, of course, the preparation of the report and all her work performed on the document itself. I commend the report to honourable senators as a very worthwhile text which sets out contemporaneous material about the trade and investment opportunities which do in fact exist between this country and the various countries of South America.
One of the other things I should say is that, on the visit by members of the committee to South America, we were accompanied by an officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Ms Sharyn Minehan—or I should say Her Excellency, because she has become the Ambassador to Argentina since that time. I express the committee's gratitude to the department and to Her Excellency for the assistance that she provided to the committee, which made the work of the committee as productive as it was, and particularly for her knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese, which assisted us so much in South America.
Appendix D to the report sets out on pages 233 to 258 the itinerary of the South American visit—quite an extensive itinerary. One can see that we spent a great deal of time in meetings, talking to government and business representatives, both Australian and Argentinian business people, assessing the opportunities for investment and trade in both directions. One of the things that the committee did discover is that there is an unfortunate lack of awareness, both here in Australia and in South America, of the trade and investment opportunities across the Pacific Ocean. As we look to our north, to Asia, for all of our opportunities and to Europe and the North Americas, it is likewise with the South Americans looking to the United States and the European Union, with neither of us looking at opportunities for investment and trade that do exist—opportunities that the committee believes will be welcomed between the businesses of this country and the businesses of South America.
In relation to the environment in which we trade, it is important to note that there are opportunities which need to be freed up by the action of the government—and several of those are recommended by the committee. This is obviously a bipartisan report—which, I think, lends it great weight. One of the things the committee is at pains to draw the attention of the government to is the need to negotiate further with countries of South America, particularly on double taxation agreements, which are serious impediments to business dealings. In terms of particular countries, the absence of the negotiation of double tax agreements will see existing trade dry up because of our lack of competitiveness arising from that circumstance with countries like Canada. 
Having mentioned Canada, I should say that the Canadians are quite proactive in developing their trade links with South America. Tables in the report show honourable senators the sorts of investments that the Canadians—and, indeed, those in other countries—have made in seeking to access the markets of South America. Canada, being a country of similar economic capacity to Australia, outdoes us significantly in terms of exploring the opportunities for business. That is a matter which obviously lies in the hands of the government to address.
There are significant criticisms in this report, particularly of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, which I think should attract the attention of the government as quickly as possible. My colleague Senator Carr has an interest in education, and here there are opportunities for bona fide students to access our great educational system. However, the barriers placed in the way of those students from South America who are seeking to access our educational facilities are enormous when compared with the lack of barriers that exists if those same students seek, as an alternative, to access the United States or Canada for similar educational opportunities.
The fact of the matter is that, in an educational sense, we have a lot to offer South America. Unfortunately, when it costs some students up to $US500 to have Australian visa applications processed compared with the negligible amounts it costs to have United States or Canadian visa applications processed, that is a trade barrier of our own making. The criticisms of the department do not simply go to the issue of the cost to students but go to the way in which the department approached the inquiry—and I commend to senators the passage of the report which deals with that. They are some of the most strident criticisms of a department that I have seen in a report, particularly a report which is bipartisan, as I stressed earlier. That is, the terms of this report in criticising the department are signed up to by both the government and the opposition members of the committee.
Having said that, I think this is a report which I will take some pride in distributing to members of the business community and others in my state—and I hope that other senators, whether they were involved or not, take the same opportunity. It is important that we do play a part in extending the awareness that is lacking at the moment—the awareness of trade and investment opportunities—because we are talking about a continent with in excess of 300 million people, a great many of whom would be prepared to buy our goods and trade with us if they knew the opportunity existed. Indeed, that is the position for Australians as well. I commend the report to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee: Joint</title>",Committees,13,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I too rise to speak to this report, entitled Building Australia's Trade and Investment Relationship with South America. As Senator O'Brien has said, this is a significant report. It is a report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and I am a member of that committee. I did not participate in the hearing of evidence and the writing of this report but, as a member of the committee, I do want to congratulate those who did. Senator O'Brien has named the particular staff member concerned. I join my remarks with his in acknowledging the fine work that she has done in connection with this report.
With those remarks, perhaps I can just say a couple of words about the subject. For historic reasons, the biggest ocean in the world, the Pacific Ocean, at its widest point has for so long separated South America from Australia. As well as that tangible separation by one of the world's most outstanding geographical features, there has been a cultural separation as well. Those on the South American continent speak Portuguese or Spanish, and we speak English. It is part of the non-English speaking world, and our news and information of what is happening in that area of the world containing 300 million people is sparse indeed. It is conveyed by caricature more often than understanding. Indeed, the historical link is quite significant. Many of the earlier explorers who made their way around Cape Horn called at Rio de Janeiro and other ports along the South American coast before moving into the Pacific. Indeed, that is where Captain Cook had his vessel the Endeavour careened before it moved into the Pacific and he discovered the east coast of Australia. 
But in modern times we have been separated by the LOTE, the Pacific and the cultural differences between our two countries. This report removes the mists of that separation. It is not the first step to do so that has been taken. I think a significant advance was when the airlines in Australia, together with the Latin American airlines, opened, at first, a regular weekly service to Buenos Aires—a service which has now grown to be a daily service with increasing demand. Our two peoples are being brought together by the speed of air travel and the frequency of the interchange. As well, Australian businesspeople have been travelling to Latin America and finding worthwhile investments. This report follows in their wake in an effort to try to comprehensively assess the likely opportunities in that market and commend those opportunities to Australian businesses.
Before going into any detail about that, I would like to acknowledge and congratulate the ambassadors from the Latin American countries. In the diplomatic corps in Canberra, they form quite an enthusiastic and cooperative group. They are very energetic in promoting the interests of their region, and they have been a catalyst in stimulating the activities of this committee to at last give in and examine the virtues of and the opportunities offered by their countries, which they kept rightly and in reasonable tones preaching to us about. The Latin American ambassadors need to be acknowledged.
Australia's diplomatic ties with South America became stronger with the launch of the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations in 1984 and with the formation of the Cairns Group at the same time. The Cairns Group is a group of countries which negotiate jointly, of which Australia is the chair. They are all agricultural exporting nations. In the main, the Cairns Group consists of Australia, New Zealand and Canada, all of the ASEAN countries and just about all of the Latin American countries. I think the fact that we work as a unit, as a group of nations, provides substantial countervailing influence in world trade negotiations so that, as well as the super-economies—the economies of the United States, Japan and Europe—we have a union of smaller economies able to unite around the common goal of liberalising agricultural trade and opening market opportunities for all of us as exporters. Without the presence of the Cairns Group, our ability to negotiate just outcomes in international trade would be considerably less but, because we have worked together on the diplomatic front, arguing real issues and cooperating with each other, we have found a way at that level of being drawn closer together by a common cause that affects the livelihoods of people in all of our countries. That too has served to break down some of the barriers between the South American nations and Australia. The Cairns Group has been quite important.
Just a month or so ago, a retired trade minister from Argentina visited Australia in order to have informal discussions with the government, with me as the shadow spokesman on trade and, I am sure, with Australian industry. The informal discussions were about whether it is possible to create a trade treaty involving South America, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, the major economies of the Southern Hemisphere, in such a way that, by cooperating together, we can grow all of our economies mutually. It is at this stage an embryonic idea. It is an ambitious idea. It is an idea worth following through. I believe the government gave the former minister a warm and positive reception, as did I.
The significance of trade in South America cannot be underestimated. I cast my mind back to the 1960s, when there was a high level of antipathy between the major countries of Argentina and Brazil and it was suspected that this traditional rivalry had taken the form of an underground nuclear arms race in which large portions of the national budgets of both those countries were being invested in the development of nuclear weapons. It is significant to note that, when that underground arms race reached a critical point and both of those countries renounced their bids to obtain nuclear weapons status, they embraced each other in a common trade agreement, which is now the Mercosur agreement, and began to unite their economies and advantage each other with the mutual growth and bigger market that a trade zone creates. If there is an object lesson in the world about trading with people rather than finding a basis for conflict with people, it is the example of what has occurred between Argentina and Brazil. We now have not only a peaceful border but also a cooperative economic relationship, which brings people in those countries together and which means that market opportunity in one nation creates jobs in the other nation. It is an example that could be commended to border conflicts in other parts of the world, such as that of Pakistan and India. 
There are different levels of economic development in Latin America and different levels, therefore, of opportunity. For Latin American companies, there are opportunities as well in developing trade links with Australia. As many Latin American economies come out of Third World status and are now better classified by the IMF and other international institutions as economies in transition—moving to First World status or emerging economies moving up the economic ladder—their growth rates present greater opportunities for growth in Australian industry. There is a compatibility between our economy and theirs. It serves to make this fundamental point about trade, particularly trade with developing countries: the more we contribute to their economic growth, the more people are lifted out of poverty or straitened economic circumstances and the bigger the market for our exports. It is an object lesson in improving the lot of humanity as well as economic circumstances. I think this report will play a significant role in broadening the horizons of Australian industry, awakening them to the opportunities in South America and setting in place a series of constructive steps to ensure ongoing application and success on both sides of the Pacific. This report will also be a bit of an object lesson to other parts of the world where, if studied in the same detail with the same diplomatic backup, they could create the same results. (Time expired)

That the constitutional validity of the Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities ) Bill 2000 be referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 11 October.
This is a very serious matter. This legislation has not been referred to this committee. It has been referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee and, in my scanning of that, the matter of constitutional validity was not canvassed. It certainly was not canvassed in any depth. I have acquainted the Senate with legal advice that has put a very big question mark indeed over the constitutional validity of this defence legislation. I am of the understanding that the government and opposition will not support this motion, and I ask them to reconsider. I think this is a very grave matter. The time has gone for me to be able to get a committee to look at the constitutional validity of this bill, which gives the Commonwealth the ability to call out the armed forces against Australian civilians before the bill goes through the Senate, which it appears destined to do some time today or tomorrow. But the matter of its validity remains.
I put to the Senate that we should not allow this to move on with a question mark hanging over its head. I contend that this legislation is in defiance of the Constitution. I contend that this legislation is not within propriety when it comes to the Constitution or a proper reading of the Constitution, and I have the legal advice from barrister Gary Corr to back that up. I incorporated that advice into Hansard during this morning's debate, and I have had nobody come back and say this is invalid. If the government has advice to the contrary, let us see it. But then we are left with a position of dispute as to the constitutional validity of this epoch-making legislation. We should be ensuring that the proper Senate committee looks at the legislation, gets a determination as to whether or not it is constitutionally valid and then reports back to the Senate.
I put this to the Senate: what if my advice is correct? What if we have—here in this legislation for the call out of the Army at the behest of Commonwealth politicians in the future—legislation which goes outside the bounds of the Constitution, whether you are looking at section 51 or at section 119? If we do not discover that now, we leave it to some future time when our inheritors, as elected representatives of parliament, do call out the armed services to discover that they have acted unconstitutionally and that this parliament now has acted unconstitutionally—in a situation which is almost beyond imagination, where Australian troops have fired upon Australian civilians for the first time in our nation's history. 
I judge this matter, as I said, as most grave. The government and the opposition may say, `Your advice is wrong.' They have not said that, but they may do so in the course of this debate. Even then, surely propriety says, prudence says, that we should have the matter looked at, and we should send it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, as in my motion, to report back in October as to whether this advice is wrong or right. With any luck—and, I believe, just fair sailing—nothing untoward will have happened in the meantime, and we will be able to put it to right, if Mr Corr's advice is correct.
But to leave this matter hang in the face of that advice is not a proper way for us as a Senate to proceed. We should not be doing it. We should be remembering that it is not Mr Corr that stands alone in this matter, that these misgivings about the constitutionality of this legislation were flagged to the previous Senate inquiry by the New South Wales government and the Victorian government, and the matter has not been clarified. We have here not just the opportunity but an obligation to clarify the matter, an obligation because we want to ensure that as a parliament we do stay within the Constitution. We want to ensure, moreover, that we do not find ourselves opening the way to some future unconstitutional act through legislation which is not valid.
I do not bring this matter lightly before the Senate. For the third time I say that this is an extremely serious matter. I cannot understand, if that is the case, why the opposition does not support this motion, does not block the bill, cannot block the bill. But it does say that there is a doubt about constitutional matters in the bill. Let us, as responsible senators, put that doubt to the test, absolve ourselves of that doubt when next we come back into this place after the Olympics and the Paralympics.
I do not have anything more to say on this. The case is very clear. I believe it is an unquestionable case of acting with propriety about the way in which we honour and remain true to the Constitution in passing legislation which at its heart is very much about that historic balance between state and Commonwealth powers that the Constitution itself is the arbiter of. I ask both the government and the opposition to consider this matter with utmost care. I ask them to support this motion. I ask: what harm can be done in supporting this motion? And I point out that potentially grave harm can be done by not supporting it and choosing instead the course of studied ignorance.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) LEGISLATION</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,15,1
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-04,"—The Democrats will be supporting Senator Brown's motion. I must say I agree with pretty well everything he has just said. The last committee that looked at this bill did not specifically look at its constitutionality, so they could not find whether or not it was constitutional. It would be a great pity if we were to find, once action had been taken specifically under the amendments brought in by this bill, that the bill itself was unconstitutional. No harm can be done by looking at this; no harm can be done by determining whether or not this bill is constitutional. Even if it passes today or tomorrow, there is still no harm in a committee looking at this. In fact it would then probably be more to the point and more urgent that a committee look at whether or not this is constitutional. We will certainly be supporting that.
We lost today the idea of a sunset clause in the bill. We were told that, if the sunset clause were agreed to, we would be back to 1903—that is, we would be back to where we are now. We were there in 1903 and we have been there ever since—we are still there now. So we do not see a problem with us being in the same situation in which we were in 1903. Despite that, I checked with the library and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and nobody in either of those places could remember a time when a bill which had had a sunset clause in it had reverted to the original. Every government always brings up a bill to replace the bill that has the sunset clause in it, and they bring it up in time for there to be something else in place. It was a real pity that amendment did not go through earlier. Despite that, we think the bill probably will go through in the next day or so. But it is almost essential that we look at its constitutionality and I think this is probably the best way of doing it. We are going to have to do this sooner or later anyway, even if it is a departmental thing, and it is much better if we do it like this. So we will be supporting this motion.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—I also rise to speak in support of Senator Brown's motion that the bill be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. As late as four days ago in the upper house of the New South Wales parliament, in answering a question regarding the defence bill that we are debating here today, the leader of the government, in reply, said:
As I indicated yesterday, I have only recently become aware of the legislation and that this state and other states have some concerns about it.
So just four days ago the leader of the government in the upper house of New South Wales said they have concerns about the bill. If we look at the Constitution itself—and that is what this motion is being based on—in essence the federal government can claim no power not granted to it by the Constitution. Powers actually granted must be such as are given expressly or by necessary implication. In other words, the only powers that the Commonwealth government can assume are expressly or necessarily implicated powers. They must be clear and defined. The instrument also has to be reasonably constructed according to the import of its terms—in other words, it must be clear and concise—and, where a power is expressly given in general terms, it is not to be confined to particular cases. So if the Constitution expressly implies that a power is for a specific purpose, that power cannot be used in another area. I believe that the necessity for this bill to go before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee is proper and correct. There are too many questions relating to this bill and its constitutional head of power. We will accordingly support Senator Brown's motion for the reference of this bill to that committee.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) LEGISLATION</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,15,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—The government opposes the motion proposed by Senator Brown. It has advice from the Solicitor-General that this proposed legislation is constitutional and it does not agree with the opinion put forward by Senator Brown. The Solicitor-General has stated that he is in no doubt that the incidental power of the parliament under section 51(xxxix) of the Constitution to legislate for the use of the Defence Force to protect Commonwealth property or Commonwealth interests covers this. It is also clearly within the individual powers of the parliament under other provisions of section 51 to legislate for the use of the Defence Force to protect interests covered by those provisions. The Solicitor-General has advised that the bill is constitutionally valid. There is no uncertainty in relation to it. The government therefore opposes the motion proposed by Senator Brown, which in any event would delay the passage of this important bill. It is needed to remedy the current situation and, importantly, it is needed for the onset of the Olympic Games, which approaches us in next fortnight.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) LEGISLATION</title>,<title>Referral to Committee</title>,Bills,15,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—On behalf of the opposition, I wish to indicate that the opposition will not be supporting the reference of this matter, standing in Senator Brown's name, to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I must say that, in relation to the general question of a committee reference, I think Senator Brown is pretty late off the mark. We have had a situation where there has been a great deal of commentary in the media about this bill. There certainly has been a lot of discussion in the general community about this legislation. I do think that is, in large measure, due to the fact that the opposition took the initiative to ensure that attention was drawn to it. It was the opposition that first publicly raised concerns about the bill, and that was at least a fortnight before the first media reports occurred on those matters. Labor were first to issue press releases noting concerns with the bill that we were keen to see the Senate committee system investigate and report upon. I think it is fair to say that was long before we heard from Senator Brown on this issue. It was the opposition that sought, successfully, to have a Senate inquiry into this bill so that the sorts of concerns we had could be investigated and so that recommendations could be made to improve the bill we are currently debating in the chamber. I think it is fair to say that it was at that time that we should have had this debate. It was at that time that we should have talked about which Senate committee could deal with the bill, the appropriateness of that, and what matters could be dealt with by the Senate committee system. 
It is the opposition that has recognised that currently there is no protection of civil liberties or proper processes to ensure that the Commonwealth does not abuse the very broad constitutional powers that it has in relation to the call-out of Australian defence forces. The Senate has now been engaged in debating this matter for quite some time. I think it is fair to say that it is the opposition that has taken the responsible approach of ensuring that any abuse in the future by a Commonwealth government in using these powers is prevented. I acknowledge that others are very concerned about those issues, and we heard from a number of them during the committee stage debate. I would be the first to say that those concerns are genuinely held. But certainly the opposition has moved key amendments to the bill to ensure that civil liberties are protected.
I must say that the opposition has not got massive concerns about the Commonwealth power to legislate for the call-out of Commonwealth troops under section 51(xxxix) of the Constitution in order to protect Commonwealth interests. I think that there is ample material available on the public record which confirms that the bill is constitutional. Senator Brown tells us that this may be tested at some later stage—which can be the case with legislation that passes the parliament, as all senators would be aware. Earlier in the committee stage debate I heard Senator Harris read an extract from Quick and Garran which confirmed the Commonwealth's capacity to protect its own interest. I hear what the minister says about the advice of the Solicitor-General. I understand the minister to have said that the Solicitor-General has considered this particular issue. Is that correct, Minister? I think that the minister at the table has indicated that and has provided advice that section 51A is constitutionally valid and not void because of uncertainty. The opposition has no reason not to accept that advice that has been provided. The government might consider that, in these circumstances—although it is not always the case—it may be useful to table that advice. That may go some way to assuring Senator Brown on the issue that he raises. I hope the minister will give some consideration to that, if formal advice is available, particularly given that earlier in today's proceedings of the Senate committee Senator Brown incorporated in Hansard some advice from senior counsel on this particular question.
I do think that the problem the Senate faces here is that a Senate committee has already inquired into this particular bill. It is always a bit difficult if you decide to come back for a second bite at the cherry after a committee has dealt with legislation in accordance with the forms of the chamber. That report is, I think, an important one, because by and large the recommendations of that committee are likely to be picked up by the committee of the whole, which indicates, I think, the thoroughness and the efficacy with which the Senate committee dealt with these particular matters. I say to Senator Brown, through the chair, that it is a very significant departure from normal practice, in circumstances where a Senate committee has inquired into the provisions of a bill, to have a second hearing.
The opposition understand and appreciate the government's imperatives in terms of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, but we also accept that if we are going to do this then we ought to get it right. I believe that is even more important in the context of the opposition not supporting an amendment for a sunset clause in the bill. They are the considerations that, as far as the opposition are concerned, are before us on this matter. That is the balance we have to bring to any judgment on this question before the chair. 
I think in this circumstance that the forms of the chamber should prevail and that one thorough Senate committee inquiry into a bill is adequate. I think it is too late in the day to have another committee hearing into matters, however important they might be. I say to Senator Brown through the chair that there is an opportunity to explore these issues in the committee of the whole and I suspect, given what has occurred over recent hours and days, that he is likely to do that. He is entitled to do that so that he is satisfied on these questions. I do not in any sense criticise Senator Brown's intention and serious commitment in bringing these matters to the attention of the Senate. But the decision for the Senate in these circumstances is whether such a course of action to have another Senate committee inquiry will effectively be tantamount to a delay in finalising this legislation on the eve of some important international events that will be taking place in this country.  
As far as the opposition is concerned, we have properly identified the weaknesses with the current situation, and that is what we continue to stress in debate on this particular issue. We are dissatisfied with the current arrangements. The status quo is not satisfactory and is not adequate as far as the Labor Party is concerned. Although we will not support the motion for this reference to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee, we are certainly happy to listen to the debate as it progresses in the committee stage and argue as strongly and as persuasively as we can the position that the opposition has taken on this matter from day one.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—I thank senators for their contribution, but how disappointing it is. I made it clear in introducing this debate that this motion would not delay the Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000. The legislation will be going through this week—I understand that—because the government and opposition have the power of numbers there. But, notwithstanding that, I believed it was extremely important and prudent that, over the coming months, the constitutional validity of this legislation be tested, not least because it was a Labor Attorney-General from New South Wales who suggested to the committee that looked into this matter that the `legislation broadens the scope of the Commonwealth's power in a manner which gives rise to doubts about its constitutional basis.' The Labor Party says, `Well, we now know the government has got an opinion from the Solicitor-General.' Is this not the Solicitor-General that the Labor Party has repeatedly criticised and found wanting in judgment on other legal matters? 
—Did you hear that I suggest it be tabled? 
—The Labor Party says, `Well, that is available now'—
—It is not available. 
—`through the government, and we may see it tabled. That is okay by us.' It is not okay by me. When the previous committee brought its findings into this place, it did not have the benefit of the Solicitor-General's opinion. 
—So you don't want to see that? 
—I do want to see that advice—the Labor Party is in a hole over this, in a mess over it—but the Labor Party is effectively closing the door on the avenue to seeing that advice, which is to support this motion, because Labor is unconscionably weak on this matter. It should be taking the position I am taking on this, but it is not. Even when we get to the position of clearing the air about the constitutional validity, Labor says, `No, too late. We made a decision on that when we didn't have the information. Now the information is available, we're going to press ahead regardless of what that information is.' What an argument for the Labor Party in opposition to bring forward into this chamber! It is not valid; it is not right; it is way short of the mark; and the government itself ought to be accepting this motion of mine. 
I am not saying that committee will make a determination one way or the other. I am saying there are very real and important arguments to be settled about the constitutional validity, and those arguments have not been resolved by either the findings of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee or by the deliberation in this house. We cannot get that resolution without expert advice. I have come in here with a reasonable proposition to the Senate, knowing that the bill is going to go through: that is, let us in the calm after the debate about the bill determine the matter of constitutional validity. The opposition joins the government and says, `No, we won't support that determination being made.' That is compliance, not opposition. I believe it is muddle-headed at best. I do not believe the opposition has taken a serious look at the potential consequences of this legislation—and the constitutional consequences—or it would be taking a far more forward looking position in support of this motion. 
Well, so be it. A question mark hangs over this legislation and its employ. If, God forbid, it is employed in the future against Australian citizens, then the matter may be resolved in the High Court but it will be too late, I submit—too late because members in this chamber have not taken it seriously enough now. Here is the opportunity to clear the air on this matter, but that opportunity is not being allowed. I think this is a pretty poor day for the proceedings of this place, and I do not think the opposition has taken the role it should in this matter.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—Prior to question time, I made reference to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. I would like to return to that and expand on section 15AB, which clearly refers to the use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of an act. It goes on to say:
Subject to subsection (3), in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, if any material not forming part of the Act is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material:
It goes further under section 1(b) to say:
to determine the meaning of the provision when: 
(i) the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or—
and this was the issue I raised earlier in the day—
(ii) the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable. 
The act then goes on to clearly define what sections of an act or what extrinsic material can be used. It states:
(a) all matters not forming part of the Act that are set out in the document containing the text of the Act as printed ... 
(b) any relevant report of a Royal Commission, Law Reform Commission ... 
(c) any relevant report of a committee of the Parliament or of either House of the Parliament that was made to the Parliament or that House of the Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;   ...   ...   ... 
(f) the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in that House; 
My reason for raising this in the context of the debate pertaining to definitions is that I believe that the definitions in this act are, as Senator Brown has so clearly set out, at best ambiguous and at worst obscure. We have a history of situations where acts are not clearly defined and where there are different opinions in the community, in both houses of parliament and also in the judiciary. One only has to look at the Native Title Act as an example. In relation to extrinsic material, the leader of the government's second reading speech that was incorporated refers to a section pertaining to the validity of extinguishing native title. The previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating, made the following statement:
Only validated freehold grants, residential, commercial and pastoral or agricultural leases, and validated Crown actions basically involving permanent public works, will extinguish native title.
So we have a statement by a previous Prime Minister on a bill that would have left the Australian people with the greatest dilemma in not being able to ascertain how an act was to be to interpreted and applied. I believe the defence bill we have before us at this point in time is of a similar construction. It has the ability in the future to create the same uncertainty because of the lack of definitions. In the report from the foreign affairs committee at section 1.66, we see that the New South Wales government also had concerns about definitions. I quote:
The New South Wales government expresses concern about the term `likely to occur'.
This phrase `likely to occur' is an issue that has not been raised in this debate to any extent whatsoever. Is that defined? No, it is not. Regarding section 51A, the New South Wales government went on to say:
The authorising ministers are to be satisfied that domestic violence is occurring or is likely to occur in Australia before they can make an order for calling out the defence forces.
We do not even have to have an actual situation where somebody is in danger or where there is domestic violence. Under this bill with the definitions that we have at the moment, the Governor-General can call out the Australian Defence Force on something that is `likely to occur'. So I support very strongly the Greens amendment.
In the Bills Digest, another section refers to `lawful protest or dissent'. Again, we have no definition of `lawful protest or dissent' in the bill. In supporting the Brown amendment, which helps to define domestic violence in a more certain manner, I ask the minister, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, whether the references to `lawful protest or dissent' can actually be defined and added into either the bill or the regulations and whether the reference to `likely to occur' can also be defined and added to the bill or the regulations.

"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-09-04,"—I want to speak on this and give reasons for the Democrats supporting this particular amendment of Senator Brown. In addressing the issue of a definition of domestic violence, let me say that we are not debating semantics here. It is not simply that this is an issue of whether it should be defined more carefully in words. There are some critical issues that hang off the whole definition of domestic violence and off the whole of this bill.
I am not going to speak for very long, but I want to put on the record some work done by a person in Brisbane who has for many years been a researcher in defence issues and peace issues. His name is David Fisher. He has drawn to my attention a number of historical precedents and historical issues that arise out of this whole issue of definition. The first issue to be considered is that any army, in defending a nation—and, after all, that is its role; or at least that is what we believe to be its normal role—needs to be trained in order to kill an enemy. While there are some soldiers who can do this automatically, most soldiers in fact have to be trained to do that. Having had some military training myself, I am aware of that and of how that takes place. The problem is, however, that, in training an army to kill the enemy, if `enemy' is identified as `neighbour' or as `fellow citizen', this creates immense confusion for the soldiers in any army. No army can really afford for its soldiers to become sensitised by contact with citizens.
There are many historical examples of this happening and confusing an army quite significantly. One example was the demoralisation of the German army during the Second World War: when they were asked to be involved in the extermination of Jews and others, many of the soldiers became completely demoralised and very confused—and we understand that that was the reason for the formation of the death squads to carry out that work. In the Hungarian revolution in 1956, Soviet soldiers who had been in Hungary for some time were unable to quell the revolution, and it was because of their contact with ordinary citizens. It was not until the Soviets brought in some new troops from, I believe, Mongolia that they were able to quell that revolution. In more recent times, in the events in Tiananmen Square about 10 years ago, the Chinese authorities had the same problem in trying to get the soldiers who had had contact with the students to carry out orders. It was not until they brought in a fresh batch of soldiers from outside of Beijing that they were able to carry out their murderous intent. So there is a confusion, in terms of definition, when we take the fundamental definition of the purpose of an army—which is to defend its own country and nation and, in order to do that, to learn to kill an enemy—when that enemy is identified as `fellow citizen'.
But there is another problem, and that is the primacy of civilian authority. In Australia, of course, we have always held to that as a fundamental part of our democracy. The involvement of an army against its own citizens confuses completely the chain of command. There is, once you do this, the possibility of a coup. Once you put an army against a nation's own citizens, the chain of command transfers from the civilian authority to the army, and that cuts across the civilian authority and causes great confusion about who it is that the soldiers should obey. The recent Fijian coup itself really illustrates how citizens can become confused about what is the nature of democracy and who is defending it. In that case, terrorists were seen to be the defenders of a particular kind of democracy—and, of course, that confusion remains and has still not been sorted out. 
I do not want to delay the chamber, but I did want to put on the record this research which has been done. It is not research which is way out of left field; it is mainstream, and I pay tribute to the person who draw this research to my attention. In conclusion, one of the problems in any war is psychological stress in soldiers, and that stress is significantly escalated when they have to act against their own citizens. The only way that, in fact, they can act against their own citizens is if they are trained to be automatons—and Australian soldiers certainly are not that and never have been. Using soldiers against our own citizens makes them less effective as soldiers, because of the blurring of the function of having to defend the country or having to attack citizens. The army is trained essentially to defend the country, not to attack the citizens of their own country.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, I would indicate the opposition's position on the amendment that is before the chair. The opposition will not be supporting this particular amendment. In fact, I am not convinced that by inserting this definition of domestic violence—or, if you like, by setting this benchmark for domestic violence—we will not have a situation where the benchmark will in fact be too low—lower than it has been set by convention for the last century. The term `significant armed violence' is a very general one, and I am concerned that that would facilitate the Commonwealth being able to deploy troops in situations where they are not required and should not be used.
Senator Brown asked questions of the minister. I could equally ask what `significant armed violence' actually means. I suspect that state police forces would probably tell you that they deal with significant armed violence frequently. But I have to say that, when they do, it is certainly not a scenario for the calling out of troops. The problem with an amendment like this is that you might have a situation where that could actually occur.
It is with that spirit I say to the committee that the opposition cannot support this particular amendment substituting a definition of `domestic violence'. It seems to me that, in many ways, this is pulling against the general thrust of many of those changes that Senator Brown has embraced in this particular bill. But, anyway, that is the position that the opposition will take, and we will vote accordingly.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—by leave—I move government amendments Nos 2 and 5 on sheet DG223:
(2)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (after line 25), at the end of subsection (2), add:
		Provided always that the Emergency Forces or the Reserve Forces shall not be called out or utilized in connexion with an industrial dispute.
(5)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 9 (after line 21), at the end of subsection (2), add:

These amendments were canvassed in the Senate committee's report. The committee recommended that the bill be amended by inserting the words `provided always that the Emergency Forces or the Reserve Forces shall not be called out or utilised in connexion with an industrial dispute' to form a proviso to proposed subsections 51A(2) and 51C(2). These amendments extend those provisos to those subsections that I have mentioned and bring them into line with section 51B. These are amendments that I think the committee canvassed well. It was a constructive suggestion by the committee, might I say, and I commend the amendments to the Senate.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—The amendments do not solve the problem—and here there will be a real test for Labor. I noted the comments on domestic violence. I think it is much better to try to define something than to leave it floating in the air for the determination of some misperforming politician further down the line. But here is the real test. The government and Labor are moving towards some sort of lowest common denominator of acceptance.
—That's not right in Labor's case. I cannot speak for anyone else.
—That is how I see it, Senator Faulkner. But let me say this, through you, Chair: Senator Faulkner has said very, very determinedly that what the Labor Party stands for is to never see the troops brought out against Australians, and Australian workers in particular. There is only one way to fix that, and that is to say that the troops cannot be brought out against Australian protesters or Australian workers. But that is not what the Labor Party is going to do here. It is coming up with one of these indeterminate definitions that Senator Faulkner was just having a go at me about: a series of words that is wide open to definition because it is not able to be pinned down. Labor should call a spade a spade. Labor should back the Green amendments coming down the line. We are in this invidious position where there are very weak amendments coming from the government. But let me say to the rest of the committee that, despite the running sheet, it does not—even if the government amendments go through—prevent the committee from then considering the Green amendments, voting on those and hopefully endorsing them.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—These particular government amendments are ones that the opposition will support. We believe that they are an improvement to the bill. They extend the restriction on the Commonwealth using emergency or reserve forces in industrial disputes, which is one of the amendments that were recommended in the Senate committee report—and, of course, we will also be supporting a similar amendment to clause 51C. These amendments will ensure that the current restriction in section 51 of the Defence Act is continued.
Perhaps I can say to the committee that we will be moving a separate amendment to section 51G of the bill to prevent any Defence Force personnel being used to stop or restrict protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. I think there is a point in these committee debates when you should not continue to repeat yourself, so I will not, except to say, as I have said before, that this is an essential safeguard of civil liberties, and I commend that approach to the committee.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—by leave—I move Australian Greens amendments Nos 5, 7 and 9 on sheet 1894 together:
(5)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (after line 25), at the end of subsection (2), add:
And further provided always that the Defence Force shall not be called out against people who are engaging in peaceful protest or civil disobedience.

3A  After the proviso in former section 51
Insert:
And further provided always that the Defence Force shall not be called out against people who are engaging in peaceful protests or civil disobedience.
(9)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 9 (after line 21) at the end of subsection (2), add:
And further provided always that the Defence Force shall not be called out against people who are engaging in peaceful protest or civil disobedience.
These are more crucial Greens amendments. Amendment No. 9 says that the defence forces `shall not be called out against people who are engaging in peaceful protest or civil disobedience'. Surely we are, here, at the heart of the matter. This says: `Let us not have lack of clarity, lack of definition or lack of direction through legislation in a matter so crucial as the use of Australia's armed services against Australian civilians.' Such a use is unconscionable. It goes against a century of this nation's ideals and how it sees itself. 
I find it incredible that we may not have the Labor Party supporting this amendment, for goodness sake. I find it remarkable that we could pass legislation which leaves the door open even a little, and which leaves it to the good offices of some future government that the troops will not be sent in to things like the Franklin blockade, which was illegal; Vietnam moratorium marches, which were illegal and—as some in power at the time thought—un-Australian; or an S11 protest. At least the government today said that it endorses the right of S11 demonstrations to proceed as a peaceful protest against the upcoming World Economic Forum. Surely, the amendments that say that the Australian defence forces shall not be used against Australians who are engaging in peaceful protest or civil disobedience should have the support not just of the opposition but of every member of this place. It is not complicated; it is bedrock. You cannot cavil with that. Where are we in this parliament, in this democracy and in this country which values freedom if we cannot pass these simple amendments in defence of civil rights, in defence of peaceful protest and in defence of 100 years of practice in this great country of ours? Surely, the government and the opposition will have to support these amendments.

"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-09-04,"—The Democrats are in favour of these amendments. We have been told pretty often that the probable reason this bill would ever need to be used is to fight against terrorism and, if that is the case, we can see absolutely no reason why anybody would vote against these amendments. They seem very basic. Keep in mind that the amendments do not say that there is nothing you can do if someone is engaging in a peaceful protest or civil disobedience; you can still send the police in. They just say that you cannot send the armed forces in, and I think that is a very good suggestion. We will be supporting the amendments.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—These particular amendments, and the one we have been giving consideration to on industrial disputes, do warrant a comment from the opposition. Let me make one now, going to amendments Nos 5, 7 and 9 and, also, to the similar matter in relation to industrial disputes that was quickly dealt with before. Amendments Nos 4 and 8 essentially replicate the amendments that were moved by the government on this matter in line with the Senate committee's recommendations. I made clear to the committee—but let me state it again—that the opposition will be moving a separate amendment to clause 51G of the bill to prevent any Defence Force personnel being used to stop or restrict protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. We believe that is vital to safeguard civil liberties. We believe the opposition's approach will be more effective in protecting civil liberties than will be the approach that Senator Brown is currently pursuing in this committee.
The bill as it stands does not in fact allow for troops to be called out to deal with peaceful protests and dissent. The opposition's amendment will ensure that, even if troops have been called out, they will not be able to stop or restrict protests or industrial action that do not pose a threat of injury or death. That is an important distinction, and I would ask the committee to give that distinction some consideration. We consider that our approach is more effective in protecting civil liberties, and that is why we have determined not to support the amendments now before the chair and the previous amendment. The opposition consider that the word `peaceful' is simply too vague a qualification to use in attempting to prescribe the use of defence forces in protest or civil disobedience. I believe—and I think a strong argument can be mounted for this—that the opposition's approach will be much more effective in protecting civil liberties. For that reason we are pursuing our alternative approach, and for that reason we are not supporting these amendments before the chair.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—I just do not accept that, and nor would any reasonable person. If the opposition believe that and there is no conflict between the amendments we are putting forward and what they are putting forward—theirs goes further—they should have no trouble supporting these amendments. Senator Faulkner says that the bill does not allow for troops to be called out in peaceful civil protest. So what is the problem with these amendments? They are not in conflict with the bill, and they are not in conflict with what Labor want, but Labor are not going to support them. 
When we look at the Labor amendment which is coming down the line, we find that it is not quite what Senator Faulkner says it is at all. He said that the Labor amendment would ensure that the defence forces cannot be used to:
... stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action that does not pose a direct and immediate threat of serious injury or death to a person, ...
The rest reads:
... except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons ... 
A very big difference! There is a reasonable likelihood of death or serious injury when we drive to work or go into a big surf or each time we catch the plane home from this place, depending on what you think `reasonable' is. A few minutes ago, Senator Faulkner took umbrage with me for bringing that into a failed Greens amendment which was trying to tie down the situation in which politicians in this place can use the wide-open door, created by Labor and the Liberals, to bring the troops out against Australians in the future. Labor are not closing that door. Labor are not closing the door to some aberrant government in the future calling the troops out against strikers or against peaceful protesters in this country—against proper civil disobedience. In short, Labor are not closing the door to some future government—coalition, Labor or otherwise—bringing the troops out because it has a political dispute with opponents who are protesting. That is what is very wrong with this.
All the nuances of this have been considered in the backrooms, and Labor have decided they do not want to give up their ability to call out the troops in future in such circumstances—what a terrible pass that is—otherwise what is the problem with a very clearly worded amendment that says `No troops against peaceful protesters in Australia, ever; no troops against workers striking in this country, ever'? But Labor are not going to have that on because they see themselves in office one of these days wanting to be able to use the troops as their police, just the same as this coalition foresees that potential somewhere at the back of its mind—it does not know the circumstances—in the future. As Senator Bourne has just said, and I have said frequently in this debate: if this bill were about terrorism it would be a different matter. But this bill is about abusing, or leaving in place the ability to abuse, the time-honoured convention in this country that troops cannot be called out against civilians, in particular peacefully protesting civilians, and Labor are not going to support that tenet in the year 2000.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Senator Brown has got this quite wrong; at least, he has got the opposition's motivation wrong. The opposition have worked very hard to apply proper constraints to any future government in the event of a proposal to call out the troops. Ascribing the motivation to the Labor Party that you do, Senator Brown, is both grievously unfair and quite wrong. Having said that, I believe and the opposition believe—through you, Mr Temporary Chair, to Senator Brown—that your amendments reduce the benchmark for a call-out. That is what we believe, and that is why we do not want to support them. Ask yourself the key question: when does a peaceful protest become a non-peaceful protest? Ask yourself that. Think about it. Contemplate the sort of interpretation that is required.
I say to you, Senator Brown, very clearly that we believe that your amendments actually reduce the benchmark for call-out. I think this is an error. I understand your motivation, and I accept it. I am sorry that you do not accept the Labor Party's motivation in this regard. You are just wrong about that. Our intentions here are proper and genuine, and I have no difficulty in defending them and embracing them in this committee discussion. I do not question your motivations at all. I believe that you are approaching this question with goodwill. So I am not questioning your motivation, though you are questioning the opposition's. But I really believe you are mistaken here, Senator Brown. I think you have made a blunder. I think that your amendments will reduce the benchmark for call-out. For that reason and that reason only we will not support it. We do not want to see this situation made any easier, with less protection for civil liberties, under the administration of any future government, of whatever political colour or persuasion they may be.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—The difference between the Labor Party and the Greens—and I think other parties in this corner of the Senate—is that they support the bill and will see it through into law and we oppose the bill and will vote against it. The amendments are a refining process in the middle of all that. I just do not accept what Senator Faulkner has just said. If the Labor Party—which are going to see this bill going to the law and, therefore, bear the responsibility for it—believe that the Greens' amendments have shortcomings, where is the argument that it is in conflict with their own amendments? 
I agree that once you start to support the legislation you are in great difficulty. Labor is now getting to the point where it has to put in some definitional words about violence and talk about the threat of serious injury or death occurring. As I have just explained to the house, that does not just apply to protests in industrial dispute; that can apply to much that we do in everyday life. In other words, it does not put a constraint on the use and abuse by politicians of the huge powers that become available under this legislation. Remember, by codifying these powers we cut through a century of convention which says you cannot do it. By codifying this we are saying—and the government and opposition are both the same in this—through this legislation, `You can do it, and here are the parameters of that.'
The Labor amendment—and the Liberals are edging in their direction, and the two are going to come together on this—is saying, `Let us talk about some ill-defined level of violence which we think could occur before we send in the troops.' That is what is wrong with this legislation. The definitions ultimately do get left in the minds of the three ministers of the government of the day—and then of the field commander of the troops, once they are sent in, who has to think under Labor's prescription that there is a likelihood that somebody is going to be seriously hurt or killed if they do not intervene.
If I were to levy that judgment on the grand prix, that would stop it. Who is going to tell me that many people do not go to the grand prix because they think there is a likelihood that somebody is going to get injured or killed? A lot of people would turn in their tickets if they did not think that was a possibility. So the grand prix becomes a vehicle for this sort of thinking, which is unimaginable.
—Has anyone been killed in a grand prix in Australia?
—I do not know about that. But the likelihood has always been there, Senator Faulkner.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Senator Brown and Senator Faulkner, you may care to address your comments through the chair.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I think he is being a bit unfair about the motivation of people attending grand prix. Not that I would know, because I—
—I did not say `all people'; I said that the ticket sales would drop. We can have that argument somewhere else. The point I am making here is that Labor's caveats do not hold water. They do not alter the fact that Labor is here today supporting the government in bringing in a law which codifies the use of the Australian armed services with a right to shoot to kill against Australian protesters and strikers. That is what is wrong with it. Labor's amendments do not alter that fact, and I do not believe they put a halter of any real effect on the use of this power by either the politicians or the field commander over and above that which the government intends.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I think that Senator Brown there has used some silly arguments in support of his case. I think it does his case no benefit to use those sorts of arguments. I have no idea what the motivation of people going to grand prix might be. I have not been to one of the Australian grand prix. I must say I do not think I have had been invited—I may have been, but I do not recall ever being invited. But that is neither here nor there. I do not think people go along to those sorts of sporting events to see death and injury. I am sure that is not the case. I think Senator Brown is being very unfair to a very great number of Australians—tens of thousands of Australians—who enjoy motor sport as a recreational activity.
But having said that—because I do not really think that is central to the matters under discussion with this legislation—I make the point to the committee that the opposition will support this legislation if, and only if, it is amended in such a way that we believe it improves the current situation, the status quo. That is the test for the opposition, that is the ruler we are going to run over this legislation and that is the reason we have been so serious in moving amendments to this legislation. I reject the comments that have been made about the approach of the opposition, which I think is not only defensible but very principled and proper. 
The problem with the amendments before the chair at the moment is that they reduce the benchmark for call-out. That is a very good reason why they should not be supported, and a very good reason why they will not be supported by the opposition. I commend that approach to the committee. But be under no illusions. No-one should be under any illusions about our general approach—that is, we are dissatisfied and concerned about the current situation, about the capacity for call-out of the ADF willy-nilly. We want to put a proper legislative framework in place—but I stress `proper' and `appropriate' and `with safeguards'—to defend the principles that our party hold very dear. That is the spirit in which we come to this debate—in which we are participating in it and will continue to participate in it.
I believe that this is a self-defeating proposal from Senator Brown—self-defeating amendments. I do not want to engage in a long and drawn-out debate with Senator Brown. He is entitled to his view. I respect people in the chamber for holding views other than those the opposition holds. He is entitled to his view and he is entitled to put it. I am merely indicating that it is not shared by the opposition, because it will reduce the benchmark for call-out. All senators have to consider this question. Look at the amendments before the chair, look at this question of `peaceful protest' and consider whether that term is too vague when you attempt to use it to prescribe the involvement of defence forces in protest or civil disobedience. We think it is too vague. I am very concerned about it. I do not think it improves the bill; I think it weakens it dramatically. It will not be supported by the opposition for that reason.
I can say no more about that. I hope I have explained that position clearly to the committee—what the approach of the opposition has been within the general framework that I have laid down now on the very many occasions I have been on my feet during this committee stage of the debate. While I commend the approach of the opposition to the committee, I accept that others have different views. I just make the point that I think the opposition's motivation in this cannot be questioned. We want to improve the current situation. We want a legislative framework and protection in place and we will only support such a legislative framework if it gives greater protection to the civil liberties of ordinary Australians than does the current situation.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I await Senator Brown's definition of when a peaceful protest becomes `non-peaceful'. That is the problem, Senator Brown. I think you are being churlish not to accept that what the Labor Party is putting forward here is a significant—
—You are ducking the question.
—I am not ducking it. This is a significant improvement to the bill. I think you ought to examine this from the perspective that I have tried, as clearly as I can and as succinctly as I can, to put before the committee. You have to look at this in the context of when a peaceful protest becomes non-peaceful and what that means for a call-out. You are lowering the benchmark and, as far as the Labor Party are concerned, we are trying to ratchet it up and ratchet it up considerably. That is our intention, and I believe we have been effective and have fulfilled that intention in the amendments we have moved.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—They haven't, Chair. The point is that Labor are supporting this legislation and we are opposing it. So the amendments are where the matter will end, and they are on the head of the Labor Party. When I have challenged Senator Faulkner to say, in Labor's amendment words, that `there will not be a reasonable likelihood of serious injury to persons in future disputation, industrial or political, in this country', he ducked the question. He ducked it because the Labor amendment applies to the commander in the field after the politicians have sent in the troops and it is then in the mind of the commander of the troops as to whether there is going to be a reasonable likelihood of injury in a dispute, including an industrial dispute or a peaceful protest. If that commander takes it into their mind that there is a reasonable likelihood of serious injury to persons, then they can send their troops in against Australian citizens. The bar is negligible in that situation. 
Can you imagine Pangea establishing a nuclear waste dump in Australia, in your home state of Western Australia, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, against the wishes of the state government? Can you imagine a huge, peaceful protest of 50,000 people out there in the desert, with the Commonwealth saying, `We've got to end this blockade,' and sending troops over? Can you imagine the commander of troops, facing 50,000 people out in the desert in Western Australia in summer, looking at this Labor amendment to this legislation and saying, `Is there a reasonable likelihood of death or serious injury to persons if this goes on?' Of course there is, of course there will be and of course the excuse is there, written in this legislation. That is why we should oppose this legislation, and that is why we should be saying, `You can't use the troops in industrial disputation and you can't use the troops against peaceful protest.' I will go along with Senator Faulkner and drop the word `peaceful'—`you cannot use troops against any protest by Australians'. Let us have it that way. But that is not what Labor is going to do; Labor is effectively agreeing with the thrust of the government's legislation, which in those circumstances will give the commander in the field the authority to send in troops—with the authority to kill if necessary—against protesting Australians. We should not be doing that.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—I would like to come back to the essence of what we are discussing; that is, the two amendments that we are looking at in light of the fact raised by the opposition that they consider that their amendment is an improvement on the amendments moved by the Greens. Senator Faulkner said in his comments earlier that Senator Brown's opposition is self-defeating. I do not believe it is. The wording of Senator Brown's amendment is:
And further provided always that the Defence Force shall not ... 
I take note of the comments that have been made regarding the word `peaceful'. I have some concerns about Senator Brown's amendment referring to `or civil disobedience'. I would not like it to go on record that One Nation is supporting civil disobedience—we are not. But I believe that the essence of what Senator Brown is raising here is the essence of the entire bill. One solution would be that, as Senator Brown has put to the committee, we support both sets of amendments. In reading both the opposition amendment and those of Senator Brown, I see no conflict between them. In actuality, to a large degree they complement each other quite well. The Labor Party also is saying that our defence forces should not be allowed to `stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action', so I do not see that the amendments that are proposed are in conflict. Where I believe there is a problem is with opposition amendment No. 3, because they have revised their original amendment to again introduce uncertainty into the bill. The situation has been further complicated by the government circulating an amendment— and the one that I have carries the word `draft' on it; I will seek clarification from the minister afterwards as to whether this is the amendment that the government will be putting—to Labor's amendment No. 3 to add the words:
After `persons', insert `or serious damage to property'.
If Senator Faulkner is raising the issue that Senator Brown's amendment has the capacity to lower the standard of the call-out, then the government's amendment would have to be viewed in all sincerity as totally scuttling the opposition's amendment in its essence. 
We have other problems associated with this section of the bill, and again they go to the fact that the bill does not clarify the situation sufficiently. I would like to briefly speak on section 51I, in relation to recapturing premises. We will leave aside all the scenarios that people could surmise where you would need this. The point I am raising is that, in 51I(1) of the government's bill, it says:
Subject to this section, a member of the Defence Force who is being utilised in accordance with section 51D 	may, under the command of the Chief of the Defence Force ...
So the bill does not even define who the member of the Defence Force is in this particular section. Again, this raises concerns that flow back to the essence of both Labor's and the Greens' amendments. We need to seek a clarification from the minister in the context that we are discussing amendments relating to whether the Defence Force can be called out in relation to an industrial event. Who is the bill actually speaking to in section 51 when it refers to a `member of the Defence Force'? We need clarification of this to have an understanding of who is going to be able to carry out the actions that may in effect result from a group of Australian protesters involved in an industrial action moving into, and taking up residence in, a building—whoever the entity may be that controls that. Can the minister clarify for us who that member of the Defence Force would be that would carry out that action?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—I think I understand Senator Harris's question in that, when he asks who it refers to, he is asking who it is in effect this bill directs or restrains—perhaps more importantly in relation to activities related to the call-out. The proposed legislation does say what the Chief of the Defence Force can and cannot do, and it also stipulates what a member of the ADF can and cannot do. It is quite clear in that. The government is quite satisfied that the directive of the bill as to firstly what the Chief of the Defence Force can do and what any member of the ADF can do in relation to the subject of a call-out is very clear indeed. That is what it is directed at, Senator Harris. I think you can put it no other way than that. The bill is quite clear as to who it restricts in relation to behaviour. I do not think I can take it much further than that.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—I beg to differ with the minister. I will refer again to this draft amendment that the government has put around that refers very clearly to amending Labor's amendment R3 by saying that, if there is serious damage to property, the Army can be called out, as the bill stands, in an industrial dispute. I do not believe the bill goes anywhere near defining in that case who that member of the Defence Force would be. The bill merely says that he is under the command of the Chief of the Defence Force. So do we have a member of the Defence Force who is of the rank of a soldier or a corporal or a sergeant who would have the power to enter that building that is being occupied by the group of industrial dissidents—for want of a better word? I do not believe the bill does define what rank makes that decision; and, if it does, could the minister direct me very clearly to it?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—This is pre-empting the amendment which is proposed by the opposition and which the government seeks to make slight amendment to. Proposed section 51G says: 
In utilising the Defence Force in accordance with section 51D, the Chief of the Defence Force must not: 
(a) stop or restrict any lawful protest or dissent ...
That is quite clear. It is a direction to the Chief of the Defence Force in relation to stopping or restricting any lawful protest or dissent. What is proposed by the opposition—and we are jumping ahead of ourselves, but I will accept it is relevant to the debate here—is that paragraph (a) be changed to include 
(a)	 stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons ...  
And there it ends. The government is proposing to add to that: `or serious damage to property'. If both of those amendments were passed, you would very clearly have a situation where the Chief of the Defence Force would be directed, when utilising the ADF, to have regard to those provisos. There would be very clear restrictions imposed on the Chief of the Defence Force by the opposition amendment. Those provisos would require that it be considered whether there was a reasonable likelihood of the death or serious injury to persons or serious damage to property.
It may assist Senator Harris to also look at what is contained in proposed section 51D, which is headed `Chief of the Defence Force to utilise Defence Force as directed'. In that proposed section is a direction of how the Defence Force is to be used, including the fact it has to be utilised `in such a manner as is reasonable and necessary'. So you have a qualification in proposed section 51D, and then in proposed section 51G(a) you have a further proposed qualification proposed by the opposition to which the government would then seek to make an addition. The provisoes and qualifications that apply are quite clear. In proposed section 51GA, it is clearly the Chief of the Defence Force who is restricted in his or her behaviour.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I move opposition amendment (R3) on sheet 1895:
(R3)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 11 (line 32), omit paragraph 51G(a), substitute:
	(a)	stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons; or 
This is a very important amendment on the restriction of utilisation of the Australian Defence Force. The opposition's intention here is to ensure that there are the tightest possible restrictions on the Commonwealth using its constitutional powers to call out troops in domestic security situations. This is a matter that I have spoken about at some length both in the second reading debate on this bill and in this committee stage. There has already been a considerable amount of interest and attention given to this amendment by the committee. I would like to make clear again for the benefit of the committee that the opposition does not support the defence forces being used against protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action that does not pose a threat of serious injury or death to a person. It is the view of the opposition that this amendment is absolutely vital for the protection of the civil liberties of Australians, the civil liberties that Australians currently enjoy. I believe this is the most important amendment that will be moved to this bill; it is certainly the most important of the opposition amendments. 
There must be no misunderstanding about the fact that we do not want troops being used against people who are simply exercising their democratic rights. We accept that there are no such restrictions in place at the moment. I stress that point for the benefit of the committee: there are no such restrictions in place at the moment. But in the process of this parliament developing a legislative framework for the use of this Commonwealth power and in attempting to define the circumstances in which the Commonwealth government should be permitted to use this power, we believe that it is fundamental that the limits of this power should be carefully defined.
The opposition does not believe this power should extend to preventing or restricting protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action. I made the point previously in debate on this bill, but let me make it again: as far as the opposition is concerned, we want to ensure that our defence forces are never used in an inappropriate way, that they are never used for anything other than to protect Australians. The Australian defence forces should only ever be used to protect Australians. They should never ever be used to prevent Australians from exercising their democratic rights. That is a fundamental principle. It has guided the approach of the opposition on this bill. I believe that this is an essential amendment to the bill, and the carriage of this bill will only be considered by the opposition in the event of this amendment being accepted. I urge all senators to support the amendment, and I commend the amendment to the committee.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—At this stage, I think it is important for the government to make its position clear, and that is it will move an amendment which will seek to add some words to the amendment proposed by the opposition. The opposition at 51G(a) is introducing a limitation in relation to the activities of the Australian Defence Force in a call-out. It says:
In utilising the Defence Force in accordance with section 51D, the Chief of the Defence Force must not:
(a) stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons ...
The government seeks to add to that `or serious damage to property'. I take on board the comments that Senator Faulkner has made on behalf of the opposition. This is indeed a very serious part of the debate in this committee in relation to this proposed legislation, which deals with the call-out of the Australia Defence Force in extreme circumstances. I can well understand the points made by the opposition and, in particular, Senator Faulkner as to why the opposition would want these qualifications made in relation to 51G(a).
The government believes, however, that it is appropriate to include the words `or serious damage to property'. On the face of it, `or serious damage to property' may not sound great. In fact, you might say that this seems rather trite when you are talking about the threat to life and limb which is contained in the opposition's amendment. I ask anyone who is thinking in those terms to go back section 51D in the proposed legislation, which deals with the direction given to a Chief of the Defence Force in the utilisation of defence forces, and I mentioned this previously. If there is a call-out order, then the Chief of the Defence Force must `utilise the Defence Force, in such manner as is reasonable and necessary'. And that is applicable to the three different call-outs: the call-out by the Commonwealth, the call-out by the state and the call-out by the territory. But, of course, if you go back further than section 51D, you are talking about the very basis for a call-out, and that is where you have a situation where the territory or state is unable to deal with the domestic violence that it is confronted with. Section 51A(1)(b) says, `the State or Territory is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect Commonwealth interests against the domestic violence'. 
There has been much debate about this, and for very good reason, because this forms the basis of the call-out. There must be such an extreme situation that the authorities in the state or territory cannot deal with it themselves. If there is a call-out and that first criterion is met, the Chief of the Defence Force then has that extra qualification that, in utilising the defence forces, they must act in a reasonable and necessary fashion. If that is not enough, then that further limitation is placed upon that action in this amendment proposed by the opposition, and that is that this action cannot be to stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action except in those extreme cases of threat of death or serious injury to persons. And that really is as extreme as it gets.
All throughout the logical process of the bill, you have these qualifications and these criteria which need to be met—not one of them on their own is sufficient. They all act in concert. We are saying that you need to have the words `or serious damage to property' looked at in this context. You might have a situation where there is the burning of houses, the destruction of a power plant or the destruction and looting of buildings. We recently saw this situation in East Timor—although a foreign place—where property was destroyed. And it could happen without the threat of serious injury to persons or death—for instance, in a neighbourhood which has been evacuated there could be serious looting, burning and destruction on a grand scale. That is the sort of situation that this addition envisages. Normally you would say that, if there is such serious damage to property, there would be threat to life and limb. That would certainly be conceivable, but we want to cover here all possible scenarios. We want to make sure that, in bringing in this legislation, we get it right.
Senator Faulkner quite properly pointed out that there is no restriction at the moment. There is no qualification in existence at present. In fact, what we currently have is this imperfect situation, which the Senate committee even acknowledged. What we are doing here is providing the Australian community with assurances in relation to the activities of the Australian Defence Force in such dire circumstances, and they are circumstances that the government would hope would never, ever have to happen. It is not a case where this is envisaged as being an easy occurrence—it would be in only those most serious circumstances that you would have such a call-out.
There is also the added aspect that in such a call-out, the defence forces would respond to a request by the police force in relation to a particular task and, if that request were withdrawn, the defence forces would have to desist from that action. So you have in this proposed legislation a number of safeguards, a number of qualifications in relation to the behaviour and activity to be undertaken by the Australian Defence Force, all of which point to the preservation of the liberty of Australians at large—and I accept the tenor of the amendment moved by Senator Faulkner in this regard.
However, the government would say that we do need to make this addition, which relates to property. It is not something which can be read in isolation. It has to be read in the overall context of this bill. To those people who say, `Look, on the surface it does not seem to be much: serious damage to property could be when a vehicle is your own possession and someone destroys it,' we would say, `Not so. This has to be looked at in the whole context of the legislation.' It is in that context of the amendment, especially moved by the opposition, that the reasonable likelihood of the death of a person or serious injury to a person is considered. For those reasons, the government would commend the amendment to the opposition and other senators. It appreciates the constructive approach that the opposition has adopted in this regard. Once again, we would ask other senators to consider supporting us. I therefore move:

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, there we have it! What the government now says is this: we want to cover here all possible scenarios—nothing outside the limits on when this government or some future government can bring in the troops in a political situation where so-called dissidents, according to the manual, are disagreeing with the government of the day. On top of Labor's sell-out clause—which talks of any threat of serious injury to a person when the politicians have already sent out the troops—the commander in the field can order the troops to take violent action against those who, it is presumed, may cause or occasion serious injury. We are talking here not about the government and its actions; we are talking about the situation for the commander of the defence forces. All he or she has to do is to ascertain in their mind that there is a likelihood of death or serious injury to persons, under the Labor amendment. 
Chair, I will not tempt you by asking you, but who here on the Labor benches will name a great strike of the last century or a great civil protest in which that situation did not pertain and could not be countenanced by a military officer? I will tell you that no-one will get up and answer that question because, as Senator Ellison has just told the chamber, this legislation aims now to cover all possible scenarios in the future—all protest situations and all strike situations—and Labor is feeding that option to the government.
This is a further remarkable derogation of the duty, I believe, of the government and the opposition to uphold the spirit of the Constitution, but it is also an opening of the doors to the abuse of proper practice by a future government against the citizens of Australia. On top of the option that the Labor Party brings in, the government brings in the garden gnome option, which is that, if there is a risk of serious damage to property and somebody is going to attack your property—there is a `risk' of it; it does not have to happen—call in the Army. This is incredible. While I might tempt the government to believe it has been misunderstood, it is not. We are dissecting this legislation not only for what it is but for what the government intends it to be. In this, the opposition has become a fellow traveller.
If you believe that the Australian people want this legislation available so that politicians, having brought out the armed forces, can then give to the chief of those forces the option of sending the troops in against peaceful protesters or strikers—because they believe that there could be the threat of serious injury to persons or to property—you are wrong. You are wrong. The government is being shepherded by the opposition, and the opposition is taking this opportunity on the eve of the Olympics, knowing that the public is not aware of what is going on here.
I challenge you again to name which of the great strikes of the last century, or which of the great civil protests of the last century, were indemnified against the risk of serious injury to people or property. None of them. So all of them could have become—and will become, if replayed in the future in some other parallel or analogous way—the opportunity to send in the troops. We have to say this yet again: if this were legislation against terrorists and were confined to that, it would be a different debate: I have no problem with that. But this is legislation which opens the door to politicians in Canberra bringing out the troops against Australians who protest. The word in the Army manual is `dissident'. The Oxford Dictionary definition is that a dissident is somebody who disagrees with the government. The government and the opposition might sit there and say `Oh, but we'd never do that.' If you would never do that, then support the amendment that says that you cannot do it. I think Senator Harris has an amendment coming up in a moment that will effectively do that—and we will see how you vote.
The government's added amendment to Labor's amendment—both amendments frittering away all the safeguards, all the checks that are supposed to be in this legislation—somehow really gets around to what is at the heart of this matter, and that is the defence of property. In a century of inordinate and gross wealth and the taking of property by the minority against the interests of the majority, we have the situation on this planet where three people have more wealth than 600 million others. We have the situation in this country where the gap between the haves and the have-nots grows bigger every day—under this government's policies and under the previous government's policies.
Laws are there to protect property, and they are becoming harsher all the time in defence of property against rights. This law has become an enormous erosion of rights in the interests of the property of the few. So the government says, `Send in the troops if there's a risk of damage to property'—not in the view of some august, independent authority, not in the view of the Governor-General anymore, not even in the view of the three ministers who allow the troops to be called out, but in the view of a field officer in charge. I ask you: is the trampling of gardens serious damage to property? Is the crashing of cars chased by police, or otherwise, not serious damage to property? Is the knocking down of barricades through crowd panic, or whatever, not serious damage to property? Is the possibility that all those things could happen not a serious threat of damage to property? Of course they all are. This is `throw all caution to the wind' stuff. I cannot help but believe that behind it there is an inherent, if not a worked out, strategy that the government will put this up so that the opposition's amendment will not seem too bad after all. 
The opposition's amendment is heinous if you look at what it does to the concept that we are a freedom loving country, that we respect authority, that we respect the police for keeping the domestic peace and that we respect our armed services for defending us from outside aggression. This bill is all about blurring those lines. At the end of it, we find that it is because the government—and I quote Senator Ellison—`wants to cover all possible scenarios' in the defence of property. That is what we have come to with this legislation. This is an incredible night in terms of legislation that is not only, I submit, in breach of at least the spirit of the Constitution but also an affront to the values of Australia.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-09-04,"—I want to address some of the remarks made by the minister. I think he was just plain wrong, and I believe that that should be drawn to the attention of this chamber. Then I do not want to talk about hypothetical situations but I want to give you a bit of history, particularly of Queensland and how these kinds of laws have been applied against Queenslanders—and not so that the army could be called out. They have been applied in such a way by the authorities that, had the army been called out, we would have seen serious loss of life and serious injury to people. But, in this instance, it would be injury to protesters—and that is what I am worried about.
The minister seemed to be saying that this amendment about serious damage to property had to be taken in concert with the rest of the bill. He then gave the illustration that the Labor amendment about death or serious injury to persons had to be taken together with serious damage to property. But that is not what the amendments say. They are alternatives. There is no sense in which they are to be held together; they are alternatives. So it is in the case of death, or in the case of serious injury, or in the case of serious damage to property. They are not to be taken together; they are alternatives to one another.
Let me then give you a few illustrations from reality. I go back to the late 1970s in the time of the Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland when we had a `right to march' law. I have to say to you that there was serious damage all right—to both property and people—and injury. But it was damage that was caused by the police and their activities. Nevertheless, had Bjelke-Petersen had an army, I think the serious injury to people and the serious damage to property would certainly have been much more serious.
Let me tell you what happened in the end. The law was used in a ridiculous way. We had a group of Christians called `Concerned Christians'. One of our members who lived in Bundaberg, a rural town in Queensland, applied for a march permit to march at 3 a.m. with his dog through a cane field, and that was refused. That is the extreme to which laws can be taken in these kinds of situations. I do not think I will invite the minister to comment, but let me place on the record that in another series of protests during the Bjelke-Petersen years there was very serious industrial action taken by workers of the South East Queensland Electricity Board, SEQEB, which resulted in about two weeks of very serious unrest in Queensland. I attended a number of the pickets at the time. There was one instance where some workers were trying to gain access to the electricity board's property. One of the protesters placed a large rock on the road and a worker drove over the top of it and seriously damaged the underneath of his car. That caused great consternation. Again, I would suggest to you that, in these kinds of situations, that would certainly be regarded by authorities in that place as serious damage to property. 
I suppose the most ridiculous situation was when, as a group of concerned Christians, we had a cross that we took to a number of the pickets. We used to erect it and stand by it. Finally, the police were so threatened—particularly the Premier, who was himself a Christian and was most angry at Christians protesting against him—that at the end of one of the protests the cross was `arrested' and `taken into custody'. We asked the police what the charge was. They said, `It's a dangerous weapon, and we believe that you may threaten us with it.' That again illustrates the kinds of situations which come into play in these kinds of protests—or at least they do in Queensland; it may be different in other states.
So I am not reassured by the minister. He is saying that such action would be taken only in very serious and extreme circumstances. I have to tell you that in some of these protests extreme circumstances can occur very quickly indeed. If my experience during the premiership of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen is anything to go by, extreme circumstances can even be quite ridiculous but they can escalate. The thought that the Premier of Queensland could have had troops to assist him in his putting down of industrial disputes and other protests in those days fills me with very serious dread.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-09-04,"—Swirling about me and about those who are opposed to this bill are the emotion and the history of our peoples, and it is to history that we need to turn in our fear of excessive discretion and excessive authority. In our blood is the memory of the Black and Tans. In our blood is the memory of all those who have abused power and who, at the time of taking it, said, `You can trust us. It will be all right.'
There is a sense of horror amongst us at what is contemplated with these wide discretions, and I struggle when I look in the face of the minister, whom I regard as a decent man, to know what values drive the government's support for a bill which infringes on liberties to such an extent. I wonder whether we are confronted again with what Malcolm Fraser so recently advised us was a great divide, and that is the divide between conservatism and liberalism. For me, liberalism—and our counterparts in England are Liberal Democrats—is about freedoms which protect the individual. Conservatism is about property and money. What I see in this amendment is a Tory attachment to property over people, not a liberal attachment to people over property. It worries me, and it worries me when I look in the faces of my Labor colleagues, many of whom I regard as decent men and women of integrity, that they are still approaching this bill with far too much trust.
This amendment to me is typical. The discretion and the authority that the amendment seeks to grant within the ambit of a bill with extraordinarily wide discretion and authority are self-evidently apparent. The bill refers to `serious damage to property'. Why is the property not qualified in law? It is not qualified in the definition and the interpretation. It is not qualified in the amendment. Why is it qualified only in the words of the minister? If the minister were able to find a qualification which said that what they were referring to in `serious damage to property' was perhaps a power plant or the destruction of a 30-storey skyscraper in a crowded city, we could all understand that. But look where the qualification is. The qualification is to `damage', not to `property'. The adjective is `serious' damage.
What about a substation and not a power plant? That is serious damage. What about a bungalow and not a 30-storey building? That is serious damage. But, in property terms, that is a police matter. If you are talking about property in the major, significant sense, you have to qualify it if you are ever going to get away with this. If you are not talking about that, you are expressing—through your amendments—the real value that applies, which is that you want the widest discretion of all, because this is a conservative agenda and its primary object is property. If you trample on the freedoms of the individual, if you affront the values and the protections we cherish in this country and if you oppose the memory of the history that runs through the blood of all our peoples, you do us an injustice. I do not think you truly understand why a small group of people—the cross-party benches, in particular, but also the Labor Party, on certain issues—feel so strongly about this bill. It infringes every element that we should value. It is an emotional issue for us. 
If you want to get the conservative coalition—not the liberal coalition—excited, talk to them about owning a company. Talk to them about owning Telstra or something. They will appear, the passion will rise and they will flood the room with excitement and joy. Why? Because it is about property and money. Here, we are talking about something possibly falling into the hands of the wrong government—not into the hands of Minister Ellison, whom I judge to be a man of decency. In the hands of the wrong people, bad laws come with bad consequences; that is the point Senator Woodley was making. That is why he outlined those ridiculous examples. Everybody says, `It can't occur.' It has occurred in this country, under certain laws and circumstances, and it has occurred in many other countries.
That is the basis of our opposition. You present us with a simple amendment which, to me, just exposes the appalling values at the base of this. It is why there is a sense of horror amongst us—because you are affecting our liberties. The heart of my appeal to you, Senator Faulkner, is to turn down this bill. Nothing that has come through so far is going to result in the unnecessarily wide discretion being limited to protect our peoples. None of us is opposed to the bill in its intent. If you want to sort out terrorism, we are with you. If you want to prevent damage to a power plant, we are with you. If you want us to support something which allows you to call out the troops without consent and where it might affect a substation and not a power plant, we are against you. It is a matter of degree. We will oppose this amendment, but we are still, at heart, distraught by the values which are coming through in this bill. I do not think sufficient numbers of people yet understand the dangers attached.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Senator Murray has been talking about history, and that is a fair thing to look at when looking at a bill like this. It is something that the courts take into account when they are looking at issues—as the minister would know, from a statement of Justice Dixon in the case of the Australian Communist Party v. the Commonwealth, where the issue of Defence powers was much considered and where the great man said:
Just as courts may use the general facts of history as ascertained or ascertainable from the accepted writings of serious historians ... and employ the common knowledge of educated men upon many matters and for verification refer to standard works of literature and the like ... so we may rely upon a knowledge of the general nature and development of the accepted tenets or doctrines of communism ...
History is a matter to look at, as Senator Murray has said. As you would realise, the expression `or serious damage to property' is an expression that you might find in a summary offences act, so I can understand the problems that arise. I might just talk about the Australian Communist Party v. the Commonwealth case, which was decided in 1951, as Mr Dabb would remember. It gives me the occasion to refer to a person who played a major part in that. I do not refer to Dr Evatt; I refer to Mr Ted Laurie. Mr Laurie was, amongst other things, junior to Fred Paterson, who was badly injured by the police in a march on St Patrick's Day. That happened in 1948—unfortunately, in a way, a time I can remember.
The Communist Party Dissolution Act went through parliament in 1950. It was taken to the High Court, and it was thought that the High Court would uphold it. The tactic was to use the High Court as a forum for protesting about the evils of the act and how it was a dreadful thing to try to disband a political party in Australia—the first time it had been tried. Fortunately, it was not successful. Ted Laurie was telling me that, when the people went in there, they quickly detected that the High Court was taking it very seriously. So, instead of making a statement and using the court as a forum, they argued it, and they argued it successfully. The only person that held against them was Justice Latham. He was a great advocate, as you know—gone to God, as have all the great advocates involved in that case. They were the days—I hope there are still days like this—when people like Ted Laurie proclaimed as lawyers the great values of life, and I think they are still there. He was a most honourable man, and I would like to place that on record now and then get back to the amendments.  
I am trying to think what Ted Laurie, Dr Evatt, Fred Paterson, or Maurie Ashkanasy, who was in that case, would say. I think they would say that they were somewhat concerned about the breadth of the statement or `serious damage to property'. It is almost inconsistent with the first part of the amendment. If the amendment is carried without the added amendment, it would read:
In utilising the defence forces in accordance with section 51D, the Chief of the Defence Force must not: 
(a) stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of—
and nobody wants to see death—
or serious injury to, persons ...
and people can understand that. But adding `or serious damage to property' seems to, as it were, reduce the weight of the earlier part of the proposed amendment. These are matters to be concerned about, as other speakers have said.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—For clarification, has the temporary chairman ruled that the minister has moved the amendment circulated in his name?
 (Senator Murphy)—That is correct.
—A further clarification: will the temporary chairman put the government's amendment before the opposition's amendment?
—That is correct.
—I have spoken earlier in relation to the original opposition amendment, and I am now speaking to it. It reads: `stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action'. By moving that amendment, the opposition is very clearly and very succinctly saying that the defence forces cannot be called out in those circumstances. We have had a general watering down of the original amendment to take into account `except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons'. Now we are debating the government's amendment on top of that, which includes `or serious damage to property'.
I believe that adequate facilities are in place for the government to call upon without having to involve the Defence Force in this level of dispute or action. It causes me concern that the government are pushing this issue as hard as they are. If they do not intend to call out the Army in these cases, why are they insisting on these provisions in the bill—that the Army can be called out for damage to property? I go back to the earlier issue of `the likelihood of'. Proposed section 51A(1)(a) states the condition that `domestic violence is occurring or is likely to occur'. There is absolutely no condition that would restrict the government in the amendment that they are proposing. There is nothing in the wording of proposed section 51A that could prevent the government or the Governor-General from calling out the army.
Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I will ask a question directly to the minister: in the light of the government amendment being accepted, will the Commonwealth minister be able to call out the Australian Defence Force if there is damage to property, against the wishes of the state? In a situation where the state has clearly indicated—or even if they have not—that they do not want the ADF called out, will the Governor-General or one of the three Commonwealth ministers be able to call out the ADF in the case of damage to property, against the wishes of the state?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—Just before Senator Faulkner speaks on this can I just clarify a few points. Firstly, Senator Brown said this is a situation where the government is widening things to say we have to cater for any possible scenario. Legislation, by its very nature, has some form of prognostication, of looking to the future, of looking at what might arise and what might not. What we are looking at here is circumstances which might arise—but hopefully never. What we are doing is putting forward a bill which has to cover these sorts of circumstances—albeit within the very restricted operation of this bill, albeit within the very restrictions which act upon the call-out, which act upon those people who may be called out; the restrictions which impose upon their behaviour. That is what I was saying when I said that we look to the possible scenarios which might occur. It is not a situation of a willy-nilly call-out. 
Senator Woodley said that I had said that these provisions have to be read in concert. But what I said was this: that possibility of death or injury to people might be entwined with serious damage to property. That is obvious. But there may also be the occasion where there is no threat of death to persons where you have serious damage to property on a grand scale, as I said. I said `on a grand scale'. I am talking about a situation where you have widespread damage to property; it is not just one individual's item of property. I would say to Senator Murray that we are not talking in terms of Tory values of property; we are talking in terms of property which is to the mutual benefit of the community—things like power stations, buildings, public facilities; things like widespread damage to residential areas. I cited this very instance in the case of Timor, quite tragically, where there was damage to property which did not go hand-in-hand with death or injury.
—This is not East Timor.
—I cite this as an example, Senator Brown, because we thankfully have not got any examples to rely on in Australia, and hopefully we never will. What I am saying is that we are talking about property—
—This is why people are asking the questions: because the examples don't exist. That's a reasonable point to make, isn't it?
—The fact is that we have to look to the future of possibility and, as Senator Faulkner says, there has not been an example in Australia. He is quite right, and the question is quite properly put. At the same time, because something has never happened does not mean to say that legislators do not have to cater for the potential occurrence of that. When we come to this chamber with legislation we have to look at its operation in years to come—not just next year, and not in a vacuum, and not on the basis that there has never been an example. What senators who have commented on this are overlooking is that to call out you need—and I go back to the very words in the bill that I used when I cited this previously—a situation where the state or territory `is not, or is unlikely to be, able to protect itself against the domestic violence; that is, the state is incapable of coping with a situation. That is quite an extraordinary situation. It is not just a protest, it is not just damaging an item of property; you firstly have to get over that hurdle that the state or territory cannot itself deal with the situation. That is a huge qualification. 
—You've removed that provision.
—That is not being removed. That is squarely in the bill. You can only have your call-out if there is a situation where the state or territory is not able to cope with the situation itself—an extraordinary circumstance. Senator Brown referred to demonstrations in the last century. What we had was demonstrations which did not fit this bill at all, because they were situations where the state or territory was able to cope with the situation, where we had large peaceful demonstrations which did not pose any problem at all to the governance of the states or territories where they occurred. That is why this bill would be not able to be brought into operation in those circumstances; because none of those protests could come near to meeting the requirements of this bill, because the requirements of this bill are so strenuous. The high jump bar is set so high that you would need to have this extreme situation before you could have a call-out. And when you do have a call-out there are these provisos which operate. 
This serious damage to property is in that context—such a damage to property that the state or territory could not cope with it, a widespread destruction. It follows from the very operation of how the call-out happens—that is, there is domestic violence of such a nature that the state or territory cannot cope. What we are looking at is serious damage to property that the state or territory cannot cope with. It is not just burning a couple of vehicles; it is destruction on a scale which cannot be dealt with by the state or territory concerned. That is why I said it had to be read in conjunction with the act and those other provisions.
Senator Woodley misunderstood that, because he thought that I was saying that it had to go hand in hand with death or injury, or the possibility thereof. Of course, in most cases it would, but what we are catering for is where you might get a scale of destruction which does not have that death or likely injury entwined in it—for instance, an area which has been evacuated where there is wholesale destruction, an area where perhaps public buildings are being damaged on a grand scale and the police force of that state or territory cannot cope. They may well have evacuated the area. They may well have it contained, but they cannot contain the destruction that is taking place. That is the scale we are talking about here. It is only for the common good to have that sort of control in that sort of extreme situation. It is not based on Tory principles of property. I respect very much the comments Senator Murray makes. He always makes a useful contribution, especially when it goes to things such as personal liberties. But what we are envisaging here is such a draconian circumstance, such a dire circumstance, that the state or territory cannot cope. It is only then that you look at these provisions, with the qualifications they have. And in some part those have been brought in by the amendment that Senator Faulkner has been talking about.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I would like to follow up a good point that has been made by Senator Murray. I think it is the same point that Senator Brown has been pursuing, albeit perhaps through the disorderly mechanism of interjection. The committee deserves a very clear response from the minister, and that is certainly important as far as the opposition is concerned. I know my colleagues the shadow minister for defence and the shadow Attorney-General are giving serious consideration to what they hear in this committee stage debate. I think the point that my colleagues in the chamber have made to the government is that an ordinary person's definition of `serious damage to property' varies quite greatly. There are very different views—it is in the eye of the beholder.
For some, serious damage to property might be breaking some windows or damaging cars; for others, it might be knocking over the side fence or damaging the doors of Parliament House or hurling bricks through plate glass windows or very serious damage to infrastructure, and so on. The question that is asked by senators in the chamber—and one that I would like to ask so we can get a very clear response on the Hansard record, which is important from the perspective of the Labor Party—is: what precisely is the government's definition of `serious damage to property'? I think it might assist the committee, given that the government is moving this amendment to the opposition amendment, if we could have a clear response to that question from the minister, and I might follow through. I think that would assist the committee, and I ask the minister that question accordingly.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—As I said previously, serious damage to property cannot be taken in isolation for the reasons Senator Faulkner has outlined. It varies from person to person. I mentioned previously the example of a motor vehicle that someone might have as their only possession, and damage to that would be very serious indeed. We have here a situation where serious damage to property constitutes damage on such a scale as for a government, such as a state or territory government, not to be able to handle the damage involved. Again I go back to the bill and say that it is where a government is unable to protect itself against such domestic violence. Let us carry that through to serious damage to property. It is where the government concerned, being a state or territory government, is unable to protect itself from serious damage to property. We have here damage on such a scale that it meets the requirements of the call-out. It has to be damage which is public in nature. When I say `public', it has to be across the board—that is, it has to be something which affects the community and damage of such a nature that it poses a threat to government good order in the place where it is occurring. 
So it is serious damage to property on a public scale. It is not something which happens in isolation or privately or which affects one person's particular goods; it is something which occurs in the community and which affects the community. That is the sort of serious damage to property we are talking about. It is not just affecting one person's item of property; it is affecting the community at large. That is the sort of scale you have to look at in this regard. It is in the context of the bill that it has to be of that nature because, if it was occurring only as an isolated case or affecting only one person, it would hardly be likely to be beyond the control of the state or territory government.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—There are a number of questions I would like to ask the minister to get some clarity on this. I will come back to this question of the definition of `serious damage to property'. In fact I am minded now to ask the minister for a definition of `property', but we may come back to that. Let me, however, ask this question, Minister—and I think it is an important one for the committee: is there any reason why a definition could not be included in the bill itself?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—While the minister is looking into that matter, let me say that I find it extraordinary that Labor is entertaining this amendment. Let me go back to what the minister has just had to say. First of all, he has got his own amendment wrong. He has got the pattern of events wrong and he does not understand his own legislation. The minister is saying that this situation would apply only where a state police force has been overrun and where there is serious damage and it is getting out of hand. No, that is not the case. That decision has already been made, whether or not the states like it, by a triumvirate of federal ministers who have called out the troops. What we are dealing with here—and let me remind the minister of this—is not any longer a judgment by state police, state authorities or federal ministers. We are dealing with section 51G, which states:
In utilising the Defence Force in accordance with section 51D—
the troops are out there—
the Chief of the Defence Force must not:
(a) stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action, except where there is a reasonable likelihood of the death of, or serious injury to, persons; or 
(b) serious damage to property.
So we are dealing here with a clause which empowers the Chief of the Defence Force to determine in his or her mind whether there will damage to property. I say to the Labor Party that it is no longer a matter of serious threat of injury or death; the word is `or' damage to property.
—We understand that, Senator Brown.
—The Labor Party understands it, but it is now entertaining the situation where troops can be sent in against it.
—Senator, you said a little while ago that interjections were disorderly, so I will ignore yours. What I am saying is that the Labor Party is seriously entertaining an amendment here which is about the Chief of the Defence Force being able to send in armed troops, with the ability to shoot to kill, against an Australian crowd because he believes there is a threat of serious damage to property. It is almost as if the police no longer exist. As Senator Murray said, this is the wording you will find in a summary offences bill or in a criminal code in a state. But that has been taken out of the equation now. This is a group of federal politicians using the armed services as a police force at their behest and empowering the Chief of the Defence Force to move in against civilians because he or she thinks there is a threat to property. As Senator Ellison said, `What we want to cover here is all possible scenarios,' and this does cover all possible scenarios. There is no definition, and there will be no definition. Even if there were definitions, we would still be left with a situation where the opposition is entertaining a definition of what is serious damage to property as a reason to allow a troop commander to send in the troops. It is extraordinary stuff. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—I would like to go back to the minister's comment during this last portion of the debate. He emphasised—twice, I believe—the words: in the situation of serious damage to property, we have to get to where the state cannot cope. The minister is clearly indicating that the situation where troops would be brought in is when the Commonwealth has made the decision that the state cannot cope. The minister also went on to say that they want to protect property. So this debate has all of a sudden made a right-hand turn. The essence of the bill is supposed to be for the Commonwealth to protect Commonwealth property. All of a sudden, the minister is telling us that the Commonwealth will, in its own mind, assess where the state cannot cope.
I come back to my earlier question to the minister: in this situation where the Commonwealth have moved their amendment to Labor's amendment No. R3, will the minister give us an assurance that the three ministers who have the power to order the troops or, as I pointed out earlier on, the officer—whoever that may be—on the ground at the time, will not use that power if the state has not asked for it to be used, and will the minister clarify very clearly that the power most definitely will not be used if the state objects?
 (Senator Lightfoot)—The question is that Senator Ellison's amendment to opposition amendment R3 be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—It is obvious that the minister is not going to clarify for us the government's proposed amendment to Labor's R3 in relation to serious damage to property. By the minister not giving us a clear indication, there can be only one conclusion: that the government does intend to bring the troops out in instances where the state objects.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—I am advised in relation to Senator Harris's point that, where there is a Commonwealth call-out dealing with Commonwealth interests, the objection of the state is different from the situation where there is a call-out by the state. In the latter case, if the state objected—and you are talking in the context of serious damage to property—the ADF could not act. The situation is, however, different in the case of a Commonwealth call-out where there is a Commonwealth interest at stake. I add one point: in both cases you need a request by the state so to act. I think that that assists you even further; that is, in the case both of a Commonwealth call-out and a state call-out, you need a request by the state for the ADF so to act in accordance with the problem at hand, and we are talking here about serious damage to property.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,—I wonder if the minister could now formally indicate to the committee why a definition cannot be included in the bill itself.,SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—The government believes that, in the context of the bill and in the way that serious damage to property is contained in the opposition amendment, an amendment would serve to confuse matters even more, because you could well have a situation where a definition—we have this had before during the debate in this committee stage in relation to the definition of `domestic violence' proposed by Senator Brown—really might do it an injustice. The best and appropriate way to define serious damage to property is as it occurs in the context of the bill; that is, having regard to the basis of a call-out being that the state or territory is unable to protect itself against the domestic violence at hand, and in that would be the serious damage which is being contemplated by this amendment. So what I have said basically before stands: it would have to be serious damage of such a public nature that the state or territory cannot protect itself from it. But the government believe that, if we constrain that by a definition, we could run into more problems instead of solving them. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I assume that in the new call-out manual, which the minister indicated to us at an earlier stage in the committee debate will replace the Manual of Land Warfare—we do understand that that is the situation—there will need to be some form of guidance or definition to provide the appropriate guidance to field commanders who might find themselves in a situation contemplated by the bill. I assume that is a reasonable conclusion to come to; I do not know; I would like to hear from the minister on this point. But if that is a reasonable assumption, I wonder how it fits with the advice in relation to a capacity for this to be defined further in the bill itself. Could the minister give the committee some information in relation to the implications of guidance in the call-out manual on the issue that I raised in relation to further defining this issue in the bill?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—The point that Senator Faulkner makes is a valid one. There is the manual that we will be looking at to replace the Manual of Land Warfare that we have been discussing. I would say that two things must be remembered. Firstly, what we have in proposed section 51F entitled `Assistance to, and cooperation with, State' is the situation where the state tasks the ADF with a mission, if you like, or with a job to be done. What would be contained in the manual would be a provision which says, `You would have to relate your activity to the task which has been requested of you by the state or territory authority.' That is the first aspect to it.
I envisage that the manual would then go on to deal with what sort of serious damage would be contemplated and how to deal with that, saying that the force must be reasonable and necessary, as is contained in proposed section 51D, which I mentioned earlier; for instance, in cordoning off an area, ensuring that people did not enter an area where there were buildings ablaze where the force was necessary to bar public entry. You might have people wanting to rush in and retrieve goods from their homes, and the forces would be saying, `No, you can't go there, it is too dangerous.' That would be one aspect of how to deal with the serious damage to property. So you would have to ask, firstly: what is the task under 51F that you have to look at that has been requested of you by the state; secondly, how do you deal with this? The force has to be necessary and reasonable. 
Then the third aspect is the sort of damage that might be contemplated, and that is more relevant to the question asked by Senator Faulkner. It would touch on the sort of widespread damage that I have been talking of—if the neighbourhood is ablaze, if the power plant is ablaze or if there are explosions taking place. So there would be three aspects you could envisage the manual touching on: the extent of the damage, the behaviour that could well be required to be reasonable and necessary under proposed section 51D; and, importantly, the task which is being requested by the police under proposed section 51F. That is important because it really is quite a limiting factor. Let us look at what proposed section 51F says:
... the Chief of the Defence Force must, as far as is reasonably practicable, ensure that:
(a) 	the Defence Force is utilised to assist the State or Territory specified in the order and cooperates with the police force of the State or Territory; and
(b) 	the Defence Force is not utilised for any particular task unless a member of the police force of the State or the Territory specified in the order requests, in writing, that the Defence Force be so utilised.
You have to tie that to the circumstance as well so that, if there is a public utility which is being destroyed, the police force can say, `We can't handle this. This is the request we're making of you. Please contain that area and ensure there's no further damage done.' I have tried to answer Senator Faulkner as comprehensively as I can about what sorts of things the manual might have in relation to serious damage to property. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I thank the minister for trying to answer that question comprehensively. I come back to the second part of my question, which is in relation to a definition in the bill. If this material can be included in the manual in the way you have described, why is it not possible to frame some form of definition in the bill that may in fact get us over this particular hurdle? That is where I am trying to come from, Minister. I hear what you say about the manual, and that gives me greater confidence that it might be possible to frame an appropriate definition for the bill.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Minister, you are absolutely right when you say that the expression `serious damage' has to be looked at in the context of the bill. We are talking about major issues here, and it has to be looked at in that way. Just as the bill puts the phrase in context, so does the phrase affect the bill. Senator Faulkner is quite right: you do need a definition of serious damage to property. If you used the word `catastrophic' instead of `serious', that affects the way you look at all of this. It has to be remembered that the scheme set up under this legislation is the scheme where the executive does all the decision making, and that is normal. The executive runs the Army, in the sense of turning it out and what have you, but I think parliament has to have a serious input into this. The only way it can have a serious input is through such things as definitions. You say that we will have the manual, and no doubt we will, and I am sure the training will be quite strict in all this. But that is not parliamentary action; that is action by the executive, writing the manual and setting out the guidelines. I think what has been asked is: why can't you get a definition, for example, that serious damage means catastrophic damage or that the word `catastrophic' is used where `serious' is now used? If parliament were able to do that, that is an input it has in this very serious business of trying to work out how the Army is to be turned out.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—In answer to the second part of Senator Faulkner's question—and I think the nub of the question is, `If you can put it in a manual, why can't you have a definition?'—of course the manual constitutes general orders for Australian defence forces. Those manuals detail across-the-board behaviour by the ADF in certain circumstances. To contain those sorts of provisions in an act of parliament would be quite burdensome and, the government would contend, impractical. The manual is really like the guidelines which are often made pursuant to a lot of Commonwealth legislation. One that would be familiar to senators is the office guidelines for running your electorate offices pursuant to determinations which are made in the Parliamentary Entitlements Act. What you have further down the chain is this manual which sets out how you run certain things in your electorate offices. Similarly, the defence manual is there for the personnel who are implementing orders, and they are in a more compendious general nature than a tight definition in an act of parliament. Therefore, although you may have descriptions of events and actions required by personnel, that would not really be appropriate for a definition in the definitions section of an act of parliament where you are looking at one or two, or at best several, lines to define something.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-09-04,"—The reality is that we are not talking about running an office here; we are talking about a bloody conflict between armed forces and Australian civilians. That is an entirely different set of circumstances, and that is what you get when you send in the troops. I want to pick Senator Ellison up on something he said 10 minutes ago, because I think he may have misled Senator Harris. In the situation in which the Commonwealth interest is at stake and the troops have been called out, you do not need the authority of the state or the state police to then have the troops employed. The implication from Senator Ellison that that was the case is quite wrong. Let us be clear about this: this legislation in the main, if it is ever used in the situation where we find the armed services of Australia against the unarmed people of Australia, will be used when the `Commonwealth interest' is alleged to be at stake. I do not believe this is going to occur where it is a state interest that is at stake, because the state have their police forces and their tactical response groups and for a century they have been able to cope and for the next century they will be able to cope. This is an evolving situation where the Commonwealth wants to use the armed services as its police force in a situation where property is at stake—a very, very different matter.  
I would counsel the opposition strenuously against supporting this amendment from the government. I am opposed to the opposition's amendment. We should be making it clear that this legislation is wrong and that there should be no circumstances in which the commander of the armed forces could stop or restrict any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action in this country. That is not the place for the armed forces to be used. We have heard good debate about that all the way through here. There is a philosophical gap that has opened between the crossbenches and the rest of the Senate in this matter, and it is not going to be closed by further debate on the matter. We cannot state it any more strongly. It has been put as vigorously and strongly as it can. However, I cannot believe that the opposition would entertain this amendment which allows the armed services chief in the field to use guns against civilians on the pretext or on the belief that property damage is likely to occur.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—I must clear up one thing—that is, I did not belittle or in any way seek to lessen the severity or seriousness of what we are debating here by using the manual under the entitlements act as an example. So for any senator to say that I was is seriously misleading the Senate about what I was saying. I merely used an example of something which I thought senators would be well acquainted with to show how a manual might work vis-a-vis the legislation we are talking about. There are other more serious examples in existence that could be used. Through the chair to Senator Brown, in no way was I saying that this is similar in substance; of course it is not, and it would be absolutely ridiculous to suggest that. What I was saying was that in process and operation there is a similarity between a piece of legislation which may then have a manual and regulations which follow which operate pursuant to it, and they are expressed, particularly a manual, in very different terms. That is what I was saying, through the chair to Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I accept Senator Ellison's last point. But I think that illustration can be looked at in another way. I think what has been said is that parliament should have an input into the rules. Take the example that you gave about the regulations or the guidelines for electorate offices regarding postage and what have you. There is no direct input by parliament there. I think that illustration was a very good one. I think what is being said is that parliament, given the catastrophic events that might follow this legislation, should almost write the manual. It clearly cannot do that completely, but it could do a lot more than it is presently doing. Indeed, Senator Faulkner's amendment goes to that point. This is a direction given to the officer in the field as to what he or she might not do. There is great scope to take that further. 
Even more alarming than that is the issue about `serious damage' to property. Serious damage to property in some context could be damaging the front wheel of a bicycle. Clearly, in the context of this legislation, that would not be—let's hope it would not be—the occasion for the Army to come in on the attack. A threat to blow up an atomic station would clearly be a situation you would want the Army to do something about. Then we get to the proverbial issue of when it is suitable for the Army to come in and when it is suitable for the Army to stay out. As the legislation now stands, that decision has been left to the military commander in the field. At least the guidelines for electorate offices are written in such a way that we know specifically what we can and cannot do. But the officer in the field—and I think this is the point that Senator Brown has made again and again—has got no guidance at all about a situation which could bring death and destruction to people. That is a very serious matter, and I do not think it has been satisfactorily dealt with yet. ",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—I apologise to Senator Cooney if I have misunderstood what he has said. If I can put it this way: the manual would have to reflect the intention of parliament in the passing of this bill. There is no question of that. The manual could not be used to do something else. I think that might allay some concerns. The problem is though that this manual is detailed; it looks at the carrying out of orders; and it constitutes general orders for the Australian Defence Force. So these general orders as such are appropriately contained in the manual; they should not be contained in an act of parliament.
This manual, which will be rewritten insofar as it is affected by the passage of this legislation, is something which really describes the appropriate carrying out of orders and how the Defence Force should act. I think, in that circumstance, it is a public document where security provisions are not infringed. I have already said that those matters dealing with division 3 are going to be made public, so there is that aspect to it. It will reflect the parliamentary intention with the passing of this bill. And it will have to be couched in terms that ADF personnel can readily understand and follow. I do not know whether that answers or addresses entirely the concerns of Senator Cooney. If it does not, no doubt he will put me right.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Thank you, Senator Ellison, for that answer. I understand what has been said about the general orders. If the Army was fighting overseas, then I think that the scheme you have set out is the sort of thing that we would want. In other words, the Army should be able to very much run its own show—if I can use that expression—when it is defending our shores. But I think there is a big jump—and this is a point that has been made again and again—when on shore, as it were, the Army, specifically modelled for a particular task, is brought out for this purpose. This is the sort of great constitutional issue which was fought in the 17th century—I am going very much by memory now. The contest between parliament and the king—
—Do you remember the 17th century?
—My father told me about it! Remember, it was Charles I that raised 8,000 men on the pretence that he was going to use them overseas or against the Scots. Senator Mackay, they were giving the Scots a very bad time, but the good Presbyterian Scots won in the end. There was a great reaction to that. When the Bill of Rights was passed, the parliament was put very much into the picture. I do not think that you could get a standing army without the right of parliament, and certainly parliament would not let the troops be used against anybody except rioters. As the Clerk, Mr Harry Evans, said the other day, the rioters were really the papists. That is probably the reason why I have a great objection to this bill, when it is all said and done. Senator Mackay, being a Scot, I do not know whether or not you have a Presbyterian background, but if you do, you could look at this with much more ease. But having a papist background, I have some concerns about this bill. Is it going to be used against the papist rioters outside St Patrick's Cathedral? I do not know. Be that as it may, I think that, if you are going to use it against the papists or anybody else, the papists ought to know about it. It ought to be in the act so they can read it.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I do not think the bill discriminates, Senator Cooney.
—Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. You have relieved my mind. I have not got the bill here; I left it in my room. You have helped me on that point—it does not discriminate against papists, and that is a good thing. I think the problem remains that parliament ought to say a lot more about what the Army does within the shores—not without the shores—and for a variety of reasons. Is it going to be used instead of the police? The police are restrained by a number of acts, and we can point to those acts. There is a long tradition of the relationship between the police and the public, which there is not between the Army and the public.
Right throughout this debate—since I have been listening to it, in any event—honourable senators have been saying, `We as a parliament are worried. We would like a little bit more in the act.' And you say—and I can understand, Minister, why you say it, too—that, traditionally, this is the way things go. You say, `Do not worry about the act. It will be in the guidelines, the regulations and the standing orders. We cannot show you those standing orders yet, but you can trust us.' I certainly trust you. I assure everybody here that you are a man of the highest integrity, but we cannot go out to the public and say, `We have agreed to this bill. We have agreed to this expression ""serious damage to property"". We do not really quite know what it means, but you can trust the relevant ministers now and forever into the future. You can trust whoever is in command of the troops at the time, you can trust the Army and you can trust the manual will be right.' They might say to us, `We paid you to do a bit better than this for us.' And they might be right. I do not know whether you can say anything more than you have said about that, but it seems to me that that is the situation. We do not know how the Army is going to act, because it has been very rarely used in Australia. As I said the other day, the Eureka Stockade was the only time that I could find that it had been used together with the police. The question remains: who was worse on that occasion—the police or the Army? 
We have no tradition of this. In a certain sense, this is breaking with tradition by bringing it up now. You say, `It's in the Constitution,' which it is in; and `It's in the act,' which it is in. But it is brought up now, I think, in the context of the Olympics. But Minister Moore and Attorney-General Daryl Williams have written to the Australian a letter which I read and which said that the Olympics are certainly an element, but by no means the principal element. So I think there is legitimate confusion, on the part of those who are objecting to this bill, about what this is all about.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I am coming back to the amendment before us. You have spoken a number of times about the Manual of Land Warfare. As I understand it, you are actually intending to reflect a better definition of what it is that we are currently talking about. I was curious about how that will actually sit: will it sit above or below, in terms of being the primary piece of legislation? Will it be subordinate to the act; and, if it is subordinate to the act, will the current definition as provided hold, or will the Manual of Land Warfare definition that you then rewrite guide or lend itself to the interpretation to allow the provision to be more fully canvassed, Minister?",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—If I could describe it in descending order of things, we have the legislation, then the regulations and then the manual. So most certainly the manual is subordinate to the legislation, and we would be tabling the manual in parliament. The regulations are a step up, if you like, and of course they are disallowable; and we know the provisions that relate to regulations and the disallowance of regulations. Then, in ascending order, you have the legislation which, of course, is the primary source of power. I think that puts it fairly squarely in relation to how this manual sits in the scheme of things.
I might say that the manual, which will need to be reworked, is very much a public document, as I said. There are some security provisions in relation to antiterrorist procedures which understandably are not public, and that is for very good reason: we do not want to foreshadow them to any potential terrorists. We are saying that, in that circumstance, obviously there is a security issue; but in all other respects the manual that I am referring to is a public document and one which will be tabled in the parliament.
I might deal slightly with an aspect of the manual. A manual is something that in these circumstances describes the carrying out of things. It needs to be understood that it relates to how things are to be done, and that constitutes general orders. It does not necessarily take the place of the substance. That is what you find in your legislation and then in the regulations; and finally the manual is basically how they are put into effect. There were some instances which have been cited in the previous debate, and I do not want to go into them again, Senator Brown—through the chair. We have dealt with those at length. But that demonstrates exactly what I am saying in relation to direction of implementation. The instances that Senator Brown referred to, of course, relate to the current manual, which will be replaced on the passing of this bill; that is, those provisions which are relevant to the passing of this bill. 
The government, in proposing this amendment, has thought through and has addressed very carefully this provision dealing with property. I would ask those senators with concerns to reconsider that aspect of it. The government is saying here that there could well be a scenario where there is serious damage to property, damage which is beyond the control of the state or territory and which meets the provisions of a call-out—that is, the state or territory does not have the ability to control it and, under 51F, the police force concerned has asked for a particular task to be met in dealing with serious damage—and the chief of the Defence Force must act with reasonable and necessary force. Then you have a situation where the ADF acts, but only then. So there are all these hurdles which have to be negotiated.
—Where is that in 51A?
—No; in 51F you have it that the Defence Force is not utilised for any particular task unless a member of the police force of the state or territory specified in the order requests in writing that the Defence Force be so utilised.
—You have the situation where 51F applies generally, Senator Brown; but the point you are making in relation to 51A is that there is a way of circumventing, I understand, the provisions of the call-out, whereby the state or territory does not have to—
—That is where the liaison with the police disappears.
—Perhaps you should make your point now and I can address that.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-09-04,"—Can we just go through that again, Minister? Let us use an example. Suppose you have a sergeant or a lieutenant—I suppose a lieutenant would be more likely—charged with using excessive force or charged with an offence and you want to argue through the amendments to the defence legislation. All you would have to show, I suppose, is that the occasion was there for the call-out and that the proper process was gone through: the three ministers concurred in the call-out, you had the request from the state and you had a cordoned off area. Suppose you come right down to it and everything is proved. So you have that situation and you say, `Look, what happened here is that someone threw a match into a haystack.' That would be serious damage, and everything has been satisfied. In other words, I am putting probably the reverse of what you were putting before. You were saying, `Look, if you get to the final act, the act of serious damage to property, then you have to look at that in the light of all these other provisions in the act and, therefore, it will only be the serious bit of property damage that counts.' But I am not sure that you do have to do that.
If you were defending a lieutenant who has been charged, what you would do is show that all the provisions of the act were complied with. Then I think the issue of serious damage would be divorced from the rest. So perhaps a match into a haystack would be sufficient to bring the provisions in so that he would then be acquitted. If you look at it in that way—and I think that is the way you would have to look at it: taking each step at a time and putting the Crown to the proof, in that it has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that this did not happen—then you would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that this was not serious damage to property. I am not too sure that that will give much protection to people who are worried about this.
It has been said throughout this that a soldier could be prosecuted if he or she went beyond the act. But as the act is presently framed, you would have to be pretty unlucky not to get your man or woman off, even if the damage were the sort of thing about which you would think, `I wouldn't call the army out to protect this.' In other words, the army is called out—if I can think aloud again—and all that is established. But, in amongst all these instances that make up the general movement of people, a person may carry out an act which is, to the lieutenant's mind, `serious damage' and therefore he or she shoots or whatever else happens. Yet, when we look at it in the cold light of day, we would say, `This act was never meant for that purpose.' When you look at it in terms of making a defence for a soldier who has gone beyond the pale in what we would estimate is a frolic of his or her own, it might be pretty hard to prove that he or she had done the wrong thing.

"Harris, Sen Len",ON,2000-09-04,"—I would like to come back to the essence of the amendments that we have before us. The government has proposed an amendment relating to serious damage of property. That is an amendment to the opposition's original amendment that would delete (a) from 51G and replace it with the preferred opposition wording relating to restricting `any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action'. Through you, Chair, or the previous chair, I asked for clarification from the minister relating to the process if the states did not wish the ADF to be called out. I believe that the minister then clearly articulated that, as it is set out under 51F, that would be the case.
Could the minister also clarify section 51G(b) for me? That refers to utilising the emergency forces or the reserve forces, unless the minister has consulted with the Chief of the Defence Force and is satisfied that sufficient numbers of the permanent forces are not available. So (b) is talking about an assessment of whether there are sufficient permanent forces or not. I ask whether the minister can give the committee an absolute assurance that, in relation to industrial action, and taking into consideration the government's amendment to also include damage to property, neither the emergency forces nor the reserve forces would be called out in relation to a protest relating to industrial action. Through you, Chair, I will just articulate that again for the minister: the assurance I ask for is clearly directed to the emergency forces or the reserve forces not being called out in relation to any protest, dissent, assembly or industrial action.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-09-04,"—That was quite a convoluted question, which was mainly a statement made by Senator Harris. As I understood it, Senator Harris is querying the use of emergency or reserve forces in relation to the protests as mentioned in 51G(a).
—That is the clarification I am seeking.
—The clarification that Senator Harris is seeking is about what circumstances those reserve or emergency forces would be used in. Is that right?
—That is correct.
—As I understand it, it states that the minister would have to consult firstly with the Chief of the Defence Force and would have to be satisfied that there were insufficient personnel from the regular forces—that is, the permanent forces—to deal with the situation before calling in the emergency forces or reserve forces. However, I will take further instructions on that process and see whether there is anything else to it.",SENATE,<title>DEFENCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (AID TO CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-09-04,"—I have questions in respect of the same thing, Minister. Do we have an emergency force? Where is the emergency force? Who comprises the emergency force?

—I was a member of the Army Reserves myself in the regiment at the University of Western Australia. Regarding their varying capabilities—whether it be in the north of this country or in other areas and whether it be Air Force or Navy—it really does depend on the situation at hand as to whether the reserves might be employed. That is something about which a decision has to be made depending on the circumstances at the time. You could not say, `We're going to call in the reserves willy-nilly.'

You talk about the electric power stations and those sorts of places, but that is not what the act says. The term `serious damage' is going to be left to a court and, if you wanted to prosecute somebody for doing something you say that he or she should not be doing, they would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that that was not serious damage.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-09-04,"—In May I was fortunate enough to be invited to attend a reunion of veterans and relatives at the former Truscott air base on the north Kimberley coast. I would like to inform the Senate of the history of Truscott and some of the events which took place there during the reunion. Truscott air base is located on the Anjo Peninsula of the northern Kimberley region of Western Australia and was named in honour of Squadron Leader `Bluey' Truscott, who met a premature death on 28 March 1943 aged 27 when his Kittyhawk plunged into the waters of the Exmouth Gulf during training manoeuvres while he was escorting a Catalina flying boat. `Bluey' Truscott had previously distinguished himself as an RAAF fighter pilot in Britain and as a squadron leader in Papua. 
Truscott air base played a crucial role in the allied offensive against the Japanese in the Pacific. At the time it was operational, Truscott was shrouded in secrecy. In writing of the history of Truscott, John and Carol Beasy said: 
Former members of units serving at Truscott remembered returning to Darwin to find that most people they spoke to had never heard of a base in the Kimberleys, let alone on the Anjo Peninsula or Truscott ... Often, personnel at Truscott never knew the identity or even existence of neighbouring units ... Photography was strictly forbidden and no one was allowed to own a camera. News of the outside war was also scarce and mostly came as hearsay and innuendo: very little got in and even less got out.
Construction of the airstrip, consisting of a steel metal runway, commenced in early 1944 and was completed by the middle of that year. From July 1944 until October 1945 hundreds of missions were flown from Truscott. The airfield essentially served as a staging base for medium and heavy bombers such as B24 Liberators. The base extended the range of the bombers and afforded crews an opportunity to rest. From Truscott, aircraft could attack the enemy in places such as Java, Timor, Sumatra, Borneo and the Celebes. There were no bombers actually based there; instead, the bombers were located at inland air bases, which were more difficult for the Japanese to attack.
Royal Australian Air Force, Royal Air Force, United States Air Force and Dutch air force units all operated from Truscott. Sixteen RAAF squadrons launched missions from the base during its period of operation, with aircraft including Beauforts, Mitchells, Liberators, Venturas and Catalinas. There were often more than 1,500 personnel stationed at Truscott performing a range of different roles. For example, there was a mobile works squadron, a supply depot company, a signals unit, a survey and design unit, engineers, an anti-aircraft regiment and radar personnel. In 1948 the RAAF abandoned Truscott, and in 1959 the land on which Truscott lies was handed over to the Western Australian government. In 1989 Santos, an oil exploration company, refurbished the strip at Truscott for their own use as a supply base for their rigs in the ocean north of the Truscott base.
This year, on 18 May, a group of veterans and relatives were flown from Kununurra on board an RAAF Caribou to Truscott airfield and were joined late on the Friday afternoon by me, Senator Lightfoot and Barry Haase, the federal member for Kalgoorlie. As the tropical sun set in the western sky a dedication service was held, and a plaque dedicated to the fitters and motor drivers transport crews was fixed to an obelisk which is outside the main building on the base. The plaque complements those already on the obelisk which are dedicated to various categories of servicemen who served at the base during the Second World War. On the next morning, all present gathered before dawn at the wreckage of a Liberator which had crashed fully laden on take-off, killing all on board. Poignantly, the now middle-aged niece of one of the crew, Flight Sergeant Easton, read a memorial poem as the dawn light broke through the gum trees and the bugler of the Norforce detachment played the last post and reveille at the end of two minutes silence.
Indeed, the reunion afforded an opportunity for those present to commemorate the sacrifices of the service men and women throughout the war, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice by laying down their lives in the service of our country. Significantly, Truscott was the location of the final Japanese aeroplane to be shot down over Australian soil. On 20 July 1944, a Japanese Dinah left Timor on a reconaissance mission to photograph significant sites in the Kimberley. The aircraft was detected by the radar station at Truscott, and at 8.45 in the morning the three Spitfire pilots on duty at Truscott were alerted and placed on standby to scramble. A few minutes later the pilots were ordered to take off and, shortly afterwards, the Dinah was shot down.
The reunion at Truscott, although it was very simple and not attended by a great number of people, provided a unique opportunity to meet the Truscott veterans and gain an impression of what it must have been like to serve at this isolated, tropical base in the dark days of the Pacific war when our homeland was under threat of invasion. The weekend is one I will long remember. I would especially like to thank Howard Young of Kununurra, who was involved in organising this event and was responsible for inviting me to join the reunion weekend. The Truscott experience led me to reflect on the importance of our freedom and democratic traditions and of how close we came to losing them within liv-ing memory. It is said that the price of maintain-ing freedom and democracy is eternal vigilance. Surely the lesson of Truscott is that we, the Australians of today, have an obligation to those who fought so valiantly, particularly those who made the ultimate sacrifice, to preserve our freedom and to maintain equal vigilance in the world of today to protect our democratic traditions. It is naive to believe that there are no threats to them in this modern world. ",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Truscott Air Base</title>,Adjournment,19,1
