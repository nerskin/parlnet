I just want to draw attention to the fact that the opposition recommends a minor amendment be made to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1999  which we believe would assuage some of the fears expressed in the committee's hearings by veterans organisations in relation to the proposal by the government to retest 1,750 existing recipients of the invalidity service pension.
We believe that this would be a retrograde step. We propose that those who already have it keep it and that the new test apply to those who want it in the future. We are willing to support the test the government wants. The department estimates that, when the new test applies in the future, at least 600 fewer pensions would be paid over time by the veterans department. We believe that the new test is reasonable, but we think it is unfair and unjust and creates great uncertainty for those 1,750 who already receive the benefit to have to resubmit themselves to a further test. Therefore, we will propose an amendment which we will debate when the bill comes forward. We look forward to that debate, and we have no opposition to the rest of the bill.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-09-30,"—I present the report of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee entitled Jobs for the regions: A report on the inquiry into regional employment and unemployment , together with submissions and Hansard  record of proceedings.

—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The tabling today of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee's report into employment and unemployment in regional Australia represents a major study into Australia's regional economies and the employment prospects for regional Australians. This inquiry was first referred to the committee on 4 December 1997. Progress was interrupted by the 1998 election and the committee's involvement in the inquiry into a new tax system held earlier this year. As the inquiry has extended over two parliaments, there have been changes to the committee membership over that time.
The committee received 224 submissions and conducted 22 public hearings in regional Australia, covering all states. We visited many regional areas as diverse as Broken Hill, Burnie and Whyalla and many more between April and December 1998. Its deliberations provide a useful snapshot of the zeitgeist of regional Australia in the aftermath of two federal budgets—1996 and 1997—that saw widespread cutbacks on regional programs.
The report, titled Jobs for the regions, highlights the importance of regional communities and the need for the Commonwealth to take a leading role in policies designed to develop regional economies. This consultation 
 revealed the seriousness of the problems in regional Australia. It also highlighted the need for government to listen to regional Australians.
The anger expressed by regional Victorians is not something new, nor is it limited simply to Victoria. Regional Australians have valid concerns and fears, and they have sent a very clear message to this government. Governments around the country—particularly the federal government—have been ignoring these concerns and fears for far too long. Governments have known about these problems and have simply chosen to ignore them.
This report, the first major Senate report on regional Australia handed down since the Victorian election on 18 September 1999, lays down an important framework for action. It is imperative that the government acts on the findings and recommendations of the report. As I mentioned, extensive consultations were undertaken throughout regional Australia. The findings of this report provide a good insight into the impact of cuts to service provision and the rationalisation of Commonwealth government programs. The findings also highlight the need for a more consistent and integrated strategy to tackling regional development issues.
I would like to draw briefly on some of the main findings of the report. This did not involve the imposition of regional structures from the outside, like past Commonwealth and state government programs. Many of the witnesses who spoke to the committee called for greater coordination between state and Commonwealth programs, with a common sense of purpose. Commonality of purpose would go a long way to providing policy stability and funding continuity, not to mention increasing the coordination between levels of government in addressing regional development issues. In developing coordination, the Commonwealth clearly has a leading role to play.
At the same time as improving coordination and providing policy stability, there needs to be a government program dedicated to maximising the economic potential of regions. A strong commitment to assisting and developing regional economies must be made. There 
 must also be acknowledgment that, for some regions, improvement or regeneration will be limited. Regions and regional centres with potential should be supported by financial and industry policies designed to maximise this potential. This does not mean the Commonwealth imposes a top down approach; rather, that it works to foster partnerships based on the idea of common purpose.
The committee found that, in order for regions to maximise their economic potential, there needs to be greater government commitment to regional infrastructure. Despite the rhetoric of private sector operators taking on the task of providing infrastructure, most regions of Australia are crying out for adequate infrastructure in any number of areas, including transport links within and between regions; telecommunications; business support and development; and social infrastructure, such as education, training, health and child care. Without adequate infrastructure as the basis of a regional economy, it will be difficult to attract investment and maximise economic potential. Government must work to improve investment in regional infrastructure.
The committee also found that cuts to many services in regional Australia, particularly labour market programs, had disproportionately affected regional Australia. The cuts between 1995-96 and 1997-98 amounted to approximately $1 billion, during a period in which many regional economies have undergone unprecedented crises.
The government's Job Network has a number of inherent problems, based on the belief in the omnipresent power of the market. The committee heard evidence from many areas in regional communities that Job Network is simply unable to meet employment needs in regional Australia. This is the result of the one size fits all approach to policy taken by the government and the impact of successive and extensive budget cuts. As one submission noted:
While it might be argued that spending cuts were necessary, it cannot be convincingly argued that the unfettered market is all that is needed to tackle problems of disproportionately high levels of unemployment and low or negative economic growth in many regions. 

The government must address the specific needs of employment seekers in regional Australia. As the committee's findings show, there is an important leadership role for the Commonwealth, particularly in providing regional Australians with the necessary capacity to develop their economies. Regional communities have a right to determine their own future, and capacity building in regional communities is critical. At the same time as developing capacity, the Commonwealth also has a role in providing relevant incentives to assist in the development of regional economies. It is all well and good to develop the vision and goals of regional communities but, unless you are prepared to provide assistance and incentive to achieve that vision, the whole process is wellnigh useless.
Many rural and regional Australians who participated in this inquiry believed the Commonwealth government was the body best placed to play a leading role in regional development, in terms of both building capacity and providing regional economies with the assistance and incentive to achieve that vision. This government cannot stand by and idly watch the creation of, as Minister Anderson put it, `two nations'. Minister Anderson flagged his own fears of this urban regional split earlier this year when he talked about the development of two nations, yet the Jobs for the Region report would indicate that the government has done little to address these concerns.
The onus is on the government to take up the challenge of creating jobs for the regions. The mood of the nation is exemplified in this observation made by the Labor and Democrat senators:
Opposition and Australian Democrat senators on the Committee—
and Senator Stott Despoja will elaborate—
also wish to state at the outset their view that the Commonwealth Government must take increased responsibility both for regional development and for past policies which have contributed to regional decline. Many submissions to the Committee expressed disappointment at Commonwealth actions, such as the withdrawal of Commonwealth agencies from communities, and blamed these actions for initiating decline in those communities. The Committee's report contains reference to 
 overseas experience in redressing rural and regional decline, and these experiences provide a useful guide for the Commonwealth to take action to review policies which have contributed to decline, and develop policies and initiatives to promote rural and regional development. Many rural and regional Australians who participated in this inquiry believed the Commonwealth was the body best placed to play a leading role in regional development. It is the view of the Committee that to do less would be to break faith with the many rural and regional Australians who participated in this inquiry for the purpose of conveying their desire for action to the body they believe to be best placed to take such action: the Commonwealth Government.
In conclusion, on behalf of the members of the committee I proffer our wholehearted thanks to the secretariat, the membership of which has changed over the length of the inquiry, for their hard work and delightful company during what was a very onerous trek throughout many areas of regional Australia. I would like to thank them for their patience and effort in the preparation of this report, which was not as smooth as all of us would have wanted, but suffice to say we got there in the end.
I also want to mention in my concluding comments one thing which was very interesting, certainly to me. As we travelled to many areas of regional Australia, the comment was made that regional Australians very rarely see Senate inquiries out in regional and rural Australia. They were very pleased that the Senate was taking an interest in regional and rural Australia to the extent that senators were prepared to travel long distances, often in very small planes, as Senator Tierney would recall, to visit rural and regional Australia. I think that says something about the process of Senate inquiries and something about the idea of bringing government closer to the people of rural and regional Australia. It is something I would urge other Senate inquiries to take very seriously. I again congratulate the secretariat for their work and thank other senators for their participation and input.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,15,1,speech
"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-09-30,"—I would like to start by taking up some of Senator Mackay's concluding remarks and also thank for secretariat for their long-suffering patience over this inquiry, particularly the final stages yesterday of 
 hammering out agreement on various aspects between the parties. The inquiry does have a long and chequered history. It has been going on for two years. I well remember, as Senator Mackay referred to, two planes going across northern Tasmania—one with the Liberal senators in it and the other with the Labor senators in it. If either of them crashed, we would have had real problems with numbers in the Senate.
But, certainly, we did visit quite a lot of places—19 locations over 16 days of hearings. I think we got quite a good outcome in the end, particularly when you look at the origins of this inquiry, which were entirely politically motivated. It was entirely set up to try to bag the Job Network before the last election. Despite all that, I think that at the end of the day we came up with a very good report. We do have agreement across all parties on 11 out of the 16 recommendations. There is dissent only on five. I want to deal with the fact as to why there is a difference in the approaches of the two parties.
In the main, the report reflects a lot of what I have been saying about proper approaches to regional development in this country, and I have made five speeches in recent times along that theme. The key theme of the report is that the role of government must move from being a doer and director to a change leader. In line with the McKinsey report recommendations in 1994, there is a need for a bottom up approach, with leadership being vital at the business and the regional level. As I said, this report largely reflects that philosophy. It is reiterated in the last paragraph of the introduction where government senators say that, in underpinning this philosophy, the government must move from being a doer and director to a change leader in regional and economic development.
Government senators therefore dissent from comments specifically related to what the Democrats said towards the end of that introduction. They say that the Commonwealth is the body best placed to solve all the problems in rural and regional Australia. It must be noted that, in making this point, the Democrats are coming from a totally theoretical position. I cannot remember them being 
 there on any days of the inquiry. I might be wrong.
—Senator Allison may have come to them.
—Well, they were not there on any of the days I was there. It was interesting that they came out with that comment in the report and it is unfortunate that that comment was out of tune with the overall philosophy of what the rest of the people on the committee, who had been out there and seen what was going on, were trying to achieve.
I want to briefly mention why we are disagreeing with some of the recommendations. Recommendation 6 relates to handing out free communication facilities to people in the bush. I think that is an insult to the pride and dignity of people in the bush, who struggle and who are fiercely independent. I do not think that is the way to go. Tied in with that is recommendation 7. People on the other side really could not help themselves on this one. It really had nothing to do with the report. It is all to do with the selling of Telstra, which of course the opposition do not want us to continue with. That is not in line with government policy, so obviously we could not agree with that.
Recommendations 8 and 9 attack the government's Job Network and labour market programs, as does the whole of chapter 4. Therefore, government senators put in a dissenting chapter 4 because it was not in line with the facts. Despite the fact that the Job Network did have some initial teething problems, the performance of the Job Network far outweighs what had been occurring before the Job Network started. We have detailed figures on that in our dissenting report relating to job matching placements, Job Search training commencements, Job Search training and job matching placements, intensive assistance commencements, intensive assistance job matching placements and NEIS commencements. If you use those statistics to compare apples with apples, that shows that in the 12 months from May 1998 to April 1999 members recorded that around 177,000, or 54 per cent, more vacancies were notified and that over 72,000, or 43 per cent, more eligible 
 placements were notified than under the old CES in its last 12 months of operation between May 1997 and April 1998.
Government senators also dissent from the recommendation to establish an independent monitoring authority to monitor the operation of the Job Network. Here again, we see a partisan, politically motivated attack which would be a sheer waste of taxpayers' money, because it would put in another layer of bureaucracy to supervise what the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business already does.
I am running out of time at this point, but I want to go through the recommendations that we agreed with and highlight again that we agreed with 11 out of the 16 recommendations. These very briefly relate to the following. No. 1 is for the greater involvement of states and local governments in the operations of the ACC. No. 2 is that the government should have a more coordinating role in the dissemination of information to local businesses. No. 3 is that the government should investigate strategies for attracting increased investment to regional Australia. No. 4 is that we put a higher priority on infrastructure in regional Australia. No. 5 is that funding formulae should be re-examined to place a higher priority on regional development. No. 10 is that the Commonwealth government should look further into strategies to facilitate the provision of structured training opportunities. No. 12 is that extra funding should be given to support TAFE. No. 13 is that training incentives are especially needed in regional industries. No. 14 is that the government should play a more pivotal role in coordinating regional development policy. No. 15 is that we should have a regional Australian summit convened periodically. Finally, No. 16 recommends that a ministerial council on regional development, involving all three spheres of government, be established on the basis of the COAG model.
It is a pity, given that we had so much consensus at the end compared with how this started, that we could not have come to 100 per cent agreement. Reports from the Senate that have 100 per cent agreement have a lot higher credibility. But, seeing that on a 
 number of these points there was party political point scoring which the government could not agree with, we had to dissent on those matters. Finally, I emphasise that there was a lot of agreement across all parties about the scale of the problems in regional Australia and the measures that are needed to address those.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee</title>",Committees,15,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-09-30,"—I assume that the Senate is continuing without adjournment. Is that correct?
—The intention was to allow you, Senator Stott Despoja, the opportunity to speak on this matter and then adjourn for the lunchbreak.
—I would like to add to the remarks made by Senator Mackay and also Senator Tierney in terms of congratulating the secretariat. I also particularly commend this initiative, which was Senator Sue Mackay's. I would be very wary of suggesting that this was a politically partisan exercise, because I think, as Senator Tierney has pointed out, the outcomes of this report and the deliberative process have been very positive. I hope that it was intended that way all along. I certainly commend the initiative and the work of the changing secretariat throughout this process. Indeed, the two previous speakers are quite right in expressing that this was a long and intensive inquiry involving travel appropriately to enough rural and remote parts of the country to hear stories of those communities that have been under threat from industrial or agricultural decline and to hear potential solutions. Many of these stories, as has been acknowledged, were heartbreaking—of towns who lost their industry, their banks, their post offices and finally, in some cases, their populations. They are the towns most in need of support and whose testimony was the first to blame federal governments for perhaps failing to provide the support that they dearly needed.
The latest Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business small area labour market figures highlight the difficulties still being faced by the bush and 
 the need for coordinated action to redress regional and remote decline. Unemployment is as high as 37.4 per cent in these smaller markets, and double digit unemployment figures are still quite prevalent in regional labour markets around the nation. These figures also point to a divide between cities and regions and a growing need for government intervention. Many of the submissions to the inquiry pointed to the severe social problems which had ensued as a result of economic decline, including high rates of suicide, crime and depression. There is clearly an onus on all sectors of the community to prevent such problems from occurring and developing in future.
This report includes a number of recommendations for government leadership, intervention and cooperation for further regional growth. These include recommendations for Commonwealth investigation of strategies to attract investment to regional Australia and a higher priority to be placed on infrastructure development. They also recommend that the remaining one-third of Telstra not be privatised and that the new enterprise initiative scheme be expanded. It is unfortunate that government senators do not necessarily agree with the latter recommendation. NEIS has been an outstanding success in seeding new enterprise and in encouraging job seekers to become small business people—something which the government and many others in this chamber would seek to support.
The report also examines the effect of the competitive tendering out of employment services through the government's Job Network. This has certainly been an area of grave concern both to the opposition and to the Australian Democrats. The old CES based system offered a universal, freely accessible labour exchange service where altruism, not profit making, was a key motive in the provision of employment services to job seekers. The government's replacement of the CES and case management with Job Network is undergoing a second round of tenders at the moment. It would have been appropriate if the government had conducted an open review of that operation of Job Network prior to the commencement of the second tender round, 
 as desired by a number of the employment service providers and community groups.
Job seekers in rural and regional areas are particularly disadvantaged by the competitive tendering of services. Areas of lower employment will always fare badly under such a model. If employment agencies are paid only for employment outcomes, those areas with fewer employment opportunities and lower outcomes will obviously place employment agencies operating in those areas under considerable pressure to maintain services and basically remain viable.
The spread of Job Network services also favours areas of high employment, as revealed in a study by Dr Paul Pickering and published by the Brotherhood of St Laurence last year. Dr Pickering conducted a number of case studies and included the following results in the report: South Australia, my home state, has the second highest rate of unemployment in the country. In May 1996 the CES operated a network for 31 offices and had 700 staff working to place people in work. Under Job Network, Employment National has less than 100 staff in 17 locations, and a number of these are merely shopfront operations. In Gippsland in rural Victoria funding was made available for only 3,600 FLEX 3—or intensive assistance—places at any one time, despite there being over 10,000 job seekers eligible for this assistance in the region.
The inquiry heard complaints from people in rural areas that services were difficult to access, particularly where a mobile service was relied upon. The Australian Democrats strongly endorse the recommendation of this report for a comprehensive review of Job Network to analyse all aspects of the design and the operation of this particular network.
The report also recommends—again, I understand, without the support of government senators—that a Job Network regulatory body be established to carry out the functions of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, which the government disbanded when it got into office and when it implemented the Job Network system. The report before us today is long awaited and very much needed by regions looking for government assistance to help them re-establish 
 themselves and adjust to economic change. The Democrats strongly believe there is a role for the federal government to provide leadership in relation to this objective.
While Commonwealth-state divisions may be drawn by those seeking to shift this responsibility, the fact remains that an overwhelming number of people in regional and rural areas believe the responsibility lies with the Commonwealth. Just as the Commonwealth made the decision to rationalise a number of services to the bush—a move seen as the harbinger of decline by people in the country—so too should it reverse this decline. As the report states, to do less would be to break faith with the many Australians in rural and regional areas who viewed their participation in this inquiry as a means by which they could convey their desire for action to the body they believe to be best placed to take such action—the federal government.

That the Senate take note of the report.
The tabling today of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee's report into employment and unemployment in regional Australia represents a major study into Australia's regional economies and the employment prospects for regional Australians. This inquiry was first referred to the committee on 4 December 1997. Progress was interrupted by the 1998 election and the committee's involvement in the inquiry into a new tax system held earlier this year. As the inquiry has extended over two parliaments, there have been changes to the committee membership over that time.
The committee received 224 submissions and conducted 22 public hearings in regional Australia, covering all states. We visited many regional areas as diverse as Broken Hill, Burnie and Whyalla and many more between April and December 1998. Its deliberations provide a useful snapshot of the zeitgeist of regional Australia in the aftermath of two federal budgets—1996 and 1997—that saw widespread cutbacks on regional programs.
The report, titled Jobs for the regions, highlights the importance of regional communities and the need for the Commonwealth to take a leading role in policies designed to develop regional economies. This consultation 
 revealed the seriousness of the problems in regional Australia. It also highlighted the need for government to listen to regional Australians.
The anger expressed by regional Victorians is not something new, nor is it limited simply to Victoria. Regional Australians have valid concerns and fears, and they have sent a very clear message to this government. Governments around the country—particularly the federal government—have been ignoring these concerns and fears for far too long. Governments have known about these problems and have simply chosen to ignore them.
This report, the first major Senate report on regional Australia handed down since the Victorian election on 18 September 1999, lays down an important framework for action. It is imperative that the government acts on the findings and recommendations of the report. As I mentioned, extensive consultations were undertaken throughout regional Australia. The findings of this report provide a good insight into the impact of cuts to service provision and the rationalisation of Commonwealth government programs. The findings also highlight the need for a more consistent and integrated strategy to tackling regional development issues.
I would like to draw briefly on some of the main findings of the report. This did not involve the imposition of regional structures from the outside, like past Commonwealth and state government programs. Many of the witnesses who spoke to the committee called for greater coordination between state and Commonwealth programs, with a common sense of purpose. Commonality of purpose would go a long way to providing policy stability and funding continuity, not to mention increasing the coordination between levels of government in addressing regional development issues. In developing coordination, the Commonwealth clearly has a leading role to play.
At the same time as improving coordination and providing policy stability, there needs to be a government program dedicated to maximising the economic potential of regions. A strong commitment to assisting and developing regional economies must be made. There 
 must also be acknowledgment that, for some regions, improvement or regeneration will be limited. Regions and regional centres with potential should be supported by financial and industry policies designed to maximise this potential. This does not mean the Commonwealth imposes a top down approach; rather, that it works to foster partnerships based on the idea of common purpose.
The committee found that, in order for regions to maximise their economic potential, there needs to be greater government commitment to regional infrastructure. Despite the rhetoric of private sector operators taking on the task of providing infrastructure, most regions of Australia are crying out for adequate infrastructure in any number of areas, including transport links within and between regions; telecommunications; business support and development; and social infrastructure, such as education, training, health and child care. Without adequate infrastructure as the basis of a regional economy, it will be difficult to attract investment and maximise economic potential. Government must work to improve investment in regional infrastructure.
The committee also found that cuts to many services in regional Australia, particularly labour market programs, had disproportionately affected regional Australia. The cuts between 1995-96 and 1997-98 amounted to approximately $1 billion, during a period in which many regional economies have undergone unprecedented crises.
The government's Job Network has a number of inherent problems, based on the belief in the omnipresent power of the market. The committee heard evidence from many areas in regional communities that Job Network is simply unable to meet employment needs in regional Australia. This is the result of the one size fits all approach to policy taken by the government and the impact of successive and extensive budget cuts. As one submission noted:
While it might be argued that spending cuts were necessary, it cannot be convincingly argued that the unfettered market is all that is needed to tackle problems of disproportionately high levels of unemployment and low or negative economic growth in many regions. 

The government must address the specific needs of employment seekers in regional Australia. As the committee's findings show, there is an important leadership role for the Commonwealth, particularly in providing regional Australians with the necessary capacity to develop their economies. Regional communities have a right to determine their own future, and capacity building in regional communities is critical. At the same time as developing capacity, the Commonwealth also has a role in providing relevant incentives to assist in the development of regional economies. It is all well and good to develop the vision and goals of regional communities but, unless you are prepared to provide assistance and incentive to achieve that vision, the whole process is wellnigh useless.

Minister Anderson flagged his own fears of this urban regional split earlier this year when he talked about the development of two nations, yet the Jobs for the Region report would indicate that the government has done little to address these concerns.
The onus is on the government to take up the challenge of creating jobs for the regions. The mood of the nation is exemplified in this observation made by the Labor and Democrat senators:

The key theme of the report is that the role of government must move from being a doer and director to a change leader. In line with the McKinsey report recommendations in 1994, there is a need for a bottom up approach, with leadership being vital at the business and the regional level. As I said, this report largely reflects that philosophy. It is reiterated in the last paragraph of the introduction where government senators say that, in underpinning this philosophy, the government must move from being a doer and director to a change leader in regional and economic development.
Government senators therefore dissent from comments specifically related to what the Democrats said towards the end of that introduction. They say that the Commonwealth is the body best placed to solve all the problems in rural and regional Australia. It must be noted that, in making this point, the Democrats are coming from a totally theoretical position. I cannot remember them being 
 there on any days of the inquiry. I might be wrong.
—Senator Allison may have come to them.
—Well, they were not there on any of the days I was there. It was interesting that they came out with that comment in the report and it is unfortunate that that comment was out of tune with the overall philosophy of what the rest of the people on the committee, who had been out there and seen what was going on, were trying to achieve.
I want to briefly mention why we are disagreeing with some of the recommendations. Recommendation 6 relates to handing out free communication facilities to people in the bush. I think that is an insult to the pride and dignity of people in the bush, who struggle and who are fiercely independent. I do not think that is the way to go. Tied in with that is recommendation 7. People on the other side really could not help themselves on this one. It really had nothing to do with the report. It is all to do with the selling of Telstra, which of course the opposition do not want us to continue with. That is not in line with government policy, so obviously we could not agree with that.
Recommendations 8 and 9 attack the government's Job Network and labour market programs, as does the whole of chapter 4. Therefore, government senators put in a dissenting chapter 4 because it was not in line with the facts. Despite the fact that the Job Network did have some initial teething problems, the performance of the Job Network far outweighs what had been occurring before the Job Network started. We have detailed figures on that in our dissenting report relating to job matching placements, Job Search training commencements, Job Search training and job matching placements, intensive assistance commencements, intensive assistance job matching placements and NEIS commencements. If you use those statistics to compare apples with apples, that shows that in the 12 months from May 1998 to April 1999 members recorded that around 177,000, or 54 per cent, more vacancies were notified and that over 72,000, or 43 per cent, more eligible 
 placements were notified than under the old CES in its last 12 months of operation between May 1997 and April 1998.
Government senators also dissent from the recommendation to establish an independent monitoring authority to monitor the operation of the Job Network. Here again, we see a partisan, politically motivated attack which would be a sheer waste of taxpayers' money, because it would put in another layer of bureaucracy to supervise what the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business already does.
I am running out of time at this point, but I want to go through the recommendations that we agreed with and highlight again that we agreed with 11 out of the 16 recommendations. These very briefly relate to the following. No. 1 is for the greater involvement of states and local governments in the operations of the ACC. No. 2 is that the government should have a more coordinating role in the dissemination of information to local businesses. No. 3 is that the government should investigate strategies for attracting increased investment to regional Australia. No. 4 is that we put a higher priority on infrastructure in regional Australia. No. 5 is that funding formulae should be re-examined to place a higher priority on regional development. No. 10 is that the Commonwealth government should look further into strategies to facilitate the provision of structured training opportunities. No. 12 is that extra funding should be given to support TAFE. No. 13 is that training incentives are especially needed in regional industries. No. 14 is that the government should play a more pivotal role in coordinating regional development policy. No. 15 is that we should have a regional Australian summit convened periodically. Finally, No. 16 recommends that a ministerial council on regional development, involving all three spheres of government, be established on the basis of the COAG model.
It is a pity, given that we had so much consensus at the end compared with how this started, that we could not have come to 100 per cent agreement. Reports from the Senate that have 100 per cent agreement have a lot higher credibility. But, seeing that on a 
 number of these points there was party political point scoring which the government could not agree with, we had to dissent on those matters. Finally, I emphasise that there was a lot of agreement across all parties about the scale of the problems in regional Australia and the measures that are needed to address those.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,15,2,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,1999-09-30,"—I assume that the Senate is continuing without adjournment. Is that correct?
—The intention was to allow you, Senator Stott Despoja, the opportunity to speak on this matter and then adjourn for the lunchbreak.
—I would like to add to the remarks made by Senator Mackay and also Senator Tierney in terms of congratulating the secretariat. I also particularly commend this initiative, which was Senator Sue Mackay's. I would be very wary of suggesting that this was a politically partisan exercise, because I think, as Senator Tierney has pointed out, the outcomes of this report and the deliberative process have been very positive. I hope that it was intended that way all along. I certainly commend the initiative and the work of the changing secretariat throughout this process. Indeed, the two previous speakers are quite right in expressing that this was a long and intensive inquiry involving travel appropriately to enough rural and remote parts of the country to hear stories of those communities that have been under threat from industrial or agricultural decline and to hear potential solutions. Many of these stories, as has been acknowledged, were heartbreaking—of towns who lost their industry, their banks, their post offices and finally, in some cases, their populations. They are the towns most in need of support and whose testimony was the first to blame federal governments for perhaps failing to provide the support that they dearly needed.
The latest Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business small area labour market figures highlight the difficulties still being faced by the bush and 
 the need for coordinated action to redress regional and remote decline. Unemployment is as high as 37.4 per cent in these smaller markets, and double digit unemployment figures are still quite prevalent in regional labour markets around the nation. These figures also point to a divide between cities and regions and a growing need for government intervention. Many of the submissions to the inquiry pointed to the severe social problems which had ensued as a result of economic decline, including high rates of suicide, crime and depression. There is clearly an onus on all sectors of the community to prevent such problems from occurring and developing in future.
This report includes a number of recommendations for government leadership, intervention and cooperation for further regional growth. These include recommendations for Commonwealth investigation of strategies to attract investment to regional Australia and a higher priority to be placed on infrastructure development. They also recommend that the remaining one-third of Telstra not be privatised and that the new enterprise initiative scheme be expanded. It is unfortunate that government senators do not necessarily agree with the latter recommendation. NEIS has been an outstanding success in seeding new enterprise and in encouraging job seekers to become small business people—something which the government and many others in this chamber would seek to support.
The report also examines the effect of the competitive tendering out of employment services through the government's Job Network. This has certainly been an area of grave concern both to the opposition and to the Australian Democrats. The old CES based system offered a universal, freely accessible labour exchange service where altruism, not profit making, was a key motive in the provision of employment services to job seekers. The government's replacement of the CES and case management with Job Network is undergoing a second round of tenders at the moment. It would have been appropriate if the government had conducted an open review of that operation of Job Network prior to the commencement of the second tender round, 
 as desired by a number of the employment service providers and community groups.
Job seekers in rural and regional areas are particularly disadvantaged by the competitive tendering of services. Areas of lower employment will always fare badly under such a model. If employment agencies are paid only for employment outcomes, those areas with fewer employment opportunities and lower outcomes will obviously place employment agencies operating in those areas under considerable pressure to maintain services and basically remain viable.
The spread of Job Network services also favours areas of high employment, as revealed in a study by Dr Paul Pickering and published by the Brotherhood of St Laurence last year. Dr Pickering conducted a number of case studies and included the following results in the report: South Australia, my home state, has the second highest rate of unemployment in the country. In May 1996 the CES operated a network for 31 offices and had 700 staff working to place people in work. Under Job Network, Employment National has less than 100 staff in 17 locations, and a number of these are merely shopfront operations. In Gippsland in rural Victoria funding was made available for only 3,600 FLEX 3—or intensive assistance—places at any one time, despite there being over 10,000 job seekers eligible for this assistance in the region.
The inquiry heard complaints from people in rural areas that services were difficult to access, particularly where a mobile service was relied upon. The Australian Democrats strongly endorse the recommendation of this report for a comprehensive review of Job Network to analyse all aspects of the design and the operation of this particular network.
The report also recommends—again, I understand, without the support of government senators—that a Job Network regulatory body be established to carry out the functions of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, which the government disbanded when it got into office and when it implemented the Job Network system. The report before us today is long awaited and very much needed by regions looking for government assistance to help them re-establish 
 themselves and adjust to economic change. The Democrats strongly believe there is a role for the federal government to provide leadership in relation to this objective.
While Commonwealth-state divisions may be drawn by those seeking to shift this responsibility, the fact remains that an overwhelming number of people in regional and rural areas believe the responsibility lies with the Commonwealth. Just as the Commonwealth made the decision to rationalise a number of services to the bush—a move seen as the harbinger of decline by people in the country—so too should it reverse this decline. As the report states, to do less would be to break faith with the many Australians in rural and regional areas who viewed their participation in this inquiry as a means by which they could convey their desire for action to the body they believe to be best placed to take such action—the federal government.

Is the minister aware of the likely timetable for the presentation to the government of the Sports 2000 review commissioned by the minister, Miss Kelly? Can the minister confirm that one of the terms of reference for this review is that it should consider `the opportunities to increase off-budget funding of sport and recreation at the Commonwealth level'?

Can the minister confirm that the review committee is chaired by Mr Ross Oakley of Oakley Enterprises, a company which is currently in legal dispute with the ACT Liberal government in relation to the Bruce Stadium fiasco? Is the minister aware that Oakley Enterprises is part of a consortium which charged $1.8 million for a marketing contract expected to raise $13 million in sponsorship, but which subsequently raised only $195,237, creating a 98 per cent shortfall?

 issues, including the future funding and structure of sport and recreation. This will form a sound basis for the government's new sport and recreation policy. I remind the Senate that the recent federal budget assured sport funding for the next three years and the review process will develop a strong policy direction for the next 10 to 15 years. While our current system has served Australia extremely well over the past 25 years, the review and subsequent new sports policy are all about staying in front and ensuring that Australia remains a great sporting nation well into the next millennium.
Some of the key priorities include: ensuring that Commonwealth funds are spent in the best possible way, increasing participation rates in sport, ensuring that the benefits of sport extend right across the community and making sport more professional. The government also has an interest in making the sport and recreation sector a true industry with greater opportunities and more rewarding career paths for those who are involved.

The statement read as follows—
CSIRO Riverside Corporate Park, North Ryde, NSW—Joint Research Complex for CSIRO Molecular Science and Food Science Australia (Eighth report of 1999)
CSIRO Division of Building Construction and Engineering Development Works at Riverside Corporate Park, North Ryde, NSW (Ninth report of 1999)
Madam President, the reports which I have just tabled concern proposals to construct new facilities for the CSIRO's Division of Molecular Science and Food Science Australia and CSIRO's Division of Building Construction and Engineering Development.
Both are to be constructed at Riverside Corporate Park at North Ryde in Sydney.
The Riverside Corporate Park contains the largest aggregation of CSIRO research activities in New South Wales. Long term planning envisages development of the corporate park, within CSIRO precincts, to provide modern research facilities.
Land surplus to CSIRO requirements has been developed and infrastructure and site services have been upgraded or replaced for sale to private sector companies. Further rationalisation and consolidation of CSIRO facilities is planned.
The estimated out turn cost of both proposals is $59 million dollars.
The Committee has recommended that the works should proceed as proposed.The first report, the eighth of 1999, concerns the construction of a new joint complex for the Division of Molecular Science and Food Science Australia. This will replace predominantly old and substandard existing facilities at North Ryde that are now inadequate for conducting modern scientific research.
The new facilities will provide accommodation for 220 Food Science Australia and Division of Molecular Science staff plus long-term visitors and students. Facilities will also include amenities, support services and infrastructure which will be shared among all CSIRO divisions within the central precinct of Riverside Corporate Park.
The estimated cost of this proposal is $49 million dollars.
By way of background, Food Science Australia and the Division of Molecular Science undertake wide-ranging strategic and applied research for industries which play a vital role in the continued economic growth of Australia. Both Divisions are housed in facilities which are inadequate and cannot be adapted to contemporary and future research requirements. North Ryde is regarded as an ideal location for both organisations which are required to interact with companies and universities located in the Sydney area.
The Committee has concluded that a need exists for the provision of modern research facilities for the two Divisions which would benefit from being collocated. In terms of the scope of the proposal, the 
 Committee has concluded that it will provide both Divisions with much needed modern research laboratories and ancillary facilities. The extent of the complex can be justified being necessary to meet current and future requirements. CSIRO staff were involved in some detailed planning of the proposed joint complex.
A noteworthy feature is the location and height of the Joint Research Centre. These will combine to create a strong architectural statement whose immediate impact will be tempered by the setback from Delhi Road and tree plantings. The question of the profile and heights of exhaust stacks arose during the inquiry and the Committee has recommended that these features should be re-examined to reduce their visual impact.
As is normally the case, CSIRO consulted widely with State and local government planning authorities in order to meet planning requirements.
In relation to the wider coporate park, the Committee has concluded that CSIRO has implemented extensive initiatives to minimise the environmental impact of the development of the corporate park site. These measures include extensive stormwater management and the provision of a substantial portion of land as a flora and fauna reserve.
The second report, the Committee's ninth of 1999, concerns the replacement of predominantly old and substandard facilities with new state-of-the-art accommodation for the construction materials laboratory and fire technology complex of the CSIRO's Division of Building Construction and Engineering.
The facilities proposed in this stage of the replacement program will accommodate 70 research and support staff and comprise modern research facilities and management and administration offices, together with industrial scale technical areas and testing bays. More specifically, the development will include:
.	 Fire Testing Facilities—Technical and Testing bays and support areas;
.	 Structural Fire and Testing facility;
.	 Reaction to Fire Materials facility;
.	 Fire Safety Performance Evaluation facility;
.	 Construction Materials Facilities—process bays and laboratories; and
.	 Central Facilities—reception, meeting rooms, office and support areas.
Madam President, the Committee is satisfied that the proposed development is necessary in order for CSIRO Building Construction and Engineering to continue to meet its objectives of supporting, advancing and improving the operation of industries relating to the built environment. The Construction Materials research team, which provides strategic 
 support to Australian concrete research, is currently housed in temporary laboratories at Riverside Corporate Park. It is essential that new and improved laboratories be built in order to support the growth in the important area of CSIRO research in advanced cementitious technology.
The Fire Science and Technology Laboratory enhances the competitiveness of Australian industry and public safety through performance prediction methods, measurement technologies and technical advances which result in improvements in the built environment.
Existing fire research and testing facilities are constraining the CSIRO's current capabilities and will not enable fulfilment of future local and international market needs. The proposed new facility will focus on new science capabilities in fire suppression technology, including methods of extinguishing large industrial fires such as the Longford gas fire and the fire at Coode Island in Victoria.
Madam President, while the Committee supports this proposed development it notes that some concerns have been raised by community groups about the likely adverse impacts of the development on the local environment. The Committee took evidence from these groups as well as from various local and State authorities and is satisfied that the CSIRO has planned and will implement numerous conservation measures which will ensure the preservation of a healthy local environment.
The Committee has recommended that the CSIRO continue to supervise development works to ensure the local environment is fully protected, and furthermore that the CSIRO give community groups an opportunity to contribute their views to the environmental management plan currently being developed for this project.
Madam President, I commend these reports to the Senate.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,1999-09-30,"—I have looked at this report on social security compliance in Centrelink. I would have liked 
 it to be more comprehensive than it is, particularly in terms of process. Today during question time Senator Vanstone raised an issue of propriety—an issue of how things should be conducted when people are accused of wrongdoing. I would like to give those considerations to the way this report has been prepared. Some of the figures given here illustrate what I mean.
This is a half-yearly report from July 1998 to December 1998 by Centrelink in respect of social security compliance activity. It points out that there was a total of 1,341,501 entitlement reviews conducted. Out of this, 1,510 convictions resulted. So investigative procedures have been carried out in respect of over a million people, yet only about 1,500 convictions resulted.
People who commit crime deserve to be brought before the courts for the courts to make the appropriate decision about them. But in trying to identify those criminals we must forever keep in mind the rule of law and the necessity to see that people who are not guilty are not treated in an untoward way. Yet these figures in this Centrelink report would  indicate that the contrary is true—in other words, people have been pursued when there was really no basis for it. We should look at the way they have been pursued through data matching, through accelerated claimant matching, through pensioner entitlement reviews and so on. But there is nothing in this report which tells us how the investigative tools have been used.
One tool that has been used is a tip-off review. The police get a lot of their information through tip-offs—people informing on others. That is the way that many people are brought to justice. But there is another side to that—that is, we become an informer society. There is always the problem that people will use that tool to embarrass people whom they do not like or to frustrate people whom they hate. It is of some concern, for example, that we find in the people with disabilities and their carers program there were 3,456 tip-offs which resulted in 121 cancellations, 653 debts being identified and 747 people having their pensions reduced. So a very big proportion of these people were absolutely innocent of a 
 crime and not liable for debt, yet they were investigated.
What I would like to see in further reports is some development of the issues that this very sparse report raises. It is too short a report. It raises a great number of issues which are not met by the text of the report. I would invite Centrelink, when it gives its report in the future, to develop the issues more fully. (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,1999-09-30,"—I welcome the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on the Hinchinbrook Channel inquiry. Whilst senators would be aware that I was not a participant in this inquiry because it concluded before I became a member of the Senate, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the former Senator Margaret Reynolds, who, as a North Queensland senator, contributed quite significantly to this inquiry. I have had a chance to look at the report, and I note that it has acknowledged the divisiveness that the Port Hinchinbrook project has brought to the community of Cardwell in North Queensland.
The history of Port Hinchinbrook, or Oyster Point as it is sometimes called, has not been very positive. Basically, it has been a recipe for how not to manage a development proposal. Parts of this recipe, the ingredients, included a beautiful area with extreme world heritage values—with the wet tropics world heritage area to the west and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to the east. The second component was the community of Cardwell, which in many respects is a depressed regional community. Whilst it is a small community, people do want very much the best for themselves and their families.
Added to that was the spectacle of a very prominent developer coming into town with some fairly fancy plans, a person used to dealing with controversy. As the developer of Hamilton Island in the 1980s, I am sure he would know that that development would not have proceeded in today's environment, given today's knowledge and given the understanding of the community broadly about the environmental impacts and the subsequent economic impacts that come from dealing 
 with such a grand plan in such a sensitive place. So with those three components, the community was very hopeful that they would end up with economic salvation.
The other part of the tragedy is that the Cardwell Shire Council, unfortunately, did not have a planning instrument that would be able to deal with the proposal. So the local government was ill prepared but, as well as that, there were unclear processes between all three levels of government as to how best to deal with such an application.
The other issue was the potential acid sulphate soil issue. At the time, there was limited knowledge of how, if at all, the acid sulphate soils could be disturbed. Given all those things, it is no wonder we have the disaster that faces Cardwell now. But all that is history, and it should be recognised as that. We now have a situation which we have to deal with, and that is the challenge that has been provided to the community of Cardwell and all levels of government.
All senators would be aware that the acid sulphate soil situation is receiving continuing monitoring for its offsite impacts. The Queensland government has commissioned an independent monitor who is working with both the developer and the community to monitor the acid sulphate situation. It will continue to need that sort of monitoring, and I congratulate the Queensland government on its initiative and also encourage it to keep that work going.
I particularly welcome the report's recommendations for federal financial support for regional planning processes. If the Cardwell Shire Council and the community in general had a planning instrument that had been able to deal with it, it would have made this process a lot less divisive. What we need for that Cardwell area is a planning instrument with clear objectives about the community aspirations, with clear community support. That will provide a sense of certainty to all players (whether they be developers, the community themselves or the environment sector) about what is proposed for the future of any community—in this case, Cardwell.
Such an instrument, I believe, would have curbed one of the most concerning outcomes 
 of the Port Hinchinbrook development proposal. Many senators would be aware that, in the early days, the proposal was purported to be a resort. That naturally was welcomed by many in the community, as they could see that it would provide them with some economic future through long-term jobs, mainly for their young people. Unfortunately, the reality is that what we have now is simply a residential subdivision. There will be some jobs, but the potential for long-term jobs is greatly diminished. That proposal has been highly speculative. If there had been sound planning instruments for the local authority and the state government to work within, it would have made it much easier.
Finally, I would like to say that I welcome the report. I look forward to reading it very closely. I also look forward to working with the local community and with all levels of government to resolve this matter as best as possible for all concerned.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,1999-09-30,"—I welcome the report of the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee on the Hinchinbrook Channel inquiry. Whilst senators would be aware that I was not a participant in this inquiry because it concluded before I became a member of the Senate, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of the former Senator Margaret Reynolds, who, as a North Queensland senator, contributed quite significantly to this inquiry. I have had a chance to look at the report, and I note that it has acknowledged the divisiveness that the Port Hinchinbrook project has brought to the community of Cardwell in North Queensland.
The history of Port Hinchinbrook, or Oyster Point as it is sometimes called, has not been very positive. Basically, it has been a recipe for how not to manage a development proposal. Parts of this recipe, the ingredients, included a beautiful area with extreme world heritage values—with the wet tropics world heritage area to the west and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to the east. The second component was the community of Cardwell, which in many respects is a depressed regional community. Whilst it is a small community, people do want very much the best for themselves and their families.
Added to that was the spectacle of a very prominent developer coming into town with some fairly fancy plans, a person used to dealing with controversy. As the developer of Hamilton Island in the 1980s, I am sure he would know that that development would not have proceeded in today's environment, given today's knowledge and given the understanding of the community broadly about the environmental impacts and the subsequent economic impacts that come from dealing 
 with such a grand plan in such a sensitive place. So with those three components, the community was very hopeful that they would end up with economic salvation.
The other part of the tragedy is that the Cardwell Shire Council, unfortunately, did not have a planning instrument that would be able to deal with the proposal. So the local government was ill prepared but, as well as that, there were unclear processes between all three levels of government as to how best to deal with such an application.
The other issue was the potential acid sulphate soil issue. At the time, there was limited knowledge of how, if at all, the acid sulphate soils could be disturbed. Given all those things, it is no wonder we have the disaster that faces Cardwell now. But all that is history, and it should be recognised as that. We now have a situation which we have to deal with, and that is the challenge that has been provided to the community of Cardwell and all levels of government.
All senators would be aware that the acid sulphate soil situation is receiving continuing monitoring for its offsite impacts. The Queensland government has commissioned an independent monitor who is working with both the developer and the community to monitor the acid sulphate situation. It will continue to need that sort of monitoring, and I congratulate the Queensland government on its initiative and also encourage it to keep that work going.
I particularly welcome the report's recommendations for federal financial support for regional planning processes. If the Cardwell Shire Council and the community in general had a planning instrument that had been able to deal with it, it would have made this process a lot less divisive. What we need for that Cardwell area is a planning instrument with clear objectives about the community aspirations, with clear community support. That will provide a sense of certainty to all players (whether they be developers, the community themselves or the environment sector) about what is proposed for the future of any community—in this case, Cardwell.
Such an instrument, I believe, would have curbed one of the most concerning outcomes 
 of the Port Hinchinbrook development proposal. Many senators would be aware that, in the early days, the proposal was purported to be a resort. That naturally was welcomed by many in the community, as they could see that it would provide them with some economic future through long-term jobs, mainly for their young people. Unfortunately, the reality is that what we have now is simply a residential subdivision. There will be some jobs, but the potential for long-term jobs is greatly diminished. That proposal has been highly speculative. If there had been sound planning instruments for the local authority and the state government to work within, it would have made it much easier.
Finally, I would like to say that I welcome the report. I look forward to reading it very closely. I also look forward to working with the local community and with all levels of government to resolve this matter as best as possible for all concerned.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,1999-09-30,"—Australia is increasingly regarded as a great place to live, a country of great natural resources and opportunity. There are indeed few countries in the world that have accepted and adapted to change as readily as Australia. For example, one just has to look 
 at the rate at which business and individuals are accessing the Internet.
One of those elements of change that has dramatically improved our standard of living is trade liberalisation, an issue I wish to address tonight. Australia has reduced tariffs and other trade barriers significantly in recent decades. Some may argue that Australia has outpaced its competitors and neighbours by too great a margin. Trade and foreign direct investment are major engines for growth in all countries as people all over the world seek more freedom of choice. An open market is a source of competitive strength. It stimulates efficiency, which contributes to economic growth, jobs and rising incomes. However, we must admit that globalisation has brought with it some threats for certain people, as well as opportunities for others.
In Australia, this open market has increased competition and boosted productivity, increased the range of imports and made them cheaper for our producers and consumers, and allowed us to focus on producing goods where we are the most cost competitive. Australia has been reducing protection because it raises the living standards for all Australians in monetary terms. The gains from domestic liberalisation over the last 10 years are estimated to have added at least $1,000 to the annual income of every Australian family.
At the same time, we must acknowledge that there has been a loss of a lot of traditionally high labour content firms, particularly in the manufacturing sector. But firms overall benefit from market openness and better access to competitive resources, materials, components and services. Individuals benefit because lower prices and greater product diversity increase the purchasing power of their wages. Liberalisation promotes competition and productivity gains and encourages best practice production methods. Competition encourages our producers to minimise waste, improve techniques and use research and development to generate innovations that will enhance the competitiveness of their product or service.
Exporting firms traditionally have highly developed business practices enabling them to 
 have a competitive edge. They have to be good to survive in the export world; it is not for the inexperienced or faint hearted. The case for liberalising investment is indeed as strong as for trade, where more open economies enjoy higher rates of private investment, which is a major determinant of economic growth.
Our Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, is a great advocate of open and transparent economies and private investment. Australia has survived the downturn in Asia when all around us the tigers have failed. We have been described as the miracle economy. Indeed, some of the recent changes suggested in the Ralph report such as releasing some capital through reductions in capital gains tax are aimed at opening up investment opportunities. About 60 per cent of total foreign direct investment flows are directed towards service industries from where economies derive the bulk of income and employment growth in such areas as telecommunication, finance, transport and professional services. We do have to acknowledge at the same time that concerns have been expressed about the impact of openness on labour markets, but we must also acknowledge that the negative effects of trade and investment are quite modest.
Adverse effects on the labour market come primarily from changes in technology, as well as business organisations. The cost of protecting industry and workers against imports by raising trade barriers, which involves the community typically paying a higher price, are regarded as outmoded today. Protection is like a tax because it raises the price of imports and domestic products, which in turn restricts consumer choice and places the heaviest burden on those in society who are the least well off. It forces Australian businesses to pay higher prices on imported goods used in production, making them less competitive than their overseas counterparts. It slows change. It also raises costs.
We can make the most of liberalisation by securing low inflation and interest rates; by continuing micro-economic reform to boost productivity, including key sectors such as transport, energy, finance and telecommunica 
 tions; by labour market reforms, which create more productive, flexible and dynamic work forces; and by lowering compliance costs to business. All these policies help encourage investment, strengthen the Australian economic growth and facilitate higher incomes, create jobs and improve our living standards. But to deal effectively with the need for adjustment—with adjustment there are always winners and losers as a result of change—policies are needed to address the plight of those in the front line of adjustment. Concerns need to be acknowledged. It is important to stress that there is a better way.
Liberal trade and investment must be seen as being not only about prosperity and greater freedom of choice but also about fairness. Public understanding therefore must be improved. Research shows that the highest benefits go to those countries which liberalise first, and certainly Australia is in this league. This is because most of the gains from trade liberalisation come from domestic reforms rather than increased market access abroad. Australian producers are enjoying improved access for their products due to liberalisation occurring in other countries via the World Trade Organisation and regional fora such as APEC, bilateral agreements and unilateral decisions.
APEC countries are already moving towards the goal of free and open trade and investment. Australia is working hard indeed to encourage greater liberalisation by other countries. China, for instance, will reduce its average tariff from 23 per cent to 15 per cent by the year 2000. Around the world average tariffs on manufactured goods have fallen from 40 per cent in the 1940s to four per cent today. The worldwide lowering of tariff barriers has helped to increase world trade dramatically. As a result, our exports have grown by 3.5 times over the past 20 years. The export mix has also changed.
All these changes have resulted in more jobs and higher growth, both of which we are experiencing in Australia today. The role then for politicians and industries is to devote more time and effort to addressing the concerns about open trade and investment. Targeted and coordinated policies must explain 
 pressures on jobs and incomes and address the problems at the root.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Trade Liberalisation</title>,Adjournment,25,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-09-30," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 12 August 1999:
(1) When was the Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS) Configuration Control Board established.
(2) (a) On how many occasions has the board met since July 1996; (b) what are its key functions; and (c) who sits on the board.
(3) Has the membership of the board varied since it was first established; if so, what changes in membership have occurred since that time.
(4) Does the board investigate problems with the development and implementation of TAAATS; if so: can a schedule be provided of failures in the system noted by the board, including: (a) the nature of each problem; (b) the duration of each problem; and (c) the action taken by Airservices Australia, or contractors, in response to each problem.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Advanced Air Traffic System Configuration Control Board: Establishment</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,1,question
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-09-30,"—The Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
Airservices Australia have provided the following advice:
(1) The TAAATS Configuration Control Board (CCB) was established in May 1998.
(2) (a) The CCB has had over 90 face to face or telephone conference meetings.
(b) The CCB principle functions are configuration control of the TAAATS system on a national basis and approval of the operational commissioning of the various elements of the system as system readiness and training is completed. In addition, the CCB provides for approval of changes to the system baseline, contract variations and new releases of operational software for TAAATS and associated systems, and endorsement of changes to interfaces that may affect the functionality and performance of the TAAATS system. 

(c) The CCB consists of the managers responsible for the major operational business units at Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney and the managers responsible for program and project aspects of TAAATS implementation.
The membership of the Board has been expanded to include the Manager, Sydney Operations and the Manager, Terminal Operations.
(4) (a), (b) and (c) The CCB has a continuing role in investigating problems that arise during the development, testing and implementation of TAAATS. TAAATS is a large software based system and the number of reported problems has been at a level that could be expected for a software development of its size and complexity. It would not be practical to provide a schedule of system issues raised in over 90 meetings of technical experts, in a form which would be readily understandable and which would not be open to misinterpretation.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Australian Advanced Air Traffic System Configuration Control Board: Establishment</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,27,1,answer
