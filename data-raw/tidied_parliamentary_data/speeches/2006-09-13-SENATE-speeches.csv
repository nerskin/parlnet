"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-13,"—I move Family First amendment (1) on sheet 5033:
(1)    Schedule 2, page 4 (after line 13), at the end of the Schedule, add:
6  At the end of section 51AE
Add:
         (7)    The Oilcode must specify that where a wholesale supplier as part of the supply of the declared petroleum product:
                   (a)   discounts the terminal gate price; or
                   (b)   supplies or offers to supply a declared petroleum product at a price other than the terminal gate price;
the wholesale supplier will make available to the public each day on an Internet website maintained by or for the wholesale supplier:
                   (c)   the price or prices including the amount of any discount and other individual components in relation to each particular price; and
                   (d)   the criteria to qualify for the price or prices including any discount in relation to a particular price or individual component of each particular price.
Note:  The terminal gate price is defined in the Oilcode.
Given that yesterday we went through quite a few amendments to this bill to make sure that we had more competition, not less, we need to make sure that independent service stations, predominantly smaller businesses, have the ability to see exactly what price they can buy at and what conditions they need to meet to buy at those prices. So this amendment from Family First is about disclosing product discounts, not about stopping discounting. This amendment is about making sure that all the purchasers, including independent service stations, know exactly what conditions they would need to meet to buy at a particular price. So this amendment is about having full price transparency.
I understand that the government may argue that the Oilcode requires the terminal gate pricing to be disclosed, but this issue is about disclosing discounts and making it quite clear to anyone wanting to buy petrol exactly what conditions or criteria they need to meet to get certain discounts. Rather than allowing discounts to be hidden and not shown, this is about making sure we have an open and level playing field for all service stations, including independents, so that they know what they have to do to get the very best discounts. Knowing the role that independent service stations play within the market in keeping prices low, I think this is extremely important. Family First wants to make sure that a structure is set up such that independents can survive. One of the ways they can survive is by being able to understand what discounts are being given by suppliers of petrol and knowing what conditions they would have to meet in order to achieve the same level of discounts.
In the last week we have heard clearly about how independents are buying at a level that is already higher than what other retailers are selling at, and they do not understand how that can happen. One way of addressing that is to have transparency of pricing, not just the terminal gate price but the discounted price. Independents need to be able to survive—their backs are already against the wall—and they need to understand exactly what criteria they need to meet to purchase petrol at the best possible price.
The amendment that Family First is putting forward would make sure that the wholesale supplier will make available to the public the price or prices, including the amount of any discount or any other individual components in relation to each price and—which is very important—the criteria to qualify for the price or prices, including any discount in relation to a price or individual component of each price. This is a common-sense amendment, as were yesterday’s, but again with this one I appeal to the Senate, I appeal to the government, to think about what is happening to independents and the important role they play in the market in keeping prices low.
I was out talking to someone at an independent service station this morning and they were sharing with me how important it is to have independents out there to make sure that there is more, not less, competition. They have played a very important role in discounting and a particularly important role in allowing alternative fuels, such as ethanol. It would be wrong for Australia and this parliament not to ensure that independents can survive on a level playing field. I notice that the Comcars now have petrol cards for independent service stations. I would have to check whether senators and members also have such access. I have a petrol card for Shell, Caltex and BP, but I do not have one for independents. I am not sure how it would work; I would have to check. It is just that I have noticed that Comcars are able to buy from independents and buy the ethanol blends they have. This amendment is all about ensuring that independents understand the conditions they have to meet to get the very best price. It is fair and reasonable that they are able to do this. I appeal to all senators to support the Family First amendment.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-13,"—We agree that transparency in the Australian fuel market is critically important. Because we believed the powers of the ACCC were very important we supported Senator Murray’s amendment and moved our own amendment in the same terms to give the ACCC the power that it was seeking to monitor and deal with anticompetitive behaviour in the market. Unfortunately, the government chose not to support that amendment. We believe that Senator Fielding’s amendment will enhance transparency for the purchasers of fuel at the wholesale level. It will do no harm to the market at all; indeed, it will enhance competition by revealing the variety of means by which a retailer can access fuel potentially at a cheaper price. It will also reveal to the general public the nature of the market, the way in which discounts are obtained and limitations on obtaining discounts.
The government might argue that these discount arrangements are commercial-in-confidence. We think that this market is so important to the Australian community, to the structure of business costs and to the arrangements which keep this country moving, that we ought to support the amendment. As I say, we believe it does no harm to the market overall. To the extent that it may interfere with commercial arrangements, we believe that it is in the public interest that those arrangements be made as transparent as possible. We will be supporting this amendment. We urge the government to do likewise. I commend Senator Fielding’s comments to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-13,"—I recall three decades ago having a very close look at the fair trading provisions in law in California and New York state. In both of those sets of legislation, and it may have been the case elsewhere—there was considerable academic and expert commentary surrounding them—I recall that they were very much focused on two fundamental and longstanding principles in competition law. The first is that you should have like terms for like customers. In other words, if you are of a certain volume, size, ability or credit worthiness you are entitled, as a matter of law and as a matter of principle, to have the same terms as someone of equivalent status. It is equivalent, if you like, to talking about antidiscrimination law. What antidiscrimination law says is that you should not discriminate against somebody—for instance, with respect to work—by age, by gender, by religion, by ethnicity; you should evaluate them on their merits. Essentially, the like terms for like customers approach says that you evaluate each customer on their merits; you do not discriminate on unreasonable, immoral or biased grounds.
The second principle which is attached to that is that you should publish your terms and conditions, and your lists of terms of conditions should be freely available. That is a principle that is well established in Australian law, except in a few industries. One of the very worst—and I am absolutely appalled to this day, and I have written and spoken extensively about it for a couple of decades now—is the fact that shopping centre rents are a secret matter. Secret pricing is undertaken and is not publicly available. I have long been concerned about this matter.
There is a publication of mine in the Parliamentary Library, if anybody wants to go and have a look at it, about an issue that was raised in March 2004 during the Senate references committee inquiry into the Trade Practices Act. Just to express the principle: if you walk into a shoe shop as a customer, all the prices of the shoes and the various brands are available and are known to you. This amendment seeks to identify, for the buyers of petroleum products, the terms and conditions to which they are entitled with respect to their particular character—in other words, their volume, or their geographical location. Obviously, if an oil refinery has to deliver fuel for 300 kilometres, it costs them more to get that fuel to that customer than it does to get the fuel to a customer five kilometres away, and they are entitled to add a premium for that distance.
The Americans discovered years ago, in that instance I was outlining, that sellers were biased in terms of how they treated buyers. For instance, some buyers would get a facings allowance, which should have been available to others and was not; some buyers might get 45 days terms of credit, whereas the standard was 30 days, and that was not available to others; and so on and so forth. The Americans required that these principles should be clearly laid out by the seller on a non-discriminatory basis so that people had an appropriate way to be able to determine how to get the best price, whether by volume or by the terms that they were able to make attractive to the seller.
I think that this amendment encapsulates an absolutely critical, vital and—if I might describe it as such—universal principle with respect to the sale of goods under an advanced, fair competition regime. Certainly, you might quarrel with the wording here or there, but it does not alter the real impact of this amendment. For instance, it says, ‘the wholesale supplier will make available to the public each day’. I am not sure the public would need to refer to it each day, because it is more important for the retail buyers to be able to refer to it, but nevertheless it still must be available to the public. It must be a public list of the terms and conditions under which you supply product.
The amendment says ‘on an Internet website’. Not every buyer will have access to a website. Some of the sorts of small businesses that Senator Joyce was talking about earlier might not have website access, they might not have broadband way out in Woop Woop, so you could argue that an internet website is too limiting and the information should simply be available to the public. Nevertheless, as with the other amendment, the saving grace—if there are any inadequacies in this amendment—is that it says ‘the Oilcode must specify’. Of course, the Oilcode is capable of being expansive and descriptive and able to cover off areas which the amendment might not cover off.
The most important aspect of this amendment is that it seeks to address the issue of fundamental public concern—I accept, because I have heard the arguments contrary to this, that it might not always be true—which is the common public and media perception that the market is manipulated by the oil majors and their various organisations. It may not be true but the only way to cure that perception, which is very widespread indeed, is for there to be a published list of terms and conditions in which the regulator, and indeed everybody concerned with these matters, can have confidence.
I have had a close look at and a think about this proposed amendment and I agree with the Labor Party. I believe that not only is the intent correct and not only are the precedents there in terms of long-established competition principles in modern market economies but the wording is sufficiently tight to enable it to pass into law without too many unforeseen consequences. With those remarks, and with a long history of my own and the Democrats’ concern and support for similar approaches in other bills at other times, it is consistent for us to support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-13,"—Once more I agree with the intent of this amendment, but there are things that I would have changed. I do not believe there is a reason that everybody in the public needs to know the commercial-in-confidence agreements. I would suggest—and I will listen to the debate—that it would probably be better if there were an ombudsman who was actually separate in the review of this matter. Part (c), which says, ‘the price or prices including the amount of any discount’, gives away, even within independents, the discount one person is getting over another person. I hope in the future that can be changed. I think it would be better if it said ‘the price or prices including whether there is a discount or other individual components that relate to a particular price’.
People should know whether someone is getting a discount, but whether they should know the exact discount is another issue. I have no problems with an individual ombudsman who could respect commercial-in-confidence agreements. If an ombudsman were to know about the discounts then that would give you another body to oversee this area. However, the intent of what Senator Fielding is trying to do is correct. He is addressing a major problem that everybody has when you call into an independent service station and say, ‘What can I do for you?’ and they say, ‘You can help me buy petrol cheaper than what they are selling it for. If I can buy petrol at what they are selling it for then that would be a great outcome.’
I ask Senator Fielding to give consideration to whether, rather than the public knowing, we could put in place an independent ombudsman to have a view of that. The public should know whether there is a discount and the circumstances of a discount, but to tell everybody on a public internet site the price of a product that everybody is buying could work against them. There could be occasions where even other majors could say, ‘Now I know what the margins are of all my competitors everywhere,’ or one independent in a small town will know what the margin is of the person up the street. I ask Senator Fielding if he could just give consideration to whether we could have an independent ombudsman with that oversight who has the ability to keep some sort of corporate veil in place so that the person down the street from you is not going to have you on toast and know each day what your margin is. I fully support what Senator Fielding is trying to do, I want to support him, but I wonder if he could give some consideration—maybe calling on the assistance of Senator Murray as well—to having a look at what the opinion is on whether we could get some form of screening so that not every detail of what a person is doing is out there for every person in the public to see.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-09-13,"—I rise to support this amendment. The Treasurer has said loudly and often that he supports truth and transparency, and that is what this amendment is effectively asking of the companies selling petroleum wholesale in Australia. I think that it is entirely appropriate that they specify the discounts and the supplies on offer and put on the internet each day the price or prices, including the amount of any discount or any other individual components in relation to each particular price and the criteria to qualify for the price or prices.
The community really objects to the fact that, just before a long weekend or holidays, petrol prices go up. They really object to the fact that when the pressure goes on suddenly petrol can be discounted, and discounted differentially around the country. I think it would be a great leap forward if we could at least allow the community to see exactly what the oil companies are doing when they are selling their product into the market—then you would be able to get some transparency in what is going on. I think that this is workable. One of the great things about modern communication and IT is that it is not beyond the wit of companies to do this. I think it would be a valuable contribution to the debate because, whenever there is pressure on petrol prices and when this kind of inexplicable behaviour goes on, parliaments have yet another inquiry into petrol prices. Frankly, the community is getting pretty cynical about the 70 or so inquiries into petrol prices. I think that they think that politicians just have another inquiry looking into it to take the political heat off themselves and that is the end of it. To avoid ongoing inquiries into petrol prices, the obvious things to do to are to strengthen the powers of the ACCC, to improve the Trade Practices Act and to provide better transparency and disclosure so that the community can go to those websites and see exactly what is being proposed. I think it is a worthwhile amendment and I support it.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-13,"—With great respect to Senator Fielding and the bona fides of his motives, the government do not support this amendment. We think that this is an extraordinarily heavy-handed approach to this issue, but it is an opportunity to remind the Senate that one of the great virtues of this package of legislation is what it does to improve the arrangements with regard to terminal gate prices from what has prevailed for virtually the whole time the old-fashioned and out-of-date sites act and franchise act have operated. We accepted that in the second reading speech, and the explanatory memorandum made it clear that one of the motivations and great virtues of the legislation is to vastly improve arrangements for independents and others with respect to terminal gate pricing. As the second reading speech notes:
The oilcode will also introduce a nationally consistent approach to terminal gate pricing arrangements to improve transparency in wholesale pricing and allow access for all customers, including small businesses, to petroleum products at a published terminal gate price.
It will overcome this problem we currently have of people in Western Australia and Victoria having an advantage over other states with respect to the arrangements that apply to terminal gate pricing.
Let us not forget that what we are doing with this legislation is a vast improvement on the current arrangements. We think we have the balance right. You must pay respect to the proper commercial arrangements that apply in all industries with respect to discounting. I am quite convinced that the very unfortunate and perhaps unintended consequence of this amendment would probably be to, in effect, end discounting at the great expense of consumers. Let us not forget that it is all very well to have a proper and well-placed concern for independents and small retailers, but all trade practices arrangements in any nation like ours must have equal regard for the interests of consumers, and consumers are the beneficiaries of discounting to the extent that it occurs. We are not prepared to embrace heavy-handed red tape amendments which could possibly, and we think probably, result in higher petrol prices than might otherwise apply. This amendment would be, in our view, an undue infringement on proper commercial arrangements. It is one thing for this Oilcode to set out nationally transparent arrangements in relation to terminal gate pricing, but every day in the commercial world private parties come to arrangements on discounting; it is a common practice in lots of industries. Who are the beneficiaries of that? Consumers. We pay less for the product than we otherwise would.
The amendment would bring about extraordinarily heavy-handed arrangements—and I think Senator Joyce was trying to make this point—where the wholesale supplier would make available to the public each day on an internet website maintained by the wholesale supplier the price or prices, including the amount of any discount; other individual components in relation to each particular price; and the criteria to qualify for the price or prices. This is, quite frankly, extraordinary stuff. It is unduly heavy-handed. While we respect the motives, the government’s point of view is that it is unacceptable and blinds the Senate to the point that this Oilcode goes an enormous way to overcoming the current inadequacies with regard to terminal gate pricing. So the government are opposed to this amendment.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-13,"—I just cannot let that go. Here we are pulling the rug out from underneath independent service stations. They already have their backs to the wall and here is the government hell bent on seeing them disappear. This is a joke. I heard the minister saying that this will hinder discounting—‘stop discounting’ were his words. That is so far from the truth that it is not funny. We are talking about a very serious issue here. Petrol and its supply are essential. Talk to people off the street. I did that this morning and you can see a video blog on my website of me talking to someone off the street.
This is an absolute joke. It is an indictment. This is a commonsense amendment that the government is paying lip service to. I cannot believe that there is only one National Party senator willing to speak on this issue. This is all about independent small businesses. Yesterday, in the committee stage debate on the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006, we also heard of amendments which would have protected and made sure that we had real competition.
This issue is starving independents of knowing what they have to do to reach a discounted price. We need to make sure we have a level playing field. We should not be pulling the rug out from underneath independent service stations. Talk to people out there. Talk to families and share with them. They do not know what is happening today. They have no idea what is happening in here today because this government has not shared with the public what we are doing here and what impact it will have down the track. So I appeal again to the government to have commonsense.
This is a fair and reasonable amendment to show that we have open and transparent pricing. It is an essential good. We cannot do without it today and we need to make sure that we are allowing independents to survive in this marketplace. Again, I appeal to the government to support this amendment.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-13,"—I must just add a brief commentary to this debate. Quite plainly, the amendment does not stop volume discounting. Quite plainly, if you buy a million litres you are going to get a better price than if you buy 100 litres. The amendment does not stop that; it simply requires the supplier—of which there are very few, by the way, in Australia—to make their price list available to the thousands of retailers. So that is what will happen. If you buy a million litres you might get extended credit terms, a certain discount level and faster delivery. Those are the terms and conditions. If you buy 100 litres you will pay a lot more, wait a lot longer and probably have to pay cash. That is how it will be. This amendment is to do with the principle of laying out for customers like terms for like customers. So big people will still get much better terms and conditions than small people. That is the market. That is the world. That is how it operates.
I seldom refer to my own experience but I speak to you with the benefit of several decades of multinational retailing and an understanding of the principles that surround it. That does not prevent hard, capable negotiators from sitting down and bending the arms of the suppliers. It does not stop that at all. There is nothing in this that prohibits that. But this amendment requires that there be a properly available price list. It is required daily because that is the way the market is. The market in petroleum products—which by and large are commodities that are not highly differentiated—is priced on a daily basis. That is why the amendment says that it should be daily.
So I can understand the minister wishing to argue for a world of secret, backroom deals and cosy arrangements, because that is how it works at the present, but it is not a principle I or my party subscribe to. We believe that people who supply suppliers in a modern market economy must put up their price lists and must say what the terms and conditions are for varying types of customers. That is all this amendment is saying.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-13,"—The weakness in the government’s argument on this matter is demonstrated by evidence that the Senate Standing Committee on Economics has taken from various petrol retailers through its current inquiry, and also from the comments that various retailers have made on the public record about their inability to obtain the same terms as their competitors in the same small market—the same town. Some independents are saying that they are not able to purchase their fuel at the same price as their competitors who are being supplied by the large companies. So Senator Joyce ought to think carefully about the concern that he had because—although I understand that some people might think it is advantageous that on the occasion that they get a slightly better deal they do not want people to know about it—overall in the market place if one business is, for no reason other than the preference of the supplier, getting a better deal and that better deal is not available to the independents, Senator Joyce will be defeating the arguments that he has placed on the record about the need to ensure that independents are not forced out of the market. It is obviously the case that, if these arrangements have to be transparent, the ability to do different deals will not be available. That would be, I think, a better thing for the market.
I agree with Senator Murray that the suggestion that discounting would disappear is just not borne out by the facts. What happens when there is fuel that needs to be sold, when the wholesaler needs to move fuel on because more fuel is coming and tries to encourage retailers to buy at a particular time in the cycle because of these needs? That is going to ensure that there is more urgency about marketing the fuel in stock, and that will have an impact on discounting. There are a variety of reasons why discounting will continue, and blanket suggestions that somehow this regulatory arrangement will mean the abandonment of discounting are demonstrably wrong, I think.
Let’s look at the situation in the Perth retail market, where service stations have to notify the public of their price each morning and may not vary it. Does that end discounting? No. Does it give the public a better knowledge of what is going to be available during the day? Yes. Does it mean that price boards do not vary several times during the day? Yes. Does that mean that buyers have better knowledge in the market? Yes. You can always mount an argument about why secrecy might end a particular advantageous circumstance in the market, but overall the benefits of transparency in this very, very important market outweigh, in our view, the concerns about the lack of transparency in some commercial arrangements. This is a very important commodity to the Australian market and to transport, and to the extent that we can have a clear understanding of what is taking place we will arm the consumer and the retailer.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-13,"—I acknowledge the arguments of the minister on these issues. What we have today, though, is a clear statement by all that the terminal gate price is really not where it is at because, if we have to disclose the discounts, the discount is where it is at, not the terminal gate price. Everybody is in agreement on that issue. Having open and transparent disclosure of the terminal gate price really does not mean very much at all, because everybody is agreed on that here today—otherwise, they would not be arguing against this.
However, when I drive down the road past the car lots I do not see on a big sign the price that they have purchased every car for. When I go into a supermarket, I do not see the price they have purchased every product for. When I go into any form of retail outlet, I do not have free and unfettered knowledge of the price they purchased their product at. There is a position between the two, between having no knowledge and having unfettered knowledge. I have a concern that this amendment gives you unfettered knowledge of a product. I believe that creating a position for an independent ombudsman, on whom people could rely for commercial-in-confidence protection of their information and whose process for keeping the market fair would be reviewed and assessed by the parliament, is the middle ground that should be looked at.
As Senator O’Brien agrees with this without qualification, he therefore agrees, no doubt, that in any market, anywhere, everybody should have the ability to know exactly what price a person buys a product at. I am not saying I will not support this—I probably will—but I just say that it is clumsy and we could do it a lot better. There is a middle ground, and the middle ground is to have an independent ombudsman so that people could have some confidence that not everything about them is known to the public.
When I go to an independent service station, I need to know it is there, but just think about it. Let’s use another analogy: I can go into a jewellery shop and I can find out on the internet exactly what they purchased all their stock for. I can go into any store around town and I can find out exactly what they purchased their stock for. Is that a step too far? I think it is. I think there is a middle ground here. However, I have not put up the resolution that shows the middle ground. The overwhelming sentiment is that the terminal gate price is used to manipulate and drive independents out of the market. Independents can show you that they do not have the capacity to buy fuel at the price that one of the majors is selling it. That is obviously intrinsically unfair and will throw them out of the market. That is the issue that needs to be dealt with.
So on this issue we have agreement now throughout the room. Everybody has agreed that the terminal gate price is not where it is at. The terminal gate price is going to appear somewhere, but it is the discounts that matter. Everybody has agreed on that point and it is good to have that on the record. What that obviously states is that we have to find some mechanism to deal with the monitoring of the discounting—not get rid of the discounting but make sure that discounting is not used as a predatory pricing factor to force independents out of the market.
My reservations are that I do not believe that everybody has a right to know the exact price that people purchase a product at. Let’s take it to an agricultural analogy—not that I have any cattle, but imagine I do. When I sell cattle, do I have to announce to everybody what price I purchased them at? It does not stand to reason.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-13,"—I think we have probably heard all we need to hear on this issue, frankly. Quite clearly this is just an attempt to undermine the independents even further. We need transparent pricing. We could go on all day on this topic and obviously not agree that we need transparency, so I think we should take a vote on this issue now. We have heard all the arguments for both cases that we are going to hear. We need transparency in pricing.
—The question is that amendment (1) on sheet 5033 moved by Senator Fielding be agreed to.
Question put.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-13,"—I move amendment (2) on sheet 5045:
(2)    Schedule 2, page 4 (after line 13), at the end of the Schedule, add:
4  Section 95A (at the end of the definition of goods)
Add:
       ; and (f)     petroleum products.
Obviously, the Trade Practices Act has to have the power of review to be able to monitor what is going on in the pricing structure. We have just had Senator Fielding’s amendment. The reason I supported it is that, although it is clumsy, at least it gives us a starting position. I think we can do something better than that—and I think amendment (2) is something better than that. My amendment provides a monitoring ability in the Trade Practices Act. It puts in place some sense of belief in a commercial-in-confidence arrangement to look at fuel pricing. It is an addendum which adds petroleum products to a number of other things that are in section 95A of the Trade Practices Act. Obviously, there is our belief in the ability of the Trade Practices Act to have surveillance over a whole range of products. Why can’t we include petroleum products? We have made the statement in legislation that there are a range of other products that deserve the ability to be monitored, and I think petroleum products should be amongst them. It is a minor amendment.
Although I supported Senator Fielding’s amendment, the problem I have with it is that it shows everybody’s underwear, although at least it gets the ball rolling. If that amendment had been successful, I would certainly have supported a watering down to an independent ombudsman. But it might have been the only chance we had, so I supported it to at least get the ball rolling. This amendment gives a better process to something that is already in place and that the government is happy with. We already have Trade Practices Act monitoring of products in place, and this amendment adds petroleum products to the list of products.
I respect what the minister said about the previous amendment. Although I agree with the sentiment of a vast amount of what he said, we had to start somewhere; we had to get the debate to a point where we acknowledged that the terminal gate price is not transparent. Having everybody know the terminal gate price is of no real assistance, because the discounting mechanism is where the game is at. We have to have in place a mechanism that at least allows some sort of power of review, power of commentary, and the ability to look at what is happening, especially with regard to independents—and we have gone through why independents are so important.
First and foremost, the Trade Practices Act protects the manifest right of the Australian public to go into business at ground level—and that is a strong belief of anybody on the conservative side of government. It protects independents, who lead in price discounting and are absolutely instrumental in getting biorenewables out into the market. We know that. It gives people in small business the latitude to be master of their own ship, to be master of their own thoughts, to follow their own destiny, to properly connect themselves to the wealth of their own nation and to have a higher sense of freedom. When asked what they want out of their work, 95 per cent of people come out with a clear statement that one day they want to be their own boss. A lot of them never get there but they all have that desire. I hope that has been plumbed on this side of the chamber and that we can give people that freedom and that innate sense that one day they will be master of their own ship. We need to protect the mechanism of people going into business, and the addition of petroleum products to section 95A of the Trade Practices Act will allow that to happen. It will be fascinating to listen to the debate. I hope that such a minor amendment can gather some support.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I will preface my comments with a slight proviso. I would like the minister to tell me it is not the case that the ACCC already monitors petrol prices and that this amendment would therefore slightly expand the monitoring role to other commodities that might be described as ‘petroleum products’. That would potentially be the nature of the change, depending on the interpretation of the words ‘petroleum products’. If that is the case, I do not think we will be doing any great harm in passing this amendment. It would have been better if the committee had supported Labor’s amendment, which would have empowered the parliament to authorise a thorough investigation by the ACCC into petroleum products. I am of course disappointed that none of the coalition senators was prepared to support that proposal, and I am disappointed that the Treasurer chose not to exercise his powers to hold such an inquiry in all the time that he has been Treasurer, as he could have done under the legislation. So, on the understanding that the impact would potentially be to extend that monitoring process to a range of products beyond petrol—and I am not sure how widely the term ‘petroleum products’ would be interpreted—we do not think this amendment would do any great harm.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-13,"—Can I just assure the opposition that, on the basis of the advice that I have, it is the case that the ACCC already does have the requisite powers to monitor the pricing of all petroleum products, not just petrol—diesel and LPG, and all the rest of it, are covered. When Graeme Samuel, in his many statements, makes the point that there is that monitoring going on, he is referring to all petroleum products. On the basis of our satisfaction that section 155 of the Trade Practices Act already gives the ACCC the power to take requisite action to instigate an investigation if it believes that there is any anticompetitive conduct, conduct that has come to its attention as a result of the monitoring that it does, we cannot support this amendment.
We do not think it is an appropriate amendment. We think the powers that are sought by the passage of this amendment already exist. I think it is clear from other statements made by Mr Samuel as the requisite authority that, as he said—and I have read some of his evidence to our current Senate committee of inquiry—the ACCC really do not believe that there is, nor do they have evidence of, any widespread corruption, illegal conduct et cetera.
This is an industry—and we were just discussing this—where it is amazing how everybody knows, almost on a daily basis, the prices being charged for these products. If you asked anybody in the street, they would certainly know the price of a litre of petrol but they would be hard-pressed to know the price of a litre of beer or a litre of milk. So there is an extraordinary focus on this issue but extraordinary transparency in terms of retail pricing.
As I say, we think that the ACCC, really, because of this public interest in it, is exercising properly its current responsibilities with respect to price monitoring. It has the requisite powers to investigate and there have been, already, a couple of actions taken by the ACCC of its own volition. So we think this is an unnecessary amendment and one that we cannot support.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-13,"—What we will have to do is get a copy of section 95A of the Trade Practices Act. There is a list of products in that section. I can see the minister has now got that list to have a look over it; I am trying to dig it up from my office as well. Obviously, this is a technical amendment. The minister might confirm whether petroleum products are in that list; I believe they are not, and that is the reason this amendment has been sought.
Obviously I do not pretend to be a bard of law but, if there is already the ability to monitor petroleum products, then there should be no problem in supporting this, because all you are really doing is reinforcing the position that is there. And I have here—thank you very much, Senator Murray—a copy of the act and I see that, at section 95A, it says that, for price surveillance:
“goods” includes:
ships, aircraft and other vehicles; and
animals, including fish; and
minerals, trees and crops, whether on, under or attached to land or not; and
water; and
gas and electricity.
So, we see that petroleum products are not there. We want to put petroleum products on that list, to give greater effect to part VIIA—Prices Surveillance. That will give us, over a period of time, greater powers for monitoring petroleum products. That is why this technical amendment has been asked for and, seeing as petroleum products are not listed in 95A, as just described, I ask the committee to consider whether that amendment should be allowed.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-13,"—For the purposes of properly informing the committee or confirming what Senator Joyce is saying, there is this part VIIA—Prices Surveillance of the Trade Practices Act and that is what this amendment seeks to deal with. It refers to the definition of ‘goods’, and says that that includes:
ships, aircraft and other vehicles; and
animals, including fish; and
minerals, trees and crops, whether on, under or attached to land or not; and
water; and
gas and electricity.
That is a rather interesting list of things! And it is Senator Joyce’s proposal that we add, to that rather odd and eclectic list, ‘petroleum products’. As I am—may I say, informally—advised, because I am no expert on the Trade Practices Act, I must confess, these goods are those which the minister may direct the commission formally to investigate with respect to pricing behaviour.
It is a very special and separate section of the act. I think it is about giving the minister certain authority to order investigations, and it is separate and apart from the general role of the commission in general price monitoring. Of course it needs to do that if it is to establish a base on which to exercise powers, under section 155, to initiate an investigation to see if there is any illegal or improper conduct. That is why it does that sort of widespread monitoring.
This is a quite separate exercise. This is an old prices surveillance regime which has been around for a long time. But really it is about the minister having certain authorities. So we do not see the purpose or need to add petroleum products to part VIIA—Prices Surveillance list—a list, as I say, that is a rather eclectic and odd group of goods—because we think the current arrangements are working more than adequately, and I think Graeme Samuel would support that very much.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-13,"—Minister, I share your amusement. I am sometimes intrigued by the sorts of things that have found their way into legislation. There must be a history of some sort to this: ‘minerals, trees and crops, whether on, under or attached to land or not’. Can you imagine a crop that is under the land? I suppose that means potatoes and things.
—Or peanuts.
—Or peanuts, which interestingly are a legume, not a nut. So there we are. I also sympathise with the minister’s advisers, because I suspect the advisers available on this bill are not advisers who commonly deal with the Trade Practices Act either; that falls under a different agency and authority.
This particular amendment goes to the heart of the problem which is being explored by the Senate committee, which perhaps is groping towards a better understanding. The problem, as outlined in Mr Samuel’s evidence, is that the ACCC can presently only go so far in monitoring the conduct of petroleum suppliers and companies. Unless they have evidence of predatory or other behaviour which contravenes the act, they are only able to monitor prices on the basis of what information is publicly available or is supplied voluntarily by the companies. The issue that the Senate committee is grappling with is how to get more detailed, more insightful and more informed knowledge into the hands of the ACCC—effectively, to use the phrase which is commonly used, to get behind the corporate veil. One of the ways in which that can be done is to either assume or adopt ASIC type powers—which is the route down which I have been going—which work very effectively in areas like continuous disclosure reporting requirements and so on. The alternative is to have ministerial discretion. The problem with ministerial direction is that it becomes a political decision—a minister, to take a decision, has to receive evidence and effectively is saying, ‘We think we’ve got enough to nab you and we’re sending the ACCC after you.’ It is much better if the ACCC is in fact pursuing these matters as part of its normal regulatory activity.
When this list was originally compiled, it is my assumption that some of the items were particularly sensitive. I was not there when they were put in, but I suspect that they were areas of the economy which had particular attention applying to them. I can see the hands of The Nationals perhaps in items (b) and (c). Items (d) and (e) are definitely still current. Item (a) has probably fallen off the list a little except with regard to some specific areas. Unlike the shadow minister, whom I think is also operating in a system where trade practices issues are not a common feature of his particular responsibilities, I suspect it is not a question of this amendment not doing much harm but rather a question of the amendment giving greater power to a minister of the Crown to instruct the ACCC to attend to a particular area. Of course it does not mean that they automatically will, because, as I said, it is a political decision and a great deal rests on these sorts of decisions. If you were of the view that ministers should have this sort of direction, then the question is: what industries deserve to be covered?
If we are all in agreement that petroleum products are a crucial strategic as well as consumer good which is a necessity, then probably it does deserve to be on this list along with water, gas and electricity—and perhaps others deserve to be off the list. I would suggest to the minister, through the chair and without any impertinence, that—even though you are bound, I suspect, to reject it by virtue of your brief—it is the sort of issue that the government needs to think about a bit more in terms of what should actually be on this list for ministerial direction and whether petroleum products may in fact qualify. I am grateful to Senator Joyce for drawing this to my attention. I must confess that, despite having trade practices law as one of my portfolio responsibilities, I have never looked at this before and I am absolutely delighted to find that minerals, trees and crops, whether on, under or attached to land or not, are subject to ministerial direction. I guess on balance, given that I am involved in the Senate inquiry and given that I think there is a need for added focus on this area, I would support the amendment because I think there is still that threshold determination: the minister will have to make a decision. It is not as if this implies an automatic function.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-13,"—There are two key issues here. Obviously I do not have the advantage of having three advisers, so I am doing this from memory—and on a technical amendment you must give me some latitude. Under the TPA, part VIIA monitoring powers as directed by the minister are far greater than those the ACCC has. The powers he has under section 155 are greater. This does not mean that it is going to happen; it means that the minister has the discretion to make it happen if they so choose. I think the minister should trust himself on this one—that if he is required to use them then he will, and if he does not require them then he will not. It would be good for the Senate to pass an amendment to give the minister these powers. If we have a concern that we may have an overcentralisation of the market, that there may be an oligopoly type arrangement, then surely we should have the ability to give the minister the power of review. This is a funny circumstance because it is actually the Senate trying to hand greater powers to the minister: a power of review. The trouble with the ACCC is that it cannot really go on fishing expeditions. It cannot just go wandering off in the vain hope that it might find something. But this amendment would mean that, on the direction of the minister, they would have far greater powers in what they can ascertain and what they can catch in their net.
The purpose of this amendment is to deal with a market that is absolutely vital to the overheads of every Australian and the freedom of every Australian—that is, fuel—and to acknowledge the power that petroleum products have in our market. In acknowledging what a vital component petroleum products are in the running of our economy, we should have a greater power of review in that area and a greater power of monitoring. If the minister of the day at some future time decides not to exercise it, so be it. But they have the discretion; it is there.
I hope we get some support for this amendment. There is a difference in powers to what is there currently. It increases them and puts them at the discretion of the minister. I am not quite sure whether the National Party had their fingers over the other ones—it sounds awfully like they did. It is maybe with a sense of nostalgia that we dig up section 95A again and bring it into the 21st century. I am glad that the committee is now aware of this section. It was brought up in the inquiries—it did not descend on me like a dove—that wanting greater powers under part VIIA was one of the issues. The ministerial direction powers are what a lot of people had been asking for during fuel inquiries. This is the only section of the Trade Practices Act where we could deliver that.
I asked the committee to strongly consider this. I appreciate the motives that have been put up already. I hope that we trust ourselves to have the ability to deal with a minor increase in power under section 95A. I hope that we trust ourselves to use it with responsibility, which I am sure the government will. I am sure the government intends to be responsible in its discretion on the use of this power. I hope it gives itself the responsibility to have that.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-13,"—To conclude, we are grateful to Senator Joyce for drawing our attention to this section, which I think is a hangover from the old Prices Surveillance Commission and got moved into this act. I think the senator is quite right in saying that I might suggest to the Treasurer that we should have a look at this list. It is an extraordinary list of items and it probably is timely that it be reviewed, but I would draw to the attention of the committee that the object of this part as stated in the act is to have prices surveillance—and that is defined in this act, and it is a very rigorous sort of regime that is different to the price monitoring which the ACCC does in the normal course of events—applied only in those markets where, in the view of the minister, competitive pressures are not sufficient to achieve efficient prices and protect consumers. It is a very particular regime. As I say, it is a rather eclectic list which has gathered over time—and I am not sure that we are necessarily particularly worried about the supply of ships in terms of prices surveillance at the moment!—so I think there is a good case for reviewing this list.
But I would also note that Mr Samuel himself made the point in evidence to the current Senate inquiry that there are 6,500 petrol outlets operating throughout Australia. There would appear to be vigorous competitive activity occurring in the sale of fuel, as reflected by the fairly vigorous price cycles that occur on a weekly basis, if nothing else. In the absence of price competition, you would not see the volatility of those price cycles. He is making it clear that he sees this as one of the most competitive industries we have in Australia. I am not sure that it automatically does fit into the quite strict and particular regime that is provided for in part VIIA of the TPA and, therefore, I am certainly not in the position to say that the government could support adding petroleum products to this list. But I am certainly happy to suggest to the Treasurer that he might want to review this particular list and bring it up to date.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2006-09-13,"—I suppose that is where the quandary is. There is a strong belief that the market is being manipulated. If you just look at the fundamentals of where the price of diesel is—I know this is drawing a long bow, but it is interesting to have it on the record—the price of diesel in Iraq at the moment is 3c a litre. There is a lot of latitude between what we are buying it at and what they are buying it at. I know that there are government taxes, profits and transport, but the person in the street has some serious queries about how it comes about that all these oil companies, from 3c a litre in Iraq, go to $1.20 or $1.30 here and manage to arrive within a couple of cents of each other. That suggests to a lot of people that there might be some manipulation of the market.
This amendment does give greater powers. We are heading towards an oligopoly relationship. The proof of that is there for everyone driving down the street to see: that incredible scenario where, within an hour, they all move up by the same price on the same road—apparently without communicating it to one another. It is remarkable: petrol stations have an innate sense of what their competition is doing and they follow it innately! The argument goes through the public over and over again as to whether we can get more stringent on this. You have to look through the Trade Practices Act to find the section that does it, because the sentiments about price surveillance that the public reflects to us are dealt with in this section. In the Trade Practices Act 1974, it might have been ships. There might have been a problem with peanuts and spuds—I do not know—but the belief of the public now is that there is a problem with fuel. This amendment does not change the world; it just hands the power to the minister to have a greater capacity to look through what is happening in the fuel market. If he believes that there is not a reason to do it, he will not. But if he believes that there is a reason to do it—and hello to the kids up in the gallery!—then he has those powers at his disposal.
I suppose the argument that we need to consider is: why would the minister not want those powers of review and the ability to say: ‘I am the minister, I can go on a fishing expedition. I can monitor this for a period. I can dig up every detail. I have the power. I have been elected by the Australian people. I have a responsibility of office to ensure that the people of our nation are being treated fairly, and I will do that.’ You do not have to worry about the ACCC stumbling across something or something being brought to their attention. He can actually say: ‘I’ve heard what the people have to say. They have a problem with this—bingo, here are the powers. We’ll have surveillance on the petroleum products for the period starting here and ending there, and we can clear the air on this one.’ Then no longer will we have to listen to talkback radio talking about people being touched, because the minister will be able to clearly lay down the law. I think the oil majors and the major retailers will sit up and pay attention, because it will no longer be under the direction of the ACCC. It will be under the direction of the minister. There is greater power under part VIIA and in using section 155 of the TPA. This can actually assist in providing clarity and confidence to the Australian motoring public about the fairness in the marketplace. I know it is an old analogy, but if they do not find anything then isn’t that a better scenario? They monitored it, they found nothing. Then you can go back to the Australian public and say: ‘We looked at it, the minister has looked at it and he found nothing.’ It is a scenario that suggests, ‘We do not want to give ourselves those powers, because we might find something,’ and that is the issue that is dealt with in this amendment.
Question put:

"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-13,"—The opposition support this legislation, and we agree that it is time to move on from the previous regime of regulation in this area. We are, however, extremely concerned that the competition model that underpins the new environment ought to be the best we can achieve. We are concerned that the Dawson reforms have not yet been given passage and that the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) has not yet been given passage. We would prefer that those things had happened before this new regime came into effect.
With that intent we understand that the government will be using its best endeavours to achieve that end by the time of our proposed operation of this legislation, which is 1 March 2007. We are caught in the dilemma of wanting three things to occur, but we are not prepared to stand in the way of the implementation of this legislation awaiting that. We think it is appropriate to set an operative date that gives the best possibility of the achievement of those three objectives.
I move opposition amendment (1) appearing on sheet 5055, which will have the effect of causing this bill, if passed at the third reading and going through the appropriate processes, to come into effect from 1 March 2007:

These are timely. We also agree that the so-called Dawson amendments and our proposed amendments to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act are important and that they need to be put in place. We hope that we can pass them through this parliament as soon as practicable; certainly, there is much endeavour to bring that about.
Again, in that spirit, we are happy to accept the opposition amendment with respect to the start date and that the start date be 1 March 2007. We will not oppose the amendment. We accept the spirit in which the opposition has participated in this debate and acknowledge the importance of the Dawson reforms and the form of section 46.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-13,"—If I were to sum up my and the Democrats view on this bill in one sentence it is that we would support the legislation that is before the chamber if it were accompanied by the trade practices strengthening amendments that are required. We are not opposed to the bill; what we are opposed to is that it has arrived on its own.
I think I made it clear in the second reading debate, but I will restate it for the purposes of this amendment, that what we have argued for is that the Dawson trade practices bill, the trade practices bill which is designed to strengthen the Trade Practices Act with respect to section 46 and the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill 2006 should all have been dealt with cognately—or, if not cognately, at least sequentially, in the same week. We could then have dealt with this more easily.
Of course, we have particular views on the Dawson bill; we are strongly opposed to elements of it. We are delighted that, as a result of the effort of The Nationals, as I understand it, the Treasurer withdrew the alterations to third-line forcing, which were detrimental to a better competition regime. But we remain strongly opposed to the antichoice, antiunion provision in the Dawson bill—which is not part of the Dawson committee’s recommendations anyway—and we remain deeply concerned about the changes to the merger decisions capacity of the ACCC commissioner and the ACCC tribunal. We think that could lead to forum shopping and to a less rigorous approach than is currently adopted. Of course, the Dawson bill itself may occasion quite a bit of debate when it comes forward.
With respect to the trade practices bill, which covers off small business amendments that strengthen the Trade Practices Act, we are likely to support the amendments. We just do not think they go far enough. We are not being bloody-minded about this. We would accept the will of the Senate, but what we want is the opportunity for the will of the Senate to be expressed so that with this bill, which deregulates the petroleum market and provides more competition among the oil majors, you would have an accompanying set of changes to the Trade Practices Act which introduce a stronger competition regime.
Restating our position in short, as I have just done—I have done it at great length elsewhere, particularly in my speech at the second reading stage—it is obvious that we would support the opposition’s amendment because it gives the government time to bring forward what it should. But of course it does not provide a guarantee that that will happen. That is my difficulty. As I have said previously in this debate, I have been both frustrated and upset by what I have seen as a spiteful approach whereby, because there has been disagreement within the coalition regarding these matters, the Treasurer and the cabinet have refused to bring forward a trade practices bill which should have accompanied this bill and should have allowed us all the comfort of knowing that, while independents were likely to face even stronger big company competition than they have to date, they would be better protected by a strengthened Trade Practices Act.
In conclusion, I support, on behalf of the Democrats, the amendment, but I do hope that the minister—because I am sure he has support for that view—will be prevailed upon to give a guarantee, a commitment, that these bills will be brought before the chamber prior to this date. If the minister could give us that guarantee and commitment on the floor of the chamber I would be much comforted. He can do that. He is the Leader of the Government in the Senate. He does have the numbers. The legislative program is in his hands. If he gives me that commitment and guarantee here and now, our attitude to the overall bill will change and we will be much more comforted than we have been to date.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2006-09-13,"—As Senator Murray has just indicated, the main concern the Greens have had with the repeal bill before us is precisely that it does not deal with the Dawson reforms and the strengthening of section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. We do not know when the government intends to deal with those matters. We are just being asked to take on good faith the fact that they will be dealt with in a timely manner. If you were a cynic you could suggest that this amendment has been brought forward so that the government and the opposition can shelve this issue because they do not want to be forced to a division on the third reading. I am described at times as being cynical, but one could assume that.
Just this week we were reminded again of the government’s promise that within 100 days of a coalition government being elected a mandatory code of conduct would be introduced for the retail grocery trade. What has happened? We are two years into the government’s term and the 100-day promise seems to have been forgotten. The Prime Minister has done a triple backflip with pike on this issue. We simply do not know what they are going to do on the matter. I am disinclined to support a proposition that says: ‘Let’s get together as the opposition and the government and shelve this until March next year, until the heat goes out of it. Let’s just leave it until we get into an election year and see how the cookie crumbles and what people are saying about it. Let’s see how the oil companies and the independents have reacted to it and then decide how far we’ll go with the trade practices reform.’
We do not know what is contained in the bills and what is being proposed. I am not inclined to take the government at its word on this. For that reason—unless the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Minchin, can stand up and give us a watertight guarantee that this matter will be dealt with and will come before this chamber before the said date, which is 1 March 2007—I am not prepared to support the amendment. It could be seen as a cynical ploy to quieten down this issue until the government repositions and decides what to do and how far to go on section 46 in an election year. On that basis I will be very interested to hear exactly what the government is proposing and to hear an undertaking that it will definitely come before the chamber before 1 March next year. Otherwise, I am disinclined to support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech

It is a case of whether things happen now or later and whether, if the protection is put in place, it should be supported. I would happily see the heat go out of the debate. It is not about scoring political points; it is about getting a protection mechanism in place for small business. That is the driving issue. If we can achieve that it would be a good outcome. Obviously, I would support amendments that seek protection for the independents. I know there is a difference of opinion. Some people believe there is protection in the legislation and I believe there is not. I take my belief that that is the case from Senate inquiries and from the presentations of the peak body groups that have visited my office. What is the option? A delay is better than failure because in the period of delay there is a chance of other pieces of legislation coming together in such a form as to provide that protection.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2006-09-13,"—I am not in the practice of giving guarantees in this place that I cannot honour—that is certainly not the way I behave. I am not the lead minister on the Dawson bill or the section 46 amendments; they are a matter for the Treasurer. I am not involved in the detailed negotiation behind the timing of the debate on those bills, so I am simply not in a position here and now to give any such guarantee. But I have undertaken, in the words of Senator O’Brien, to ensure that the government’s best endeavours will be directed towards ensuring the passage of those two pieces of legislation prior to the commencement of this provision on 1 March 2007 and the ALP amendment which we have accepted.
I will give my word to the Senate that I will certainly be active within the government to ensure that we do seek to achieve that objective, but I am simply not in a position to give guarantees that I cannot be sure can be delivered. I do undertake to use best endeavours to ensure that comes about. That is the government’s objective. Our detailed proposition with respect to the Dawson package is on the table. The details of our proposals with respect to section 46 are on the table. The Senate, the parliament and the community are well aware of what the government has in mind. I certainly, for my own sake, very much hope that they will be in place by 1 March 2007 and, within the government, I will seek to ensure that occurs, but I am not able to respond to the request to give absolute, unconditional guarantees.",SENATE,<title>PETROLEUM RETAIL LEGISLATION REPEAL BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,1,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2006-09-13,"—Let us try and get to the nub of the issue here. Family First believes that this bill will pull the rug out from independents. This amendment just delays that fact. I will support the delaying of it. It is better than actually having it happen earlier. But really, we have had no assurances at all in this chamber, so senators will have to think very carefully about how they vote on the third reading, given that we have had no assurances. In actual fact, if you went on form on the reform of the Trade Practices Act just recently, you would find that the government has been very mischievous in trying to tie helping small businesses to stopping collective bargaining from proceeding. It takes one minute to pass a bill in the lower house. The Senate has made it quite clear on collective bargaining that it should go ahead but the government stubbornly refuses to go down that track because it wants to make it easier for big business to merge. The Senate would not have a bar of it and the lower house should pass that immediately. So that is the form on trade practices reform. Here we are talking about delaying it on the pretence that there may be some amendments to the Trade Practices Act arising from the Dawson review. The form so far is that it is not fair dinkum; it is not reasonable. Family First will support the delaying of it, but I certainly at this stage will not be supporting the third reading.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-09-13,"—Mr Chairman, before we start the committee proceedings I table a supplementary memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 5 September 2006.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I have an amendment but I will not move it at this time. I have some questions, arising out of those amendments, that I would not mind a response to. It was pointed out in a submission by Allens Arthur Robinson that the restriction of cash dealers to ADIs in sections 17FA and 17FB would lead to noncompliance with special recommendation VII. When asked whether this was the case, the response from the Attorney-General’s Department, as far as I can see, did not quite answer the question. The Attorney-General’s Department said in section 4 of its answer to the first question on notice that the limitation in the FTR Act framework meant that special recommendation VII obligations could only be applied in a more limited class than would be the case when the AMLCTF bill is enacted at a later date.
Provisions in the AMLCTF bill comply with special recommendation VII, so I am curious as to the answer to the original question. Should we assume that it applies in a more limited class—and is that a euphemism for noncompliance? I will go through that again. Allens Arthur Robinson pointed out that the restriction of cash dealers to ADIs in sections 17FA and 17FB would lead to noncompliance with special recommendation VII. The answer given did not seem to address that issue. The answer was that the limitation in the FTR Act framework meant that special recommendation VII obligations could only be applied in a more limited class than would be the case when the AMLCTF bill is enacted at a later date. As you can see, that does not quite answer the question.
I will go on to other things while you reflect on that. Perhaps it is worth while to talk a little about this issue. This bill amends changes to the Financial Transaction Reports Act which were enacted last year by the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 but have not yet gone into operation. The bill before the Senate is regrettable in that it has amendments to a poorly drafted piece of legislation which the government rushed through in 2005. But it is less than a year since we passed the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 into law and already we have returned to fix this piece of legislation. Not only that, but we have also brought in further amendments to fix it again—and it seems to be only on an interim basis, in any event. I am happy for that to be clarified further in the committee stage.
It seems to me that the provisions in the ATB have not yet even come into force. Already, the government has been forced to concede that there are significant problems not only in the bill itself but also in the explanatory memorandum that further amends that legislation. It has gone so far that it seems to me that the government now concedes that this legislation as it stands, without this amendment, would destroy legitimate businesses when it goes into operation.
It would be helpful if we understood as well—and you might want to take this question on notice during the committee stage—what feedback has been received, from what industries, to indicate that, and when it was received by industry. It seems to me that industry was not consulted in the first instance. In addition to that, if this is going to be, as I understand it, an interim solution, will it then be resolved in the first or second tranche of the AMLCTF legislation? Is it going to be rectified or covered again in the first tranche? The bill is currently in an exposure draft, on which the government has received submissions, but it has not yet been introduced into this chamber.
The provisions introduced by the Anti-Terrorism Act, which this bill amends, implement the special recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, in relation to combating terrorism funding. FTAF is an intergovernmental body designed to develop and promote policies to combat international money-laundering and terrorist financing. To that end, as we know, there are 40 recommendations on anti money laundering and, since September 11, a further nine special recommendations in relation to the financing of terrorist activity.
The history of the situation so far is that in 2003 the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, promised that we would have an updated financial transaction report brought into line with those special and general recommendations. It is now more than three years since that promise to bring the legislation before the parliament. The minister could indicate in this debate when that bill is likely to be brought forward. As I understand it, there is a commitment for that legislation to go to a committee as well for a further look. The minister could also provide assurances that that will be the case and that there will be sufficient time for that committee to have a look at the legislation in toto.
It is a substantive piece of legislative drafting. I understand the department has been drafting it for some time—and I think that would be an understatement—with the draft legislation going back and forth between industry and the department. So the additional factor would be that the committee does have sufficient time to hear from industry—in other words, we need to allow sufficient time for it to be advertised and for us to hear from industry as to what issues may arise in respect of the bill, and then to allow the committee sufficient time to report back to parliament. If it is the intention of the minister to have the matter passed before the end of the year, time is now running out.
The other matters I will come to shortly, when I seek to move the amendment that I have made. But I will first give others the opportunity to participate in this debate and deal with some of the questions I have raised, if there are any to answer at this point; if there are not, I will go on with some other issues.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-13,"—Just before the minister responds to Senator Ludwig, I wish to say that I hope it is the intention of the government to refer the final bill to a committee. In his response, I would ask the minister to consider whether the appropriate committee would be the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs or the Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, because obviously the bill is of great interest from a corporate law perspective and from the perspective of matters which arise through the APRA regime, all of which have been matters of interest to the joint committee. Maybe you are not in a position to give an answer now or today, Minister, but you need to think carefully as to which committee you send it to.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-09-13,"—I wish to make it clear that the government does believe that this bill, when it is introduced, should be referred to a committee. I believe the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs would be an appropriate committee to deal with the bill. There was an exposure draft which we referred to that committee. It was done for the reason that this is a complex area and we wanted to give the committee a preliminary opportunity, if you like, to look at the legislation and to look at issues in the broad, so that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs now has a fairly good appreciation of the issues involved in this. I think that, for that reason, there would be benefit in sending the final bill, as introduced, to that committee. That is my thinking on that. Of course, it is up to the Senate as to what it refers, and I will not pre-empt that decision, but that would be the government’s view in relation to that.
In relation to the time line, Senator Ludwig has asked that there be adequate time, and it is certainly planned to introduce the bill in these sittings. The bill has the appropriate status for that to happen and I believe that the committee would have the time to look at the bill.
There has been extensive consultation in this process: two exposure drafts, which is quite unusual. The two exposure drafts have been the subject of comment by industry. Consultation is ongoing. Indeed, part of the consultation that was conducted in relation to this particular bill formed part of the broader consultation for the more general aspects of the legislation which we will be dealing with later.
In relation to Senator Ludwig’s other queries, I think that, of the question on notice he mentioned, I can say that, in relation to special recommendation VII of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, the amendments to restrict division 3A of part II of the FTR Act to authorise deposit-taking institutions will not achieve full compliance with special recommendation VII. I think that answers the question that Senator Ludwig posed.
That further compliance which is needed will be done under the bill—if I can call it this—which is dealing with the wider issue of anti-money-laundering reform. It will be dealt with when it is brought into the parliament. The amendments to schedule 9 of the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 are meant to provide an interim solution to the issues identified by the non-bank money remittance businesses. That is how we are approaching it with special recommendation VII.
In relation to the submissions by the private sector and when they were received, some of the government amendments that we are moving today are the product of consultation with the private sector, and I can indicate those when I deal with each of the government amendments in turn. If Senator Ludwig’s question is a broader one, dealing with all the submissions that we received and when they were received, then we will have to take that on notice.
—No, it’s a narrower one.
—Then I think I can address that, Senator Ludwig, when we come to each of the amendments in turn. As for the date we received them, I would have to take that question on notice. But I think I can cover that when we deal with the government amendments shortly. I think that covers all the issues we were dealing with.

21  Section 42A
After “3A”, insert “, 3AA”.

customer information, in relation to an international funds transfer instruction transmitted out of Australia, means the following information about the ordering customer on whose behalf, or at whose request, an ADI sends the instruction:
                    (i)    the ordering customer’s full business or residential address (not being a post office box);

unique reference number, for an international funds transfer instruction, means a combination of any or all of the following:
         (ii)   a unique reference number assigned to the instruction by the ordering organisation.

unique reference number, for an international funds transfer instruction, means a combination of any or all of the following:
This amendment will ensure that there is no gap in the legislation if an Australian bank which is asked to send a funds transfer instruction to a foreign bank is not able to deal directly with the foreign bank but has to deal through an intermediary bank in Australia. The amendment will provide that the intermediary bank is taken to be acting on behalf of the original customer and not the originating bank and will have the obligation to ensure that the relevant information accompanies the funds transfer instruction. The intermediary bank, however, will be able to act on any information it receives from the originating bank. It will not have to make its own inquiries of the original customer. That is a technical amendment and one which was identified during the drafting of this legislation.
The second amendment is the product of a suggestion by the Australian Bankers Association. This deals with the definition of customer information. This meets industry’s request to amend the definition of customer information in section 17FA(3) to better reflect the wording that will be used in section 67 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill. This amendment also inserts the definition of ‘unique reference number’ into section 17FA(3). This definition is consistent with that term as it will be defined in the AMLCTF Bill—that is the bill to be introduced.
Amendments (3) and (4) are again somewhat technical. Amendment (3) is the result of a request from AUSTRAC. It amends section 17FB(6) paragraph (b)(ii) to omit date and place of birth and substitute date of birth, the country and the town, city or locality of the ordering customer’s birth. Amendment (4) is another technical amendment that is consequential on government amendment (2). That amends section 17FB(6) paragraph (c)(ii) to now provide that a unique reference number assigned to the instruction by the ordering organisation be included in the international funds transfer instructions. The reference to the term ‘unique reference number’ is consistent with the definition of that term as it will appear in the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill.
The final government amendment deals with four aspects. The first inserts the definition of a unique reference number into section 17FB(6). This definition is consistent with the terms in which it will be defined in the AMLCTF Bill. That is a technical amendment recognised by government drafters. The second aspect of amendment (5) inserts a new section, 17FC. This amendment will ensure that the provision of complete customer information in an international funds transfer instruction is not required where that is transmitted from a place outside Australia to another place outside Australia and merely passes through Australia. This was a suggestion made by the Australian Bankers Association. It is a technical amendment and one which we think is a worthwhile suggestion. We have accordingly taken it up. The next aspect of amendment (5) deals with a drafting error. It amends section 29(4)(ba) that was inserted into the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 by schedule 9 of the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005 to refer to an authorised deposit-taking institution rather than a cash dealer to ensure consistency with the amendment to restrict division 3A of part II of the FTR Act to authorised deposit-taking institutions only. That is a technical amendment and one which has been recommended by the drafters. The final aspect of amendment (5) comes from a suggestion by AUSTRAC—and that is to amend section 42A, amendment of schedules by regulations, to include a reference to schedule 3AA as inserted into the FTR Act by schedule 9 of the ATA, the Anti-Terrorism Act (No. 2) 2005. Again, this is a technical amendment. That deals with all of the government amendments that are proposed. I commend those amendments to the committee.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-13,"—Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to the minister, I am going to ask the minister to take something on board which I think needs to be attended to. I am of the opinion that this bill needs to pass as rapidly as possible and that we need to get on with the anti-money-laundering legislation as fast as possible, for obvious reasons that I enunciated in my speech in the second reading debate and elsewhere. But I want to draw your attention to amendment (3). Through the chair, Minister, I have come across a large number of residents and citizens of Australia who do not know their date and place of birth. I was exposed to that first of all, and most materially, with respect to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into child migrants. I have discovered since that there are many circumstances—it probably runs into thousands; it is not a question of hundreds—where such individuals exist.
In the old days, the term used was ‘foundling’—abandoned children. Abandoned children did not know when they had been born or to whom they had been born. Often they knew where, of course, because they were found in a particular locality—unless like Moses they floated down a river, in which case you would not know where they had come from; although I understand that they did find that out in the end. This is a serious issue. I have had adult Australians who were child migrants, who believed themselves to be Australians, weeping in my office at the humiliation of being made to justify who they were and not being able to produce a birth certificate. If they had a birth certificate, it might have been wrong because they were put into an institution and the details about them were made up.
There have been instances of people who came into this country as child migrants being employed by and serving in the Australian armed forces—including in places like Vietnam—and later on, as adults, going overseas, losing their passport, applying for another one, not being able to prove who they were and being refused re-entry into the country in which they grew up. It really is a material issue for a small but sizeable number of Australian residents and citizens.
I would like to request through the chair, if the minister would take my remarks on board, that the department refer to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee’s reports on child migrants, Lost innocents, and Australian children in institutions, Forgotten Australians. With institutionalised children, including foundlings and people who do not know the details of their birth, birthplace and parents, we are talking about over 500,000 Australians last century. That is a sizeable proportion. My feeling is that some kind of protocol, process or mechanism is needed to deal with these circumstances if and when they arise, such as a statutory declaration process or some other means which addresses this problem. By my remarks, please do not infer that I am opposed to your amendment; I am not. I think it is perfectly reasonable for it to be as detailed as it is, but some people just will not be able to comply, and I suspect now and again it is going to prove a problem.
Really, my request through the chair to the minister is to take my remarks on board and think about whether this issue should be addressed in the forthcoming bill, which is to go to a committee, or addressed by some sort of regulatory or administrative process or means, because I suspect it will arise. It arises right now when people want to get married—they cannot say who they are and where they came from—when people apply for a passport, when they apply for bank facilities and so on. It is a problem, and the Senate has recognised it is a problem in its reports. I think, with respect to this sort of measure, the government should be alert to the fact that it might arise as a problem and you need to think about it.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-09-13,"—I will deal with that issue. Does the current legislation allow for the situation that Senator Murray has mentioned? I am aware of those cases that I have come across personally where people who have come to Australia from another country do not have that detail available as to date and place of birth, and I accept that it is an issue out there for some people. We do not want to disadvantage them because of that. The section which deals with this in the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 is section 17FB(6), which puts it this way:

customer information, in relation to an international funds transfer instruction transmitted into Australia, means the following information about the ordering customer on whose behalf, or at whose request, an ordering organisation sends the instruction:
It then lists the details that are required:
the ordering customer’s name—
You do need that, and that is straightforward. It goes on:
any one of the following:
the ordering customer’s full business or residential address (not being a post office box);
the ordering customer’s date and place of birth;
a unique identification number given to the ordering customer by a foreign government;
the identification number given to the ordering customer by the ordering organisation—
So there are four requirements there which are alternatives. I would suggest that, where you have someone in this position, who does not have their date and place of birth, the other three criteria could be met and any one of them would suffice, according to the wording of the section.
That said—and I would submit to the committee that it addresses the concern raised by Senator Murray—certainly I will take on board the comments by Senator Murray in dealing with this change to the legislation to ensure that in the private sector, as much as we can ensure it, no-one is disadvantaged in the application of this legislation and no-one is disadvantaged who is in the position of not knowing their date and place of birth because of reasons beyond their control. Certainly they should not be disadvantaged. I think the legislation does accommodate it because it prescribes it in the alternative, but I still take on board Senator Murray’s point. That is something we will bear in mind when we are looking at this.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I will deal with a couple of issues. The Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) in this instance, in terms of the amendments, moved to a position where there would be compliance with special recommendation VII. I am wondering whether the government accepts that position. Now we are retreating from full compliance with SR VII to the position where, because of the lack of consultation in the original bill, we have consultation which puts it in a position where industry will be substantially affected. I know those industries are cash dealers, but perhaps the government could give a more concrete example of who they are and, in particular, to what extent their businesses would be disrupted by this amendment. Perhaps they could also indicate whether or not there was a matter raised by the ABA or how it came to the attention of the department or the minister that there was a problem that needed to be retreated from or rectified. How long will it take before you will be fully compliant with SR VII, given that you now say, even after this bill, you will still not be compliant with it?",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-09-13,"—At the outset, I think it is fair to say that the government never said in the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) that we would be fully compliant with special recommendation VII. That piece of legislation was always acknowledged as being an immediate response which was needed, and further work would be done on the special recommendations made by FATF. Indeed, today I have said that, even after this bill, further aspects of special recommendation VII will be incorporated in the wider response. Certainly, I see the whole area of anti money laundering as being a work in progress. The area in which financial institutions work is ever changing—the products, the packages that people invest in and the way people structure their financial affairs. There is always something coming up in the financial sector which needs to be addressed, especially with emerging technology.
I would make very clear to the chamber that I would not regard the passing of any bill in relation to anti money laundering as being the final response. Further work will always be needed. With respect to special recommendation VII, it is fair to say that the government certainly said that, notwithstanding the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2), further work would still be done. This is the further work that is designed to respond to special recommendation VII, and there will be further aspects which will complete our response in the final legislation.
The other question Senator Ludwig asked is: was there some submission from the private sector and, if so, what did we receive? I am not so sure that that applied to special recommendation VII. I will take that on notice. I think the work on special recommendation VII was as a result of further drafting by the government, but I will take that on notice and just make sure. But, if there was a submission from the private sector, we will advise the chamber of that.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I am happy for the chamber to be provided with the answer but, as I understand it, I do not think this fixes the problem with SR VII. I think you will agree with that, Mr Temporary Chairman. The main problem was the exclusion of ‘cash dealer’ from the section and the substitution of ‘ADI’. I thought that had to do with an objection raised by the ABA which related to hub and spoke transfers. My understanding is—and this is partially taken from the EM itself—that a customer goes to bank A and wants funds transferred to bank B. Bank A sends the transfer instructions to a related bank, bank C, which has a corresponding banking relationship with bank B.
Under the amendment, for the purposes of the legislation, bank C is taken to be acting on behalf of the customer, who is entitled to rely on the customer information provided by bank A. Apparently, this fixes an error which would have required bank C to verify the details of the customer before sending on the instructions. The AGD said they would consult with the ABA as part of their response to original questioning by me. It looks as though, in that instance, the ABA found another hole—or, alternatively, the department, in looking at this area, turned up the issue. But are these amendments designed to address the issues that were raised by the ABA in the Senate committee? Was the ABA consulted on the final wording of the FTR amendment to this bill? If not, then an explanation of where it came from would be helpful. What other industry bodies were tacking changes onto this particular bill? That is in relation to amendment (1).
What I am concerned about is that we do have to meet the 40 recommendations from FATF, plus the nine special recommendations. The OECD report earlier this year did not give Australia a very—in my words—good report. Since that time, there have been the Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 1) and Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) which, in part, were brought about to address some of the deficiencies discovered, including the fact that we, at that time, were not fully compliant with any special recommendations.
The minister says that it is a work in progress, but it has been a work in progress since November 2003 and it is still not finalised—in fact, it is significantly not finalised when we have a second tranche as yet unseen and an unknown date as to when it will be brought forward. We still have not finalised the first tranche and it is now 2006 and counting.
As to the government’s response that it is a work in progress, I am concerned that there is a requirement to meet the 40 plus nine recommendations to be fully compliant. The OECD will revisit this issue to establish whether meeting the 40 plus nine recommendations by, I think, later this year, is a reasonable timetable. You can correct me about that if I am wrong, Minister. You would certainly know better than me.
In that sense, it is not a work in progress. We do have to meet those 40 plus nine recommendations. As you would expect, as there are developments over time, legislation does change. It requires amendment and updating. But at least bedrock legislation has to be put in place, and it needs to be bedded down. You might find a slip, an error or a correction. That is not unusual. You might find that new circumstances have arisen or new procedures by industry might require amendment or change, but that is not a work in progress. It is part and parcel of the role of government to ensure that legislation remains up to date and relevant to the people who use it. But we have not got to the bedrock legislation, which I do not think should amount to a work in progress. It should in fact be here by now. It concerns me that, in an ad hoc way, we are still amending the legislation again today, when it has not even come into being. I asked a couple of questions in all of that, but I will deal with amendment (2) shortly.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-09-13,"—With regard to the more general issue that Senator Ludwig mentioned in relation to the transactions between banks where you have an intermediary, suggestions were made by the Australian Bankers Association which were taken on board. I understand that the private sector was consulted in relation to the wording of this bill, and I think that that covers what Senator Ludwig has said. Other countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, have been dealing with the same issues we have and are in the process of implementing their responses to the 40 recommendations from FATF, plus the nine special recommendations.
In a visit recently to London and Washington it was made very clear to me that they also regarded this as very much a continual work in progress and that you would never reach a specific point in time where you could rule a line through things. The complexity of it is demanding, and that is why we have gone very carefully with the private sector. I have said repeatedly that we do not want to render the financial sector of Australia uncompetitive because of inappropriate regulation. We do not want to burden that sector with such regulation and red tape that internationally we are not competitive. They work in a very global environment, if I can put it that way, and it is essential, therefore, that we achieve a balance between security needs, on the one hand, and the needs of the private sector, on the other.
To give you an example of one of the things that FATF requires, and one of the issues that we are dealing with: for credit card transactions FATF requires the full details of the customer and the number. On the one hand, this sounds like a good suggestion, and there are security aspects to it, but, on the other hand, does it really achieve that which it sets out to? We have said—and you have seen this recently with changes to credit card details—that when you get a receipt your full number is not on it for security reasons: so that people cannot hack into your credit card and commit credit fraud. One of the things I would say when somebody comes along and says, ‘This is what you’ve got to do,’ is that you have to go a bit further and see what ramifications there may be in providing the full details. Are you exposing the cardholder to possible fraud by doing that? That is just one very small aspect of what is a very big area of reform, and that is something we are taking up with FATF, for instance. FATF has suggested that and said that that is a good way to go. I think we need to have a good look at that and make sure that it is the best way to go, because it could have the reverse effect by publishing the details in such a fashion that a person’s identity could be stolen.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-13,"—I want to add my voice very briefly to the call of the shadow minister for more haste in this area. I accept and respect the conundrum the minister and the government find themselves in. You have privacy weighted against security weighted against commercial needs and the competitive needs of the nation. Frankly, we need a less than perfect anti-money-laundering regime rather than none at all—and I recognise that we do have an anti-money-laundering regime, because that is what the financial transactions act is all about. But I am of the view that the need to limit the availability of finance for global crime or global terrorism—and sometimes they are one and the same thing, as the minister well knows—is greater than our need to make haste slowly. Global crime and global terrorism are an immediate threat, and I want to add my voice to urging the minister and his department to come forward with legislation as fast as possible, even if it does not meet the full requirements that have been put to us by the task force. It is better that, in this matter, we make rapid progress that might be less than perfect than make slow progress.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-13,"—As we have said right from the start with this, we do not oppose the introduction of anti-money-laundering legislation that fights the financing of terrorism. It is a scourge and should be limited and got rid of. We do not object to the government bringing the legislation forward in a reasonable state, having consulted with business to ensure that it does not tie them up with red tape.
When you look at the way this has been handled, you will see that the No. 2 bill brought in the legislation, and the government limited the ability of the original committee to deal with it. As a consequence, we had a range of submitters. The government then came back to amend it, even before it came into place. So I suspect that business is getting annoyed, or at least finding that the sands are shifting underneath them all the time, because the legislation is changing and not being brought forward.
We then had more changes, which appear to be me to be straight from the ABA submission to the committee with perhaps some add-ons from other industry sources as well. So we had a situation where, having the committee hear from the government, there was no change and the bill went through. We then came back before it was enacted with even more changes—even late changes through a supplementary EM. You would have to say, upon reflection, that this process is less than perfect and in fact smacks of really ad hoc changes and a bandaid solution, because it is only an interim solution. We are still waiting for the final bill, but it will deal only with the first tranche of the entire area. This is all turning into quite a saga. There are a couple of analogies I would make, but I will refrain from doing so. It is a serious issue.
The opposition is concerned about ensuring that small business, medium business and even big business are not tied up with red tape, particularly in this area, but it does require a considered, meted change to ensure that it is effective and that business is consulted. In the consultative process the changes that are brought forward need to meet business expectations in the fight against the financing of terrorism. So far the process has not been all that satisfactory.
Amendment (2), instead of requiring just a full business or residential address, provides that a range of identifiers can be used. We do not object to that change; it is sensible to bring it forward to ensure that there are a range of identifiers, such as full business or residential address. Perhaps the minister can provide an explanation as to why the changes regarding subsection b(i) were required. It is just not clear on the record, at least to me. And in subsection b(ii), why do we need to clarify that the ID code must be unique when a unique reference is subsequently defined later on?
While the minister seeks an explanation I turn to some broad issues. As I have said, the saga of this bill is not yet over. These amendments are largely to correct problems in the bill that came about through lack of consultation in the drafting process in the first place. In fact, half of the corrections seem to come straight from the comments made by the Australian Bankers Association. Labor certainly agrees that those concerns should be taken into account by the government when drafting legislation, but of course while keeping in mind the purpose of the legislation—that is, to fight terrorist financing.
The government has gone about this in a backward sort of way. The correct process, I would have thought, would have been to consult with stakeholders, bring the bill forward and deal with it through the committee process—for those people in the wider community who still have a legitimate interest—rather than wait until the last minute to amend an already amending bill. I have to say that, in my experience, this department’s attitude to consultation with industry has been less than perfect on a range of issues. In fact, I have even been assured by AGD at a committee hearing that they would lift their game in the consultative process. That was in relation to a different bill, and it may even have involved a different part of AGD. Perhaps the minister can pass it back to AGD that they should think through the consultative process a little more broadly so we do not end up spending more time than we need to when debating this issue in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-09-13,"—The changes as provided for by amendment (2) were the result of industry’s requests to amend the definitions that Senator Ludwig has referred to. That was the reason for the amendment. I might just say that I have received very positive feedback from the industry in relation to the way in which the Attorney-General’s Department has handled the consultation process. I think it is fair to say that was across the board from different sectors of the financial industry in this country. As I have said, we plan to introduce the broader bill in these sittings. An exposure draft, which is almost in its final form, will be introduced in these sittings—I cannot be clearer than that—and it will naturally go to a committee. These amendments are the result of industry suggestions and we thought they were sensible.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION REPORTS AMENDMENT BILL 2006</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I do not think we are going to be able to complete our consideration of this in the time available, but we should be able to come back to it today. There is not much left to consider. As I understand it, it will take only 10 or 15 minutes. There is one last issue which the minister can take before we report progress, which goes to amendments (3) and (4). Presumably ‘place’ was too broad. I would like an explanation as to why the amendment refers to the country and the town, city or locality. I think it goes partly to a matter raised by Senator Murray. According to the EM, it brings us in line with section 17FA(3)(b)(ii). Would the minister look at whether section 17FA(3) is the definitions section and whether subsection (b)(ii) exists? It only goes as high as (b), which provides that a unique reference number may include digits. I may have missed that, but there may be another—and I hate to mention it—drafting issue. I suspect that can be corrected on the run, if I am right. If I am wrong about that maybe I am being pointed to the wrong place by the legislation. Perhaps the minister can take that on notice.
Amendment (5) relates to section 17FB and provides for a unique reference number. It appears straightforward and consequential. Amendment (6) also involves the issue of hub and spoke, as I understand it. I would like an explanation as to whether that is the case.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2006-09-13,"—In the last week of the last sittings, the Greens’ Senator Nettle spoke of the situation in the Middle East. I said at that time that I would respond because Senator Nettle’s speech seemed very one-sided in its criticism of Israel’s defence in the face of attacks by Hezbollah. In Australia Hezbollah is registered as a terrorist organisation. In her speech, Senator Nettle made a number of claims that are either distorted, inaccurate or complete fantasy. For example, Senator Nettle claimed:
Previously all of the milk in Lebanon was supplied by an Israeli company that operated in Lebanon. In recent years, a new organisation had been set up, a consortium of French and Lebanese, to provide milk for Lebanon. That organisation’s factory was targeted in the bombing.
Senator Nettle implied that Israel targeted the bombing out of concern to protect its commercial interests. Even if there used to be a company in Lebanon with a monopoly on the supply of milk products to the Lebanese people, it could not have been Israeli. Lebanese law renders it illegal for any citizen to have any contact with Israelis. Senator Nettle betrays an ignorance of the basics of life in the Middle East.
Senator Nettle also argued that the recent deaths in the Hezbollah-Israel conflict could have been avoided if the Israelis were prepared to trade the only Lebanese citizen jailed in Israel for murdering four people, for its two soldiers. This is an extremely one-eyed view. The deaths could have been avoided if Hezbollah had been disarmed according to UN Security Council resolution 1559, or even if it had not fired rockets from and next to residential buildings throughout Lebanon. Senator Nettle told the Senate:
We now have a devastated country that needs rebuilding. Much of southern Beirut and southern Lebanon is in ruins.
A simple Google search reveals up-to-date satellite photographs of Beirut which show the damaged part of Beirut is limited to exactly those areas Israel said it was targeting: the Hezbollah stronghold in one small area, plus the strategically important runways—but not the buildings of Beirut airport—and other specific targets designed to prevent a rapid resupply of Hezbollah by Iran and Syria.
Senator Nettle talked about Israel attacking some Lebanese army positions, despite its claim to be targeting only Hezbollah. But she failed to point out that Israel attacked some Lebanese army radar stations after they were allegedly used, in coordination with Hezbollah, to guide the missile that damaged an Israeli ship in the first days of the violence. You never get the full story from Senator Nettle, only the bits that suit her view of the world. You never hear the well-known fact that Hezbollah frequently launched rockets from positions adjacent to the UN, putting everyone nearby in danger. This is confirmed by one of the soldiers tragically killed in that accident. According to reports, before his death, he wrote:
... we have on a daily basis had numerous occasions where our position has come under direct or indirect fire from both artillery and aerial bombing. ... This has not been deliberate targeting, but has rather been due to tactical necessity.
The tactical necessity was because of Hezbollah actions against Israel in the immediate area. The Canadian soldier also wrote in his email that the UN position afforded a view of the ‘Hezbollah static positions in and around our patrol base’.
While Senator Nettle claimed that Israeli ‘incursions and invasions into Lebanon have been going on for many years’, she failed to mention the constant cross-border attacks carried out by Hezbollah since Israel withdrew from every inch of Lebanon in 2000. Twenty-seven Israelis were killed by Hezbollah between the Israeli withdrawal and—but not including—the 12 July attacks by Hezbollah. These attacks have taken the forms of rockets, anti-aircraft fire into Israel, small arms fire, mortars and stabbings. Hezbollah had made frequent incursions into Israeli territory to kill Israeli soldiers on border patrol, as well as civilians going about their business. Senator Nettle incorrectly stated that Israel fired on a convoy that had previously been granted Israeli permission to move. An Israeli press release after the accident pointed out that the deaths were tragic, but that Israel had specifically warned the convoy against leaving, as it was conducting operations in the area. Senator Nettle said:
The United Nations and Israel had been in discussions and they had been given the green light for that convoy to head out. Yet, once the United Nations escort left the convoy, the convoy was bombed, killing at least seven people and wounding 36.
She then went on to say:
Part of the lessons we need to learn and part of the wrap-up from this experience is to ensure that there are investigations into any war crimes ...
So Senator Nettle, the Greens senator from Down Under, gets up in this parliament and virtually judges the Israelis guilty of war crimes. The incident referred to is yet another example of Israel attempting to prevent civilian deaths by warning civilians away from conflict but being blamed for their deaths when the civilians disregarded all warnings and drove into a conflict zone. Of the aid convoys that were authorised and coordinated by the IDF throughout this entire period, not a single convoy was hit by IDF fire.
Senator Nettle also incorrectly claimed that:
The calls for peace have been consistent from the Israeli peace movement members, who have been involved in massive demonstrations in Israel throughout this conflict ...
In fact, throughout the conflict, there was near total consensus in Israel that Israel was doing the right thing. Even the left-wing press reported that a peace rally in Tel Aviv was attended by only 2,500 people. I am advised that the recent Tel Aviv rally was noticeable for the presence in significant numbers of Balad supporters. Balad is an Arab political party in Israel whose leader, a member of Israel’s parliament, praised Hezbollah terrorists as heroes in recent weeks as well as before the conflict started.
Finally, Senator Nettle talked about Australia selling some $10 million worth of defence related products to Israel. She said:
Unfortunately, our Prime Minister and our government have been arming one side of the conflict ...
Surely Senator Nettle does not expect Australia to also arm Hezbollah, a terrorist organisation fighting against a close friend, ally and fellow democracy. Australia’s position on this is very clear: Israel had the right to protect itself from terrorist attacks and the Australian government fully supported the exercising of this right. I urge Senator Nettle to be far more judicious in her comments on Middle East affairs, and to check her facts and informants carefully.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>Middle East</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST,3,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2006-09-13,"—My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Can the minister confirm reports that the government has dumped a $400 million Defence contract to upgrade the FA18 Hornets with radar and electronic sensors? If this contract has been cancelled, can the minister advise when and why this decision was taken? What capability would be lost to Defence if this project were cancelled, and would it lead to a loss of air superiority in our region? Out of the total budget for the project, how much public money has already been spent? Are there any provisions for damages in the contract so that taxpayers could recover at least some of the money if the project is abandoned?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-09-13,"—I thank Senator Hogg for a very important question about a project that is very important to the future security of Australia and our air defence capabilities. Senator Hogg would no doubt be aware that Defence is seeking to acquire joint direct attack munition guidance equipment. The focus of that is to enhance the accuracy of its inventory of iron bombs. The new equipment converts a standard iron bomb into a highly accurate guided weapon through the use of global positioning systems, generally known as GPS. The improved accuracy reduces risks of collateral damage and produces much greater effectiveness from each load of weapons on our aircraft. The improved accuracy of smart bombs’ use of global positioning systems will increase weapon effectiveness while also minimising the risk of collateral damage, as I have said. I can report that recent tests of the joint direct attack munition systems have been successful. Senator Hogg has asked in relation to the amount of money that has been spent to date. The total investment to date in specific development, integration and testing of the system for the Hornet is just under $94 million, and no decision has been made on the future of the ALR2002B program at this time.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer

Senator Hogg has raised with me the fact that Senator Campbell, in answering Senator Hogg’s question regarding reports of the government’s cancelling of the FA18 Hornet’s electronic warfare protection project, in fact, read a brief relating to a quite different Defence project regarding the smart bomb. While I accept that Senator Campbell made an honest mistake in reading a document he did not understand, totally unrelated to the question asked of him, I invite him to have a second go, and respond to front-page newspaper reports that the $400 million project will be dumped as an expensive failure. Has the electronic warfare project, the one originally asked about, been abandoned? And, if so, at what cost to taxpayers? And what does that mean for the jobs of the people working on the project in Adelaide?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-09-13,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his second go at the question but, given that he provided information that there will not be a loss of jobs but there would be no decision taken, I am a bit confused. Has the government decided to abandon this project? If not, when will it make the decision? And what will be the cost to taxpayers if the decision is made in accordance with the advice from Defence which, as he informed us, was that the schedule risk was not supportable? So, given you have had firm advice from Defence that the project basically should be abandoned because it is a complete dud, what will be the cost to taxpayers and when will you formally abandon the project?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,question
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2006-09-13,"—The answer is that there are a number of programs operating under that. There are two projects, which are related. Of the project that Senator Evans is referring to, we understand that—and I do have further information that I promised to give Senator Hogg and, Mr President, you will know that I—
—You’ve got to read the right brief. You’ve read the wrong one instead.
—I said that I did not have in front of me the brief that had the information.

Senator Carr interjecting—

—Senator Carr, come to order!
—There is a brief, and it refers to two projects, and I referred to both of those projects, and I said to Senator Hogg that I would add any information I had at the end of question time, and you have a note by your right hand, Mr President, that says, ‘Yes, I do have some further information and will be seeking the call after question time.’ But since Senator Evans wants to give me the opportunity to add that information now, I will. As I have said, there is no decision made in relation to that project—
—Which project?
—the ALR-2002B—at this time. This element of the Hornet upgrade program aims to improve the FA18’s ability to detect radar. BAE was selected by Defence as the preferred radar warning receiver for the program. I think there was an implication made in Senator Hogg’s earlier question that it was not the preferred system, but it was in fact preferred by Defence, as the project was regarded as better value for money.
With these Defence contracts, they are seeking to ensure that the FA18’s air combat capability is enhanced. And you go through a process of developing it, integrating it and testing it. And, as I have said, that has cost $94 million. Defence now advises that the remaining schedule and technical risk in maturing the program for the Hornets is not acceptable. But the government will ensure that the air combat capability of the FA18 Hornets is not compromised.
BAE Systems Australia is developing a radar warning system, the ALR-2002, to be fitted to some ADF aircraft. BAE Systems Australia has informed Defence that it has approximately 140 people working on the radar warning projects and those engineers who are involved in the project are highly skilled and can be redeployed to other areas within BAE. So, in response to Senator Evans’s questions about potential job losses at BAE, Defence has been assured that there will, in fact, be no job losses.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Defence</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Coonan) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ludwig today relating to Telstra and payphones.
The minister failed to convince me but clearly failed to convince Senator Joyce. What we now have is Senator Joyce who has been conned, mugged and done over by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in relation to the Telstra payphones. You now have a complete list from Maranoa which tells us the sorry tale that Senator Joyce has allowed to occur. He has not only been conned by his minister; he is going to con the people out there who need these phones and who use them.
What Telstra says—clearly he and the minister must both now believe this—is that not only has the demand for payphones dropped but everyone has a mobile phone to deal with their telecommunication needs and we do not need payphones any more: we do not need payphones in the bush to be able to service requirements; we do not need them in places from Roma to Mitchell to Wallumbilla. Two payphones in St George are gone—one near the church; you might know that one, Senator Joyce, and one near the showground, where people might obviously require a phone. Of course, there is Thallon—you might know that place near William Street, Senator Joyce—there is Barcaldine, where two have gone; there is Jericho; and a swag have gone from Charleville. There is Augathella; the Augathella motel has lost its phone. Blackall has lost a swag. Then there is Longreach, Warwick, Tara—and so it goes on. Telstra has hung up on the bush and Senator Joyce has hung up on the bush. What we have is the minister, with Senator Joyce’s compliance, hanging up on the bush because the regulations are now no more than hot air. That is what they are.
We have allowed Telstra to remove 5,000 payphones and it is still planning to dump more when it gets privatised; I have no doubt about that. But Telstra, in the universal service obligation, is only required to maintain a third of its 32,000 phones, so the government has given the green light—Senator Joyce has also voted for that—to hang up on the most vulnerable in our community. We will end up with a situation where schoolchildren who do not have a mobile phone, people living in the bush who do not have a mobile phone and plenty of others—the elderly in the community—who will not be able to afford a mobile phone, who will then have been given a green light to say, ‘I don’t have any telecommunication needs at all.’ We warned Senator Joyce and we warned the minister—

Senator Joyce interjecting—


Senator Sterle interjecting—

—Senator Ludwig, resume your seat. Senator Joyce and Senator Sterle, it is disorderly to exchange disrespect across the chamber. That is what it sounds like to me from here. Desist from your comments across the chamber. Senator Joyce, if you want to be added to the list of speakers, I am sure you can organise it, as can Senator Sterle.
—Clearly what the minister and Senator Joyce have signed up to is then going to rip the heart out of the bush with the removal of these payphones. What we are going to have is the minister and Senator Joyce hanging up on the bush—not only some nebulous bush but his own neighbourhood. You can imagine that payphones provide a lifeline to many people in Australian society but they also play a role in ensuring that those who cannot afford a mobile, or do not want a mobile, have the ability to access a payphone. That is another fundamental role which a telecommunications carrier such as Telstra should be able to provide to Australians.
Senator Joyce has made sure, by signing up to Senator Coonan’s Telstra plan, that we will not have the universal service obligation as good as it should be. To be fair to Senator Joyce, he was probably either sucked in by the persuasiveness of Senator Coonan or, in fact, mugged by her—one or the other. That is his choice in this. I think that, if he had known the truth, he would not have hung up on the bush. If he had been able to say, ‘This is going to be the result where we get lists out of Maranoa and not only Maranoa but places like Rockhampton—(Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2006-09-13,"—Senator Ludwig is misleading the Senate when he says that Telstra has cut services to country people in need of payphones in particular and also that the agreement which Senator Joyce and others reached with the government over the sale of Telstra, which in fact has improved telephone services to regional areas, has been abrogated. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the services to country areas have been greatly improved since the agreement was reached to sell Telstra. In particular, the need for payphones to be retained in regional areas has been recognised and Telstra will be maintaining payphone services where needed in country areas because Telstra is required to provide a payphone service under the universal service obligation which—as I am sure Senator Ludwig knows—means that Telstra has to maintain a certain minimum standard of phone services in regional areas. In fact, there are something like 60,000 payphones in Australia. While some payphones have been removed because they were unprofitable or because there were several payphones in the one area, nevertheless, where needed, payphones have been retained in regional Australia. Payphones continue to be recognised by the government as an important community service for many people and that is why the government requires Telstra to ensure that payphones are reasonably accessible to everyone in Australia and, in particular, to people living in regional areas.
Senator Ludwig, as I said, is doing no more than getting up to the ALP’s old trick of claiming that, with the sale of Telstra, services to people in regional areas will be diminished. Nothing could be further from the truth because we have the universal service obligation, which requires that a certain basic telephone service be available to people throughout this country. In addition, we now have other telecommunications companies coming into regional areas offering services. So, in fact, the services to people in regional areas are being not only maintained but also enhanced through competition.
In June this year, the government increased Telstra’s obligations in relation to the removal of payphones. The government also increased the responsibilities of the regulator, ACMA, in monitoring Telstra’s obligations in that regard. For Senator Ludwig’s information, Telstra is now required to undertake stricter consultation processes, identify all of its universal service obligation payphones in regional and rural areas and rewrite its universal service obligation standard marketing plan for payphones. Considerable progress has been made with these initiatives, which will, as I have said, ensure that payphones are maintained where needed in regional areas. Telstra has also engaged its low-income measures assessment committee to agree on new arrangements for payphone consultation processes and complaints mechanisms. Through the enhancement of the USO process, communities can now feel assured that they can not only identify where USO payphones are located but also feel confident that they will be adequately consulted if there is a proposal to remove or relocate a payphone. While Senator Ludwig is a great proponent of the ALP’s position that the government will reduce services to rural Australia, I can say that that is not the case and reassure those people throughout rural Australia who are listening to this broadcast that Senator Ludwig is wrong and that the government will maintain and enhance the telecommunications services provided to people of regional Australia.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,8,1,speech

I think that if those people who are listening to this broadcast heard Senator Eggleston’s contribution they might possibly be reassured—until they heard what is really happening. Where Senator Eggleston reassured people that, under the universal service obligation, Telstra is required to take into account the response of parliamentarians, community groups and individual members of the public, we have heard quite clearly from the community of Dysart. The mayor of Dysart, Cedric Marshall, said yesterday, as quoted in today’s Courier Mail, that Dysart would be left with insufficient payphones. That is a small community that is losing six payphones. Councillor Marshall also said:
We wrote to Telstra to make the point that we did not want them taken out of Dysart.
But that had no effect. I think that, while Senator Eggleston is being a bit disingenuous about the rhetoric of consultation, we know that that is not really what is going on and that there are communities that are losing their telephones for no good reason other than the important reason that was quoted to me in a letter from Mr Ian Peters, the Area General Manager Capital South East Region of Telstra Country Wide, when he said:
The cost of operating a payphone has continued to rise, resulting in over 50 per cent of Telstra’s payphones now losing money at a cost of approximately $30 million a year to our shareholders.
This is really about keeping Telstra shareholders happy so that we can maintain a high price for the T3 shares, and just abandoning the concerns of country people.
I live in a rural community and travel around regional New South Wales, and in the last six months I have discovered—and I am sure that there are others who would support this observation—that not only are things pretty difficult with Telstra and Telstra coverage but my mobile coverage in rural New South Wales is getting worse and worse. That is obviously a concern for people like Senator Nash, as well, because today she has lodged a petition from 441 petitioners asking for the Senate to take action to ensure that necessary funding is provided for the construction and erection of a mobile telephone reception tower in the district of Gooloogong in New South Wales.
It is not easy to look after regional electorates. It is certainly not easy to maintain a business if you are living in a regional community and it certainly does not help when every part of the telecommunications system seems to be under attack. The idea that there is some kind of potential for competition in regional communities—small communities, where there is a very thin telecommunications market—really does not stack up in the longer term. We know that payphones are an important part of the cultural life and cultural infrastructure of small communities, and we understand and acknowledge that Telstra’s plan to slash 5,000 of its 32,000 payphones in country towns and cities over the next seven months will have a dramatic effect on the lives of families continuing to struggle under this government.
An example is Jindabyne. Jindabyne is in an extraordinary situation. There is a massive influx of visitors and tourists during the ski season and there is a very real need for additional telephone services. They are being severely hit in this raft of cuts by Telstra. That is the kind of community that will see a significant impact from this really short-sighted policy. I suggest we need to look very clearly at Telstra’s obligations under the universal service obligation to ensure that payphones are maintained where they are required.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,8,1,speech
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2006-09-13,"—One thing we can say about Senator Ludwig is that he certainly cannot be accused of pedantry, because he was not displaying any signs of learning in that speech. In fact, it was a most inaniloquent speech.
It is very interesting that the person who would probably know most about payphones in St George, Senator Joyce, just advised me that the very process that this government put in place is working there, because the consultation that they required Telstra to undertake actually took place. The consultation was with the mayor. Senator Joyce has not had one complaint about those payphones. They were not profitable. Consultation took place with the community and they were removed.
That is exactly what we have forced ACMA and Telstra to do: make sure that when those payphones are removed it is done in consultation with the community. That is the way the system works. But what amuses me most about the Australian Labor Party is that they now have another shadow minister. Poor old Senator Conroy—my friend Senator Conroy—is now the shadow shadow shadow minister, because Senator Ludwig is now getting involved in communication matters.
Why doesn’t the Labor Party give Senator Conroy a go? On this side of the chamber we think it is about time he was allowed to fulfil his position as a shadow minister. Everyone else is jumping over the top of him—Mr Tanner and Senator Ludwig. They are all having a crack at it and it is about time that he was allowed to do his job.
There are 60,000 payphones in Australia, as Senator Eggleston said. I was trying to think of the number of unprofitable payphones but I was suffering from a bit of lethologica. I think there are 7,500 payphones which cannot be removed because of the universal service obligation. But this government has made absolutely sure, when discussing any of these matters in relation to communications, that it talks to the people who are affected.
Is Senator Ludwig really saying to us that he does not think that consultation should take place? Is he saying that consultation should not take place? There was a bit of echolalia there, I will admit. Is the Australian Labor Party going to put these payphones back? Senator Ludwig, through you Deputy President, are you going to put them back? Let the record show that Senator Ludwig had his head down reading from his papers and refused to answer my question: are you going to put the payphones back? Clearly not, because Senator Ludwig has his head buried in his papers and refuses to answer the question. Is the Australian Labor Party going to change this policy by putting them back? No.
The only way you could possibly change this is to take away the community consultation. Is that what the Australian Labor Party intends doing? Is that what we are going to get? Clearly, that is the situation.
If you look at the record of this government in relation to our commitment to regional and rural Australia, it is second to none. The Minister for Finance and Administration is at the table and he knows—he is even more acutely aware than the rest of us—the extraordinary amount of government funding, taxpayer funds, that have gone into regional and rural telecommunications.
For 13 years under the previous government nothing was done. We had the analog debacle. If you look at what has been said by the Australian Labor Party over the two years since the last election, you will see that they are still totally devoid of a communications policy. There is absolutely nothing. The only thing that we have got from the Australian Labor Party that is expansive in relation to this is the fact they have so many shadow ministers. (Time expired)

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I had the opportunity to receive a document from my colleague Senator Sterle here, and it was an excerpt from an article written by Matt Price. This is a description of what you might think would be a Queensland National Party MP:
… a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma swallowed by a joke covered in bananas sprinkled with peanuts dipped in ethanol.
It is unfair, because that does not describe a current Queensland National MP; it describes a former Queensland National MP, Bob Katter—but it could well describe most of them. I wanted to take note of Senator Coonan’s answer, because this afternoon Senator Ludwig asked a direct question of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts in which he clearly mentioned Senator Barnaby Joyce. Where is Barnaby at the moment?
—Senator Joyce.
—Senator Joyce. Where is he? He had an opportunity to respond to the allegations made in question time about him. He had plenty of opportunity. You heard him raving over there, Mr Deputy President. You heard him getting worked up over there. He was accused of being a windbag by some on our side. He was accused of being Lord Haw-Haw by some on our side. Where is he? Where is Senator Joyce? Where is Windy? He is not down here to defend himself.
—Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: it is not appropriate to use nicknames for Senator Joyce.
—Yes. The senator should be referred to as Senator Joyce.
—All I am referring to is the fact that there were interjections made about Senator Joyce this afternoon where he was called ‘Windbag’, where he was called ‘Windy’ and where he was called ‘Lord Haw-Haw’. These were all interjections made across the chamber to Senator Joyce. You saw him—he was getting a bit excited. But where is he this afternoon to defend himself? Where is he to defend the constituents of Maranoa? Mr Bruce Scott, the member for Maranoa, proudly states that he has nearly one-half of Queensland as his electorate—yet, under the proposals that Telstra is putting forward, 39 of those payphones are going to be taken out of that electorate.
Here he is—Senator Joyce is back. Maybe he will get an opportunity to speak and defend himself, because all he did was rave this afternoon. Where was Senator Joyce when Telstra made the decision to get rid of these 39 payphones? Two are in his own town of St George. What did he do? What has he said? He has been over there having a rant and a rave, like the windbag that he has been accused of being this afternoon. He has said nothing to defend his constituents. Let me remind you what Senator Joyce said last year when he was asked whether he was going to sell out rural Australia so that he could vote with the government to sell Telstra. Let me remind you what the sell-out merchant said last year:
I’m down for a yes—
that is, to vote for Telstra—
providing that when we see the legislation it provides what has been stated, with real teeth on some of these basic service issues—there can be no watering down of that.
Now Senator Joyce may get an opportunity to respond to allegations he has sold out his constituents. Mr Deputy President, call him up now. Let him have a say. All he has done is be a doormat for Telstra and a doormat for the government. Thirty-nine payphones are going to be taken out of the electorate of Maranoa, where he lives—two in his own town—and what is he doing about it? The doormat that the National Party have become, the great Country Party that they used to be, what are they doing now? They are standing over and letting themselves get tickled on the tummy. That is all, because the minister is not doing anything about this.
What about the people without the payphones? People will not have access to them. What about the mobile service coverage? What about the 12,000 jobs that people like Senator Joyce signed up to get rid of? Where are they going to be in regional and rural Australia? What has he done about it? All we have are these sell-out merchants in the National Party who have not looked after their constituents. We call on the government to stop these cuts. They must be stopped to make sure that regional and rural Australia can continue to operate. (Time expired)

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 10 of 2006, dated 13 September 2006. I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
In tabling the committee’s Alert Digest No. 10 of 2006, I would like to draw senators’ attention to two bills on which the committee has made comment: the Fuel Quality Standards (Renewable Content of Motor Vehicle Fuel) Amendment Bill 2006 and the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Marking of Plastic Explosives) Bill 2006. The committee has noted that both bills provide for indefinite commencement of certain provisions. The committee’s longstanding view is that parliament is responsible for determining when laws are to come into force and that the commencement provisions should contain appropriate restrictions on the period during which provisions might commence.
The Fuel Quality Standards (Renewable Content of Motor Vehicle Fuel) Amendment Bill 2006 provides that the amendments in schedule 1 to that bill would commence only on ‘a day or days to be fixed by proclamation’. The committee is wary of provisions which enable legislation to commence on a date to be ‘proclaimed’ rather than on a determinable date or within a specified time.
The committee’s preferred approach is reflected in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel Drafting Direction No. 1.3, which states that a clause which provides for commencement by proclamation should also specify a period or date after which the act either commences or is taken to be repealed. It also provides that any proposal to defer commencement for more than six months after assent should be explained in the explanatory memorandum.
The committee is equally wary of provisions which link commencement to an uncertain event. The committee accepts the need to defer commencement in certain circumstances, such as the entering into force of an international convention—as in the case of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Marking of Plastic Explosives) Bill 2006—or the passage of complementary legislation. However, the committee generally expects to see a fixed date, or a period of time, by which that event must occur to trigger either commencement or repeal. The committee also expects the explanatory memorandum accompanying a bill to explain the reasons for including uncertain commencement provisions.
The committee also notes that, in this particular case, the government announced its intention to accede to the convention—the Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Detection—in 2004, some two years ago. While the committee appreciates that such processes can be lengthy, this merely underscores the committee’s concern regarding the degree of uncertainty created in the wider community by such open-ended commencement provisions. The committee would prefer to see appropriate safeguards incorporated in the bill itself or a clear statement of the time frame within which the convention is expected to come into force included in the explanatory memorandum.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-09-13,"—Senator Ludwig put forward a number of questions when this matter was last in committee, and I now have a reply for him. Firstly, as I recall it, Senator Ludwig asked, ‘Is there a difference between a unique identification number, as used in section 17FA(3)(b) subparagraphs (iii), (iv) and (v) and a unique reference number as defined in section 17FA(3)?’ The answer is, yes, there is a difference. A unique identification number is any number given to a customer by an Australian government, such as an ABN, or a foreign government. A unique reference number is a concept used in 17FA(3)(c) subparagraph (ii) and is a number given to a transaction by an ADI. The two concepts are different but use similar technology.
Senator Ludwig also asked: ‘Why is ‘unique reference number’ defined in the bill, given that the definition seems self-evident? Why is it defined in two places—section 17FA(3) and 17FB(6)?’ Industry asked that the term ‘unique reference number’ be defined to make the meaning clear beyond doubt. The government accepted this request and section 17 FA(3) defines the term for the purpose of outgoing IFTIs. We use a lot of acronyms in this bill, so I remind the Senate that an IFTI is an international funds transfer instruction. While section 17FB(6) defines the term for the purposes of incoming international funds transfer instructions, there are differences between the definitions. Section 17FA(3) refers to authorised deposit taking institutions, which is a meaningless term for an international funds transfer instruction sent to Australia from a front country. Whether there should be two definitions or one definition which covered all possible variations was a drafting issue. There is no issue of substance in using two definitions.
Another query concerned 17FA(3)(b) subparagraph (ii). Senator Ludwig asked what this change was designed to achieve. AUSTRAC requested this change. When people are asked to disclose their place of birth, most people will give only details such as country, city or town. Some, however, will only give their country of birth. The amendment will make it clear that ‘place of birth’ requires more than just a country. Senator Ludwig also asked for an explanation of how the ATA and this bill as amended fit in with special recommendation VII. This bill was only ever designed to be a partial response to special recommendation VII. That recommendation deals with both international wire transfers and domestic wire transfers. The ATA only ever dealt with international wire transfers. Domestic wire transfers will be dealt with in the AMLCTF Bill.
The effect of the amendments will be to limit the operation of the ATA changes so that they apply only to authorised deposit taking institutions. That is a narrowing down of the provisions, since they will not now apply to non-bank money remittance businesses. That change is necessary because of the way the FTR Act is structured. It would cause problems for non-bank money remittance businesses if they had to comply with the new obligations under the architecture of the FTR Act. Non-bank money remittance businesses will also be dealt with under the AMLCTF Bill. The result is that the current legislation does not fully meet the requirements of special recommendation VII—and, of course, as I said earlier, the government never said that it would.
That covers the issues that Senator Ludwig raised. I commend the amendments to the committee.

(1)    Clause 1, page 1 (line 6), omit “Financial Transaction Reports”, substitute “Anti-Terrorism (Correction of Government Legislative Errors)”.
What has been clear in this whole process is that it is an ad hoc, band-aid solution, and the amendment is designed to simply highlight that fact. It is to ensure that we get the consultative process and the amendments right for the next big bill which will come into the Senate—the anti money laundering legislation. The government is clearly put on notice that we will spend a lot longer with the next bill if we have to start amending it on the run again.

I reject that this has been ad hoc or on the run. I have always said this has been a work in progress. We had our initial legislation to provide an urgent response to the needs of the time. There was always going to be another bill of this sort to take it further.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2006-09-13,"—The Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, often referred to as the PSS, and the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, known as the CSS, provide superannuation services and products to employees of the Australian government and other participating employers. The CSS was established on 1 July 1976 and closed to new members on 1 July 1990. On the other hand, the PSS was established on 1 July 1990 and closed to new members on 30 June 2005. A new fund, the PSS Accumulation Plan, known as PSSAP, commenced operating on 1 July 2005.
The main purpose of this amendment bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005, currently before the Senate is to ensure that the operation of these two schemes, the PSS and the CSS, are consistent with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act of 1993, commonly referred to as the SIS Act. The requirements of that act that concern this bill are those which concern the fitness and propriety standards for superannuation fund trusts and their members, and those providing for reduced reliance on acting members of the board, and for the use of proxies at board meetings to match the standards in the private sector.
The bill will also allow what is now the ARIA board to delegate certain functions to its staff, broadens the type of information that can be provided to members via their employers, allows negative crediting rates to be applied to amounts held in the CSS and authorises certain payments made incorrectly to a small number of CSS members. So it is virtually aligning it with the practice in the private sector.
I note, by way of interest, that, whilst the explanatory memorandum to the bill refers to the CSS and PSS boards, the situation really has changed somewhat because, since that memorandum was written, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006 has taken effect, from 1 July this year. The previous structure of one board managing the CSS and another board managing the PSS and PSSap created duplications. But, under the new structure of one board, named ARIA, the superannuation arrangements for Australian government employees would not have been sustainable or cost-effective in the long term.
So, we have the merger between the Australian Reward Investment Alliance, that is the new board, a simplified, sustainable and more effective governance structure. The ARIA board is now required to provide information to members under other acts. I also note that the ARIA board has a lot of very experienced people; for example, Chairman Susan Doyle, Winsome Hall, a former member of parliament David Connoly AM, Joy Palmer, Des Moore, Graham Rogers and Peter Feltham. They have between them formidable experience, and I have every confidence in their ability.
The bill will provide for the appointment of acting members to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The bill allows the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme boards—now the ARIA board—to delegate certain functions to staff and it also broadens the type of information that can be provided to members via their employers.
The amendments will require that substantive and acting appointments to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board do not contravene the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 fitness and propriety operating standards. The bill will also provide that the Minister for Finance and Administration may terminate the appointment of any board member who does not meet that standard. These amendments will place the same obligations on the ARIA board as for other trustees of superannuation funds in relation to having to comply with fitness and propriety requirements.
An interesting case came from Tasmania, where, not so long ago, a marketing manager, a Mr Sonny Azzopardi, was dismissed by the industry fund Tasplan—a highly respected and performing industry fund—because of a theft by him from a former employer, the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. And this action was given the nod by the regulator, APRA. This highlights that trustees and directors of superannuation schemes have to maintain higher standards of propriety than even operate in the private sector boards of public companies in Australia.
The proposed amendments enable members of the ARIA board to participate in meetings even when overseas and to vote and disclose conflicts of interest at board meetings through proxies. New section 27N(4A) also provides that the appointment of the proxy is to be in writing and signed by the appointing member. New section 27N(4B) provides that the proxy is not entitled to vote on behalf of the member on a proposed decision unless there is an instrument of proxy appointment which sets out the terms of the proposed decision and indicates whether the appointing member is in favour of or against the proposed decision. The proxy member votes on the proposed decision in accordance with the indication in that instrument.
The bill also makes amendments to the Superannuation Act of 1976 and the Superannuation Act of 1990 to broaden the type of information that can be provided to a scheme member via their employer, provided that this would not breach the Corporations Act 2001 or any other act. Item 23 will amend section 42A(1)(a)(ii) to allow the ARIA board to request a designated employer to provide to a member of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme any information required to be provided by the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme board to a member under any act. Schedule 2 of this bill provides for amendments to the 1976 act which will allow a negative crediting rate to be applied to Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme member accounts. This initiative has the effect that members will now bear investment risk relating to their account balances, as I believe is appropriate. It will also provide the ARIA board with a greater capacity to equitably distribute earnings between those members who leave the scheme and those who stay.
As you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, previously the CSS board’s investment policy included a reserving mechanism, an unusual arrangement which gave effect to the legislative requirement that members not exit the CSS with less than what they have contributed even when investment performance has been below zero. Reserves were limited to no more than five per cent of the CSS’s assets and were used to smooth annual returns. If the value of the reserves was not sufficient to offset completely any negative investment returns then, because the CSS board could not determine a negative interest rate for members, a negative reserve was actually created. This negative reserve was replenished out of future earnings. This was a very convoluted arrangement. Because the CSS is no longer determining annual crediting rates but is instead allocating members their share of the fund’s assets when they leave—which is very appropriate—the CSS may have a notional balance which represents unallocated earnings. This balance is invested in exactly the same way it would be if allocated to members, and members can then earn a return on the balance in exactly the same way they would if it was allocated to them. The effect is that the members bear the investment risk.
Schedule 3 of the bill also provides for amendments to the 1976 act. This schedule will rectify the situation where a group of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members have received benefits in breach of superannuation laws. They were deferred benefit members who had ceased contributory membership by joining an alternative superannuation arrangement offered by their employer. After they had reached preservation age they received payment of the benefits without meeting certain conditions such as terminating their employment or reaching the age of 65 as required. The amendments in this bill will effectively validate these payments. The bill also provides for necessary technical amendments as a consequence of the government’s reforms on the safety of superannuation as well as providing the changes to facilitate the application of negative interest rates to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme.
I turn now to superannuation safety. I am reminded that there was an attempt to steal $150 million over an extended weekend break late on a Friday afternoon in 2003 involving overseas bank accounts. Fortunately the attempted fraud was detected quickly through a vigilant custodian, JP Morgan. Fortunately no member benefits were lost. It took some time for charges to be laid but last year six men were charged over the attempted fraud after an 18-month international investigation by the AFP. Of the $150 million stolen, $147 million has been recovered by the AFP. This issue essentially involved transaction between the board, the custodian and the perpetrators. I must emphasise that no members’ money was actually lost.
I am surprised that it has taken so long to bring these people to justice. What has happened since August 2005? Obviously these people were left out on bail. I think it is in the public interest, now that these people have been charged, that there is some debate and discussion, because there was a significant sum of money involved. I think APRA have a responsibility to warn other trustees of the sorts of activities that could lead to these sorts of losses. It also illustrates the need for trustees to have in place mechanisms and procedures to discourage fraud. I am surprised that APRA have not been a little more up-front in sending circulars warning other trustee companies about the potential risks which may occur in terms of communications. So what actually happened? The fraudsters had a very good knowledge of how the transfer of funds processes worked. I understand, and we have been assured, that there has been a certain upgrading of communications and IT platforms to strengthen the framework against fraud. That is to be commended. In conclusion, I trust that APRA are now in a position to issue upgraded instructions to all other boards and trustees in terms of their communications with their custodians who hold the assets. I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2006-09-13,"—The Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005 will amend the Superannuation Act 1976 in relation to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the CSS, the Superannuation Act 1990 in relation to the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS, and the Superannuation Act 2005 in relation to the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSAP. Following the passage of this legislation, similar amendments will also be made to the PSS Trust Deed and Rules under the Superannuation Act 1990 and the PSSAP Trust Deed under the Superannuation Act 1995.
The bill includes changes required to facilitate the application of negative crediting rates to the CSS, changes to validate the payment of benefits to particular members of the CSS and a number of minor amendments related to the delegation of powers of the trustees and the disclosure of information by those trustees to employers. The bill also includes provision to amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to include certain safety of superannuation reforms in the governing rules of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. These safety of superannuation provisions have already been implemented through the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006, which received royal assent on 9 June 2006. As a consequence, these provisions of the bill are no longer required. Under technical arrangements included in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) Bill 2006, sections 1 to 14 and 25 of this bill will be automatically repealed when the bill is passed, so these provisions no longer have any practical effect.
 The government is also moving amendments to this bill to change the commencement date of negative crediting provisions. The existing terms of this bill have these provisions commencing on 1 January 2006. As this date has passed, it is important to make this amendment to ensure that all provisions remain prospective. The bill will enable the trustees to allocate negative earnings to members’ accounts. The trustees requested these changes to allow allocation to members of actual fund earnings, including negative earnings, when member investment choice was introduced for relevant members in 2004. This will resolve the inequity where negative earnings are not passed on to members exiting the funds but are deducted from future earnings applicable to remaining members’ accounts.
The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to authorise a small number of CSS benefit payments that were incorrectly paid because ComSuper incorrectly informed certain members that they were entitled to claim their benefits. The effect of these changes will be that recovery from these individuals will not be required. The bill will also make a number of other technical amendments to enable trustees to delegate administrative functions to their staff and to broaden the type of information that can be provided to scheme members via their employers, provided this would not breach the Corporations Act 2001 or any other act. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Stephens’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION SAFETY AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2005</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,28,1,speech
"O’Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2006-09-13,"—The Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Security Plans and Other Measures) Bill 2006 amends the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. The amending legislation seeks to simplify the procedures for making changes to maritime ship and offshore facility security plans. It also seeks to clarify measures relating to the plan approval process, to make a number of technical amendments to clarify the intent of the act, to make amendments to various acts consequential to the enactment of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and to make a technical amendment to the Customs Act 1901. There are three schedules to the amendment bill and schedule 1 deals directly with the act.
The main purpose of the amending legislation is to require various ships, ports and offshore facilities to have security plans in place to minimise the danger to them and Australia as a result of terrorism and other acts of violence. Maritime security plans identify security measures to be implemented when different maritime security levels are in force. A maritime security plan means a plan prepared for the purposes of part 3 of the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. Such plans must be approved by the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services.
An example of the changes to the process of the approval of security plans is that the secretary will now have 60 days to approve a security plan, instead of the current 90 days. However, the secretary will effectively be able to extend this time by a maximum of 145 days when additional information is required in order to make a decision on a security plan. That matter is detailed in the explanatory memorandum on page 1.
Item 1 of the tabled amendments involves the repeal of current section 47(1)(c) of the act. That section requires that maritime security plans include contact details for a responsible maritime security officer. The substitute wording for section 47(1)(c) requires a participant to designate, by name or position, all of the security officers responsible for implementation of a maritime security plan. That is detailed in the explanatory memorandum on page 4. In some respects, that is an improvement. Labor understands that designated security officers may depart employment or be moved to other positions. This amendment allows flexibility by designating a position rather than an individual name, although the ability to identify a responsible person rather than a position may no longer be available because of the discretion to supply the name of a person or a designated position.
It is the opposition’s view that this bill has a tendency to validly upgrade security, but there are still many serious maritime security issues that urgently need attention. Labor has warned the government about the dangers of ammonium nitrate being freighted around our coastline by foreign flag vessels with foreign crews—crews that have not undergone a background check. As Labor understands it, the crews of foreign flag vessels need to be identified by name prior to arrival in Australia, but that is only a name and does not entail a background security check. Labor is concerned about these arrangements, particularly in relation to the carriage of ammonium nitrate as this chemical compound is a high-end explosive when mixed with fuel.
I will give an example to demonstrate the sort of damage that this can cause. When the French freighter Grandcamp, carrying 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, docked in Texas City in Texas in the United States on 16 April 1947, what happened next showed how serious an explosion of that substance can be. When the deck of the Grandcamp caught fire, the ammonium nitrate cargo exploded. The explosion, I am told, was heard as far as away as 150 miles. It produced a mushroom cloud, rising 2,000 feet. Locals thought it was a nuclear explosion. The Grandcamp’s 1.5-tonne anchor was flung two miles and was embedded 10 feet into the ground. Senators would not be surprised to learn that Texas City was devastated and the explosion killed 567 people.
In our view, it is irresponsible that the government, having been warned about this danger, has refused to deal with this danger immediately. Labor has also pointed out that Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah have the skills and opportunities to launch a maritime terrorist attack. Reports from United States intelligence sources indicate that the al-Qaeda group is suspected of owning or having long-term charters on a fleet of between 15 and 18 bulk or general cargo vessels. While it is believed that these vessels are used to generate revenue and to support the group’s logistics network, it is feasible that one of these vessels could be used in a suicide mission, making use of an explosive such as ammonium nitrate. There is, in our view, a real threat of such a ship being used as a weapon in a terrorist strike, just as jet aircraft were used in the 2001 World Trade Centre attacks, the anniversary of which we have just seen pass.
A maritime vessel can be used against a population centre adjacent to port facilities and/or shipping channels to damage port facilities, to sink vessels or just that particular vessel and to block access to a port facility. Labor has been calling for urgent maritime security reforms and, frankly, we get precious little from this government. We do welcome the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Security Plans and Other Measures) Bill 2006. However, there are many other urgent reforms that are required to improve Australian maritime security. Under Labor’s plan, a department of homeland security would be organised around its two core responsibilities—border protection and protection against terrorist attacks within the border. That was outlined by Mr Beazley in his Sydney Institute speech on 4 August last year.
Our shadow homeland security ministry would provide a specialist focus on Australian national security. We believe that is necessary because security arrangements need to be tailored to Australia’s needs. The best way for that to be done is by a specific and dedicated department. We believe there is further need for maritime security reform. We think that in providing access to our ports and to vessels in and around our ports, there ought to be full knowledge of the crewing of such vessels.
At a hearing into maritime security, the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee was informed that somewhere in the vicinity of 200,000 foreign seamen visit our ports each year. Those 200,000 seamen—not Australian seamen but seamen from other countries—are not required to undergo the same level of security checks as our seamen. They do not have a security check at all. Therefore, we certainly will not be in a position to have a complete knowledge of those who visit our ports. It is one thing to talk about how one might ensure that there is an appropriate check on those crews from the time a ship berths if those crew members leave the vessel, but it is another thing to make assumptions about what might occur whilst those crew members are on a vessel approaching a berth or if those crew members do not leave the ship. We have raised those matters on a number of occasions.
Australia is becoming more and more reliant on foreign crewed vessels to provide our own domestic shipping needs rather than visiting our ports as a one-off, delivering goods which are imported into this country or collecting goods which are exported from this country. There are many vessels which are given a permit to trade on our coastline, to pick up domestic cargo, to move cargo between one Australian port and another or, in some cases, to continue to operate on the Australian coast on what is known as a continuing voyage permit—to continue to trade for a specific period and carry any number of cargoes in that period between any number of Australian ports.
Labor has for quite some time held the view that there are times when it is necessary for those foreign crewed vessels to be given the opportunity to carry cargo. That obviously occurs when there is not a suitable vessel available to carry the cargo or when a suitable vessel on the Australian coast is not available to carry that cargo. But what we have seen is a deterioration in the restrictions which have been placed on those vessels, to the point where it is almost a function of the department to determine that, if an Australian vessel does not provide shipping at the same rate or for the same remuneration as a foreign crewed vessel, the foreign crewed vessel is preferred and is given a permit.
That leads to a circumstance where we are seeing, day by day and week by week, the number of Australian crewed vessels working on the Australian coast carrying domestic cargoes between Australian ports declining. We are approaching the point where the domestic shipping industry will fall below a critical mass with which it can operate efficiently. We saw recently on the 7.30 Report an indication from Australian ship owners of the parlous state of Australian shipping brought about by this government’s administration of the permit system which allows foreign crewed vessels onto our coast. In the context of what we see as the deterioration of the state of Australian shipping, brought about by this government’s policy, we believe that the Senate ought to say something further. I move a second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate condemns the Howard Government for its failure to provide necessary maritime security and protect Australians, including:
the Government’s failure to conduct security checks on foreign crews;
the Government’s continued failure to ensure foreign ships provide manifestos of crew and cargo before arriving at an Australian port;
the ready availability of single and multiple voyage permits for foreign flag of convenience ships including the ready availability of permits for foreign flag of convenience ships carrying dangerous materials in Australian waters and ports;
the failure of the Government to examine or x-ray 90 per cent of shipping containers;
the Government’s failure to create a Department of Homeland Security to remove dangerous gaps and to better coordinate security in Australia; and
the Government’s failure to establish an Australian Coastguard to patrol our coastline”.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT AND OFFSHORE FACILITIES SECURITY AMENDMENT (SECURITY PLANS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2006-09-13,"—I rise to speak in support of Labor’s second reading amendment to the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Security Plans and Other Measures) Bill 2006. The bill introduces measures in relation to the submission and approval of maritime, ship and offshore security plans. The bill is brief and straightforward and makes a number of small adjustments that Labor supports. While the Labor Party supports this bill as far as it goes, it is clear that the Howard government is not serious about addressing the deficiencies in Australia’s maritime and transport security. I hope that the provisions in this bill are acted on and implemented with greater competence than has characterised this government in its other dealings with maritime security.
I refer to the failure of this government to ensure that, as required by law, all ships advise details of their cargo and crew members 48 hours before they reach an Australian port. The most recent information given to the Senate tells us that just 67 per cent of ships coming to Australian ports actively comply with the requirement to properly advise of their cargo and crew 48 hours before they reach an Australian port. One-third of ships do not comply with the law, and this government is doing nothing about it. In the United States they have a similar requirement that a ship must advise the authorities of crew and cargo 48 hours before the ship berths. If ships do not provide that information 48 hours beforehand, they are required to stand offshore and, if need be, the coastguard will make sure that they do. In Australia we do not require them to stand offshore and we do not have a coastguard to stop them anyway.
Unfortunately, the National Party has been responsible for the transport portfolio ever since this government came to power. Ten long years of National Party mismanagement of the portfolio has left Australia’s maritime security in a parlous state. The current Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the honourable member for Wide Bay, has been busy trying to save his political neck from the ‘wheat for weapons’ scandal. As a result, it seems that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has given less than his full attention to maritime security. I suspect the reason is that he is anxiously awaiting the report of Mr Justice Cole’s royal commission.
But I am not the only one frustrated by the pathetic performances of the National Party. I must admit that I did enjoy a great laugh over my Weet-Bix yesterday morning when I read a comment from Liberal MP Mr Michael Johnson on the front page of the Australian. According to Mr Johnson:
The National Party is on its last legs ... within the next 10 or 15 years they’ll be a dodo.
From where I sit in the Senate, I think Mr Johnson is 10 or 15 years behind: they are already a dodo.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—That has woken them up. Mr Acting Deputy President, through you: welcome to the debate. It is Labor’s view that maritime security matters should be the responsibility of a minister for homeland security. But this government in its wisdom has chosen to leave maritime security to a succession of National Party transport ministers who clearly have other things to worry about: Mr Katter’s ‘beast’ riding a horse of discontent, for example.
Australian seafarers undergo a rigorous and thorough security check by the Australian Federal Police and by ASIO. They also have to have a maritime security identification card, known as the MSIC card. I want to commend the Maritime Union of Australia for the way in which it has willingly and efficiently cooperated with the government in introducing the maritime identification card system and other very important measures that it undertakes are necessary to secure and protect Australia’s maritime trade.
Despite the indifference displayed by the government, the Maritime Union of Australia, the Transport Workers Union, the Rail Tram and Bus Industry Union, the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers and the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union forced their way to the table and did their best to save the government from itself and its own ignorance of the maritime, cargo and offshore industries.
The detailed submissions made by these unions show just how important union and worker involvement is in any project to develop and enhance maritime security. To quote Senator O’Brien’s figures and his vast knowledge of this area of Australia’s security, we have 200,000 foreign seafarers coming to our country every year; however, they are not subject to the same rules that apply to Australian seafarers serving on Australian ships. Not only are foreign seafarers denied Australian pay and working conditions; they are not subject to the same security regime as Australian seafarers.
Why aren’t we applying the same standards to foreign crews coming to Australia? If it is good enough for Australians to meet the required tests by the Australian Federal Police and ASIO of being of good character and good background, then surely we should ask the same of those crews coming to Australia, who could cause major terrorism damage to Australia. Why aren’t we prepared to say to foreign crews that we expect them to undergo the same security checks by the Australian Federal Police and ASIO as those which we apply to citizens of Australia? There is no good reason why there should be lesser security checks on foreigners coming into Australia than the security checks we apply to Australian citizens.
We also need to ensure that people who would do harm do not have the opportunity to turn one of those cargo ships into a floating bomb. The Howard government has a record of breaching the navigation regulations and its own ministerial guidelines regulating coastal shipping by failing to establish whether a licensed Australian vessel is available before issuing a single voyage permit to a foreign ship. The government has been quite happy to allow ships of convenience with foreign crews we know nothing about to carry dangerous materials around Australian waters. The Labor Party have made it clear that we think that is wrong.
We have made it clear that ships that come to Australian ports should be obliged to provide the details of their crew and their cargo at least 48 hours before arrival. If they do not, then we should do exactly what the United States does: prevent their entry into our ports.
An independent review of this government’s administration of coastal shipping licences and permits for foreign vessels, undertaken by KPMG for the Department of Transport and Regional Services, provides a damning indictment of just how eager the government is to let these floating coffins move freight in Australian waters. The review found:
One in six permits for foreign vessels were granted without a signed application ... Data relating to one in five permits was incorrect or absent altogether; The Government was in breach of the Navigation Regulations and Ministerial Guidelines on the regulation of coastal shipping by failing to establish if a licensed Australian vessel is available before issuing a permit to a foreign ship.
It is a sad indictment of this government that it has presided over the demise of the Australian coastal trading fleet while giving a leg-up to foreign shipping that uses substandard vessels and engages cheap, foreign labour. I do not think it is enough to just tick off a list that people have put their plans in and rely upon that to secure us, which is what this bill is all about.
We do not know who the crews are on foreign flag of convenience ships. We do not know whether they are subcontracted to al-Qaeda. I reckon we have far more to fear from terrorists than we do from unionised workforces. International maritime security agencies now accept that Osama bin Laden owns a fleet of cargo ships, all flagged under the flag of convenience system. As we know from the Ships of Shame report, this system allows for the evasion of taxation and most other regulated costs. But, more importantly, it provides the beneficial owner with the most effective veil of secrecy available in international trade. In fact, I can hardly think of a way to make Australia more vulnerable to terrorist attack than by permitting foreign ships to sail from port to port without the inconvenience of lodging a signed permit form. As we know from the KPMG audit, that has occurred.
The Howard government’s active undermining of Australia’s shipping industry has been highly successful. Over the last 10 years over half of Australia’s fleet has already been decimated. We are now down to 50 vessels that sail under the Australian flag. Most recently, the chemical carrier MT Stolt was reflagged from Australia to the Cayman Islands and the 18 Australian crew members were sacked and replaced by cheap, foreign seafarers. The owners of the MT Stolt sacked the Australian crew and changed the flag to a flag of convenience, safe in the knowledge that the Howard government hands out single voyage permits like confetti at a wedding. Even though the MT Stolt regularly carries loads of around 9,000 tonnes of sulphuric acid around the Great Barrier Reef, the Howard government is happy to allow the owners to make a few extra bucks profit through the use of cheap, unskilled foreign crew and lower safety requirements.
The result of the Howard government’s continued abuse of the single voyage permit system is that the remaining Australian merchant fleet will be forced to struggle to compete with foreign competition that has lower safety standards and lower wage costs. It is clear from the findings of the audit that the lax administration of foreign ships on the Australian coastal trade places Australia and its citizens at a heightened risk of maritime terrorism.
We have the recent example of the Pancaldo chugging around Australia’s coast loaded with ammonium nitrate. Honourable senators will recognise that ammonium nitrate was the explosive of choice in the Oklahoma bombing. We all remember the horrifying images of the north side of the Murrah Federal Building being torn down by a single car load of ammonium nitrate explosive, with the tragic loss of 168 lives. The Pancaldo was carrying over 3,000 tonnes of the stuff in and out of Australian ports. The Pancaldo sails under the Antiguan flag, which has been listed by the International Transport Workers Federation as a flag of convenience registry where, for a few quiet payments, you can get a ship registered with no questions asked. The MUA were able to discover that most of the crew came from former Soviet republic nations and Eastern European nations. The Australian government had no background knowledge of the crew whatsoever. There were no security checks done on any of the crew.
It is going to take more than this bill and a fridge magnet to fill the gaping holes in our maritime security—but you do not have to take my word for it. In a recent report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Australia’s maritime security, the institute found:
A terrorist attack on Australia’s maritime interests is a credible scenario. Australia still faces major institutional and operational challenges in reducing the risks of maritime terrorism. We haven’t met these challenges fully, and we lack consistency in the response.
According to this authoritative and independent body, the Howard government has failed to appreciate the seriousness of the situation. The Howard government proudly boasts that it X-rays about 10 per cent of the containers that come off ships. That leaves about 90 per cent of containers going through unchecked. The odds are pretty good if you want to hide something in a container. The government cannot come before the people of Australia or this parliament and say that it is doing its job when it allows 90 per cent of containers to come through our ports without being checked at all.
If we compare the Howard government’s effort with what is occurring in neighbouring countries, we can see just how slack they are. Hong Kong are trialling new systems with new equipment to X-ray 100 per cent of the cargo in two of their nine terminals. Unfortunately, in Australia, the government are asleep at the helm. There are over 20,000 ship arrivals and more than 3½ million movements of loaded containers in Australia each year. If 90 per cent of these containers go unchecked, there is a lot of opportunity for dangerous items to be smuggled into our country.
The centrepiece of Labor’s maritime security policy is the creation of a coastguard. Government ministers come into the chamber to ridicule Labor’s coastguard policy every chance they can get. The Minister for Defence claims that this is an outrageous policy and a slur on the Royal Australian Navy. It is nothing of the kind. If we had a coastguard, maybe we could enforce the laws that the government wanted and the Labor Party supported that require ships to provide notification, 48 hours before they arrive in port, of who their crew are and what their cargo is.
The functions of a coastguard would be to protect Australia’s coastline from all manner of threat—for instance, illegal immigration, illegal fishing and environmental threats such as oil dumping—and, if necessary, to enforce Australian law with regard to shipping. If we had a coastguard, we could enforce our own shipping laws and protect Australian ports while not diverting the Royal Australian Navy from the important tasks that we have the Navy for. If the Howard government do not want to listen to the Labor Party then they should take the lead from the many countries in the world who understand the difference between the role of a coastguard and the role of a navy.
Far from thinking that the coastguard is a waste of money, the US is currently planning a major expansion and re-equipping of their coastguard to meet the new challenges of the times, including the terrorist threat to US ports and shipping lanes. If Jemaah Islamiah were to fill a Panamanian flagged tanker with ammonium nitrate, hire a Ukrainian crew who spoke no English and who had no idea of where they were or what they were carrying and sail the tanker into Dampier, the requirement that they notify the port authorities of the tanker’s cargo would probably not be enforced and, sadly, we would have no capacity to prevent it from coming into port. Does this government really think it is appropriate that the Royal Australian Navy keep its warships tied up in every Australian port to guard against threats of this kind? That is not what the RAN, with its highly specialised ships, equipment and crews, is trained and funded for. That is the role of a coastguard.
The bill before the Senate today is a small step forward, but a lot more needs to be done. We as a nation deserve better when it comes to our national security and the protection of our maritime borders and points of entry. The carriage of highly dangerous goods, like ammonium nitrate, by foreign ships around our coastline must stop now and the transport of high-consequence dangerous goods around Australian coasts must be done by Australian ships crewed by Australian men and women who are subject to appropriate security screening.
The Howard government’s neglect of shipping policy threatens our economy, threatens our national security and threatens our natural environment. Labor supports this bill, but that should not be taken as an endorsement of this lazy government’s failure to act to protect the security of our seafarers and our port communities or even to enforce the laws that this government itself has passed.
In conclusion, under a Labor government, Australia will have a full-time minister for homeland security, a full-time inspector of transport security, and a full-time professional coastguard.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT AND OFFSHORE FACILITIES SECURITY AMENDMENT (SECURITY PLANS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-09-13,"—The Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Security Plans and Other Measures) Bill 2006 amends the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003. It does so to simplify the procedures for changing maritime offshore facilities security plans and to make various technical amendments to clarify the intent of the 2003 act. As such, it deals with the framework of regulations which safeguard against unlawful interference with maritime transport or offshore facilities.
With the close proximity of this debate to the fifth anniversary of the events of September 2001, this bill may be seen as very appropriate in tightening up our maritime security. Indeed, it is. This bill makes some valid and long overdue improvements to our maritime security and, if we think about it, maritime security is indeed very important. One shudders to think what might happen if maritime security were breached by a boatload of explosives.
In my own electorate in the Northern Territory, one can only imagine the horrendous potential of a security breach with any of the now numerous liquid natural gas ships that load up not far from Darwin city. Just over the harbour, you can sit down and dine on the Darwin wharf with LNG ships loading just over the other side of the harbour at the Bechtel plant on Wickham Point.
So maritime security is essential, and it is not to the government’s credit that there are many areas of maritime security where it has been lacking. The government has been lacking in allowing vessels carrying ammonium nitrate to move around our coast and our ports, as my colleague Senator Sterle so aptly described. These are foreign flagged vessels with foreign crews who are given minimal, if any, security checks. It is indeed ironic to think of these flag of convenience vessels moving around quite freely with holds full of ammonium nitrate and minimal security checks on crews, but heaven help any individual who buys it in bulk without good reason once that cargo is unloaded—ASIO will be on their doorstep in very quick time.
Considering the potential of ammonium nitrate as an explosive agent, this lack of checking on foreign vessels and crews is unforgivable in this day and age. With the international shipping market being wide open, any terrorist group with the funds could, it would seem, charter a vessel from a foreign owner and go wherever it liked—certainly into Australia, with our lack of security checking of crews. Put such a vessel together with a hold full of ammonium nitrate and you have a sailing bomb moving around with minimal checks, all but free to sail into whichever Australian port it decides on.
The Labor Party has long been calling for improvements to our maritime security, but with little or no recognition from this government to date. We therefore welcome this bill, although it falls far short of meeting all of our concerns. With the help and support of Labor, this government was able to enact legislation requiring all ships entering Australian ports to give 48 hours notice about details of their cargo and crew. Despite this, recent information given to the Senate was that only about two-thirds of the vessels entering our ports actually comply with this requirement. So this government has totally failed to enforce compliance with this part of our legislation dealing with maritime security. It seems, like so many other pieces of legislation forced through by this government, these requirements are poorly administered and implemented. My various speeches and comments on Indigenous education in the last 18 months indicate that this is another area that lacks such detail.
In the United States they have a similar requirement of all vessels entering their ports. Any such vessel failing to give details of cargo and crew 48 hours ahead of arrival is simply not allowed in. Instead, it is required to anchor offshore. If need be, the US Coast Guard makes sure the vessel does not get close to port. Here, we do little or nothing and we have no coastguard anyway.
So one-third of ships entering our ports do not comply with the requirement of giving details of cargo and crew. They could be carrying anything, and the crew could be legitimate or illegitimate—indeed, they could be terrorists. One-third of ships have no checks carried out before getting alongside the wharf, and many of the others have minimal crew checks anyway. This is doubly ironic when one considers what checks Australian maritime and port workers have to go through to get their security card in order to work on a ship or in the dockside area. But foreign crews seem to get away with little or no checking. Who knows who is entering our ports, and anyone wishing to do so for illegitimate purposes will do so and may well be away from the ship before their identity is discovered. As was said by my colleague the honourable member for Batman in the debate in the other place, flag of convenience crews are, frankly, floating terrorist opportunities to do serious damage to Australia.
To make things even worse is the fact that when cargo is unloaded, only about 10 per cent is actually X-rayed to check its contents. This must be one of the lowest ratios in the developed world. Again, if I may use figures from my colleague the member for Batman, in Hong Kong, certainly one of the busiest ports in the world, up to 100 per cent of containers unloaded are X-rayed—a major difference between them and us. We can only wonder why an equal proportion could not be X-rayed in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane, for example.
But an equally poor failing from the point of view, certainly, of my electorate in the Northern Territory is the government’s failure to properly police and secure our northern waters. The situation in our northern waters has gone from bad to worse over the past couple of years, with more illegal vessels being sighted but a decreasing proportion being stopped or caught.
This government has been very well aware of this worsening situation but has steadfastly refused to consider options such as paying Indigenous marine rangers to do that sort of job or setting up a proper coastguard. Instead, it has consistently claimed that our security is good, that we are detaining boats and illegal fishers. But the truth is that more and more boats are entering our waters, plundering our fishing stocks and often, it seems, landing on Australian soil and seriously threatening our biodiversity and security with quarantine risks.
The truth of the matter is that under this government our coastline has been and remains extremely vulnerable. The government policy that is in place simply is not working efficiently or effectively. Authorities are unable to track illegal vessels or to reach them in time to take any action. Last year alone, 13,000 illegal vessels were sighted in Australian waters, but only 609 of those were apprehended or detained—let alone those that get right in close to our shores, in the mangroves or up the rivers, as we have seen and heard reported time and time again by our Indigenous marine rangers in places such as Maningrida and Groote Eylandt. Any of those vessels could have had people come ashore and enter our country illegally. Most probably, that has happened.
What this government has done is to have the occasional blitz on illegals, catch a group of them and then turn the event into a media stunt, just as it has done with the odd burning of boats and those ceremonies along our northern shores. As reported on the ABC news back on 9 May, Customs caught 12 boats in the Gulf of Carpentaria in the previous fortnight. That was good, and we are sure Customs are doing their best with the resources they have, but how many other boats were in the gulf that were not caught? An average of over 30 a day are spotted across the top—in a fortnight, that could be as many as 500—but only 12 were detained.
I emphasise again that I fully agree with my NT colleague in the other place in saying that both Navy and Customs are doing their very best, in a very professional manner. There has been many a time that I have had a briefing at NORCOM or have been with Coastwatch and had an opportunity to witness the way in which these people work. But they do it with limited resources for the total job on hand and for what is expected by the Australian community.
The government has changed coastal surveillance and now has more aerial surveillance flights with the sophisticated Orion aircraft, but this will just mean that they spot more, not catch more or stop them from coming. Illegal incursions by foreign fishing vessels are at record levels and appear to be on the rise. This threatens not only the NT Fisheries resources but our national security and biodiversity.
The Labor caucus Transport and Maritime Security Taskforce, who have spent some time over the recent months investigating and reporting on this matter, described in their report Maritime security and illegal fishing: a national disgrace the situation where illegal fishing has become a highly organised, sophisticated and criminal activity. Vessels are now being used more and more, and modern ships are equipped with modern technology—they know precisely where they are at all times. They are not innocent traditional fishermen anymore. Evidence given to the caucus task force was that as many as nine out of every 10 illegal fishing trips are in fact successful, so in most incursions into Australian waters these vessels could be up to anything, in addition to the illegal fishing that is occurring.
The real truth is that anyone could be entering our nation via the sea and our coast. They could be doing so on vessels carrying anything from high explosives to rocket launchers, to rabid dogs or other major diseases. And of course all of this has been helped along quite nicely by the Howard government allowing Aussie flagged and crewed vessels to fall by the wayside and to be replaced by these foreign-crewed flag of convenience vessels. This has all been part of this government’s campaign against Aussie workers. These ships have been allowed to replace Aussie ships around our coastline on a regular basis, in the process sacrificing the safety of our sea lanes and ports.
Thank goodness that up to now an exception has been on the LNG vessels working on the North West Shelf. There Australian tankers are crewed by Australians, with a strong commitment to best-practice safety and security procedures. This stands us in good stead not only at home but in the trade of LNG, where we are reputed to be good, safe and reliable carriers of this product. However, we also need to ensure the security of not just the LNG vessels and the Wickham Point gasworks but also, of course, the many oil rigs based off our coast.
If all vessels were forced to report details of cargo and crew 48 hours before entering any port, this might also help to further protect the safety of our offshore rigs. This could be done if only this government would listen and form a coastguard service. We seem to follow so many other things the Americans do; why not this? Maybe because it is a Labor idea, and the government is too strong-headed to adopt this one. The Navy is here to protect our nation from hostile actions, not from illegal fishing and foreign-crewed flag of convenience cargo vessels roaming our shores.
Maybe if we had a coastguard we could enforce these laws. We could ensure that vessels reported details of crew and cargo 48 hours in advance, or we could force them to anchor offshore, as is done by our American allies. We could check out many more of those vessels spotted in our waters, often illegally fishing but also potentially bringing in undesirable illegal entrants. We have a coastline of around 37,000 kilometres. We absolutely rely on maritime transport for most imports and exports. We are indeed a maritime nation.
We support this bill but condemn the government for the many failings it has had in maritime security in ensuring the safety of our vessels, our ports and our people. We can only hope that the government will be better at administering this bill than others in the past.
In conclusion, I want to reiterate the second reading amendment that was moved by Senator O’Brien. We suggest that the Senate, in passing this legislation, condemn the Howard government for its failure to provide necessary maritime security and to protect Australians. The government has not done that, because it has failed to conduct security checks on foreign vessels. It continues to fail to ensure that foreign ships provide manifestos of crew and cargo before arriving at an Australian port. There is the ready availability of single and multiple voyage permits for foreign flag of convenience ships, including the ready availability of permits for foreign flag of convenience ships carrying dangerous materials in Australia’s waters and ports. This government has failed to examine or X-ray 90 per cent of shipping containers. It has failed to create a department of homeland security to remove dangerous gaps and to better coordinate security in Australia. Finally, of course, there is this government’s reticence and failure to establish an Australian coastguard, as suggested by the Labor Party, to patrol our coastline.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT AND OFFSHORE FACILITIES SECURITY AMENDMENT (SECURITY PLANS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2006-09-13,"—It is my pleasure to sum up the debate on the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Amendment (Security Plans and Other Measures) Bill 2006 after hearing Labor’s best available big hitters on this occasion, Senators O’Brien, Sterle and Crossin. I will address the bill first and then respond to Labor’s proposed second reading amendment, which the government opposes.
The bill strengthens the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 by simplifying procedures for making changes to maritime, ship and offshore facilities security plans; clarifying the processes in place for the establishment of security zones; shortening the time allowed for the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services to approve security plans; and clarifying when the security plan approval period commences. There are a number of other technical amendments to a wide range of legislation administered within the Transport and Regional Services portfolio. With a handful of exceptions, they are unrelated to transport security matters.
The bill does not propose to vary any of the policy settings underpinning Australia’s maritime security regime. It is merely a procedural bill. The passage of this bill will assist the maritime industry by providing for a simpler process for making minor variations to security plans without undergoing the full plan revision process. The government also wishes to simplify the administrative process for establishing maritime security zones. Consultation undertaken by the Department of Transport and Regional Services with the maritime industry has assisted in developing these amendments, and this bill has the widespread support of the industry.
The Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee has conducted an inquiry into the bill and, in its report tabled on 15 June this year, has recommended that the bill be passed without amendment. The government looks forward to the passage of the bill within the current sittings of parliament to enable maritime industry participants to focus on implementing and maintaining the security measures outlined in their security plans, contributing to the strengthening of Australia’s maritime security arrangements.
I might address some comments to the Labor Party’s second reading amendment as moved by Senator O’Brien on behalf of the opposition. With respect to pre-entry security reporting and crew reporting, I would comment that, despite Labor’s claim to the contrary, every ship seeking entry to Australia is subject to a comprehensive security risk assessment regardless of the flag that it flies. The security risk assessment takes account of all relevant information about the ship, including the nature of the ship’s cargo and operations, and is independent of customs cargo manifest reporting requirements. Ship and crew reports are required 96 hours in advance of arrival. For voyages under 96 hours, reports are required within shorter time frames. For the shortest voyages, reports are required 12 hours prior to entry. These reporting time frames have been in place since October 2005. Ninety-nine per cent of ships entering Australia have been compliant with ship- and crew-reporting requirements.
Furthermore, all foreign crews are checked before they enter Australia. Foreign crews go through stringent immigration processes, with their names checked against alert lists as soon as the crew list is received in accordance with the existing reporting requirements. This is far different from Labor’s claims that ships arrive in Australian ports having failed to meet crew-reporting requirements. That claim is simply not true. If a ship has not met the pre-entry reporting requirements, the government proactively seeks the information from the ship’s master or agent. If information is not reported within required time frames, ships can be subject to control directions. These may include ordering the ship to leave Australian waters, holding the ship in a particular position until further notice or requiring that particular actions are taken on board the ship. As well as 99 per cent compliance with crew-reporting requirements, 99 per cent of foreign ships seeking entry to Australia have been compliant with the maritime security regime that exists.
With respect to the provision of pre-entry cargo manifest reports, the Australian Customs Service is responsible for clearance of all cargo entering and leaving Australia. Ships are required to provide these reports in accordance with specified reporting time frames. Again, Labor have fiddled the figures regarding compliance with cargo manifest reporting time frames. Their claim of 67 per cent of compliance is based on figures 16 months old and only refers to cargo reports that arrive 48 hours or more prior to a ship’s arrival. As with crew-reporting requirements, that time frame decreases with the voyage’s length. In fact, 83 per cent of sea cargo is reported within the legislated time frames. If cargo is not reported until after arrival, the cargo is not released from Customs control until such time as all required information is provided and the cargo has been risk assessed by Customs.
With respect to dangerous goods and coastal voyage permits, I make the following points. Labor is concerned about the carriage of ammonium nitrate between Australian ports by foreign ships. The government provides that a foreign flagged ship may transport domestic cargo between Australian ports where there is no suitable or adequate ship available to undertake the task. The ships undertaking such voyages are subject to a comprehensive risk assessment. This ensures Australian industry has access to the coastal shipping services it needs to compete with imports and maintains its ability to export into competitive global marketplaces.
Labor’s opposition to using foreign ships to transport ammonium nitrate—even though it is clear that there may not be Australian ships suitable or available for the task—will lead to hundreds of semitrailer loads of ammonium nitrate travelling on the already busy highways of Australia’s east coast. This is surely a far more dangerous outcome than shipping ammonium nitrate by sea. Labor’s objections also ignore the fact that the safety arrangements for the shipping of ammonium nitrate are now regulated internationally by the International Maritime Organisation and Australia is fully complaint with the international regulatory regime that is set up under the IMO. Among other things, the regime prohibits the storage of ammonium nitrate with other volatile products—which led to the explosion on the Grandcamp in Texas City, an incident that happened almost 60 years ago.
With respect to Labor’s comments on homeland security, I make the following points. Proposals for a department of homeland security fail to take account of the fact that Australia has a well-practised national counter-terrorism regime which has been developed over many years on a whole-of-government basis. These arrangements worked well in the aftermath of September 11, the two Bali bombings and the Jakarta, Madrid and London bombings. Our counter-terrorism coordination arrangements have been instructed to reflect our federal system of government—and they are complex. State and territory governments and agencies have primary operational responsibility for dealing with a terrorist incident in their jurisdiction. The Australian government would of course provide support to the state or territory involved, as appropriate.
At the top level of government, the National Security Committee of cabinet, the NSC, meet regularly. There is a clear line of direction from the NSC, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to the Australian government’s operating departments and agencies. The Prime Minister has created a National Security Division within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to take the lead role in counter-terrorism policy coordination on a whole-of-government basis. The system works well.
Finally, with respect to the need for a coastguard, I make the following points in response to the Labor Party amendments. Border protection duties are already carried out in a highly professional and effective manner by the Joint Offshore Protection Command, the Australian Customs Service, the Australian Defence Force and relevant government agencies through a range of strong capabilities. These capabilities are on the beat 24 hours a day, every day of the year. A coastguard would be an expensive duplication of existing capabilities. A coastguard would also create a new and overlapping bureaucracy and divert resources away from the existing tried and tested arrangements. It is simply not needed and not appropriate in the Australian context.
The government does not support the opposition’s second reading amendments, but I do note that the opposition supports the legislation. I commend the legislation to the Senate.
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator O’Brien’s) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MARITIME TRANSPORT AND OFFSHORE FACILITIES SECURITY AMENDMENT (SECURITY PLANS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,29,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-09-13,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the documents.
These two documents are: Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs—Response to Ombudsman’s statements made under section 486O of the Migration Act 1958—Statement to Parliament—Section 486P of the Migration Act 1958. (28 August 2006/28 August 2006); and Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs—Reports by the Commonwealth and Immigration Ombudsman—Section 486O of the Migration Act 1958 [Personal identifier: 070/06—071/06]—Subsection 486O(5) of the Migration Act 1958. (28 August 2006/28 August 2006).
The latter document is a report by the Commonwealth and Immigration Ombudsman, one of a series that has been tabled in the Senate detailing the investigations into the circumstances of people who have been in immigration detention in Australia for prolonged periods; and the former document is the minister’s response to the statement by the Immigration Ombudsman concerning two cases.
As is mentioned there, these two reports bring the total number of statements by the Immigration Ombudsman tabled in parliament to 71—so, there are 71 different people who have been in immigration detention for, I think, either one or two years. The ombudsman is investigating every case of every person who has been in immigration detention for those prolonged periods of time, looking at the background to the detention, the detention history, any issues relating to health and welfare, and removal issues or other detention issues, as well as a recommendation about what should best be done to resolve the situation. This flows from the justifiable outrage that came forward, in particular when the case of Cornelia Rau was discovered, and also with the case of Vivian Alvarez Solon. The federal government agreed to allow the ombudsman to investigate each of these cases, and to require a report to be tabled.
It is a valuable checking mechanism and it is a valuable transparency mechanism, and the government should be congratulated for initiating it. It should however still be noted that it is completely unacceptable, certainly from the Democrats’ point of view, that a person is in immigration detention for years at a time unless there are absolutely extreme extenuating circumstances. Many of the cases that have been tabled, including the two that have been tabled today, have been difficult cases. There is no doubt that the immigration area does throw up difficult cases from time to time. But we have to remember that detention is in effect jail. It is the denial of people’s freedom for an indeterminate period of time—people who have not been convicted of any crime and in most cases have not been accused of committing any crime, at least with regard to the Migration Act. To be basically locking them up as a holding pattern until we figure out how to resolve their circumstance is, in the Democrats’ view, still completely unacceptable.
The fact that we have transparency mechanisms such as these is welcome, but they should not be used as a reason for stepping back from the necessary reform of abolishing mandatory detention as an automatic component of our Migration Act. Despite all of the changes and welcome improvements that have been made in the last year or so, it is still a part of our Migration Act for there to be mandatory detention—mandatory indefinite detention—and that I believe is still unacceptable. We need to continue to push to reform the Migration Act to eliminate that totally unacceptable component of the act which I believe totally goes against the basic principles of our democracy and our system of law.
I have introduced private members bills in the Senate to achieve precisely that. I also note that I have introduced a separate bill to try to provide a more coherent and reliable mechanism for assessing peoples’ circumstances when there are other humanitarian issues separate to refugee convention issues. Many of these difficult cases that have been the subject of ombudsman reports are in that category where they do not meet the refugee convention criteria but there are other significant humanitarian circumstances. At the moment the system is arbitrary, very inconsistent and very opaque in how those cases are dealt with. These reports simply reinforce the need for broader legislative change. You cannot change the culture without actually changing the laws that inform that culture. (Time expired)

"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2006-09-13,"—We can only see what is occurring in Iraq by that which the Australian and international media chooses to report. Their decision to constantly convey the negative issues, such as the bombings and other appalling problems facing Iraq—and there are many appalling killings by these crazed murderers, particularly in and around Baghdad—does not give a full indication of what is occurring in other regions in that nation. At a time when so many negative aspects of Iraq are reported in the media—bad news is good news—it is important that we acknowledge the many positive events that have occurred in a land that gave birth to civilisation over 10,000 years ago. Kurdistan, in the northern part of the Republic of Iraq, is often overlooked and ignored, receiving very little or no coverage in the mainstream media. Yet it is progressing at a rapid speed in developing its land.
For many decades the Kurds faced persecution, torture and death. In 1974 the Iraqi government began a new offensive against the Kurds and pushed them close to the border with Iran, into the Zagros Mountains that gave them protection from Saddam’s killers. The Iraqi regime informed Tehran that it was willing to satisfy other Iranian demands in return for an end to its aid to the Kurds. The Algiers Pact, an agreement between Iraq and Iran, with mediation from the then Algerian President Houari Boumedienne, was agreed in March 1975. The agreement left the Kurds helpless and the Shah of Iran ordered that supplies to the Kurdish movement be cut, causing the Kurdish leader General Barzani to flee across the border into Iran with many of his supporters. As a result the Iraqi government extended its control over the northern region after a 15-year absence and, in order to secure the dictator’s influence, started an Arabisation program by moving southern Arabs to the oil fields in Kurdistan, particularly the ones contiguous to Kirkuk, the main oil city in Iraq.
The repressive measures carried out by the Iraqi regime against Kurds after the agreement led to renewed clashes between the Iraqi army and the Kurdish guerrillas, known as Peshmerga, in 1977. As a result, in 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burnt and destroyed. Around 200,000 Kurds were forcibly relocated to other parts of the country and many started what was to become a diaspora of Kurds around the globe. During the Iran-Iraq War of the eighties, the Iraqi regime implemented anti-Kurdish policies and a civil war broke out. Saddam was widely condemned by the international community but was never seriously punished until 1991 for his oppressive measures, including the use of chemical weapons against the Kurds—particularly in Halabja, a town I have visited in north-eastern Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of men; women, some pregnant; and babies and children of all ages.
For two years, between 29 March 1987 and 23 April 1989, the Iraqi army continued the genocidal campaign against Kurds—and indeed against Arab Iraqis too, especially the Shiites. It is estimated that—as a result of the widespread use of chemical weapons, some bought from Europe—there was the complete destruction of some 2,000 villages, and mass murder saw around 50,000 Kurds lose their lives. These are just some examples of the atrocities and inhumane acts that the Kurds had to face at the hands of the brutal former Iraqi dictatorship. Yet, despite these unimaginable events, the Kurds have maintained their honour and their dignity. They are an outstanding group of people whom I am privileged to support in many ways. The Kurdistan region’s economy is dominated by the oil sector, augmented by agriculture and tourism. Due to relative peace in the northern region, it has a more developed and diverse economy in comparison to other parts of Iraq. The stability of the Kurdistan region has allowed it, through the democratically elected Kurdistan Regional Government, to achieve a higher level of development than other regions in Iraq. In 2004 the per capita income was 25 per cent higher than the average of the rest of the nation.
The Kurdistan region is rapidly developing and the Kurdistan Regional Government has undertaken a major program to attract foreign investment in the region from Europe, South Korea, Turkey, Russia, the Middle East and the United States. Some examples of development and progress being made in Kurdistan include the following. Firstly, the new Iraqi constitution for a federal Iraq means that Kurdistan is now in a position to validate its own regional constitution, one that will provide the framework for a society in which human rights, including women’s rights, are upheld, the business environment is regulated and the rule of law—not Sharia law—is supreme. Secondly, a new investment law has been passed by the Kurdistan National Assembly and is awaiting ratification by the President of the Kurdistan Regional Government, His Excellency Massoud Barzani. Investors will have a legal, secure and business-friendly constitutional environment that is designed to encourage inward investment. An innovative two million square metre industrial city, Arat, is planned 25 kilometres outside the national regional capital of Erbil and will be open to foreign investment.
Erbil International and Suleimani airports are almost fully operational and are receiving regular direct flights from neighbouring countries, Dubai and Europe. When the region opened its first international airport a year ago, planners expected one arrival and departure a week. Now, they see about 65 to 70 flights a week to a dozen or more destinations. You can fly directly to Frankfurt, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Vienna, Athens, Istanbul, Amman, Tehran and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The new Erbil International Hotel enjoys maximum occupancy with mainly visiting foreign press and business delegations.
Two thousand eight hundred Korean troops and fewer than 1,000 US troops augment the local Pershmerga and are stationed in the Kurdistan region to assist in rehabilitating infrastructure such as water supply, sewerage, roads, schools and the renovation and construction of town halls. A new, modern conference centre is set to open in Erbil which will attract more and more industry conferences, exhibitions and high-level trade and political delegations. Foreign governments have been in the process of opening representative and commercial offices in Erbil, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Russia and the United Kingdom. Shaqlawa is in Kurdistan, a fertile region of northern Iraq that was once the target of Saddam Hussein’s chemical attacks—yet this tiny town had 1.2 million visitors last summer, mostly from other parts of Iraq. The fact that the region is peaceful and relatively safe, with minimal infighting, has encouraged tourism within Iraq.
The clearest sign of the new boom in Kurdistan is the increase in salaries. Before the fall of Saddam Hussein a white-collar worker earned 22,000 Iraqi dinar per month. That is around $148. But, according to the Ministry of Finance, today it is 158,000 Iraqi dinar—a 750 per cent increase. Since the Gulf War, Kurdistan has been largely on its own. Iraq’s new constitution gives the region partial independence, in which the Kurds are wanting to encourage foreign investment. In a recent interview, the British Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. Tony Blair MP said:
Look, one of the interesting things about Kurdistan is that there, because there has been the opportunity for people to live and work in peace, that region is so much stronger. It is economically stronger, it is stronger in terms of the living standards of its people and what it shows is what Iraq itself could be like …
With the US intervention in Iraq in 2003, Kurdish fighters joined the US forces and Australians to topple Saddam. Today they tightly control their own regional borders with their own army, supported by some foreign assistance, keeping out foreign terrorists who can more easily penetrate Iraq’s large and porous borders and make their way to Baghdad to continue to wreak havoc.
The potential for the Kurdistan region is vast and there are no limits to what can be achieved. Kurdistan has proven reserves of oil and gas, which are only now being developed by Norwegian, Turkish, British and Australian firms. There is no Kurd who would argue against the changes that have occurred since the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein has ended and, for the first time for many years in their long history, the people of Kurdistan can lead a peaceful life without fear of persecution, violence or summary execution. They are most grateful for the assistance given to them by Australians for their freedom, after generations of unbelievable atrocities committed against them. I have great affection for the Kurds and will always offer them my support and encouragement.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Iraq</title>,ADJOURNMENT,31,1,speech
