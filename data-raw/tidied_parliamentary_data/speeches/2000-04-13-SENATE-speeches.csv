"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2000-04-13,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that, 15 sitting days after today, I shall move that the following delegated legislation, a list of which I shall hand to the Clerk, be disallowed:
1. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1), as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.5 and made under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975.
2. Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000, as contained in Statutory Rules 2000 No.6 and made under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975.
3. Marine Orders Part 47 - Mobile Offshore Drilling UnitsIssue 2, as contained in Marine Order No.1 of 2000 made under section 425(1AA) of the Navigation Act 1912.
4. Marine Orders Part 60 - Floating Offshore Facilities - Issue 1, as contained in Marine Order No.2 of 2000 made under section 425(1AA) of the Navigation Act 1912.
5. Notice No.1(2000) of Declared Rate in respect of Diesel Fuel Rebate made under subsection 164(5A) of the Customs Act 1901.
6. Notice No.1(2000) of Declared Rate in respect of Diesel Fuel Rebate made under subsection 78A(5A) of the Excise Act 1901. 
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The summary read as follows—
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2000 (No.1)
Statutory Rules 2000 No.5
Although the Explanatory Statement notes that the purpose of these Regulations is “to provide for a register of permissions to be kept by the [Great Barrier Reef Marine Park] Authority, and for members of the public to have access to documents in the register”, new subregulation 59A(1) is permissive only, and not mandatory. 
New subregulation 59C(2) specifies the fees that the Authority is to charge for copies of documents on the register. In the absence of a regulation-by-regulation explanation of the amendments, it is unclear what basis has been used to set these fees. 
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Aquaculture) Regulations 2000
Statutory Rules 2000 No.6
These Statutory Rules regulate the discharge of waste from aquaculture operations that may affect animals and plants in the Marine Park.
Subregulation 5(7) requires the Minister to “make publicly available” the reasons for his or her decision to accredit a Queensland law. However, the subregulation does not indicate what means the Minister may or must use in making this information publicly available. This is in contrast with other provisions in regulations 5, 6 and 7 which require the Minister to publish in the Gazette a notice of a decision about accrediting a Queensland law, revoking that accreditation or limiting the application of an accredited law.
Paragraph 6(6)(b) permits the Minister to allow the revocation of the accreditation of a Queensland law not to take effect for up to a year after notice of the revocation has been given. 
The purpose of regulation 11 is to allow aquaculture facilities that were operating on 1 October 1999 to continue to operate, without the need to comply with these Statutory Rules, so long as such facilities are not significantly increased in size. There is no indication, in the Explanatory Statement, of the reason for the date of 1 October 1999 having been chosen. It appears from the Regulation Impact Statement that the intention of the Statutory Rules is to affect only new aquaculture facilities, but since the Regulation Impact Statement is dated January 2000 and the Statutory Rules themselves commenced on 23 February 2000, when they were gazetted, it appears that the Statutory Rules have a measure of retrospectivity.
By virtue of paragraphs 11(1)(a) and (b), an aquaculture facility that was operating on 1 October 1999 will be liable to the penalties imposed by regulation 9 if there is a significant change to the operation after these Statutory Rules come into operation. Regulation 11 does not provide any definition of what constitutes a significant change.
Subregulation 11(5) provides that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority may advise an operator, in answer to a request from the operator, whether a proposed change is significant, and that answer is to be taken, for the purposes of paragraph 11(1)(a) or (b), to be conclusive. There is no indication whether this provision permits the Authority to oust the judicial function of deciding whether a criminal offence has been committed.
Regulation 17 permits the Authority to send to the operator of an aquaculture facility a notice requiring the operator to show cause why the Authority should not direct the operator to cease discharging aquaculture waste from the facility. Subregulation 17(1) provides that the regulation applies to a facility which is licensed under an accredited Queensland law, but a law in respect of which the Minister has revoked that accreditation, although the revocation has not, at the time of the show cause notice, taken effect.
Paragraph 26(2)(a) obliges the Authority to make a decision on an application submitted by a proposed operator of a new aquaculture facility. Neither that paragraph, nor the remainder of regulation 26, imposes any time limit on the Authority within which it must come to that conclusion. 
Subregulation 39(1) allows the Authority to various kinds of action against an operator if “there is reason to believe that a breach of ... a condition is about to happen”. There is no indication how the Authority will determine that a breach of a condition is about to happen. In doing so, it should be noted that the Explanatory Statement considers that this regulation applies only “where it appears to the Authority that the holder of a permission is not complying with the existing conditions of a permission.”
Regulation 48 permits the Authority to waive the payment of fees which would otherwise be payable for an application. In making that decision, the Authority may consider any relevant matter, but there is no provision for the external merits review of the exercise of that discretion. 
Marine Orders Part 47 - Mobile Offshore Drilling Units - Issue 2
Marine Order No.1 of 2000
The Order gives effect to both the 1979 and the 1989 Codes for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units as adopted by the International Maritime Organisation. Although the Explanatory Statement asserts that this Order gives effect to these Codes, there does not appear to be any provision in the Order which expressly makes clear that purported effect.
Provision 2.2.2 appears to grant to the Chief Marine Surveyor a discretion to determine the extent to which compliance with the provisions in Part 47 is unreasonable or impractical. The exercise of the discretion does not appear to be subject to independent merits review. 
Provision 4.2 appears to be merely directory, in providing that a decision maker may give written notice of that decision to a person whose interests are affected thereby. This appears to be in conflict with the heading to that provision, which suggests, by using the words “Statements to accompany decisions” that it is mandatory. This also applies to an identical provision in Marine Order No.2 of 2000  provision 4.2.
Provision 5.2 provides, among other things, that the failure to comply with provision 7 “constitutes an offence by the owner and person-in-charge.” Provision 7 states merely: “A MODU must be provided with personnel in accordance with Appendix 1.” In Appendix 1, the only provisions that appear to impose a duty relating to the manning of a MODU are clauses 3.1 and 3.3, both of which are expressed to apply only to the owner.
The Note at the end of provision 8.4.2 states “In the case of a MODU to which the 1989 MODU Code applies, the muster list must comply with that Code.” Since, by virtue of provision 1.8(c), “a note included in the text and printed in italics is not part of the Part”, it is difficult to ascertain the basis for the Note at the end of provision 8.4.2.
Clause 3.1 of Schedule 1 requires the owner of a MODU to ensure that the manning of the MODU comprises at least “such number of competent persons determined by the owner to be sufficient to undertake” the operations in question. Since this clause is, by virtue of provisions 5.1 and 7, a penal provision, it may be questioned whether it could readily be determined, on any particular occasion, whether the owner was guilty of an offence.
Marine Orders Part 60 - Floating Offshore Facilities - Issue 1
Marine Order No. 2 of 2000
The Order prescribes requirements for the construction and equipment of Floating Production, Storage and Offshore ships and Floating Storage Units.
Provision 8 imposes various obligations on those involved with the transfer of material, appliances and personnel and with the arrival and departure of helicopters.  However, provision 5 does not list that provision as a penal provision, even though the identical provisions in Marine Order No. 1 of 2000 - provisions 8.8 and 8.9 - are listed in that Order as penal provisions.
Notice No.1(2000) of Declared Rate in respect of Diesel Fuel Rebate made under subsection 164(5A) of the Customs Act 1901
The Notice that sets the rate of rebate payable in respect of diesel fuel purchased for use for five specific purposes is stated to have effect “on and after 2 February 2000”, but the Explanatory Statement observes that it was not notified in the Gazette until 3 February 2000. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking confirmation that the notice does not prejudicially affect any person other than the Commonwealth.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-04-13,"—Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brown moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notion No. 551.
This is an important motion. It comes from the raising of the forest issue by the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, Mr Tuckey, so I am not quite sure why the opposition is not backing it and has moved against formality. Mr Tuckey is the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, but he has failed in that portfolio. What he has done is stirred up a great deal of unnecessary heat attended with no light in the forest issue in Australia. The first thing that needs to be said here is that the promised success of the regional forest agreements under his ministry has become an absolute failure. The second thing that needs to be said is that the contention by those who felt that logging was an issue that was put to bed by the regional forest agreement is a patent failure. The third thing that needs to be said is that the majority of Australians are appalled by the massive onslaught of the woodchippers in Australia's forests from Western Australia to New South Wales and Tasmania since the regional forest agreement was signed.
Why is this happening? Because behind the scenes, the big woodchip corporations have power over government to have their way against the interests of the majority of Australians. So when young Australians, in particular—but they are aged right across the spectrum—go out to protest peacefully in the forests, they are acting on behalf of popular demand. They are doing the job that Wilson Tuckey fails to do. They are standing up for forests and conservation, something that the minister has failed to do in his portfolio.
In recent weeks, we have seen pro-logging vigilante groups taking the law into their own hands by bashing up and smashing the property of the peaceful protestors in the Otways and East Gippsland in particular, although similar raids have occurred in Tasmania, New South Wales and Western Australia in recent years. These thugs of the logging industry have taken the law into their own hands, and this is not a past matter. This is an urgent matter that we should be considering now. Indeed, the minister recognises that by his inflammatory statements, including his call yesterday on ABC radio for the state governments to prosecute the law or cancel the law. Let this be said: when it comes to the law, he and those he supports are defaulters. 
In Victoria, the Kennett government was twice found guilty of illegal logging in the period of the formulation of regional forest agreements. In Goolengook, the government, supported by the likes of Minister Tuckey, has logged hundreds of hectares of riverine national park illegally. Where was Mr Tuckey while that was occurring? To rectify its illegal actions, the Kennett government brought in retrospective law to cover its illegality. More recently, the Victorian government illegally logged water catchments in the Otways and was found by the courts to have done so. Where was Mr Tuckey to cavil about this breach of the law by the logging authorities backed by the government? 
In Tasmania, the woodchip corporations have illegally logged national and state forests. They have burnt out thousands of hectares of forests through fires that have got away from regeneration burns. They have burnt into and destroyed riverside logging areas illegally, against their own code. 
This minister speaks with a forked tongue. This minister is not an upholder of the law. This minister is selective against those citizens who wish to do his job for him. I commend this debate. We should be having this debate. This is about people whose lives are endangered now, and the situation is being inflamed by the minister, who should be correcting it by moving these loggers out of our native forests. (Time expired)
—Madam Deputy President, I have a point of order: I am sitting here reflecting on the words that Senator Brown has used. Is it correct for him to reflect on a person in the other place in the way that he has?
—No, it is not. Senator Brown, I would ask you to resist from reflecting upon anyone in that way, and your time has expired.
—On the point of order: Madam Deputy President, I was not reflecting. I was directly making comments on the behaviour of the minister and I stand by them. They are quite legitimate in this debating situation. 
—I would urge you to be cautious because some people could interpret it as a reflection and it is not orderly to reflect.",SENATE,<title>FORESTS: PROTESTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-13,"—I indicate that the opposition will not be supporting the motion for suspension. We have some difficulties with Senator Brown's motion. When the minister's own colleagues are asked about the actions or comments of the minister, they say, `Well, that's only Wilson Tuckey,' and I am quoting them and not being improper in any way in using the minister's name. The fact is that this is a minister who already has no credibility. For us to agree to debate this matter now would lend him credibility that he does not have.
—You are in full support.
—I hear Senator Brown interjecting. Isn't it interesting that his own motion is asking for things to be done through the regional forest agreement process, a process which I thought he opposed?",SENATE,<title>FORESTS: PROTESTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-04-13,"—It is appropriate to put the Democrats' position on the record on this issue. This is a matter relating to the inability of police and to the insightful statements by certain ministers against people who are exercising their legitimate right to protest against forest industry operations in native forests. It is quite clear that there has been an inadequate response to protect those people from thuggery and violence. That is a serious and urgent matter and it is one that my colleague Senator Allison has spoken out about quite strongly, because it is quite clear that there is a lot of evidence about the seriousness of some of the incidents and also the lack of response from law enforcement officials. That lack of response can hardly be helped when you have some of the inflammatory statements such as those by Minister Tuckey.
This is an important matter. It is one that the Democrats have already expressed concern about and will be continuing to follow through, because it is an issue that is ongoing—it is not a matter of being concerned about something that is in the past; it is an ongoing issue of people who are exercising a legitimate right to protest and who quite genuinely have significant fears for their safety. That is a situation that we should not have in a country like Australia, so we do believe it is an important, urgent matter and we certainly support the thrust of the motion.
—The question is that the motion moved by Senator Brown be agreed to. Those of that opinion say aye.
—Aye.
—To the contrary no.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—The noes have it. Is a division required?  
—Yes.
—A division is not required. The noes have it.
Question resolved in the negative. 
—Madam Deputy President, could I have it recorded that I did call for a division but do not have the numbers to have that taken into effect.
—Madam Deputy President, I would also like it recorded the Democrats did not want to use up the time of the Senate in a division, but I do record that we supported the motion.",SENATE,<title>FORESTS: PROTESTS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,7,1
"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2000-04-13,"—On behalf of the Senate Select Committee on Information Technologies, I present the committee's report entitled In the public interest—monitoring Australia's media, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, submissions and other documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This report is about the protection of the media and the protection of consumers. It is about enabling consumers to have confidence in the media, and the media having confidence in itself. While there are bad apples in every industry, this report seeks to put in place a means by which consumers can effectively complain about these breaches. The media is like any other profession in that consumers will have confidence in it if they know that it is underwritten by an efficient and effective consumer complaints regime. I would be delighted if the recommendations in the report today, particularly for a Media Complaints Commission, were never used because the media itself improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the complaints regime that already exists. The report provides an opportunity for improvements to be made to the self-regulation of Australia's media. The proposed reforms would enable the community to have more direct access to the existing complaints handling mechanisms, thereby developing a more effective consumer voice. 
Australia's media industries affect the lives of all Australians on a daily basis, and the community relies on these industries—that is, the print media, television, radio, telephone and now the Internet—to be informed, to be entertained and to communicate with each other. As a former journalist, I value and respect the freedom of the media, but with this right comes responsibility. The integrity of the media must be protected as it expands and develops. Effective regulation involving a balancing and protecting of industry interests while recognising and caring for the wider interests of the Australian community is also important. One way in which regulation is currently managed is through codes of practice that have been developed over the years by the industries themselves.
However, the committee found substantial evidence to question the success of the existing self-regulation process. There were breaches in the privacy of individuals. For example, a photograph of former Senator Bob Woods and his wife, which was published in the Daily Telegraph in 1996, was labelled by the Australian Press Council as `a blatant example of the unjustified breach of privacy'. The photograph was subsequently republished in the Daily Telegraph as part of a portfolio that won a merit award for the press photographer concerned.
There was the display of undesirable images. For example, in 1998 the Townsville Bulletin published a photograph of a circus act that showed a woman performer's face contorting as air was sucked from a plastic bag that she was wearing over her head. A complaint was lodged alleging that the photograph may encourage children to perform a similar act, with possible fatal consequences. Although the photograph was found to have breached the Australian Press Council's statement of principles, it was published a second time as part of an editorial that disputed the Australian Press Council's adjudication. 
There was the broadcasting of undesirable content—for example, a commercial radio station broadcast from a brothel that involved live sexual activity. There were news broadcasts that were influenced by commercial arrangements. For example, the recent `cash for comments' inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Authority into radio station 2UE Sydney Pty Ltd found that certain news and current affairs broadcasts promoted the commercial interests of sponsors.
The conduct of the media is a major issue of concern for the Australian public. In a 1997 Clemenger survey about the everyday problems of Australians, the conduct of the news media accounted for six of the top 40 problems identified. It ranked behind only health and welfare and crime and punishment, and ahead of race and immigration, education and drugs. Just 30 years ago, the same Clemenger survey found that media issues did not rate at all, and even 20 years ago they rated very low. The committee heard evidence that there is confusion about where specific complaints ought to be directed across the industries and that the ensuing delays and the complexity involved in making a complaint further frustrated the process. The timeliness of the complaints process was also criticised. For this reason, the committee has recommended that the Broadcasting Services Act 1922 be amended so that a complaint can be taken to the Australian Broadcasting Authority 30 days after it is lodged, as opposed to the 60-day period that currently applies.
The majority of the committee believe that several additional improvements can be made to self-regulation, such as better and more proactive enforcement of the self-regulatory codes of practice; an increased awareness of and ability to complain about breaches of codes of practice by the media industries; and increased guidance on the self-regulatory codes of practice that protect an individual's right to privacy. The majority of the committee address these challenges by recommending the establishment of a media complaints commission. Specifically, it recommends that an independent statutory body known as the Media Complaints Commission be established to advise individuals who wish to lodge a complaint against Australia's media; that the Media Complaints Commission provide a single reference point for all complaints, regardless of which media outlet is involved; and that, as a one-stop-shop, the Media Complaints Commission would also assist individuals in lodging their complaints and in the process of having them heard. This assistance will of course include interpreting services.
We have recommended that the Media Complaints Commission function as a final arbiter for complaints and be able to empower individuals making a complaint and act as an independent link between community and proprietor; and that the Media Complaints Commission's annual report to the parliament show how it has contributed to the better and more proactive enforcement of the self-regulatory codes. It would also include for the first time comprehensive data about the complaints that have been recorded throughout the year and the way in which they have been resolved. At present this data is not collected and coordinated.
I am very pleased to note that the recommendations that emerged from the Productivity Commission's recent inquiry into broadcasting will complement the functions of the MCC. Importantly, the current models for self-regulation will continue to operate. Codes of practice and complaint handling procedures will continue to be largely developed and administered by the media industries themselves. Further, the industry member would in each case continue to be the principal body to deal with the complaint. What we are talking about is a last resort for unresolved complaints for those people who believe that their complaints have not been adequately addressed. I commend the report to the Senate",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Information Technologies Committee</title>,Committees,10,1
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-04-13,"—The findings of the Senate IT committee into self-regulation in the information and communication industries need to be considered in the context of the far-reaching and significant changes these industries are undergoing as a result of rapidly advancing technologies. Labor senators recognise the importance of the information and communication industries both economically and as an element of our democratic society. We recognise, too, the fact that arising from these functions of the media are responsibilities to prevent the misuse of the ensuing powers. Typical regulation of the communications and information industries has been industry based; however, the increasing convergence of these industries necessitates reconsideration of the policy frameworks within which they operate. It is apparent that industry convergence will inevitably complicate government intervention and regulation over the coming years. Juxtaposed with this emerging convergence are the existing fragmented and industry specific regulatory frameworks. There are presently distinct regulatory regimes for telephony, the Internet, print media, and radio and television broadcasters. These disparate frameworks prescribe varying degrees of self-regulation and coregulation for the industries which commonly develop the framework to which they are subject. 
The predominant concerns of Labor senators with the existing regulatory structure relate to whether the privacy of individuals is adequately protected; whether there are adequate controls over the publishing, broadcasting and the like of content some consider undesirable; the impact of commercial arrangements on the content of news and current affairs; and the insidious breaches of the self-regulatory code by commercial radio stations evidenced by the ABA's findings into the 2UE report on the commercial radio inquiry into commercial arrangements between 2UE's presenters and various corporations. 
Labor senators believe that it is important to maintain a balance between regulatory control of the information and communication industries and basic freedom of speech. At the same time, we recognise that there are transgressions in these industries relating to intrusion into individuals' privacy and instances where the media has gone too far. Concerns relating to the regulation of the print media's regulation under the oversight of the Australian Press Council were raised about the following matters: the APC's failure to proactively investigate potential breaches of their statement of principles; the ineffectual consequences of the APC's adjudication and enforcement powers; an apparent lack of community awareness of the availability—and, as a consequence, underutilisation—of the APC's complaints procedure; the APC's time frame for handling complaints; and the apparent inadequacy of measures for the protection of individuals' privacy as a result of enforceability matters. Labor senators support the APC's endeavours to respond positively to the criticisms of the self-regulatory regime that it oversees and believe that continued advancement should improve that regime.
Australian television broadcasters operate within a co-regulatory framework in which codes of practice are developed and managed under the supervision, and with the assistance, of the ABA. There was acknowledgment from within the industry that instances of overtly intrusive activities illustrated the need for ongoing attention to the review and the development of mechanisms directed at preventing such activities. The principal criticisms of the existing system are that there is a lack of public awareness of the complaints handling procedures available, that the time frame for complaints is too long, that the ABA is failing to adequately monitor compliance with the codes of practice and that there is a lack of meaningful penalties for breaches of the code by broadcasters.
The scheme that applies to the radio industry mirrors the co-regulatory scheme that applies to commercial television broadcasters. The efficiency of the scheme, as it relates to the radio industry, is dubious in the light of the ABA's recent findings in its now notorious `cash for comment' inquiry. The ABA has reported the findings of its investigation into radio 2UE and the commercial arrangements between 2UE, radio presenters and corporations. As a result of the adverse finding that radio 2UE breached the Broadcasting Services Act and the commercial radio code of practice on numerous occasions, the ABA has imposed conditions on 2UE's broadcasting licence. The ABA's findings indicate an urgent need for the government to legislate for across-the-board disclosure requirements like those imposed on 2UE's licence for all the commercial radio broadcasters. Government action is required on this front. 
The regulatory issues faced by the telecommunications industry are substantially unlike those discussed for other communications media. In the telephone and Internet industries two distinct regulatory schemes apply: firstly, to regulation of the carriage and, secondly, to regulation of the content of information. Labor will review the effectiveness of the Broadcasting Services Act in regulating content, subsequent to the six-monthly reports that the government is required to table, pursuant to a Senate resolution. Evidence to the committee regarding the limitations of the self-regulatory scheme for carriage focused on concerns with code development and coverage, the apparent ineffectiveness of monitoring and the enforcement of compliance. The relevant industry and regulatory bodies should afford these matters due consideration.
ALP senators are very concerned at evidence elucidating the privacy implications of databases storing personal and financial information on individuals for consumer purposes. It is of particular concern to the ALP that the gathering of information constituting an invasion of privacy, including via the Internet, is largely unregulated. Evidence that there is an involvement in such activity by the Australian information and communications industries is of considerable concern and must be addressed by suitable privacy legislation. Concerns about such databases include: unregulated, the information provided could be inaccurate and misleading, with potential implications for an individual's credit rating, for example; moral objections to infringements of a person's right to confidentiality of personal information; the inability of consumers, in the absence of regulatory controls, to know when information is being collected, who is collecting it, how that information will be used and to whom it will be disclosed; and, that the resultant uncertainty in the community might inhibit the development of e-commerce industries in Australia.
In conclusion, ALP senators believe there is insufficient evidence to conclude that self-regulation of the communications and information industries has failed to a substantial degree, with the obvious exception of the radio industry. There are not significant numbers of complaints evidencing regular and systematic breaches of the relevant codes or standards of practice in the print and television media. Labor senators do not consider it appropriate at present to diminish or override the impact of the regulatory schemes and risk compromising the media's freedom of speech whilst there is scope for appropriate alteration of existing schemes to address the complaints raised.
The radio industry requires urgent government attention. The government needs to legislate for across-the-board disclosure requirements, like those imposed on radio 2UE's licence by the ABA. Action on individual stations in response to code breaches is an inadequate safeguard against the ongoing and blatant disregard of the codes of practice and the act. Labor senators are very concerned about the privacy implications of databases storing personal and financial information on individuals for consumer purposes. Evidence that Australia's information and communications industries are involved in such activity is of considerable concern and needs to be addressed by suitable privacy legislation. 
Finally, Labor do not support the chair's proposal for the establishment of a media complaints commission, for the principal reason that, with the exception of the commercial radio industry, we do not believe breaches of the existing regulatory system that have been identified are of such number, so systematic, so recurrent or of such a structural nature as to warrant the creation of the overarching body, as recommended in the chair's report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Information Technologies Committee</title>,Committees,10,1

Just 30 years ago, the same Clemenger survey found that media issues did not rate at all, and even 20 years ago they rated very low. The committee heard evidence that there is confusion about where specific complaints ought to be directed across the industries and that the ensuing delays and the complexity involved in making a complaint further frustrated the process. The timeliness of the complaints process was also criticised. For this reason, the committee has recommended that the Broadcasting Services Act 1922 be amended so that a complaint can be taken to the Australian Broadcasting Authority 30 days after it is lodged, as opposed to the 60-day period that currently applies.
The majority of the committee believe that several additional improvements can be made to self-regulation, such as better and more proactive enforcement of the self-regulatory codes of practice; an increased awareness of and ability to complain about breaches of codes of practice by the media industries; and increased guidance on the self-regulatory codes of practice that protect an individual's right to privacy. The majority of the committee address these challenges by recommending the establishment of a media complaints commission. Specifically, it recommends that an independent statutory body known as the Media Complaints Commission be established to advise individuals who wish to lodge a complaint against Australia's media; that the Media Complaints Commission provide a single reference point for all complaints, regardless of which media outlet is involved; and that, as a one-stop-shop, the Media Complaints Commission would also assist individuals in lodging their complaints and in the process of having them heard. This assistance will of course include interpreting services.
We have recommended that the Media Complaints Commission function as a final arbiter for complaints and be able to empower individuals making a complaint and act as an independent link between community and proprietor; and that the Media Complaints Commission's annual report to the parliament show how it has contributed to the better and more proactive enforcement of the self-regulatory codes. It would also include for the first time comprehensive data about the complaints that have been recorded throughout the year and the way in which they have been resolved. At present this data is not collected and coordinated.
I am very pleased to note that the recommendations that emerged from the Productivity Commission's recent inquiry into broadcasting will complement the functions of the MCC. Importantly, the current models for self-regulation will continue to operate. Codes of practice and complaint handling procedures will continue to be largely developed and administered by the media industries themselves. Further, the industry member would in each case continue to be the principal body to deal with the complaint. What we are talking about is a last resort for unresolved complaints for those people who believe that their complaints have not been adequately addressed. I commend the report to the Senate",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,10,2
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-04-13,"—The findings of the Senate IT committee into self-regulation in the information and communication industries need to be considered in the context of the far-reaching and significant changes these industries are undergoing as a result of rapidly advancing technologies. Labor senators recognise the importance of the information and communication industries both economically and as an element of our democratic society. We recognise, too, the fact that arising from these functions of the media are responsibilities to prevent the misuse of the ensuing powers. Typical regulation of the communications and information industries has been industry based; however, the increasing convergence of these industries necessitates reconsideration of the policy frameworks within which they operate. It is apparent that industry convergence will inevitably complicate government intervention and regulation over the coming years. Juxtaposed with this emerging convergence are the existing fragmented and industry specific regulatory frameworks. There are presently distinct regulatory regimes for telephony, the Internet, print media, and radio and television broadcasters. These disparate frameworks prescribe varying degrees of self-regulation and coregulation for the industries which commonly develop the framework to which they are subject. 
The predominant concerns of Labor senators with the existing regulatory structure relate to whether the privacy of individuals is adequately protected; whether there are adequate controls over the publishing, broadcasting and the like of content some consider undesirable; the impact of commercial arrangements on the content of news and current affairs; and the insidious breaches of the self-regulatory code by commercial radio stations evidenced by the ABA's findings into the 2UE report on the commercial radio inquiry into commercial arrangements between 2UE's presenters and various corporations. 
Labor senators believe that it is important to maintain a balance between regulatory control of the information and communication industries and basic freedom of speech. At the same time, we recognise that there are transgressions in these industries relating to intrusion into individuals' privacy and instances where the media has gone too far. Concerns relating to the regulation of the print media's regulation under the oversight of the Australian Press Council were raised about the following matters: the APC's failure to proactively investigate potential breaches of their statement of principles; the ineffectual consequences of the APC's adjudication and enforcement powers; an apparent lack of community awareness of the availability—and, as a consequence, underutilisation—of the APC's complaints procedure; the APC's time frame for handling complaints; and the apparent inadequacy of measures for the protection of individuals' privacy as a result of enforceability matters. Labor senators support the APC's endeavours to respond positively to the criticisms of the self-regulatory regime that it oversees and believe that continued advancement should improve that regime.
Australian television broadcasters operate within a co-regulatory framework in which codes of practice are developed and managed under the supervision, and with the assistance, of the ABA. There was acknowledgment from within the industry that instances of overtly intrusive activities illustrated the need for ongoing attention to the review and the development of mechanisms directed at preventing such activities. The principal criticisms of the existing system are that there is a lack of public awareness of the complaints handling procedures available, that the time frame for complaints is too long, that the ABA is failing to adequately monitor compliance with the codes of practice and that there is a lack of meaningful penalties for breaches of the code by broadcasters.
The scheme that applies to the radio industry mirrors the co-regulatory scheme that applies to commercial television broadcasters. The efficiency of the scheme, as it relates to the radio industry, is dubious in the light of the ABA's recent findings in its now notorious `cash for comment' inquiry. The ABA has reported the findings of its investigation into radio 2UE and the commercial arrangements between 2UE, radio presenters and corporations. As a result of the adverse finding that radio 2UE breached the Broadcasting Services Act and the commercial radio code of practice on numerous occasions, the ABA has imposed conditions on 2UE's broadcasting licence. The ABA's findings indicate an urgent need for the government to legislate for across-the-board disclosure requirements like those imposed on 2UE's licence for all the commercial radio broadcasters. Government action is required on this front. 
The regulatory issues faced by the telecommunications industry are substantially unlike those discussed for other communications media. In the telephone and Internet industries two distinct regulatory schemes apply: firstly, to regulation of the carriage and, secondly, to regulation of the content of information. Labor will review the effectiveness of the Broadcasting Services Act in regulating content, subsequent to the six-monthly reports that the government is required to table, pursuant to a Senate resolution. Evidence to the committee regarding the limitations of the self-regulatory scheme for carriage focused on concerns with code development and coverage, the apparent ineffectiveness of monitoring and the enforcement of compliance. The relevant industry and regulatory bodies should afford these matters due consideration.
ALP senators are very concerned at evidence elucidating the privacy implications of databases storing personal and financial information on individuals for consumer purposes. It is of particular concern to the ALP that the gathering of information constituting an invasion of privacy, including via the Internet, is largely unregulated. Evidence that there is an involvement in such activity by the Australian information and communications industries is of considerable concern and must be addressed by suitable privacy legislation. Concerns about such databases include: unregulated, the information provided could be inaccurate and misleading, with potential implications for an individual's credit rating, for example; moral objections to infringements of a person's right to confidentiality of personal information; the inability of consumers, in the absence of regulatory controls, to know when information is being collected, who is collecting it, how that information will be used and to whom it will be disclosed; and, that the resultant uncertainty in the community might inhibit the development of e-commerce industries in Australia.
In conclusion, ALP senators believe there is insufficient evidence to conclude that self-regulation of the communications and information industries has failed to a substantial degree, with the obvious exception of the radio industry. There are not significant numbers of complaints evidencing regular and systematic breaches of the relevant codes or standards of practice in the print and television media. Labor senators do not consider it appropriate at present to diminish or override the impact of the regulatory schemes and risk compromising the media's freedom of speech whilst there is scope for appropriate alteration of existing schemes to address the complaints raised.
The radio industry requires urgent government attention. The government needs to legislate for across-the-board disclosure requirements, like those imposed on radio 2UE's licence by the ABA. Action on individual stations in response to code breaches is an inadequate safeguard against the ongoing and blatant disregard of the codes of practice and the act. Labor senators are very concerned about the privacy implications of databases storing personal and financial information on individuals for consumer purposes. Evidence that Australia's information and communications industries are involved in such activity is of considerable concern and needs to be addressed by suitable privacy legislation. 
Finally, Labor do not support the chair's proposal for the establishment of a media complaints commission, for the principal reason that, with the exception of the commercial radio industry, we do not believe breaches of the existing regulatory system that have been identified are of such number, so systematic, so recurrent or of such a structural nature as to warrant the creation of the overarching body, as recommended in the chair's report.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,10,2

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-04-13,"—I wish to make a few comments on that motion. The Labor Party made clear in the original debate in this chamber our concerns about the many deficiencies of this legislation. In particular, we were concerned about the requirement that the family estimates income in advance with no margin for error before receiving the family tax benefit, the changes to income tests that will leave families worse off when one parent takes maternity leave and changes to shared care provisions. We accept that there was little we could do about the first two issues, but we are very keen to try to improve the shared care provisions. 
We accept that legislation impacting on those shared care provisions was passed by the Senate last year and that, given the complexity and size of the legislation, we were not able to debate or to notice the impact on shared care arrangements that were contained in those bills. We have tried to use this legislation to have a proper debate about this important issue. That was the purpose of the amendments that the Senate carried the other day, and I am grateful for the support of the Democrats and others in carrying those amendments. We believe those amendments improve the legislation and strike a better balance between the needs of both custodial and non-custodial parents who share the care of the children. 
The government, it seems, has refused to budge on its position in this regard. I understand that it argues that the whole thing is well down the track and that that creates some difficulties, and there is obviously some basis for that argument. We still think that our proposed shared care arrangements are far superior to those of the government. We think the government's amendments are inappropriate, particularly given their inconsistency with the approach in the Child Support Act with the 30 per cent threshold which we propose should remain. We also think our amendments are closer to the intent of recent family law reforms which seek to engender greater involvement of separated parents in the lives of their children. That is achieved by rewarding both cooperative parenting and encouraging substantial involvement by the non-custodial parent. The government's original legislation provides a financial incentive for non-custodial parents to participate in a minimal rather than a substantial way in the child's life. We think that, under the Labor amendments, no family need have been worse off. 
We are most concerned that the government's legislation automatically removes assistance from custodial parents who declare shared care arrangements. The minister was unable to detail in the debate the numbers of those parents. We think there are large numbers of custodial parents who will lose a percentage of their benefit as a result of this move. We are particularly concerned that they might lose that benefit even where the non-custodial parent does not apply. It seems to us that there ought to be a better way of being able to resolve these issues. The government is automatically removing a percentage of the benefit to benefit the non-custodial parent who may in fact not want it.
I have looked at the figures about the benefits paid and the incomes of the people involved and I have had a look at the research to which the minister referred us, which I do not think is nearly as convincing as she claims—and they themselves make the point that it is very much exploratory research based on small and not necessarily representative samples. We think that the small amounts of money involved in most families cases do not warrant the change, and the arguments put in that research certainly do not justify some of the conclusions drawn from them. But, as I say, our main concern is that automatically benefit will be taken away from the custodial parent. The other thing that concerns us is that we are not convinced that the other parent will necessarily get the benefit. I asked the minister this question in the original debate and she assured me that they would but the advice I have about briefings given to the opposition, which I was not present at, indicates it is not automatically the case that the other parent will get the benefit. We understand that there will be no active mechanism to contact the non-custodial parent who becomes eligible for assistance for the first time. If the other parent does not claim, we are concerned that the government will keep the difference—and therefore the separated family, taken in total, will be worse off—and that this in fact will be a savings measure.
We understand from the department that only non-custodial parents who are already receiving a share of family allowance will be contacted directly to be advised of the new arrangements. Those parent who are currently outside the system but are sharing care will not be directly contacted by the Family Assistance Office or other agencies. We think that is a serious deficiency. I asked for reassurance about that in the original debate and I am not sure that the minister quite got the point that I was trying to make. That may be because I did not explain it very adequately and I am prepared to concede that because this is a complex area.
One of our other major concerns is that, firstly, automatically you take it off the custodial parent and, secondly, that does not necessarily mean that the non-custodial parent will get the benefit. Both of those issues are important. We think it is an arbitrary system. It does not allow for flexibility, it does not allow for consultation between the parents, and that seems to run counter to a lot of other things the minister says about initiatives the government has supported in other areas, so we still think it is a deficiency. We know there is generic advertising and TV and newspaper campaigns but, as we all know, the take-up rate on these things is limited: people do not understand, and we have spent millions of dollars in other campaigns where people still have not got the message and have not applied for benefits even sometimes when they are quite large benefits that they are entitled to. That is another major concern that we have and I hope the government can provide some reassurance about that. 
Having said that, the Labor opposition always realised we were behind the eight ball in this debate in terms of the total package of A New Tax System. Shared care is one issue among a whole range of issues in very complex legislation that has come through the chamber in a number of ways and the opposition cannot seek to overturn this one measure by holding up the whole family tax package initiative. That is an invidious position to be in. We do not like it. We wish it were otherwise but, on balance, we accept that we cannot seek to hold up the whole new tax system and family assistance related measures in order to achieve a better outcome on shared care. 
I do hope, however, that the minister will take the concerns we have raised seriously. We remain very unhappy about the shared care propositions. We do not accept the arguments and we think there could have been a much better result. But the Labor opposition will not be insisting on the amendments, given the fact that this is one issue in a much broader package and that to delay the bill would, I suspect, without the minister having to lay it on too thickly, upset the totality of the package. So it is with great reluctance that I indicate the opposition will not be insisting on its amendments.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-04-13,"—Realising that it is the final day of this session and the pressures of time, I will try to be brief. I did indicate to the minister's office some issues that I would like her to outline on the record in the chamber about the consultation process that was used in arriving at the 10 per cent, the use of the new shared care arrangements in modelling that might have been done in terms of the overall impacts of the new tax system, and a couple of other matters. I put these issues on the record now so, hopefully, she can respond in one go to everything that we have raised. 
It is worth putting on the record an acknowledgment that the implementation of the 10 per cent threshold was part of the overall legislation that was passed in June last year. To the extent that we were not fully aware of that and of its potential ramifications, that is obviously something we have to accept some responsibility for. Looking further at it, while I must say I still cannot figure it out from reading the legislation, I do concede that in part of the explanatory memorandum at the time relating to that one particular clause there was an indication of that. I see moving to this 10 per cent threshold as quite a potentially major change and I do think it is one that might have been highlighted a little more clearly, because it is a significant change that one could feel was being put in the midst of quite a huge change overall in implementing a new family tax benefit payment. I am not trying to imply that the government snuck it in there and hoped we would not notice it all; I am simply saying it was a major change in its own right and it certainly could have done with some more scrutiny. The fact that some of the groups that are now expressing concern about this were not aware of the change at the time either indicates that perhaps there was not as much attention paid to it as there should have been or could have been. I guess we all have to take some responsibility for that.
It is also worth noting that, whilst the minister mentioned the policy research paper from the department and her office kindly provided a copy to me to make sure I had read it, and that is useful, it does in itself say that it is quite preliminary research and that it should be treated only as exploratory and not necessarily as representative of the overall population. I would also say that the ACOSS submission which the minister referred to which talked about shared care in general did not specifically talk about the shift to a 10 per cent threshold. Indeed, its recommendation about shared care was very different to what is actually in the legislation. So the suggestion that ACOSS was fully aware of and fully supportive of this change is not completely accurate. Nonetheless, as I say, the change was made at that time. While still very concerned about the potential impact, I welcome the minister's commitment, which I am sure she will repeat, about the government monitoring the impacts of the change. This is an area where none of us, including the groups in the community, can be 100 per cent sure of how it is going to work and what the impacts will be, and in that circumstance it is certainly appropriate to monitor it and assess how it does operate in practice.  
I remind the minister that, seeing this is part of the new tax system package which we all know and love so well, as part of the agreement that was reached on putting that package through there was a commitment from the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Democrats that he would ensure that no sole parent was significantly worse off. I am sure that is a genuine commitment and I am sure that the minister shares that commitment, and as part of monitoring the impact of this we will be trying our very hardest to ensure that that commitment is translated into reality.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FAMILY ASSISTANCE AND RELATED MEASURES) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,14,1
"Newman, Sen Jocelyn",LP,2000-04-13,"—I want to respond to the senators who have spoken. I do appreciate the fact that senators have recognised this as a very important piece of legislation with great ramifications for a whole lot of people. None of us would want to see child-care benefits denied to Australia's families, but that would be the implication if this did not pass, because it is the bill that contains all the machinery provisions for actual payment of entitlement to families for child care. So it would have been a very serious matter if we had stalled it at this stage, and I appreciate the other parties recognising the importance of the bill.
In answer to Senator Evans, the other parent does need to claim; that is quite correct. But also we will be contacting them if we know about them. The chances are we do know about a lot of people, because letters are going out, for example, to people who are currently getting family tax initiative, the dependent spouse rebate with child or the sole parent rebate with child. In that context, a lot of people who will be affected by this measure will be directly contacted.
I also want to answer the queries that Senator Bartlett has raised with me, and I will read them into Hansard now. Senator Bartlett firstly asked whether the government can outline in more detail who was consulted in arriving at the 10 per cent shared care rate, whether there was any other research or reports done and which organisations were consulted before arriving at the rate and informed about the change. In November and December 1998, my department conducted a round of consultations with a number of peak community groups. I can provide the list of groups, and the names of all those who were invited are attached. I think most of them did accept the invitation. Those who could not be there in person sent submissions. Meetings were held with most of the organisations. The main factors taken into account when the government determined the appropriate level of care that should attract a payment of family tax benefit were the existing shared care payment arrangements for the benefits being rolled into the family tax benefit and the views expressed by community groups during those consultations.
The second query from Senator Bartlett was whether the impact of the introduction of the 10 per cent rate was incorporated in any modelling of the overall impact of ANTS, that is, did NATSEM, Access Economics or others who did modelling incorporate the probability of some sole parents receiving only 90 per cent or 75 per cent of FTB. I am not aware that NATSEM or Access Economics did include those parameters in their modelling. However, it would be extremely difficult to model this because assumptions would have to be made about whether the non-resident parent had claimed certain benefits under the current system. 
The third query related to people who are able to demonstrate that they are disadvantaged by the change being able to access the one-off payment that I spoke about in my statement recently. I think the simple answer to that is that I will provide details on the operation of the review process at a later time.
The fourth query related to my promise in the chamber in the debate previously to monitor the implementation and the impacts and to table a report on it. Senator Bartlett asked for more details about that. The answer to that, Senator, is that my department will collect data relating to the number of customers receiving shared payment of FTB when available. Data will commence to be available early in the first year after assessments have been made for the commencement of the family tax benefit payments. However, most of the data will not be available until the majority of families have lodged a tax return for the 2000-01 tax year, and therefore the government will monitor the measure over the first year of operation and will table a report in the Senate towards the end of 2001, next year, when most parents will have lodged tax returns. The report will detail the effects of the shared care arrangements on separated parents.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-13,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 June 2000:
The provisions of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 9), made under the Customs Act 1901 and tabled in the Senate on 15 February 2000.
The opposition has moved that this matter—that is, the provision of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.9), made under the Customs Act 1901 and tabled in the Senate on 15 February 2000—be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 February 2000.
A reference of this nature to a committee is to give this issue a proper hearing and some analysis. I was told this morning that, apparently, there is some deal, being contemplated at least, again, between the government and the Democrats on this issue. So, if the government and the Democrats join together again to block this reference—if they are at it again—they will be repeating what happened when they negotiated the Measures for a Better Environment package, as they termed it. Remember that this is the basis of the regulation which is the subject of this motion.
Measures for a Better Environment was negotiated in haste and in private and was part of the negotiation to get the GST deal done. And here we are apparently confronting another exercise to fix that problem—because there is no doubt that the deal that was done in this area caused more problems than it resolved—and there has been no consultation or involvement with anyone. It is of fundamental importance to the opposition that the people and businesses affected by this regulation or any change to the measures contained in this regulation have the opportunity to be consulted about its implications. This regulation implements one part of the Measures for a Better Environment agreed between the government and the Democrats, as I said, to secure the Democrats' support for the GST.  
The regulation in question inserts a new 4C into the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999. This will subject the importation of any used diesel engines, designed for use in road vehicles, to the permission of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services or an authorised officer. Approval is required for each individual engine. The minister or the minister's delegate may only grant permission for the import if the engine complies with the Australian design rules. The applicable design rules are 30/00, Diesel Engine Exhaust Smoke Emissions, and 70/00, Exhaust Emission Control for Diesel Engine Vehicles. The importer in those cases would be required to have each engine undergo a full certification test, as specified in the current emission ADRs and the test report provided to the Department of Transport and Regional Services for approval to import the engine. This would have to occur prior to the arrival of the engines in Australia and would add between $2,000 and $15,000 to the cost of each engine, depending on its size. 
The Department of Transport and Regional Services have prepared and issued a `Regulation Impact Statement' which is quite critical of the regulation change. That statement confirms the industry concern that the cost of undertaking an emission test would result in limited or no used diesel engines being imported. That statement advises that it is not possible to determine the proportion of health costs attributable to imported second-hand diesel engines but says that it is likely to be small given that they account for less than one per cent of the diesel motor vehicle fleet. The department's statement also advised that the total cost of this impact has not been quantified and that although there would be some benefits in terms of reduced emissions these could not be estimated without extensive research. 
What about the businesses that import the engines? I am advised that this measure will force the closure of 90 per cent of the 85 businesses that import engines, and many of these businesses are in regional areas. Within 18 months existing supplies of engines and spares will be exhausted. That means that, in a short time, only new spare parts will be available to farmers and other users, dramatically increasing the cost of repairs. The cost of repairing trucks will also increase dramatically as those spare parts are imported in tandem with second-hand engines. This will increase costs in the agriculture, transport, marine, building, earthmoving excavation, engine reconditioning, auto recycling and the pump and generator equipment sectors. There will be a significant reduction of competition in the diesel engine sector and the price pressure on the manufacturers of new engines will all but disappear. 
Increased costs mean reduced maintenance and increased environmental problems. In terms of the policy development to help regional Australia, this is far from the government's finest hour—and you do not have to take my word for this: you can rely on one of the architects of this measure, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr John Anderson. In an astonishing statement on his own law making, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services confessed baldly to the negative environmental impact of the regulation. He said in an interview on the 7.30 Report on 23 March:
I have to say that we are now in receipt of more accurate information which suggests that the environmental benefits that they—
by `they' he means the Democrats—
were concerned about are not as evident as they thought. They may, in fact, be negative and I can confirm to you that I'm looking again at this ...
And Senator Allison replied:
Well, it was Mr Anderson, in discussions with Meg Lees, who agreed to this restriction. So it isn't something that the Federal Government should be now saying they want to walk away from, I would have thought.
Confirmation: they did the deal in secret and then they set about passing the buck to one another. Yes, it can get confusing. The Democrats and the government signed off on this regulation as a `Measure for a Better Environment'. But, frankly, it is hard to tell who did the research and who conceived this measure. It can certainly be ascertained now that it was not anyone with an understanding of its impact. 
Now we have talk of another deal. Senator Allison said to me this morning, `We don't want you to proceed with this resolution because we think we've got an agreement, but we don't want to release it now; we are going to release it in about a week.' There have been various reports over the past couple of days which have reported different versions of the new deal. We do not know what it is. Apparently, it is so secret or so shaky that no-one can confidently say exactly what it will be or when it will be released. We do not know whether the government will in fact be withdrawing the regulation, the subject of this proposed inquiry. The government can stand up here today and indicate to the Senate whether they will be withdrawing it, and that may be helpful in the debate. The Democrats can stand up in the debate and tell the Senate and the public just what is contemplated in this new deal and accept responsibility—or at least their part of it—for what appears to be a very poor arrangement, as I said, made in secret as part of the GST deal.
Maybe at the end of the day they will be able to come up with something which stands up to the test of public scrutiny and on which we can be convinced that they might well have it right this time. But at this stage this side of the chamber is not convinced that this matter is proceeding properly, that the government and the Democrats have got it right or that they are likely to get it right. We need to have a proper look at this matter and it is important that this motion be carried so that this matter can be examined by the committee and so that those people with an interest in it, not just the government and the Democrats, can put their view in public on the Hansard and the matter can be considered by this committee. 
May I say that this committee has been one of the most cooperative in the sense that many of its findings have been bipartisan. The committee has looked at the facts of the matters and has come to conclusions based on those facts, not on the basis of backroom deals. If the government and the Democrats have any confidence that the measures that are now on the table can stand the test of scrutiny, they will support this proposed reference. Of course, their comments will probably indicate that they do not want that scrutiny, that they do not want this matter examined in the light of day and that they do not want on the record matters which might contaminate the arrangements that they have made in private. All I can say is that the opposition commends this motion to the Senate and that, if the Democrats and the government are fair dinkum, they will support it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,16,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-04-13,"—The Democrats do not believe it is necessary to proceed to an inquiry on this issue. We agree that there need to be changes to the current arrangements and we have been talking with the government and with industry to find a workable solution, and I think we are very close to that. In fact, if you talk with the industry you will find in fact that the trucking association is not opposed to this restriction and that it is really a question of dealing with the problems for the importers of diesel engines and, as I say, I think we have found a solution to that problem. 
The Democrats set stringent requirements for the importation of second-hand diesel engines as part of the tax package, as Senator O'Brien has already indicated. There were two reasons for that. We think engines imported into Australia should be able to demonstrate that they meet our current standards. Very few countries in the world set standards and then allow those to be watered down by the bringing-in of equipment that does not meet those standards. We need to draw attention to the fact that the Australian standards are woefully lower than the standards overseas. That is thanks to previous governments that have neglected this whole question of air pollution and have put us in a situation where diesel trucks in Australia are 14 to 15 years old on average. That is on average, which means that there are a lot of trucks rumbling around, particularly in the cities, spewing out enormous amounts of pollution. For this reason 1,160 is the estimated number of people who die directly from the particulate pollution that comes from diesel engines. 
So our fleet is much older than those in most OECD countries and it is much more polluting, and engines that are being imported include those that are 20 years old, 30 years old and even older. Unlike other countries, we do not require vehicles to be tested to ensure that they comply even with our miserable standards, so another failure of previous governments is that we have in place a regime where we do not even know whether the vehicles that are on the road meet the standards that we have. The result of this is that maintenance is ignored here and that diesel engines continue to spew out their particulate laden dangerous emissions. I heard the other day that the engineers for CityLink, the tunnel project in Melbourne, had to install exhaust equipment which was designed to cope with pollution levels that have not been tolerated in Europe for more than 17 years. It is a great pity that the residents of Richmond and the residents of other suburbs around freeways and tunnels of this sort will have to put up with the concentration of this pollution for some years to come. However, we have now put in place measures that will correct the situation.
So we did fix up the question of pollution in our tax negotiation with the government, and our emission standards, instead of being a decade or more behind Europe, the United States and the UK, will catch up by going to Euro 4 standards by the year 2006. I remind the Senate that particulate emissions for Euro 4 are 95 per cent lower than our current standards. Dirty diesel, the diesel that has high levels of sulphur in it, makes it impossible for even the newest, best maintained engines to perform efficiently and cleanly. That too has been dealt with in our tax package with the government. So from the year 2003, diesel with a sulphur content of more than 50 parts per million will be penalised by an extra 2c a litre excise. Again, thanks to previous governments, we tolerate a level of sulphur 10 times that of the UK, and if you ask any truckie they will tell you what sulphur does to their engines. It costs them an enormous amount of money and it certainly does not do anything for pollution.
While the problem will eventually be fixed by emission standards, by fuels and by the other measures that are in place, we do not want Australia to become a dumping ground for engines that other countries will not allow on their roads. Already we take thousands of vehicles from Japan for just that reason: Japan no longer wants them. Australia has become a poor cousin and is accepting polluting vehicles while other countries are not. Having said all that, we did see the arguments of the engine importers that testing overseas would be prohibitively expensive and that changes to this substantial side of their business would seriously affect them. There is an issue relating to spare parts; also, one-third of the 5,000 engines imported are used in farm machinery and farmers are concerned at the cost. We are amenable to revisiting this situation. We are not prepared to undermine the very strong policy position of new emission standards but I feel that we are well on the way to developing an alternative arrangement which will fix the problem. Of course, that problem will not exist in a few years, once we join the rest of the developed world in testing vehicles regularly on the road. If they do not comply, they will need to be fixed or they will simply be off the road. So this arrangement, which I hope will be announced by the government very shortly, is relatively short term in nature. It is the responsible thing to do, and I do not believe we need a Senate inquiry to find a solution.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,16,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2000-04-13,"—I rise briefly to say that we oppose the motion. We are a government that is strongly committed to reducing air pollution. It is interesting that surveys indicate that to Australians air quality in the major cities is still the number one environment issue. I will not take the time of the Senate today to remind honourable senators of the whole range of initiatives we have taken to improve air quality in this country, but those initiatives exist and they are being implemented. One of them concerned the importation of second-hand engines. We have, nevertheless, listened to representations of the industry in terms of where they have made a case that the engines being imported can in fact contribute to a better environmental outcome by replacing current engines that are more polluting. We have listened to those representations constructively and are looking for a resolution that can be of benefit to their industryin other words, a win in terms of economic outcomes but in particular a win in terms of environmental outcomes. Because we are close to achieving that objective, we really do not see that a further Senate inquiry is going to help us in that task. For that reason, we oppose the reference. ",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-13,"—In closing the debate, isn't it amazing that we have the Democrats, who are keen for public scrutiny of various measures that this government implements to go to committees to be examined, who participate in the process, as is their right, now saying, `Oh yes, but this is a measure we are involved in. We're negotiating behind closed doors. We don't want anyone to know what is going on. We don't want anyone to have a chance to put on the record what their view is of the matter, so we don't want an inquiry. We don't want our dealings to be exposed.' I guess that is something that the Democrats will have to live with in terms of their approach to suggestions that there ought be public scrutiny on various matters, because they are being quite selective in this matter, and selective to protect their own hides. Let us be frank: a regulation has been laid down which, if not withdrawn or disallowed, will have a very detrimental effect on a great number of people, and it will not achieve, it is argued, the environmental intentions which Senator Allison just addressed. It will not achieve them. 
What have we got going on? We have got the minister, Senator Hill, and the Deputy Prime Minister having a fight about whether in fact the regulation the subject of this motion ought remain and not be changed, that there not be any agreement to change it, that the government continue to pursue it. We do not know what the Democrat position is on that. We do not know what is going to go on in cabinet at the end of the day in the battle between Senator Hill and Mr Anderson. One has to take account of the form: Mr Anderson has not got a very good track record in cabinet. He was rolled on one of the National Party's key industry interests, on the wool industry. We cannot be confident what is going to happen. All we know is that there is another deal taking place behind closed doors and the Democrats do not want anyone to know just how wrong they and the government got this issue. And the government certainly do not want us to know just how wrong they got this issue. But there is one thing for certain: there are a lot of people out there who wanted their opportunity to get on the record and say why this was a bad idea. The government and the Democrats have come together to deny them that opportunity, and they will wear the odium of that.
Question put:
That the motion (Senator O'Brien's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Committees,16,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-13,"—I move:
That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 June 2000:
The provisions of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No. 9), made under the Customs Act 1901 and tabled in the Senate on 15 February 2000.
The opposition has moved that this matter—that is, the provision of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999 (No.9), made under the Customs Act 1901 and tabled in the Senate on 15 February 2000—be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 7 February 2000.
A reference of this nature to a committee is to give this issue a proper hearing and some analysis. I was told this morning that, apparently, there is some deal, being contemplated at least, again, between the government and the Democrats on this issue. So, if the government and the Democrats join together again to block this reference—if they are at it again—they will be repeating what happened when they negotiated the Measures for a Better Environment package, as they termed it. Remember that this is the basis of the regulation which is the subject of this motion.
Measures for a Better Environment was negotiated in haste and in private and was part of the negotiation to get the GST deal done. And here we are apparently confronting another exercise to fix that problem—because there is no doubt that the deal that was done in this area caused more problems than it resolved—and there has been no consultation or involvement with anyone. It is of fundamental importance to the opposition that the people and businesses affected by this regulation or any change to the measures contained in this regulation have the opportunity to be consulted about its implications. This regulation implements one part of the Measures for a Better Environment agreed between the government and the Democrats, as I said, to secure the Democrats' support for the GST.  
The regulation in question inserts a new 4C into the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 1999. This will subject the importation of any used diesel engines, designed for use in road vehicles, to the permission of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services or an authorised officer. Approval is required for each individual engine. The minister or the minister's delegate may only grant permission for the import if the engine complies with the Australian design rules. The applicable design rules are 30/00, Diesel Engine Exhaust Smoke Emissions, and 70/00, Exhaust Emission Control for Diesel Engine Vehicles. The importer in those cases would be required to have each engine undergo a full certification test, as specified in the current emission ADRs and the test report provided to the Department of Transport and Regional Services for approval to import the engine. This would have to occur prior to the arrival of the engines in Australia and would add between $2,000 and $15,000 to the cost of each engine, depending on its size. 
The Department of Transport and Regional Services have prepared and issued a `Regulation Impact Statement' which is quite critical of the regulation change. That statement confirms the industry concern that the cost of undertaking an emission test would result in limited or no used diesel engines being imported. That statement advises that it is not possible to determine the proportion of health costs attributable to imported second-hand diesel engines but says that it is likely to be small given that they account for less than one per cent of the diesel motor vehicle fleet. The department's statement also advised that the total cost of this impact has not been quantified and that although there would be some benefits in terms of reduced emissions these could not be estimated without extensive research. 
What about the businesses that import the engines? I am advised that this measure will force the closure of 90 per cent of the 85 businesses that import engines, and many of these businesses are in regional areas. Within 18 months existing supplies of engines and spares will be exhausted. That means that, in a short time, only new spare parts will be available to farmers and other users, dramatically increasing the cost of repairs. The cost of repairing trucks will also increase dramatically as those spare parts are imported in tandem with second-hand engines. This will increase costs in the agriculture, transport, marine, building, earthmoving excavation, engine reconditioning, auto recycling and the pump and generator equipment sectors. There will be a significant reduction of competition in the diesel engine sector and the price pressure on the manufacturers of new engines will all but disappear. 
Increased costs mean reduced maintenance and increased environmental problems. In terms of the policy development to help regional Australia, this is far from the government's finest hour—and you do not have to take my word for this: you can rely on one of the architects of this measure, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr John Anderson. In an astonishing statement on his own law making, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services confessed baldly to the negative environmental impact of the regulation. He said in an interview on the 7.30 Report on 23 March:
I have to say that we are now in receipt of more accurate information which suggests that the environmental benefits that they—
by `they' he means the Democrats—
were concerned about are not as evident as they thought. They may, in fact, be negative and I can confirm to you that I'm looking again at this ...
And Senator Allison replied:
Well, it was Mr Anderson, in discussions with Meg Lees, who agreed to this restriction. So it isn't something that the Federal Government should be now saying they want to walk away from, I would have thought.
Confirmation: they did the deal in secret and then they set about passing the buck to one another. Yes, it can get confusing. The Democrats and the government signed off on this regulation as a `Measure for a Better Environment'. But, frankly, it is hard to tell who did the research and who conceived this measure. It can certainly be ascertained now that it was not anyone with an understanding of its impact. 
Now we have talk of another deal. Senator Allison said to me this morning, `We don't want you to proceed with this resolution because we think we've got an agreement, but we don't want to release it now; we are going to release it in about a week.' There have been various reports over the past couple of days which have reported different versions of the new deal. We do not know what it is. Apparently, it is so secret or so shaky that no-one can confidently say exactly what it will be or when it will be released. We do not know whether the government will in fact be withdrawing the regulation, the subject of this proposed inquiry. The government can stand up here today and indicate to the Senate whether they will be withdrawing it, and that may be helpful in the debate. The Democrats can stand up in the debate and tell the Senate and the public just what is contemplated in this new deal and accept responsibility—or at least their part of it—for what appears to be a very poor arrangement, as I said, made in secret as part of the GST deal.
Maybe at the end of the day they will be able to come up with something which stands up to the test of public scrutiny and on which we can be convinced that they might well have it right this time. But at this stage this side of the chamber is not convinced that this matter is proceeding properly, that the government and the Democrats have got it right or that they are likely to get it right. We need to have a proper look at this matter and it is important that this motion be carried so that this matter can be examined by the committee and so that those people with an interest in it, not just the government and the Democrats, can put their view in public on the Hansard and the matter can be considered by this committee. 
May I say that this committee has been one of the most cooperative in the sense that many of its findings have been bipartisan. The committee has looked at the facts of the matters and has come to conclusions based on those facts, not on the basis of backroom deals. If the government and the Democrats have any confidence that the measures that are now on the table can stand the test of scrutiny, they will support this proposed reference. Of course, their comments will probably indicate that they do not want that scrutiny, that they do not want this matter examined in the light of day and that they do not want on the record matters which might contaminate the arrangements that they have made in private. All I can say is that the opposition commends this motion to the Senate and that, if the Democrats and the government are fair dinkum, they will support it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Referral</title>,Committees,16,2

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-04-13,"—As I was saying yesterday, this government is being exposed day after day for its broken promises. Senator Kemp, I am pleased that you have come to join the debate today. I always welcome it.
—Senator Conroy, address the chair, please, and ignore interjections.
—It is very pleasing that the government minister responsible for these bills has finally turned up. He will hopefully have something to contribute—more than the look of pain on his face that was shown on national television recently. Some people think it was pain over the result of the match, Senator, but I know you had just been chatting about the GST and the fact that you knew there was a Benalla by-election coming. I invite the government ministers opposite to come with me on Tuesday to the street walk in Benalla and to debate the GST with me.
—Senator McGauran is here.
—Senator McGauran, a National Party senator, is present. He is welcome to come and join me on the street walk. Senator Sherry, I think the National Party in Benalla need Senator McGauran. In fact, he should consider getting on his white horse and nominating to try to help out the National Party in the state of Victoria. They need a quality candidate like Senator McGauran to go in there and try to fly their flag for them.
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President. Senator Conroy has now been speaking for three minutes on what has nothing to do with these bills. I ask you to invite Senator Conroy to address the matter before the chair.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I totally support Senator Kemp's intervention. Senator Conroy is sounding like Senator Kemp at question time—totally irrelevant. You should bring Senator Conroy to order and set some standards in this place.
 (Senator Murphy)—I will certainly take on board the comments of Senator Kemp and Senator Robert Ray. Senator Conroy, I am sure you will come back to the matter at hand.
—Thank you for that helpful suggestion, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I was saying, we have seen this government renege on each and every promise it has made. The key promise, which I talked about yesterday, was that the government said there would be no more amendments. The Treasurer said there would be no more amendments. Senator Kemp is on the record as saying that there would be no more amendments. Yet here are more amendments, more dirty deals with the Democrats. They are not content with getting the fix on diesel fuel. Apparently, all of Victoria is now regional—except Geelong. Every marginal Liberal seat has been added to the diesel fuel rebate zone because the Democrats are so intent on trying to protect this government that they are becoming an embarrassment to themselves—an absolute embarrassment—over the diesel fuel conurbations.
—Senator Kemp personally drew the maps, didn't he?
—I am not sure whether Senator Kemp drew the maps. I hope he is not going to claim responsibility for that, although the tax office did tell us that this was a matter being handled by Senator Kemp. I am trying to work out how Geelong missed out. Why not just give the whole country the diesel fuel rebate? This is a disgrace. It is anticompetitive; it has left companies in Geelong at a competitive disadvantage. We have already had trucking companies in Geelong say they expect to lose business and will have to move their operations out of Geelong into the conurbation zone. This is a disgrace, designed purely and simply to protect this failing government which keeps breaking promise after promise. It has reached a stage where Mr Peter Switzer wrote an article earlier this week in the Australian called `Tax criticisms missing in action'. This government promised compliance costs would be minimal, yet the costs are building and building. Mr Ray Regan, the President of the National Tax and Accountants Association, said that:
The price cuts promised under the GST will not happen. The falling dollar would wipe out the benefits of the GST.
We are already seeing Australia's alleged savings from the GST-ANTS package being chewed up by interest rate increases. We are now seeing the dollar respond because this government will not be honest. Mr Regan hit the nail on the head when he said:
The dollar's fall will also put upward pressure on interest rates which will wipe out the tax cuts to 8 million taxpayers from 1 July.
That is the truth that the government want to hide. They want to continue to pretend that there will be tax savings and cost savings on hotels, cars and transport. 
Transport is at the nub of this debate about broken promises. The President of the National Association of Road Freight Operators has written to the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, warning that operators are struggling to survive, let alone dropping prices. The association president, Doug McMillan, accused the government of raising unrealistic expectations of price falls when diesel prices have jumped 25 per cent in the last year. So we have the trucking industry making it absolutely clear that we have another broken promise coming—just like in this legislation. The Democrats will do more and more dirty deals, like the casino cave-in to help that struggling small business the Packer family.
—I have a speech on the Victorian casino. I am just ready now.
—Excellent. I welcome Senator Woodley to the debate because he knows the dirty deal that was done here. He was in on the fix. He has been in on the fix on the casino, he has been in on the fix on diesel fuel and he is now trying to make up ground on the dirty deal he did a while back on charities.
—Can you go back to casinos, please?
—Senator Murray, welcome to the chamber.
—Senator Conroy, you should direct your remarks through the chair.
—I apologise, Mr Acting Deputy President. We have seen Allan Fels do another interview—that is, the mysterious Allan Fels who has plenty of time to hold press conferences and to harass small businesses but cannot find the time to come before the parliamentary Senate estimates committees to be scrutinised over his conduct. We know what will happen. The Democrats will be in the committee with the government trying to protect him.
—When he is in the building!
—Thank you for reminding me, Senator Sherry. This is the same Allan Fels who declined to come to the Senate estimates because he had other commitments and then turned up in the building on the day, in parliament, and talked to the minister. He will not come and face the scrutiny of parliament but we know, when he does turn up— 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the issue of relevance to the bills before us. We are again ranging far and wide over every first thought which comes into Senator Conroy's mind. It is well known that we say on our side of the chamber that Senator Conroy does not know what he thinks until he hears what he says. It is appropriate that he come back to the matters before the chair.
—Senator Kemp, I am not sure that you have a point of order. If you are raising a point of order on relevance, I am quite sure that Senator Conroy heard it and will continue to address his remarks to the bills before the chair.
—For my remaining two minutes I am going to continue to make the point about broken promises, because this government promised there would be no more amendments. This government promised that we would not be here today debating more amendments, but it has done another dirty deal with the Democrats. This is what these bills are about: they are about another sell-out by the Democrats, another fig leaf for Senator Woodley and Senator Murray. At the end of the day, the Australian public will hold the Democrats accountable for these fig leaves and these pretences. We have got the emperors with new clothes: the Democrats are running around pretending that the emperors have got their clothes on. That is what this debate is about: exposing the Democrats and the government for another dirty deal. They are spending more money wantonly to protect their political position. There is no price too great to pay in terms of throwing money into the problem areas of the GST. There is nothing this government is not prepared to do. There is no amount of propaganda it is not prepared to spend taxpayers' money on to try and hide what it is doing. There is no deal it will not do with the Democrats to get them to agree to no scrutiny and to not getting Fels to appear in front of a committee so that we can try and get to the truth of what this GST is going to do to the Australian community. I will be looking forward to Senator Woodley's and Senator Murray's contributions, as I always do, because I know they are going to have to stand up here and protect the government, as they have been doing over and over again.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-04-13,"—Senator Woodley has concluded his speech in second reading debate but wishes to move a second reading amendment. Therefore, I would like to move that second reading amendment on his behalf and I am formally putting it before the Senate.
 (Senator Murphy)—Because we have an amendment currently before the chair, you can foreshadow the movement of that particular motion at this point in time.
—Thank you for your advice. I foreshadow Senator Woodley's amendment No. 1785.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,17,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2000-04-13,"—I think we have run the course of the second reading debate, unless anyone else wishes to take up the time of the Senate. As usual on these bills, we have had a very wide range of contributions by senators. Very few of those comments seem to have touched particularly on the matters which are directly before the chamber, and the last speech perhaps showed just how much unnecessary time has been taken up on these bills. There may well be some debate later this afternoon on the time allowed for the bills. I would point out to the Labor Party that a great deal of time has already been taken up on the bills, and a great deal of time has been wasted already. When we proceed to making sure that these bills are through this Senate, Labor should not run the argument that they have not had time to debate the bills. They have wasted, as they so often do in this chamber, so much time.
—Order! Senator Conroy and Senator Sherry.
—Senator Conroy, as usual, is overexcited—
—It would be useful if you ignored the interjections.
—I am trying to give my speech, but it would be useful, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you could take some action against Senator Conroy.
—I certainly will do so.
—He is now constantly and wilfully refusing to obey the instructions of the chair, so I call that to your attention.
—I am watching him carefully.
—The bills do a number of things, and let me just sum them up. They will allow a fringe benefits tax exemption for all meals, other than meal entertainment, provided on a work day to primary production employees in remote areas.
—That is a roll-back.
—It will introduce another FBT gross-up formula to ensure tax neutrality between fringe benefits and cash salary following the introduction of the goods and services tax system, a system which is now supported by the Labor Party, although again, from the speeches we have heard today, that would not be clear. When Senator Conroy goes to Benalla next Tuesday, there may well be some people out there asking why the Labor Party supports the GST, Senator Conroy, and we do not want you doing a Daryl Melham. We do not want a touch of the Daryl Melhams from you, Senator Conroy. We want you to be rather specific on what the Labor Party GST policy is. Another aspect of the bills is to extend the FBT exemption for remote area housing for all employees.
—That is another roll-back.
—They are important bills. They are bills which have been widely debated in the community. There has been a wide range of groups which are particularly interested in these bills. It is no secret that the government has been having discussions with parties in this chamber to make sure that we can secure the passage of these bills promptly and efficiently. 
—You are doing that by rolling back your policy.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know I am very slow to be provoked. I am a man that likes to just play it straight and have a straight bat, but I was somewhat drawn out by Senator Sherry's intervention on a roll-back. Senator Sherry, if you read that policy that you went to the election on, your policy was a direct copy of our policy on FBT. I make that point and invite Senator Sherry to look to his own history on this matter. We will not be supporting the second reading amendment before the chamber. I will not detain the chamber any longer. I am sure that we will have a good but, hopefully, limited debate in the committee stage of these bills.
Question put:

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-13,"—Again, we have amendments which deal with the responsibilities of Senator Macdonald, and Senator Macdonald is not here. It is worth having a look at what has taken place which leads us to this position. For example, the Senate Procedure Committee second report of 1999 and the Rural and Regional Affairs Legislation Committee supplementary estimates report of June 1999 both detail the extreme difficulty the opposition had in getting the minister to answer questions. Senator Macdonald has consistently refused to answer questions in the estimates hearing or even to appear now, when the additional appropriation bill in his own portfolio areas is proposed to be amended.
In the estimates hearing, he refused to answer questions on the GST and how it affected local government, his area of responsibility, on health and how it affected regional Australia and on the issue of fuel. In yet another aspect of the government's position on fuel, he was happy to answer a dorothy dix question in this chamber yesterday. But, when he is given a chance to answer opposition questions in the estimates forum, which is where he should be prepared to answer questions, he ducks. He refuses to answer questions. What about telecommunications? He has had a number of dorothy dix questions in this chamber where he has had a prepared answer and is prepared to read that answer into the Hansard. But is he prepared to answer questions during the estimates process? No. There was the question of the Prime Minister's recent commitment to regional Australia. One would have thought that Senator Macdonald would have been across that. It is his portfolio area.
—He doesn't know what day of the week it is.
—I do not know whether he is tuned in to his diary, but the reality is that when questions are asked of him in the estimates committee, he wants to play games. He wants to ignore and avoid his responsibility and he wants to hold up the proceedings of the estimates committee. Senator Macdonald complains about the time taken for estimates hearings. If he bothered to brief himself and answer the questions, or admit that he cannot answer them and get his officials to answer them, or properly take them on notice and come back and then not complain about the fact that there is a lot of material on notice which requires the actions of his department—costs that are attributable only to him because he will not answer questions—we might get a bit more done. We might get these things done and in fact have had this bill passed well before today. The delay in this bill has been down to the intransigence of Senator Macdonald and his unwillingness to come into this chamber and to answer serious questions about his own portfolio responsibility. What does he do? When he is not answering dorothy dix questions in this chamber, he is prepared to pump out a steady stream of press releases on all of the topics that I enumerated, and more. But when he is asked to answer the hard questions he goes missing.
The question has to be asked: what is this minister responsible for? He certainly is not responsible for doing the things that many other ministers do. Senator Hill has been used in the debate as an example of a minister demonstrating the sort of behaviour that is required of ministers of the crown in the estimates committees process of this parliament. I would expect that Senator Hill will quietly take this minister—Senator Macdonald—aside, sit him down, stand him up, lie him down, give him a Bex or whatever is required, and tell him what his responsibilities are. Perhaps Senator Macdonald could sit through some tapes of estimates committees Senator Hill has been involved to show him just what is required. Unless and until that happens, we are going to be faced with repeats of what is happening in this chamber now. We are going to be wasting the time of estimates committees trying to get answers to reasonable questions in a timely fashion. If the minister is up to his job, then he will do that in the future. 
If we really want to take into account what has gone on and the sort of opprobrium that attaches to the behaviour of this minister, I will take the Senate to the contribution Senator Mackay made on 6 April in the committee stage of this bill. I will quote from that contribution to put on the record again exactly why we are in this situation and just what sort of support Minister Macdonald has for the position he is taking. In the estimates the opposition sought advice of the Clerk as to just what was going on and Senator Mackay said this: 
The Clerk made the situation extremely clear, and I will quote from his advice in relation to Senator Macdonald's refusal on a whim—or probably because he did not know the answers—to answer questions. The Clerk said inter alia that there are no grounds on which a minister can refuse to answer questions except `where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest'. The minister has to declare that. He has to say, `This is not in the public interest, therefore I cannot answer it.' But did Senator Macdonald do that? No. He just said, `I don't feel like answering the questions.' He also stopped his department answering the questions. I want to make it very clear here that the opposition are not dissatisfied in the main with the performance of this department. We regard this department as substantially underresourced. We regard the budget cuts that have taken place since this government came into power as contributing to the difficulties the department is experiencing. So, in the main, we have no difficulty with the department when we actually get an opportunity to ask questions of the officials at the table—that is, before Senator Macdonald tries to cut them off. 
Later on Senator Mackay said: 
We got a substantial amount of advice from the Clerk in relation to this. It was all bundled up in a minority report in relation to supplementary estimates and went off to the Procedures Committee. What did the Procedures Committee say? I will quote from the second report of the Procedures Committee of 1999. The report was signed, might I say, by every senator on the Procedures Committee, not simply opposition senators. The Procedures Committee vindicated utterly the actions of the opposition and vindicated utterly the advice we received from the Clerk—complete and absolute vindication.  
Senator Mackay then said: 
I quote from the Procedures Committee report in relation to the non-response. It reads: 
It is for Ministers to determine whether they wish to raise any grounds for not responding fully to particular questions, and whether those questions will be pressed is a matter for a Committee to decide in the first instance—
of course, this relates to the previous advice that we got from the Clerk, which went to the public interest—
and ultimately for the Senate. 
Senator Mackay went on to indicate that the reason that the opposition was raising these matters in the chamber was substantially following the decision of the Procedure Committee `because we could not get answers from the estimates committee process'. 
The opposition is not about denying the passage of this legislation. The opposition takes the position that supply should not be held up. We have sought to make a contribution in this debate to outline that there is a responsibility on ministers of the government to answer questions properly put to them unless they have public interest grounds for not doing so. When there is the sort of behaviour that we experience from Senator Macdonald then the opposition will again take the opportunity to raise those matters in the chamber. 
As I said earlier, we hope that Senator Hill will sit Senator Macdonald down, remind him of his responsibilities and show him just how it is done. At the end of the day we might be able to spend a little less time on the estimates process arguing about whether we get answers and actually deal with the substance of what estimates are about, and that is the asking of questions and the receiving of answers which are relevant to the activities of government and the spending of government. That is what the opposition has been seeking to do in this area. We have been frustrated at every turn by this minister, quite improperly as demonstrated by the Procedure Committee report. In winding up, on behalf of Senator Mackay I withdraw the opposition requests.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-04-13,"—The opposition supports this motion, which provides an opportunity for the government to have its legislative program considered during general business this afternoon, which would normally be time allocated to the opposition. I feel it is important that these issues be considered, and that will allow matters to be debated. There will be an opportunity at 6 p.m. tonight for Senator Brownhill to make a presentation to the chamber and then we will return to government documents. There will be no divisions or quorums after 6 p.m., as are the provisions of the normal standing orders. We trust that the government can manage its program a little better than it has to date.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-04-13,"—There are a number of matters which need to be corrected which have been put forward by the opposition in relation to Senator Macdonald. One of them is that he only answers questions from the government. The reason for that is very simple: he never gets any from the opposition. When was the last time Senator Macdonald got a question from the opposition in question time on his portfolio? We have the shadow spokesperson in relation to his area in the Senate, but we still do not get questions to Senator Macdonald on his area of responsibility. The reason for that is evident: regional affairs is going very well and Senator Macdonald is doing a very good job getting out into regional Australia and visiting those people in regional Australia who need to see him as the minister responsible. The other day he mentioned the Rural Transaction Centres that he is overseeing. These are very important initiatives for people in the bush. That is what you want from a minister—a minister who gets out and sees people, who deals with the real issues that Australians want dealt with. If there is any question about Senator Macdonald not getting any questions, let us see some questions from the opposition during question time. Let us see the spokesperson concerned, Senator Mackay, ask those questions. 
Can I also say, in relation to this particular matter, that this is an appropriation bill which is dealt with by the Minister for Finance and Administration, whom I represent in the Senate. It is therefore my responsibility to take these bills through the Senate—no-one else's. It is not incumbent on any other minister to appear in relation to this bill. For the opposition to say so is not correct. This bill is my responsibility. That is why I have carriage of it. Senator Macdonald has been only too willing to assist in relation to any queries that people might have, and departmental officials have been available to answer questions. 
In fact, I might raise on that point that in the debate last week Senator Ludwig asked about the proposed appropriation item relating to the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal. I am advised that the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal—the new name of the Australian Rural Partnership Foundation—is a newly formed foundation. The government has contributed $10.6 million in new funds this year to kick-start this foundation, which was founded with a $2 million contribution from the Sidney Myer Foundation. The foundation provides the opportunity now for the private sector to contribute to the development of regional Australia. 
During the same debate Senator O'Brien asked why there is no legislative base for the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. I am advised the government does not believe a legislative basis for the scheme is necessary to achieve certainty of assistance. The recommendations of the TFES Review Authority in June 1998 included a commitment to a five-year funding term with an annual rolling review to determine whether assistance will continue five years beyond that date. The government has implemented the scheme recommended by the review authority which is increasing funding to $56.4 million from the previous amount of $41.8 million. The government's implementation of the modified scheme following the report by the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme Review Authority is regarded, particularly by users of the scheme, as a major step towards removing any perceived uncertainty surrounding the continued availability of assistance under the scheme. I remind the Senate that the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme was an initiative of a coalition government, as indeed was the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme, both of which have received bipartisan support.
I answered the other questions asked by honourable senators during the debate last week but I needed to add these two points which were still outstanding. I thank Senator Macdonald's department for assisting in those answers. I acknowledge the opposition's withdrawal of this request, and I thank them for that. I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 1999-2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,20,1
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-13,"—I will speak very briefly as it is not our intention to hold up these matters, but I am provoked to make a comment in relation to the matter of Senator Macdonald's question time performance. Why would the opposition pursue questions without notice to Senator Macdonald when, given ample opportunity to answer questions in estimates, he declines? Why would we? If Senator Macdonald wants to play the game of saying, `Well, I don't get any questions,' he had better reflect on the fact that when he does have the opportunity to answer questions he does not answer them. We have enough trouble with other members of the frontbench not answering questions: perhaps that is why question time becomes as rowdy as it does from time to time. We had the serial offender Senator Kemp in here earlier being reminded of that by Senator Ray. But let us not digress. We believe that the complaints that we make about the performance of Senator Macdonald are well founded, and we really do think that he ought to have a good hard look at himself and think about his performance for the future.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-04-13,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), to a question without notice asked by Senator Watson today, relating to the Australian economy. 
A dorothy dixer to the minister talking about the IMF's views of the economy attracted comments about the state of the Australian dollar, for example, which stands below US60c to the Australian dollar. One is reminded that in 1991 Mr Howard—I think he was the Leader of the Opposition at that time—complained about the Australian dollar being at US70c. That was an indication, he said, of the depths the economy had sunk to.
Of course, the opposition does not believe that necessarily the position of the currency is an indication of the strength of the economy. The fact is that the government inherited, and admitted that it inherited, a basically sound economy in 1996. The minister did not deal with the debt truck. One assumed that he was waiting for some sort of diesel fuel assistance so they could get the truck moving again, because it has been going backwards at 100 miles an hour. What the minister did say was that there was a dark cloud hanging over the economy, in one of his pathetic attempts at humour into which he often delves when he is trying to deflect from the question. 
Isn't it amazing that he cannot even give a straight answer to a dorothy dix question from his own side but he has to then degenerate into asking questions of the opposition rather than answering the question? Doesn't that remind you very much of his appearance on the 7.30 Report some months ago where there was that very same problem: he could not answer a question. I have the transcript here and I thought I would draw it to the attention of the Senate again because obviously a lot of people have forgotten it. The presenter, Kerry O'Brien, asked him some questions about casinos. He said:
Okay, now I've heard you say that.
And Rod Kemp said yes. Kerry O'Brien said:
But it's too hard for you to answer this question.
Rod Kemp said no. Kerry O'Brien said:
In simple yes or no terms, does this amendment that you have introduced save the casinos money or not?
Rod Kemp:
Well, I've answered it, Kerry, and I'm pointing out to you that the revenue estimates that we have made from the legislation are not changed as a result of this amendment which gives effect—
And Kerry O'Brien comes in:
But why have you written the amendment? I mean, does the amendment have no effect?
And Rod Kemp says:
No, but the amendment gives effect, Kerry, to the policy that we went to the election on and there was a drafting error.
And Kerry O'Brien says:
I'm sorry, Senator Kemp, but I've got to insist.
Rod Kemp:
Well, you can ask me.
Kerry O'Brien:
You've not answered the question.
Rod Kemp:
Well, I think I have, Kerry.
And Kerry O'Brien says:
I'll try again. 
Rod Kemp:
In that I'll provide you with, if you give me the same question I'll give you the same answer.
And Kerry O'Brien finishes that point by saying:
Well, I would think that most of our viewers would agree with me you haven't answered it.
It is not amazing that he did not answer that. He does not answer opposition questions. We saw that today in question time. He diverts from the point of the question. It seems that that is contagious. Members of the front bench, of the government, now have a touch of the Rod Kemps, because they are not answering questions, either. We had the unedifying spectacle of Senator Newman not even understanding a question, and not being able to answer it. Minister Kemp cannot even answer a dorothy dixer—presumably that he gave to Senator Watson to ask him—about the IMF's views on the Australian economy. He degenerates to asking questions across the chamber.  
There is indeed a dark cloud hanging over the economy, and it is this government. This government, as represented in this chamber in the area of economics by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, is demonstrating not only that it cannot answer questions but that it has a great problem with the rise in interest rates, with the fall in the Australian dollar, with the falls on the stock exchange. In the period where we could be looking at some great growth in the Australian economy which the spending on the Olympics should have generated, what are we seeing? We are seeing problems emerging for home owners with rising interest rates, we have great problems with our foreign debt and a lot of our rural commodities are in strife. This government has done very little. It inherited what was, it admitted, a basically sound economy and what has it done? It took credit for interest rate falls but now, when interest rates are going up, this government says, `That is not our fault; that is the economy.' It just won't wash. ",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice,28,1
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2000-04-13,"—I cannot believe that Senator O'Brien would raise the question of interest rates. Where on earth was Senator O'Brien in the early 1990s when the Labor Party deliberately allowed interest rates on housing to get up to over 17 per cent? He was certainly not in this place. He certainly would not be in here defending any movement on interest rates. This government has been able to manage the economy for the past four years in a way this country has never seen since the early 1980s, when the Labor Party came to power. 
It is very interesting that Senator O'Brien should choose to take note of Senator Watson's question to Senator Kemp. I can only assume one thing, and that is that Senator Lundy and Senator O'Brien and all the senators on that side are very happy with all of the answers they got to their own questions. That is the only assumption you can draw from that. Senator O'Brien chooses to take note of a question that was asked by Senator Watson because they have received adequate answers to all of the questions that they put today. So that is why they chose that one. 
Senator O'Brien, the last thing you want to do is to start quoting from transcripts of radio or television interviews. If you want to read a gem, read the transcript of Daryl Melham's interview with Laurie Oakes—read it over and over again. At the end of the day you still will not be able to understand what Labor Party policy is—not until you have had a chance to sit down and think about it. We will sit down for a while, we will contact all the stakeholders, we will come up with a policy. Just read the transcript of Daryl Melham's interview with Laurie Oakes and make sure you use that as a basis for all of your future interviews. I can promise you that the people on this side of the chamber will not allow you to forget that you are in a policy free zone. Daryl Melham in his interview with Laurie Oakes only confirmed all of that. 
Senator O'Brien, what you did not say and what you will never admit is that the GST is now part of your policy. The GST is now the only policy that the Labor Party has. Senator Conroy was talking on Australia's public views of the tax reform package. He uses words like this:
If they had a chance, as was unfolded last year during the Senate GST inquiry, they would have seen the balance of payments problem going to be caused and currently being caused by wantonly throwing money into the economy just as they are through these tax cuts.
Senator Conroy, you must still oppose these tax cuts. Senator Conroy is back. He refuses to guarantee the tax cuts to the Australian people which we promised prior to the last election and which they voted for. Senator Conroy said, on 10 April: 
The government champions the tax cuts but what does Mr Macfarlane say about the inflationary impact of the ANTS package? Nothing. 
So does that mean, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Senator Conroy believes that, because the Governor of the Reserve Bank has said nothing about it, it is inflationary? Senator Conroy has a lot to learn when it comes to this package. All we want to hear from Senator Conroy is that the Labor Party is going to maintain the GST as part of its tax policy. The other thing we want to hear Senator Conroy and Senator O'Brien and Senator Lundy say is that they will deliver on the tax cuts. But they will not say it. The roll-back of the taxation package has been promised, but never have they said where it is going to be rolled back, and never have they said how they are going to pay for it. They will not guarantee the tax cuts that we promised to the Australian people prior to the election campaign. The one thing you can believe about this government is that they will deliver those tax cuts on 1 July to the Australian people.  
So I welcome Senator Conroy's comments. I know he is going to get up and say that yes, he now supports the GST, that he does believe that Australians should have tax cuts and that the whole ANTS package and the reform of the taxation system is good for the Australian economy. It must be good because he does not want to see it changed, and neither does Senator O'Brien.

"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-04-13,"—I am grateful for that contribution from the other side from Senator Ferguson. At least Senator Ferguson has had the guts to put his money where his mouth is on this occasion. Senator Ferguson knows that he has a $10 bet with me that the Labor Party is going to lose the Benalla by-election. We need a mere eight per cent swing on top of the eight per cent swing we got in October last year. At least he has the courage to put his money where his mouth is. 
If Senator Kemp, a senator from Victoria and the Assistant Treasurer of this country, is so confident, when invited by me all this week and all day today through question time to take the opportunity to come and sell the virtues of the GST and his tax package—not to have a glossy propaganda exercise on late night and early TV but to come and actually front up to discuss the state of the economy, to come and convince the ordinary punters in Benalla that they are better off at the moment and that they will be better off under this tax package—why won't he come to Benalla? It is only a two-hour drive from Melbourne. Next Tuesday I will be there doing a street walk. The whole town will come if they know Senator Kemp is coming; I am prepared to concede that Senator Kemp is a bigger attraction than me. I am prepared to say they will all come for the laugh: they will only have to come along and see Senator Kemp discussing the state of this economy. Come and tell them in Benalla how much better off they are—just like in Rippon, just like in Gisborne, just like all over regional Victoria when they threw the Kennett government out at the last state election. All you have to do is turn up in Benalla, Senator Ferguson. Bring Senator Kemp, bring Senator Macdonald—regional services—because what they will be told is that this economy is nowhere near as grand as you lot are making it out to be. 
Today we have Stephen Koukoulas saying in the Financial Review:
The indicators suggest a hard landing.
That is the truth of what is going on in this country at the moment. He sets out the economic growth scorecard in today's Financial Review. Retail trade momentum is weaker; motor vehicle sales are flat; housing finance is weaker; building approvals are strong at the moment but, after the GST, he says, they will collapse; building investment is weaker; equipment investment is weaker; government demand—that is, government spending, the amount of money you are just throwing around in an attempt to cover up—is stronger, he says, and there is no argument there; ANZ job ads are weaker; employment is peaking; consumer sentiment is slumping to a five-year low; exports are strong because the dollar has gone down, and the dollar will keep going down while this government pretends the economy is in good shape. And that is what the debate is about today. Senator Kemp can stand up in this chamber and take a dorothy dixer from one of his own government senators, but he will not come out on the streets of Benalla. That is the test; that is the truth test. The Liberals in Benalla are so scared they will not even field a candidate. 
—The Nats are going to win it.
—You are absolutely right, Senator Ferguson, the Nats are going to win it. Senator McGauran's old campaign director, is he, Senator Ferguson? There is a brave call. But the truth test will be to come to Benalla, Senator Kemp. Come and tell those punters in Benalla they are better off under this government, that the GST will not cripple them, that the tax cuts will fix all their problems—that is if there are any left after interest rates go up again next month. 
That is where this government continues to push its line. As Mr Koukoulas says, it is being driven by nothing more than government spending. You have caved in on the charities; you have caved in on the contractors; you are giving up revenue everywhere; you are shovelling money out into the economy as fast as you can to try and prop up the economy. You know what is happening here. Despite your claims of how rosy it is—and despite the World Bank producing reports supplied to them by the Australian Treasury telling everybody how rosy it is—you will not front ordinary Australians, you will not come to Benalla, you will not try to get their feedback and listen to the hardships you are putting them through because you will get the same response that Jeff Kennett did last year in Victoria from regional and rural Australia. That is the reality that is happening in country Victoria. In Benalla, you have the chance—notwithstanding your courage to at least put your money where your mouth is.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-04-13,"—Goodness me, if any Liberals go to Benalla, one thing they certainly will not be hearing from Senator Conroy or any of his colleagues is anything about the new tax package or Labor's plans to roll back the $12 billion in tax cuts which have been offered to the Australian people. That is one thing that Labor does not want to talk about. Labor has lost itself completely on what to do about the tax package. 
Let us have a look at some of the comments that have been made in the press about where Labor stand on the tax package. On 21 February the Australian said:
Kim Beazley's refusal to rule out higher income taxes under Labor's plan to roll back the GST triggered fresh demands yesterday for full details of the ALP's taxation policy.
Of course, that is a pretty hard thing for Kim Beazley to do because they really do not have any tax policy. They know that somehow or other they have to say a few things, but none of them add up. The one thing they have not done is exclude the possibility of not going through with the $12 billion worth of tax cuts which will put so much more money into average Australian households.
On 21 February 2000, in the Courier-Mail again Kim Beazley was targeted. The Courier-Mail had this to say:
Despite his rhetoric, Labor leader Kim Beazley knows the GST is beneficial for Australia's economy—hence his unwillingness to dump it. Instead, Mr Beazley has signalled he will roll back the GST ... a Beazley Labor government will have to raise income taxes, cut federal services and/or create a federal deficit to meet such commitments.
That is something the Labor Party do not like talking about. They never provide the details. Beazley says, `We will roll back the GST,' as though the GST is something evil. The GST will be very beneficial to all sorts of average families in this country because they will be paying a lot less for consumer goods and they will be getting the benefit of the $12 billion in tax cuts which this package includes.
	The Labor people in Benalla next weekend will not be talking about Labor raising income taxes, they will not be talking about cuts in federal services and they will not be talking about the need to have a return to the enormous deficits which characterised the Hawke-Keating governments. 
Channel Nine's Today presenter Tracy Grimshaw said to the opposition leader Kim Beazley on 23 February this year:
All right. Let's get to the GST. You hate it, but you won't scrap it. You say the health care rebate is a monumental failure, but you'll keep it. You look like you don't know what to do.
Of course the message in both those instances is that, although the Labor Party say they do not like the policies—the GST, the health care rebate—they are going to keep both of them because they know that they are both beneficial to the Australian economy. Again, anyone listening to what the Labor politicians say in the streets of Benalla this weekend will not hear anything about the details of their plans to roll back the GST or end the rebate on health insurance, because they know that both of these policies are needed. They know that the GST is needed because Australia had a situation where the direct taxation system was failing. It was known by the Labor Party that we had to go to an indirect system. The Labor Party are so terribly sad that the Liberal coalition government has introduced something they knew had to happen. They also knew that there had to be a shift in the balance back to private health insurance to overcome the problems created by the unholy mess that Medicare has created in terms of overcrowded public hospitals.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2000-04-13,"—There is one very important point to be made here this afternoon, that is, despite having been given a free kick by the opposition—by taking note of a dorothy dixer presented to a government minister—the government has been unable to take advantage of the opportunity to talk on the question of substance that was put to Senator Kemp: can the minister inform the Senate on the state of the Australian economy—the good news about the economy? Over the last 25 minutes we have heard three members of the coalition stand up and talk about what they think about Labor.
—Three? Who was the other one?
—Well, two so far. The issue here is that it is not about good news, because there is no good news. We have not heard any good news. We have not heard anything of substance from the coalition representatives in this last period of taking note of the good news that Senator Kemp attempted to put forward. What we have heard is a desperate attempt by a desperate government to make out that the GST is somehow getting broad support.
Government senators interjecting— 
—That is a lie. Labor does not support the GST. We participated very strongly in demonstrating to the Australian public the faults of the GST and why it is not good news for the Australian public and why it is not good news for Australian consumers or Australian citizens. The fact is that the closing remark of Senator Kemp is the one thing of substance, that is, the dark clouds hanging over the Australian economy—and there are many. The GST will bring on a period of time here when we know inflation—tenuous as it is now—will rise. No-one believes the good news story that Peter Costello and others attempt to put out about where our economy is going. No-one believes that the inflationary impact is going to be a one-off and that it will be offset. No-one believes that. Circumstances around the world indicate that the inflationary effects of the GST do more than just medium-term damage; they actually do structural damage to industry in the economy. Why? Because people get scared. People get scared that prices are going to rise. We know through the evidence we gathered from the committee that prices will rise. We know that for some industries this will be devastating, because people buy up before a GST is put in place. 
I want to cite one example from 1995-96 in Japan. As the Japanese government upped their GST by two per cent—from three per cent to five per cent—to try to boost their revenues to deal with their budget situation, the consequent and corresponding rise in domestic consumption leading up to the point of implementation of that GST increase of a mere two per cent led to a chronic slump in domestic consumption post the increase of their GST. It was a chronic slump so severe that it did have structural implications for the Japanese economy, and it has certainly been recognised as a contributing factor to the subsequent Japanese recession. These are the concerns that the government is refusing to acknowledge even exist.
I would like to make one other point, which goes to the heart of Australia's future. If anyone has taken note of the figures in relation to electronic commerce and the way that Australians are looking to purchase commodities, be it in the business to business area or the business to consumer area, they will know there is a significant trend upwards in the use of electronic commerce to purchase commodities and services. This trend upwards has significant implications. I know that Senator Alston knows all about it, because he stands up in this chamber and says, `Isn't it great! Electronic commerce is going up.' Well, I say that the GST is about the worst thing you can do to a country that is looking to promote growth of electronic commerce. Why? Because they have not told us how they are going to collect it. They have not told us the implications of purchasing from overseas sources that do not have a GST applied to them.  
The government have not explained why and how they will actually protect the producers of digital content and services in this country trying to sell to the domestic market from the impact of people sourcing those digital products and services overseas without a GST. What is going to happen to those producers of digital content and services selling in the domestic market who are required by law to put 10 per cent on topareas that have previously been untaxed but will be pitted against the rest of the world which can import that material without any GST at all? These are the sorts of specific questions we need answered. Until they are answered—and I do not believe they can be answered adequately—there is a dark cloud over the Australian economy.

Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Questions Without Notice,28,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-04-13,"—The Jurisdiction of Courts Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 addresses a particularly difficult issue facing our federal system. One of the primary purposes of the bill is to overcome difficulties arising from a recent High Court decision which has invalidated cooperative cross-vesting schemes between the states, the territories and the Commonwealth. Specifically with respect to a number of areas, including the Corporations Law and other important areas of commerce, the state and federal governments introduced similar laws based on a national code to facilitate national regulation of important areas, particularly commerce and areas such as sport. As part of those codes there were enforcement mechanisms. These mechanisms have been directed through the Federal Court system; the reasoning being that the federal courts have the ability to develop national expertise and consistency across all jurisdictions. However in the re Wakim case, the High Court held that, under chapter III of our Constitution, federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction conferred by state legislatures.
This bill attempts to overcome some of the worst aspects of the Wakim case by facilitating a situation where actions taken by Commonwealth officers in the administration of the schemes are recast as federal actions even though they are taken pursuant to state law. This will mean that, even though the function is a function undertaken under state legislation, because the person undertaking that action is an officer of the Commonwealth, it will be subject to federal and judicial review. It sounds like a difficult way through this particular problem, but it is a problem that has now confronted the states and the Commonwealth for a little while and it is a problem that really needs to be addressed as a matter of seriousness. 
Increasingly in this age of globalisation, we see that state boundaries have become increasingly burdensome and, in fact, increasingly irrelevant when it comes to trade and commerce. As a consequence, what we have in this country is a national market with international imperatives, and those old boundaries based on state jurisdictions are really not recognised by our corporate and commercial system. In that context, I think the conclusion of the court in re Wakim was regrettable, particularly as we are striving to keep pace with such international and global developments. In fact, it is fair to say that one of the reasons for Australia's economic success has been our stable and efficient legal system. In particular, as a result of that legal system, Australia has been an attractive base for much commercial activity. There is therefore a risk that, unless we properly address these matters and the difficulties arising out of the High Court case of re Wakim, Australia will be diminished in the eyes of many corporations as a desirable base for their activities. 
To further demonstrate the inconveniences arising from the case, it is appropriate to draw the attention of all senators to some of those areas that have been affected. Firstly, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was established in 1976 to review decisions taken by Commonwealth ministers, agencies and officials. It has the power to review both the merits and the legality of the decisions. It has operated so effectively that some states have legislated to adopt the provisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act as state law. This meant that the tribunal has been able to review decisions taken by state public officers and those decisions have been appealable to the Federal Court. Because of the Wakim case—a case which held that states could not confer jurisdiction on Commonwealth judicial bodies—those cooperative schemes that have been implemented will now have to be amended. 
There is also the area in respect of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. That act is an important piece of legislation, facilitating the review of administrative decisions in a more formal context than the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. At present, cooperative schemes between the federal and state governments can prescribe that the AD(JR) Act applies to decisions of the Commonwealth officers as a matter of state law. These schemes will also now have to be amended in light of re Wakim. 
I mentioned sports earlier. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is a Commonwealth statutory authority which primarily focuses on the conduct of comprehensive drug testing in competitive sport. It is worth putting on the record that this agency will have an extremely important function in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympics. At present, section 9A of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act consents to a state or territory conferring jurisdiction on certain entities, including the Federal Court. These provisions also must be amended as a result of the High Court case.
I think the most important and significant impact of re Wakim is in the area of Corporations Law. The Corporations Law is a uniform national law which deals with companies, takeovers, securities and futures. Each state has passed a law which in turn adopts the federal Corporations Law. It was not all that long ago that the former Labor government introduced such legislation and, at that stage, we got cooperation from the then opposition. The intention of each of the acts is to create a cooperative scheme designed to achieve a uniform national corporations legislation scheme despite the limitations on the Commonwealth's constitutional power in this area. One would have thought that that was a desirable outcome some 12 years ago, but it is now even more desirable given market trends in that intervening period. As part of the scheme the state acts apply Commonwealth law as state law and confer, in addition to the Federal Court, jurisdiction on their own state courts with respect to both civil matters and matters arising from the Corporations Law. 
The problems arising with respect to Corporations Law are particularly complex because state supreme courts are prevented from hearing ADJR applications. Accordingly, this bill will again recast actions by Commonwealth officers as matters of federal law but, at the same time, it will be specifically necessary to confer jurisdiction on the state or territory courts to hear ADJR proceedings. It should be noted that the much wider range of non-ADJR legal proceedings which were possible under the Corporations Law of a state can no longer be cross-vested in the federal courts. 
Since the decision of Wakim we have seen a significant reduction in Federal Court cases. As I said earlier, this is regrettable. It is particularly regrettable as the Federal Court had developed considerable expertise in respect of that important area of Corporations Law. Indeed, in handing down a landmark report on the federal civil justice system—the ALRC Report No. 89—earlier this year, the Australian Law Reform Commission noted:
Australia's legal system plays a crucial role in the nation's economy, with law and legal services a key export and effective dispute resolution a potential selling point.
The independence, integrity and quality of the Federal Justice System gives Australia a competitive advantage in the Asia Pacific region and beyond, so we should be pushing this message to the international business community.
In particular, the ALRC report singled out the Federal Court for praise as providing high quality service for litigants and playing a pivotal role in relation to various sectors of economic activity. Unfortunately, that leading role is now jeopardised and will now be taken away from the Federal Court in respect of many areas under the Corporations Law. As I said, there is a whole range of areas. Another one is in respect of the natural gas pipeline. Since early in the 1990s, both the former Labor government and the present government have attempted to promote competition in the natural gas industry. As a result of an intergovernmental agreement, third parties have been allowed to negotiate access to natural gas transmission pipelines and distribution networks under a broad regulatory framework that applies across the nation. Clearly, this is desirable, given the increasing importance of natural gas and the fact that it is transported across state boundaries. 
The Jurisdictions of Courts (Cross-Vesting) Act 1987 is a general scheme by which proceedings have been transferred between federal, state and territory courts, and it has some relevance to the way that the natural gas system has been operating. The scheme has been tremendously successful in avoiding costly and inefficient duplication in several jurisdictions. What we do have though, with the advent of the Wakim case, is elements of the scheme involving conferral of state jurisdiction now in jeopardy and, as a consequence, we have this bill containing provisions for state courts to hear matters which have been treated as special federal matters and have been dealt with in the past by the federal courts.
The NCA is also affected by the decision, as is the Trade Practices Act and competition policy reform acts passed by the Commonwealth, states and territories in the mid-1990s to create a uniform national competition code. The competition provisions contained in part IV of the Trade Practices Act were applied by that code throughout Australia because state and territory laws applied the Commonwealth legislation as if it were a law of their own state or Territory. The Competition Policy Reform Act 1995 also created as a regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, arising from the merger of the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority. The ACCC is now responsible for the enforcement of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act. In order to preserve and maintain national standards, all state and territory governments have agreed, through their competition codes, to confer exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under those codes on the Federal Court. Again, unfortunately, as a result of the High Court case those state codes, in conferring power on the Federal Court, are in conflict with the findings of the High Court.
It should also be noted that a similar cooperative scheme of the Commonwealth, state and territory legislatures will create a national price exploitation code to monitor prices and take legal action in relation to price exploitation under the GST. Once again, we have provisions within this act to ensure that such schemes can be sustainable. The list goes on—the implications of this High Court case cover the field from the National Crime Authority to prices surveillance to competition and to corporations. The Workplace Relations Act is another act which is affected by this legislation. It is noted that this bill deletes subsection 5(7) of the Workplace Relations Act, which arose from a cooperative arrangement between the NSW, Queensland and federal governments in respect of enforcement of awards and instruments in the coalmining industry in the context of the situation where the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had been exercising jurisdiction as a result of cooperative legislation of both the state and federal governments. That has to be the longest sentence I have actually read out in this place, Senator Carr. 
—Yes.
—Similarly, subsection 5(9) gave the Federal Court of Australia authority to deal with unfair dismissal matters in circumstances where a state had adopted the laws as laws of the state. While it is conceded that it has been necessary to repeal those sections in light of the Wakim case, we as an opposition are not satisfied that there are appropriate measures which could be taken to repair the vacuum. We have reserved our right to further consider these provisions. With that as our guiding force and in the time that we have, we will be moving amendments in this place to try to fill the vacuum that has been left because of the government's provisions.
In summary, the significance of these cooperative cross-vesting arrangements to our economic prosperity cannot be underestimated. The question then becomes whether the approach in the legislation will be adequate. While we will be supporting the legislation as an attempt to resolve some of the immediate difficulties created by the Wakim case, we believe that this legislation is a long way from being a complete or perfect proposal. 
We see two very large clouds on the horizon in respect of this legislation. Firstly, the High Court, in May or June this year, will hear a challenge to state legislation which has effectively adopted and validated those decisions of the Federal Court which have been invalidated as a result of the Wakim case. If those federal decisions cannot be validated by state legislation, then the consequences are quite horrendous. It goes without saying that it would be a disgusting waste of resources for those cases to have to be rerun, but that is a consequence which we cannot be oblivious to.
The other cloud on the horizon is the High Court case of Hughes and the Queen, which was heard by the High Court on 20 October 1999. That case involves, among other things, a challenge to the validity of section 45 of the Corporations Act, a section which states, in effect, that offences against the various state laws that mirror the Commonwealth's Corporations Act and constitute the Corporations Law as a national code are taken to be `offences against the Commonwealth'. Related questions in the proceedings are whether the Commonwealth law has been imported by the states and whether Commonwealth officers are empowered to prosecute corporate offences in the states. It is not our role to prejudge the outcome of that particular case. It is sufficient to note, however, that, if the challenge is upheld, then it will have enormous consequences for the operations of the Corporations Law and also potentially for the other cooperative regimes I mentioned earlier, particularly in the circumstance where Commonwealth officers are not empowered to prosecute offences under state legislation. Indeed, the scheme of the current bill in many instances is based on an assumption that such action by officers of the Commonwealth is valid.
Aside from these two pending problems building up on the horizon, we should not be under any illusion that this bill will solve the cross-vesting problems. In particular, while the action of officers of the Commonwealth has been recast as action under federal law for the purposes of judicial review, there will still be many instances where Commonwealth officers are not, or indeed cannot be, involved in all aspects of these cooperative schemes. One example is in relation to the gas pipelines access legislation where, for instance, South Australian legislation still gives a significant role to South Australian public servants.
It is fair to say that the implications of this legislation are broad ranging and quite pervasive. It is probably also fair to say that no-one in this parliament has had sufficient time to really investigate each of the state acts of the schemes involved, but it is quite fair to anticipate that, with respect to many pieces of state legislation, circumstances that I have mentioned in relation to specific legislation will also have to be confronted. In those circumstances we will have unsatisfactory situations where action by officers of the Commonwealth will be the subject of federal judicial review but action taken under the same schemes by state officers or state public servants will not be. Australian citizens affected by decisions of these and relevant instrumentalities will be compelled to seek state remedies as well. So we have got a problem of potential inconsistency and potential duplication. These are problems which, as I said earlier, can be quite complex. The overall dilemma is one that will face potential litigants, and that is whether to commence proceedings both in the state jurisdiction and also under the federal ADJR Act, or to take other courses. 
Another problem that needs to be mentioned is in relation to the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. I note that item 28 of the bill seeks to confer power to review decisions of that agency on judges or officers of the Federal Court of Australia acting in their personal capacity. There has got to be a substantial question mark as to whether that is a valid provision. It raises questions as to whether a judge of the Federal Court, albeit one acting in a personal capacity, would nonetheless be fulfilling a judicial function and, if they are, whether their involvement in the adjudication of matters under state law would offend the principles of the Wakim case. 
I could go on because, as I said earlier, there are quite a number of wide-ranging implications in this legislation and it is legislation that does require urgent and comprehensive treatment. I will not do so at this stage, however. To the extent that other matters need to be raised, I will raise them during the committee stage. There are quite a number of amendments that the opposition will be moving in the committee stage. I will explain those amendments as we go to them sequentially. But I repeat that this is one case where the High Court has in a sense had its collective head in the sand, not recognising the necessity for a national scheme here which needs to have consistency, needs to have a degree of efficiency and needs to recognise that when it comes to Corporations Law the old state borders are somewhat irrelevant these days. It also needs to recognise that maybe powers such as the incidental power in the Constitution could be deployed to overcome some of the problems that the High Court has left us. 
We all await with trepidation the Hughes case. In that context it was interesting to see last week that only two states are not prepared to refer powers at this stage to the Commonwealth. The states are South Australia and Western Australia. Coming from South Australia, I find this quite a bizarre decision by the South Australian government and the South Australian Attorney-General. Any state corporate sector that is left out of a national scheme is going to suffer because of being left out. I would have thought it would have been in the interests of South Australia, the South Australian economy and the South Australian business community for the South Australian government to have ditched its ideological fixations and to have embraced the concept of referring further powers to the Commonwealth to overcome such a problem. To the extent that a state's jurisdiction is not so conferred and not consistent with the rest of the Commonwealth, corporations operating in that state will be at a disadvantage. I say to both the Western Australian and South Australian Attorneys that they should rethink their position. I look forward to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>JURISDICTION OF COURTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2000-04-13,"—This bill, while entitled the Jurisdiction of Courts Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, really does fall short of the mark in terms of actually establishing additional jurisdictions for courts in Australia. As a hallmark of our federal democracy, the Constitution establishes a strict separation of powers. In simple terms, the separation of powers makes sure that those who make the laws, or at least the statutory version, do not have the responsibility of implementing or interpreting them. As far back as 1748, well before the arrival of European law in this land, Montesquieu had the following to say on the separation of powers: 
There is no liberty if the judiciary power be not separated from the legislative and the executive. Were it joined with the legislative, the life and liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary control; for the judge would be then the legislator. Were it joined to the executive power, the judge might behave with violence and oppression. There would be an end to everything were the same man or the same body, whether of nobles or of the people, to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing the public resolutions, and of trying the causes of individuals.
More recently, and certainly in a more contemporary sense, in 1981 former High Court Justice and former Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen said:
But within its own modest limits judicial independence conduces to the free society and it is within those limits that I confine myself tonight. If judicial independence is in itself far from a complete protection against absolutism in government it is nevertheless a sure touchstone of freedom under the law; where it exists absolutism has not yet established itself, and where it is absent absolutism is likely to have free rein.
The rule of law, another democratic tenet, requires that competent courts be the ultimate forum in which law and its effects are played out. From the outset, let me say that almost without exception the men and women who administer the judicial power of the Commonwealth and of the states are among the finest holders of judicial office in the world. There is a tendency to forget in this place, I think, that parliamentarians are not the only bastions of democracy. Equally, and at times more importantly, we depend for the preservation of our democratic system of government on the existence of the judicial arm of government.
It is important that we never forget these principles. However unlikely it may be in Australia, as a member of the global family Australian society is neither immune nor exempt from the strains that have occurred in countries with fewer democratic freedoms than we enjoy here. Having said that, and notwithstanding the importance of the judiciary and the common law in this country, the great bulk of law and the jurisdiction of the courts come from the statutes that we make and amend in this place. The Family Court is constituted by the Family Law Act 1975. The Federal Court is constituted under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, and the Federal Magistrates Service is constituted under a more recent act, one with which I am more familiar.
I have taken some time today to canvass these issues because, ultimately, they lead into the main topic I wish to address on this bill—that is, the absence of a comprehensive human rights jurisdiction in Australia. Only a week or two ago, the Australian public was subjected to what might best be described as a childish response from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, when he stated that the Australian government was conducting a review into this nation's participation in the United Nations committee system. The capacity of governments to review their participation in international fora, rightly or wrongly—although my colleague Senator Vicki Bourne would argue `wrongly'—resides within the prerogative of the executive government. Human rights, however, are not the purview of any government. 
It was by no means a coincidence that Mr Downer's comments came literally days after the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was critical of Australia's record, particularly on indigenous issues. UN committees do not usually point the finger if there is nothing to point the finger at. Indigenous people have good cause to be alarmed, hurt or disappointed about recent events and statements. But they are not the only group in the community whose capacity to seek redress and recompense for injustice goes unheard and uncared for. A particular hotbed of discontent and frustration will always be the absence of a place for people to have their grievances respected and addressed. Enter the UN committees. Most Australians will be unaware that the United Nations human rights committees—and there are a few—are neither the first port of call nor an easy place to lodge a complaint. Take, for example, part 2, article 11(3) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which states: 
The committee shall deal with a matter referred to it in accordance with paragraph 2 of this article after it has ascertained that all available domestic remedies have been invoked and exhausted in the case—
I emphasise the point here about them having to be `invoked and exhausted'—
in conformity with the generally recognised principles of international law. This shall not be the rule where the application of the remedies is unreasonably prolonged.
This fact was conveniently omitted from Mr Downer's critical comments against the UN committee system. The point is that you can go to the United Nations only when and if you have exhausted all remedies here in Australia. The fact of the matter is that UN committees are the last port of call, not the first. We have the foreign minister, ably assisted by the minister for reconciliation, arguing that the last port for human rights complaints is not appropriate or is, at the very least, embarrassing. The simple fact of the matter is that there would be no recourse to the UN if Australia had done the right thing—as it is required to do under its treaties—and placed our own house in order in this regard.
This, of course, is the chief deficiency in the bill presently before the Senate. None of those pressing issues are presently contained in this bill, despite the urgency of these matters. There appears to be no great will within the ranks of much of the government to address them. It is stated that the primary purpose of this bill is as a response to the High Court's recent invalidation of cross-vesting schemes in the Wakim case, and it contains a series of measures which: firstly, repeal provisions which contemplate the conferral of state jurisdiction on federal courts, now known or assumed to be invalid; secondly, restore the availability of federal administrative law proceedings for decisions taken by Commonwealth officials under state law as part of cooperative legislative schemes; thirdly, provide, in relation to the Corporations Law and certain other cooperative schemes, for the vesting of jurisdiction in, and the transfer of proceedings between, state, territory and federal courts within constitutional limits; fourthly, provide generally for the cross-vesting of certain proceedings involving decisions by Commonwealth officials under state law; and, finally, preserve the Federal Court's exclusive jurisdiction in relation to proceedings under the competition codes and price exploitation codes of the territories, but not under the state codes.
The first question to be asked, then, is: given the seriousness of the destructive effect of Wakim's case on cross-vesting and cooperative legislative schemes, is the bill an adequate Commonwealth response? Large issues remain, for the moment, unaddressed. A related question is whether the bill tackles all of the cooperative schemes imperilled by the Wakim case. For example, do the national codes in areas such as agriculture, veterinary chemicals and civil aviation carriers' liability also require attention? I note, however, some acknowledgment of this from the government in the form of their amendments before us. The Democrats support these. Clearly, however, the technical issues involved are highly complex, cross a number of areas of public policy and, most importantly, entail intergovernmental negotiations, which can be notoriously difficult. It is also questionable whether federal legal aid should be denied in certain review proceedings under the NCA Act now that they have been recast as matters of federal law. It seems unlikely that legal aid would be available at the state level if the provisions in this bill become law. I would appreciate government clarification on this point.
A separate purpose of the bill is to restrict the ability to challenge pre-trial decisions taken by Commonwealth officials in the criminal justice process and to do so retrospectively. Let me state from the outset that the Australian Democrats always view retrospective application, particularly as it applies to criminal jurisdictions, as wrong. That is to say, our starting position for these matters is to ensure that people who are apprised of the law should be subject to the law as the law stands. But, so as not to give Senator Vanstone a free kick on this issue of retrospectivity, let me put on the record firmly that, in terms of addressing crimes against humanity, a matter which I and the Australian Democrats look favourably upon, we take a different view. I note that in the public debate that has occurred to date on my anti-genocide bill, Senator Vanstone has ruled out government support for any retrospective application of that bill. It is interesting to note, therefore, that the government does not always necessarily take the view that all crimes and all legal matters should not have a retrospective application. 
This bill is a clear example of where the government sees the need for retrospectivity. It is an area which primarily relates to white-collar crime in the big end of town. I sincerely hope that the government's mind is not closed on this point. I would be incredulous to learn that—and I daresay it would be immoral if—the Australian government is of the view that only white-collar criminals ought to be treated with retrospectivity and therefore are more important, in terms of applying retrospectivity, than those people who perpetuate genocide and crimes against humanity. I signal the importance of these issues here because, when we come to debate human rights provisions down the track, or my anti-genocide bill, some clarity from the government on this matter will, I think, be warranted. The ultimate question is whether this government sees economics or people as being more important. I suspect that answer will be evident in the coming months as the government deals with its present difficulties with human rights jurisdictions.
This is not one of those instances where the Australian Democrats see retrospectivity as being appropriate. For the record, the Australian Democrats have considered the amendments of the opposition and consider them to be worthy of merit. I indicate now, however, that the Democrats will be supporting the opposition amendments, as circulated, that have previously been moved in the House of Representatives and again here today in the Senate. I also indicate that, if the amendments are not acceptable and do not gain the support of the Senate, the Australian Democrats would be very unlikely to support the passage of this bill through the Senate.",SENATE,<title>JURISDICTION OF COURTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-04-13,"—Sir Daryl Dawson was appointed to the High Court from Victoria. There has been only one Victorian judge appointed to the High Court since then—Justice Hayne, a very eminent jurist who does Victoria proud. Sir Daryl Dawson, as he now is, was also a very eminent judge from the Victorian bar. He was Solicitor-General in Victoria for a long while. He filled that position with distinction and he filled his position on the High Court with distinction, although very often he was in the minority, as people would know. He did some great work in Victoria, as Senator Conroy would know, in an inquiry arising out of the fire at Longford.
Why should I be talking about Sir Daryl Dawson? He was always a man who showed great responsibility. He retired quite recently and, because he was retiring, said he ought not to sit on a case called Gould and Brown—he would not be there to deliver the judgment. Because he was so responsible, there were only six judges to make that decision. That court, in Gould and Brown, dealt with a matter that is being dealt with in this legislation—that is, the jurisdiction of the states to give state jurisdiction to the federal courts. As a result of that, the judges on the court—there being only six—split three for and three against. The case was won in the sense that whatever the Chief Justice said held in those circumstances, and so the case of Gould and Brown was decided in favour of the states being able to confer state jurisdictions on federal courts. The problem was, as the case was decided three all and was carried by the Chief Justice's vote, the decision did not set any precedent that would bind later judges. The issue arose rapidly afterwards in the case we all know as re Wakim. In the meantime, a couple of judges had retired, including the Chief Justice and Justice Toohey. You might think that two out of seven does not make a difference, but in this case it made a very big difference. As a result, we have the Jurisdiction of Courts Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 before us today. 
I am very pleased to see Sir Daryl Dawson enjoying his retirement. He has contributed greatly to the law. I like a lot of what he said about the professions, how they should be devoted to service and not let market forces get the better of them—I have quoted a particular speech of his in that area in the past. If he had been on the High Court for re Wakim, who knows what would have happened? In any event, he was not. We had two new justices, including Justice Hayne from Victoria, so the decision in re Wakim was made and here we all are. It has caused great difficulty—and that is a matter that has been talked about—in the area of the Corporations Law. I do not want to say much about the Corporations Law because I am going to leave that to Senator Conroy who is more learned than I am in that area.  
Actually, I will say something about re Wakim and the Corporations Law because it has taken up to about 30 per cent of the work that used to be done by the Federal Court away from it. That is a disappointment, too, because that is a court with very many eminent people on it and is particularly well led by Justice Michael Black who, I think everybody here would agree, is one of the great judges in the history of the judiciary in this country. That would not be taking things too far. As a matter of fact, his brilliance has gone into the next generation. His son was a Rhodes scholar and is now a theologian—from the law to the Lord. That is good to see. Perhaps I am wandering a little from the point. It is very disturbing, and I use that word advisedly, that the Federal Court does not have the jurisdiction that it used to in this area. The point has already been made that this does make a lot of trouble for the way corporations are carrying out their business. Corporations, of course, are the main underpinning of our economic life and if you have not got a law which can look after that in a fairly quick and proper fashion, then all sorts of problems arise. But, as I said, I will leave that area to Senator Conroy.
It impacts not only in the corporate world but also in the area of family law. That, in a way, is a more serious problem because the Family Court and family law deal with matters of the heart, of the emotion and of the soul. A lot of stress, a lot of worry and a lot of woe is exhibited in the Family Court. To fracture the jurisdiction of that court in the way that this decision does is a pity. I would like to say something about the decision.
—It was a shocker.
—Senator Conroy says it was a shocker and he will tell you why. On the other hand, we have got a Constitution and it is for the judges on the High Court to interpret that Constitution. They have got to call the law as they see it and then leave it up to the parliament to fix it up or, if the parliament cannot fix it up, for the people to do it through changes to the Constitution. That may be the best way of dealing with this matter. I do not know what the cost would be to run a referendum. I think it is about $60 million to $70 million, which seems a lot of money. On the other hand, given the amount of money that is at stake here in the area of corporate law, in the area of family law and in other areas as well, that would seem fairly cheap. I am sure that all parties would be responsible in this area and would see the Constitution altered so as to fix the present problem. 
I do not think it would be a tremendous task. It would probably involve making some changes to chapter 3 to enable state jurisdiction to go into the Federal Court. If federal jurisdiction can be given to state courts, why shouldn't the Federal Court be able to take up state jurisdiction? I am sure if the founding fathers—unfortunately there were no founding mothers, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, but I am sure if you were there at the time you would have been one of the founding mothers—had thought about this, they would have accommodated the problem, because it is a problem. Here we are, 100 years next year later, trying to sort the matter out. The decision made by Justice Brennan and Justice Toohey, and supported by Kirby J, was certainly a sensible one, whether or not it was in accordance with the Constitution. It has now been decided in favour of the answer that, no, it was not. In any event, as far as the practicalities of it go, things were much easier when the workings of the courts were as they were before re Wakim. 
With the way family law, whether state or federal, is run at the moment, it is all a bit difficult. As it is now, you can have a judge sitting there and deciding the issue, say, of a child of a de facto couple and making orders as to access. It is not access now. Is it custody? What do we have? 
—It is parenting arrangements or orders, I think.
—My mind does not keep up with things as well as it should. It used to be called custody and access. The court is deciding those sorts of issues, then an issue of property arises and the court has to stop deciding the issue and send the matter back to a state court to decide a separate but related matter. If the Constitution were properly arranged, another area which could be dealt with so as to save a lot of problems is protection orders. At the moment, appeals against protection orders made by a Magistrate's Court in Victoria have to go off to the County Court, or in other states to the District Court or whatever it is called in other states. I do not want to say that the other states are not important, but Senator Conroy and I would say that Victoria was the one that stood out. In that jurisdiction, if you wanted to appeal against a protection order, it is to a County Court. Wouldn't it be better if that went off to the Family Court so that the whole idea of having a court that looks at all family matters would be realised?
Another area is adoption. I think the county court deals with that. I remember, years and years ago now, if an adoption order was made, people would go up and the judge would look at it, and people used to say it was the only time the judges were nice, because the adopting families were there. I remember being told of one occasion where someone did not concentrate on the matter as well as he might have. The matter had come before the judges a couple of times before, and the judge actually signed the order and was not quite concentrating on what he was doing. What he did was give in adoption the judge who had looked at the matter the previous week. So the judge rather than the child was adopted to the parents. I am sure that does not happen these days. In any event, I am sure that, if the matter had been taken to the Family Court, there would not be any risk of that sort of thing happening. I think there are some real issues to look at there.
I will go on to another aspect of the bill, and that is the issue of criminal jurisdiction. I see that there are some very eminent advisers on criminal jurisdiction here in the chamber. I wish I had seen them earlier—I would not have rambled so much. Issues such as whether a warrant has been properly issued or whether a subpoena has been properly issued can be actively challenged in the Federal Court in its civil jurisdiction. All that is going to go, from the time that the prosecution starts—I suppose that would be from the time the charge has been made—to when there is a resolution of the matter. The Attorney-General says, and no doubt his advisers have advised him to this effect, that it really does not make a great deal of difference—the matter can be heard by the criminal court hearing the case. I am not sure whether all these issues are going to be gathered up to be argued on the day of the trial or whether they are going to be argued beforehand. If they are going to be argued on the day of the trial, people will bring their points along into court, perhaps even before or after the jury has been empanelled, and they will argue all these points in the context of the case. It can become fairly costly because the person accused has briefed a solicitor and a barrister who prepare themselves for the case and charge high fees. Whereas you might not have had to pay somebody as much to do an interlocutory application on one of the side issues, such as the validity of a summons or a warrant, you have to pay large sums for the trial barrister, although he or she will be arguing what is in effect an interlocutory point. That might make it more expensive. If there are rights, you have to be very careful about how you cut down on them. Anyhow, it will be very interesting to see how all that operates.
This is a bill to which the opposition are suggesting some amendments. As I understand from Senator Conroy, we are as anxious as anybody to get it through and to see if we can get the system operating. Before I sit down, I will just say that another thing that could go to the Family Court is the testator's family maintenance jurisdiction. 
—Yes.
—As Senator Abetz very much understands, how we divide up what we leave when we die is very much a family issue. My children are going to be a bit disappointed with what I leave. 
—I know all about that.
—No, testator's family maintenance happens when you die, Senator Carr, so you do not want to start worrying about that just yet. You do not have to worry about it at all because, once you are dead, what does it matter who gets it? In any event, that is another issue I thought could go to the Family Court. I will sit down and let Senator Conroy get on with his contribution.",SENATE,<title>JURISDICTION OF COURTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2000-04-13,"—As the Jurisdiction of Courts Legislation Amendment Bill 2000 arises from the High Court decision in re Wakim, I feel it is appropriate to add a few words to this debate. The decision in re Wakim has ramifications for the entire Australian legal system. It causes particular problems for the operation of the Corporations Law in Australia. In re Wakim the High Court held that the Australian Constitution does not permit the Commonwealth parliament to legislate to accept the vesting of state judicial power in Federal Courts by operation of state law. This means the Federal Court will not have the power to determine matters arising under the Corporations Law.
To go back 10 years, in 1990 the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory agreed to a cooperative system which created a national Corporations Law. The objective of the national scheme was to ensure that the scheme legislation: operated as a single national law applying throughout Australia; invested in ASIC, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Australian Federal Police responsibility for the regulation, investigation and prosecution of offences under the Corporations Law; and invested jurisdiction in the Federal Court to hear cases in relation to the Corporations Law.
It is this last aspect of the system which the decision in re Wakim most affects. One objective of the national scheme was to have the company laws administered by a national court system in the Federal Court. This has enabled the Federal Court to build up considerable expertise in Corporations Law. The vesting of jurisdiction in the Federal Court was also intended to ensure national consistency in the interpretation of the national scheme of company law. Following the decision in re Wakim, the benefit of the expertise that the Federal Court has built up in Corporations Law matters is substantially lessened, and there is a risk that the national character of the Corporations Law may be compromised by different state court hierarchies applying its provisions inconsistently.
This bill attempts, in part, to deal with the problems raised by the decision in re Wakim. The bill confers federal jurisdiction on federal courts to review the decisions of Commonwealth officers and bodies made in the performance of functions conferred on them by specified state and territory laws. The bill will also enable the Supreme Court of a state or territory to exercise federal judicial review jurisdiction in limited circumstances where related proceedings are before a court of the state or territory. These amendments will address in part the problems caused by the decision in re Wakim but will not remedy all the difficulties which have arisen from that decision. There will still be many non-ADJR matters which will arise in the state arena which cannot be dealt with at a federal level.
The national cooperative scheme has allowed Australia to be promoted as having a stable and well-regulated national corporations scheme. The national cooperative scheme has also contributed to business and investor confidence. A functioning system of corporate regulation is essential to fostering a climate in which people can conduct business with confidence as to its legal efficacy. Since the decision in re Wakim, the High Court has also handed down decision in Byrnes and Hopwood and DPP v. Bond. In those cases, the High Court held that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions did not have the power to appeal against sentences for breaches of the old state company codes. More recently, the High Court has heard arguments in Queen v. Hughes as to the powers of the Commonwealth DPP in the national corporate scheme. Without wanting to anticipate the High Court, the decision in Queen v. Hughes could have wide-ranging implications for corporations law in Australia. In Queen v. Hughes, the High Court is examining the constitutionality of a section in the state corporations acts which treats offences against state law as an offence against a Commonwealth law. If that section is set aside, it will prevent the Commonwealth DPP from prosecuting breaches of state corporations law. There may also be implications for the power of ASIC to investigate breaches of the Corporations Law. Whatever the outcome in Queen v. Hughes, there are fears that it is only a matter of time before the national scheme falls apart. 
My colleague Senator Bolkus has discussed the means by which the problems with all cooperative schemes, including the Corporations Law, can be addressed. I join my colleague in urging urgent action in these matters. The Commonwealth has a leadership role in consultation with the states and territories to achieve a long-term solution to the problems created by the decision in re Wakim and any other decision which imperil a national system of corporate law and regulation. A national scheme of corporate law and regulation is essential to creating an environment attractive to investment and to promoting Australia as a regional financial centre. It is critical to the future economic prosperity of Australia.
I would also like to say a few words on the other national cooperative schemes in the portfolio of Financial Services and Regulation which are affected by the decision in re Wakim. The national competition code effectively granted exclusive jurisdiction to hear matters arising from part IV of the Trade Practices Act to the Federal Court. Part IV of the Trade Practices Act deals with restrictive trade practices. Following the decision in re Wakim, vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the Federal Court is now not possible. The national price exploitation code also creates a cooperative national scheme to monitor prices and take legal action in relation to price exploitation under the GST. The states have repealed or will be repealing those provisions of their codes which purport to confer jurisdiction over matters arising under them on the Federal Court. This bill will also be removing references in the Trade Practices Act which contemplate that state jurisdiction could be conferred on federal courts. The amendments also acknowledge that the Federal Court can no longer exercise exclusive jurisdiction in relation to prosecutions arising out of the competition and price exploitation codes. As I have discussed in relation to the Corporations Law, these solutions are a legal solution but diminish the objectives of a national scheme. 
The ability of the ACCC to police price exploitation in relation to the GST may also need to be considered after the decision in the Hughes case. While the Hughes case concerns the Corporations Law, a similar provision to that in question in the Hughes case exists in the price exploitation code of the states participating in the national scheme. The relevant provision provides that an offence against the new tax system price exploitation code of the state jurisdiction is taken to be an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. If the decision in Hughes holds such a provision to be constitutionally invalid, the ability of the ACCC to police price exploitation in the wake of the GST will be severely curtailed. I will eagerly await the decision in Queen v. Hughes. I am sure the government is also awaiting the decision in Queen v. Hughes. It could make it all too clear that the ACCC is not able to police the GST and that it simply cannot be the protector of consumer interests which the government is promising.
I stand here with my colleagues, and probably most senators, to encourage all states to set aside narrow parochial views and interests. The national interest must come to the fore in this debate. The Labor Party stands ready to work with the government and all other political parties to ensure that the advances that we have made in the last 10 years are maintained and that further strides can be taken to overcome the ramifications of these decisions. I urge a speedy passage of this legislation and promise the opposition's cooperation on future matters in relation to these cases.",SENATE,<title>JURISDICTION OF COURTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2000-04-13,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions in this debate. Can I make a few comments in relation to the contributions made by individual honourable senators. First of all, to Senator Bolkus: I am sure I did not hear in his remarks even a hint of criticism of the High Court decision! I am sure that was just in my imagination, and I will let that pass. We will undoubtedly engage further in relation to the specific proposals of the opposition, and I will deal with them in some general comments afterwards. 
Moving on to Senator Greig, I would invite him: please do not tempt me on the UN committees. I will bite my tongue at this stage and we will move on. In relation to Senator Cooney's contribution, can I thank him for his discourse on judges, both present and former. We did miss out on the Family Court judges. He did not go through those, but I am sure he would have interesting stories to tell about them. 
In relation to the Federal Court jurisdiction, I remind Senator Cooney that the costs in the Federal Court, I would imagine, are higher than they are in state criminal courts in the various jurisdictions around the Commonwealth. Basically what he was talking about—the way the criminal trial would be conducted—is exactly the way it happens every single day of the week in every single jurisdiction around Australia for the vast majority of criminal cases that are brought under state law. Can I simply suggest that the costs will increase as of necessity when two jurisdictions are involved. Counsel with experience in Federal Court jurisdiction may have to be engaged as well as a barrister or counsel with criminal court experience. However, the main cost is in the level of representation. Most of the defendants exploiting the Federal Court jurisdiction would engage counsel at the highest level, where ultimately avoiding a prison term or getting out of the proceedings is their main goal. 
I also mention two other matters that Senator Greig raised. He suggested that there would be retrospective application in the criminal jurisdiction. That is wrong. Schedule 2 is not retrospective. We would assert that the amendments have effect from the date of its commencement on proceedings which are on foot at that time and on proceedings begun after its commencement. The fact that some proceedings affected by the bill may have commenced before the bill came into effect does not make the bill retrospective. 
In relation to the comments on the NCA and legal aid, amendments of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 made by items 70 and 71 of the bill do not remove an existing entitlement to Commonwealth legal aid. They preserve the status quo in relation to Commonwealth assistance. The Commonwealth NCA Act provides for witnesses giving evidence under that act to seek review in the Federal Court of decisions of the NCA. The bill applies this element of the Commonwealth act to witnesses giving evidence under state NCA acts. This is done because the state acts cannot confer jurisdiction on the Federal Court following re Wakim.
The Commonwealth NCA act also provides for witnesses giving evidence under the Commonwealth act to seek legal and financial assistance. The state NCA acts do not provide for such assistance. In making technical changes to preserve existing Federal Court jurisdiction, the bill will not create new rights to Commonwealth assistance to cover witnesses under the state acts. The intergovernmental committee of the NCA has established a working party, including Commonwealth and state representatives, to coordinate reforms of the legislative framework. The Commonwealth will put this issue on the working party's agenda so that it may consider any concerns regarding assistance for witnesses under state legislation. The working party is the appropriate body to pursue this issue. 
Can I make some general comments. I think all sides of the chamber have acknowledged that this legislation is necessary. Some problems have arisen as a result of the High Court's decision in reWakim and Bond and we need to address them. That is what the bill seeks to do—to overcome some of these problems. It is important to ensure that the Federal Court remains the principal forum for review of Commonwealth offices and authorities performing functions under the cooperative schemes affected by the bill. It is important to ensure that the Commonwealth DPP is able to play the role that was envisaged under cooperative schemes and that the criminal justice process is given every chance to operate fairly and effectively. White collar criminals with deep pockets should not be allowed to take advantage of opportunities to exploit the legal system in ways which reduce the fairness of that system.  
I should point out that at a recent conference on the reforms of criminal trial procedure the Hon. Justice Mark Weinberg, a judge of the Federal Court, recommended strongly that legislatures act to impose meaningful restrictions on the process of collateral review of investigative functions. The bill implements essential remedial action required to address the real difficulties resulting from re Wakim and Bond. It was introduced only after extensive consultation with the states and territories and we expect that they will in due course introduce their own complementary legislation. It is, therefore, essential that the bill is passed quickly to minimise as far as possible the disruption resulting from these decisions. 
Can I conclude by giving an example of an actual case and the delays that were occasioned as a result of the sorts of activities that we believe do not assist the criminal justice system in this country and in no way make it a fairer system. Allow me to detail this case. Following an investigation by the Australian Federal Police and a state police force, the defendant and others were charged with drug offences relating to the supply of cannabis. The evidence depended on conversations which were recorded under a telephone interception warrant and a listening device warrant. The preliminary hearing of the charge was listed to begin in November 1995. It was adjourned pending the completion of a Federal Court action for a review under the AD(JR) Act and section 39B of the Judiciary Act in respect of the listening device warrant and for declaratory and injunctive relief in respect of both the telecommunication interception and listening device warrants. In October 1995 a Federal Court judge made orders for limited discovery of the material placed before the judge who issued the warrants. The AFP claimed public interest immunity.
In November 1995, another Federal Court judge ordered transfer of the proceedings to the Western Australian registry of the Federal Court. Various orders were sought and a notice of motion was heard by a third Federal Court judge in Sydney in June 1996. His Honour adjourned the proceedings and stated a case and reserved questions for the Full Federal Court. In November 1996 the preliminary hearing of the substantive case was further adjourned to February 1997 as the case stated in the Full Federal Court had not been decided. The Full Federal Court decided in favour of the AFP in January 1997. Further proceedings were brought relating to the defendant's request that a subpoena be issued for the production by the AFP of the five affidavits in support of the application for the warrants, the material which was the subject of the order of the first Federal Court judge for limited discovery in October 1995. At the beginning of argument on the notice of motion it was ordered by consent that the order of His Honour be vacated. On 13 June 1997 a fourth Federal Court judge ordered that the defendant's subpoena to the AFP be set aside. The defendant appealed to the Full Federal Court against the decision of the fourth judge to set aside the subpoena. The Full Federal Court unanimously dismissed the appeal in April 1998. On my calculations, that is about 2½ years later. Before the substantive prosecution case could be dealt with, one witness died. 
This is a prime example of how resort to the judicial review jurisdiction of the Federal Court can delay a prosecution. The Federal Court proceedings were commenced in Melbourne; transferred to Perth and then to Sydney; there was a case stated in Brisbane; a subpoena before the fourth judge in Sydney, and an appeal in Melbourne. I can say to this Senate that the government remains to be convinced that those sorts of tactics and antics do anything to engender confidence in our criminal justice system and indeed the fairness of the criminal justice system in this country. Basically, what we are saying is that once a court is seized of the actual matter, then it is the court that ought to deal with all the matters that may arise—the procedural matters and the challenges to evidence—as in fact happens in every single state trial that is conducted, which are the vast majority of criminal trials around Australia. That is the way it happens around Australia in every state jurisdiction every day of the week. I cannot in fairness see the arguments of the opposition in wanting to allow a situation to arise where people with deep pockets can frustrate the due criminal process of this country.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-04-13,"—I rise tonight to speak to the report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on entry and search provisions in Commonwealth legislation, which was tabled in the Senate on Thursday of last week. This report represents the most recent efforts of this parliament to define liberal democracy's most pressing and most fundamental friction: the yearning for individualism and the impulse for community, the call for privacy of the person and possession, the demand for effective law enforcement, the prerogatives of the individual and the sovereignty of the state.
As Australians we are fortunate indeed to live as citizens of liberal democracy. The peace, stability and prosperity that system brings to us are unequalled by any other system of government developed in human history. Unfortunately, many in our society have become so accustomed to sharing liberal democracy's great bounty that they take it for granted. The reality, however, is quite precarious—in the famous words, `The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.'
It is in this light that the efforts of the committee for the scrutiny of bills and many others have to be seen to be truly appreciated. It is easy for the cynic to dismiss the hours of meetings, and the reams of paper, of a committee as a waste of time and a waste of resources. The cynic, however, forgets that it is such seemingly mundane efforts that comprise our eternal vigilance and define the democratic enterprise. The experience of the last century is clear. Freedom and civil liberties are frail and thus are in need of constant nurture and constant protection. All too often they have been trampled under the totalitarian boot—in Paul Johnson's words, `The destructive capacity of the individual, however vicious, is small; of the state, however well-intentioned, almost limitless.' The role of a parliamentary committee such as the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills is to ensure that the government, while being vigorous enough to protect the integrity and the interests of its citizens, is also sufficiently shackled by law and democratic oversight so as not to threaten the individual.
When writing its report, the Senate Standing Committee for Scrutiny of Bills was faced with the challenge of reconciling the need for search and entry powers in effective administration of law with the need, on the other hand, to ensure that citizens are protected from arbitrary and unwarranted interference by the state and its agencies. As the reports says in introduction:
At common law, every unauthorised entry onto private property is a trespass. The modern authority to enter and search premises is essentially a creation of statute. As such, it should always be regarded as an exceptional power, not a power granted as a matter of course, and any statutory provisions which authorise search and entry should conform with a set of principles.
In this the committee implicitly followed the principle that the onus lies with the state to establish the case why it should interfere with the individual and his or her possessions and that any such interference should be clearly circumscribed by law. The committee's most important task, therefore, lay in developing a set of principles that in the future would guide the exercise of entry and search powers by the Commonwealth, its bodies and its agencies. The committee felt that the current state of affairs, where different agencies were given different powers under a variety of different acts, was quite unsatisfactory. 
I would like to briefly mention just some of what I consider to be the most important of the few dozen or so principles developed by the committee in this report. In my opinion they most clearly indicate the committee's broad vision and best represent the essence of a new approach. The committee believed that, the powers of entry and search being so inherently intrusive, granting them to any government agency should only be done expressly through primary and not subordinate legislation. Only in this way could parliamentary control and thus accountability be secured. The committee proposed that, in all cases, entry and search should be conducted only with the genuine consent of the occupier or, alternatively, under a warrant. The committee expressed concerns that currently various government agencies, such as the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation, were able to effect entry and search without warrant. The committee recommends not only that, in future, all entries and searches where the occupier does not consent be conducted only under a warrant but also that any such warrant should be issued only by a judicial officer. This will ensure the continuing accountability and integrity of the process.
The committee also addressed the issue of the mechanics of entry and search. The committee believed that the powers should be conferred only on officials of sufficient maturity and training and who would also be subject to official scrutiny and accountability for the use and, indeed, the misuse of their power. Entry and search should be carried out in a manner consistent with human dignity and property rights. In most circumstances, it should be exercised during reasonable hours and on reasonable notice and, where it is likely to involve physical interference with people and property, the committee recommended that the power be used by, or at the very least with the assistance of, police officers.
In developing such principles the committee attempted to encompass what it considered to be best practice. Considering the intrusive nature of search and entry, the committee was of the opinion that these principles `should apply both to existing search and entry provisions and to proposed new provisions, should be administered by the Attorney-General's Department, and should have statutory force.' Only through such mechanisms would the integrity of the process be protected. In so defining powers of search and entry, this committee has sought to modestly retouch Australian liberal democracy and the living balance between the state and its citizens. 
I thank all committee members, the secretariat, particularly Mr James Warmenhoven and, finally, our Chairman, Senator Barney Cooney, whose leadership, bipartisanship and commitment in this endeavour set the best example for all Senate committee work.

In this the committee implicitly followed the principle that the onus lies with the state to establish the case why it should interfere with the individual and his or her possessions and that any such interference should be clearly circumscribed by law. The committee's most important task, therefore, lay in developing a set of principles that in the future would guide the exercise of entry and search powers by the Commonwealth, its bodies and its agencies. The committee felt that the current state of affairs, where different agencies were given different powers under a variety of different acts, was quite unsatisfactory. 
I would like to briefly mention just some of what I consider to be the most important of the few dozen or so principles developed by the committee in this report. In my opinion they most clearly indicate the committee's broad vision and best represent the essence of a new approach. The committee believed that, the powers of entry and search being so inherently intrusive, granting them to any government agency should only be done expressly through primary and not subordinate legislation. Only in this way could parliamentary control and thus accountability be secured. The committee proposed that, in all cases, entry and search should be conducted only with the genuine consent of the occupier or, alternatively, under a warrant. The committee expressed concerns that currently various government agencies, such as the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation, were able to effect entry and search without warrant. The committee recommends not only that, in future, all entries and searches where the occupier does not consent be conducted only under a warrant but also that any such warrant should be issued only by a judicial officer. This will ensure the continuing accountability and integrity of the process.
The committee also addressed the issue of the mechanics of entry and search. The committee believed that the powers should be conferred only on officials of sufficient maturity and training and who would also be subject to official scrutiny and accountability for the use and, indeed, the misuse of their power. Entry and search should be carried out in a manner consistent with human dignity and property rights. In most circumstances, it should be exercised during reasonable hours and on reasonable notice and, where it is likely to involve physical interference with people and property, the committee recommended that the power be used by, or at the very least with the assistance of, police officers.
In developing such principles the committee attempted to encompass what it considered to be best practice. Considering the intrusive nature of search and entry, the committee was of the opinion that these principles `should apply both to existing search and entry provisions and to proposed new provisions, should be administered by the Attorney-General's Department, and should have statutory force.' Only through such mechanisms would the integrity of the process be protected. In so defining powers of search and entry, this committee has sought to modestly retouch Australian liberal democracy and the living balance between the state and its citizens. 
I thank all committee members, the secretariat, particularly Mr James Warmenhoven and, finally, our Chairman, Senator Barney Cooney, whose leadership, bipartisanship and commitment in this endeavour set the best example for all Senate committee work.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2000-04-13,"—At 6 o'clock this evening we heard David Brownhill's final speech as he leaves after 15 years of service to the Senate. But he did not mention in his valedictory the many years that he served the National Party. He was on the state executive for 20 years, then Deputy President of the New South Wales branch of the National Party, then Vice-Chairman and then Chairman from 1983 to 1986. In those years that he served on the state executive and, as president, he led the New South Wales National Party in a very strong fashion. He saw it in government, he negotiated the coalition agreements between the New South Wales National Party and the Liberal Party and the Senate tickets, and then he came in here to serve for a further 15 years.
I have known him for 15 years and I would describe Senator David Brownhill, as he is now and will be until he hands in his resignation tomorrow morning to the Governor-General, as a quiet achiever, a person who is held in the absolutely highest esteem by his Senate colleagues and his colleagues in the House of Representatives, who all came into the Senate tonight to wish him all the best and be with him while he made that very nice speech. You never saw David out there in the headlines but he was achieving, like a duck that looked like it was cruising across the water but was paddling like crazy underneath. Some of his achievements were that he got easy peel mandarins into Japan—and that is just about an industry in its own right—he was strong in retaining the research and development levies, he was also the joint parliamentary secretary for John Anderson and Tim Fischer and he negotiated a lot of trade agreements overseas. The other night we were invited to the Chilean embassy and many of us from this side of parliament went over to see David receive an honour for the work that he had done to promote friendship and trade with Chile. He was honoured in a most spectacular way by the awarding of a very high Chilean honour. So over the last 15 years David has been very successful in a lot of what he has done. But what he has also done is provide stability to the National Party in some very hard times, in particular in 1987 when we were in a very destabilised position and condition. His wise counsel led us through some of those very rough times.
He alluded to the famous—or infamous—back of the truck incident, and I must admit that he found it very difficult to forgive me for that. He has often brought it up over the past 15 years and today I said I would put on the Hansard record that I apologise to him for that day that he got up in the back of the truck and I also got on the back of the truck. He was very disappointed in the way that I behaved and I said to him that tonight I would put it on the record that I apologise to him. 
Tomorrow morning David passes his resignation to the Governor-General. In the 10 minutes tonight that I have agreed to split with my colleague Senator Tambling, I would like to take the opportunity to wish David and Julia many years of happy retirement in which David can do some of the things that he has always wanted to do but has not been able to because of his service to the National Party and to the Senate over the past 30 or 40 years. Good luck, David, and good luck, Julia.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Valedictory: Senator Brownhill</title>,Adjournment,42,1
