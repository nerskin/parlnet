"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2008-06-26,"—On behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, following the receipt of a satisfactory response I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall withdraw business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5 standing in my name for 10 sitting days after today for the disallowance of Instrument No. CASA 222/07, Instrument No. CASA 364/07, Instrument No. CASA 445/07 and Instrument No. CASA 450/07. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee’s correspondence concerning these instruments.
Leave granted.

Instruments Nos. CASA 222/07, 364/07, 445/07 and 450/07

13 March 2008
The Hon Anthony Albanese MP
Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government
Suite MG.43
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister

On 20 September 2007 the Committee wrote to the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon Mark Vaile MP, seeking advice on certain matters relating to 
CASA Instrument No 222/07
 made under regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988. The Committee was awaiting a response when the Parliament was prorogued for the last federal election and owing to the change in government at that election; the Department requested that this matter be referred to you.

This instrument, which permits Jetstar Airways Pty Ltd to operate certain aircraft with a reduced number of cabin attendants, is in similar terms to previous instruments which make the same provision for other airlines (CASA Instrument No 321/06, which relates to Virgin Blue Airlines Pty Ltd, and CASA Instrument No 172/07, which relates to Pacific Blue Airlines (NZ) Ltd.)
The Committee has received advice from professional associations involved in the aviation industry expressing concern at the level of consultation undertaken prior to the making of these instruments.

Instrument No 321/06 refers to consultation both “within CASA and with Virgin Blue”, with consultation concluded by the signing of a document outlining agreements and undertakings. Instrument No 172/07 states that no consultation was conducted because the direction “is in terms identical to one previously issued to another operator in respect of the same type of aircraft” and that “any other operator requesting a direction in the same terms would have to meet the same or an equivalent standard”. This Standard seems to involve briefing passengers seated in the overwing emergency exit rows on emergency evacuation procedures. Instrument No 222/07 simply states that consultation was not undertaken “because the instrument is similar to a previous instrument issued to another operator”.
No wider consultation seems to have been undertaken on these instruments. The Committee has been advised that wider consultation with specialist stakeholders may have led to the canvassing of a number of significant technical issues including evacuation efficiency, crew member redundancy and effective security oversight, and have led to a more complete analysis of the safety of the proposals.
In addition, the Committee has been advised that these instruments run counter to a statement made to the Parliament by then Minister John Anderson on 2 June 2003. This statement, which was made following a review of Notice of Proposed Rule making (NPRM) 0211 OS, affirmed that Australian cabin crew ratios would not be altered.
Finally, could you advise whether the Office of Best Practice Regulation was consulted about the need for a Regulation Impact Statement?
The Committee notes that since it last wrote to the former Minister further instruments have been made that reduce the number of cabin attendants across a variety of aircraft types ─ CASA Instrument No 344/07 with relates to Macair Airlines Pty Ltd, CASA Instrument No 364/07 with relates to Capiteq Limited, CASA Instrument No 445/07 with relates to Qantas Airways Ltd and CASA Instrument No 350/07 with relates to Tiger Airways Pty Limited. The explanatory statements that accompany these instruments also advise that consultation was not undertaken.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 28 April 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.
Yours sincerely
Senator Dana Wortley

Dear Senator Wortley
I refer to your letter of 13 March 2008 (your reference 45/2008) about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s (CASA) Instrument No 222/07 made under Regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations (CAR) 1988, regarding cabin crew ratios on Jetstar aircraft. I also refer to the Committee’s recent motions to disallow similar instruments for Qantas, Tiger Airways and Capiteq Limited (Airnorth).
Your letter raises important questions regarding these instruments, primarily relating to the safety outcome, the consultation undertaken and whether the Office of Best Practice Regulation (OBPR) was consulted with regard to the need for a Regulation Impact Statement (RIS).
I understand that CASA has conducted thorough assessments of the safety cases provided by the operators in question. In each case the application process included a comprehensive review of the application and the applicable standards, meetings with the operators to resolve issues, and practical demonstrations including evacuation efficiency and crew member redundancy issues.
Given the complexity of the proposals, the safety cases put up by the operators generally take CASA months of detailed review, consultation and testing.
The regulation against which these instruments were issued is now almost 50 years old and does not consider the numerous advances in aviation technology over that time.
As part of the evaluation process, CASA has considered the certification standards for the aircraft and standards applied in other advanced aviation countries including the US, UK and NZ. It is worth noting that, in these countries, similar judgments have been made, effectively based on the type certification of the aircraft types for which CASA has now also provided exemptions in these four cases.
With regard to consultation, under section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (L1A), my understanding is that the rule-maker must be satisfied that any consultation it considers to be appropriate, and that is reasonably practicable to undertake, has been undertaken.
I am advised that CASA considers that appropriate consultation has been undertaken in this case.
In relation to your concerns regarding RIS, the OBPR was not consulted. As you would be aware, RISs are not required when business compliance costs and other impacts are considered to be low. CASA produces hundreds of legislative instruments annually and is currently discussing with OBPR the policy related to legislative instruments such as these.
With regard to safety, you would be aware that, under section 9 of the Civil Aviation Act 1988, CASA’s functions are all essentially safety-related, and a central feature of that responsibility involves making a range of safety-related judgements. In the context of cabin crew ratios, I believe that CASA has made appropriate safety judgements and that these instruments should not be disallowed.
I acknowledge that the development and implementation of aviation regulations is a complex process for the regulator and industry and there is an opportunity for this matter to be addressed as part of the forthcoming aviation white paper.
Yours sincerely

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-06-26,"—Whilst the opposition will not insist upon the amendments that have been rejected by the House, there are a few interesting points that I think we need to make. First of all, the opposition is pleased that we have stood up and advocated for maintaining entitlements for the people who would have been affected by this Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. Parts of this bill make additional entitlements available by correcting an oversight and an unintended consequence, but basically the remainder of the bill strips away benefits for people who have come to rely on them. We have made these points and we have debated them extensively in committee. In putting forward the opposition’s position, we believe that the amendments that we originally made are truly very significant. We believe that they are important and we believe that this is penny pinching by the government.
What do I mean by that? In the other place the talk was about how the seniors health card list had been cleansed by the previous government. Yes, it was cleansed; we went through it, reviewed it and reformed it. But the difficulty we have with this legislation is the fact that requiring tax file numbers is really a way of slowly introducing other income measures that will affect peoples’ entitlements—entitlements that they have come to rely on quite frankly, entitlements that they were not told they were going to lose before the election by an opposition that became the government through its sneakiness.
The other thing we have to point out is that the other part of the amendment that we introduced, which was going to affect partner service pensions, was going to have a total revenue cost of around $20 million. This government has stripped $20 million from about 930 people who have come to rely on it. That $20 million is being stripped by a government that has spent $167 million in marginal electorates on pork barrelling through sport and recreational facilities. It is a shame. They are taking $20 million from one end and adding $167 million of unaccountable projects and shameless pork barrelling at the other, of which they are unable to even provide a list. This is a government with its priorities all wrong. It is a government that has been sneaky. It has betrayed the Australian people.
In reading some of the debate in the House, I noticed that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs talked about how he publicised the changes to the partner service pension. The problem with that is it is so disingenuous because he publicised it after the election. He claims that putting out a press release prior to the budget is publicising it and being open and accountable to the Australian people. It is simply not being open and accountable. They went to an election without telling people about their sneaky tests to remove entitlements—hard-won entitlements, entitlements that people deserve. This is a government that is clearly making policy on the run. It has not completely shared with the Australian people its agenda of ripping and stripping away entitlements to hurt those that are vulnerable.
We are interested in ensuring that the unintended consequences of legislation relating to fringe benefits entitlements for lower paid workers and community organisations are removed and we want to support the amendments that are there so that people are not disadvantaged any more than they have to be. Quite frankly, we would prefer our amendments (4) and (5) to be retained, but we are not going to stand on that because we do not want to delay this legislation any further. But we are very, very concerned about it. I think that is on the record now.
We will continue to advocate so that people will not be disadvantaged by this government’s sneakiness They are clearly not interested in honouring their commitments given in the election campaign, because they are introducing measures that were not election commitments. The only commitments they made during the election campaign that they seem to be honouring are those that revolve around their pork barrelling and their purchase, for want of another word, of marginal seats, where they have gone and made enormous promises, promises that they are not disclosing to the Senate, promises they boast about internally and promises that will ultimately embarrass this government enormously. In the largest pork barrel the country has ever seen, they have rolled out hundreds of millions of dollars to try and purchase an election. They are now stripping away entitlements that people have come to rely on. Whilst the opposition will let this legislation go through because we want to ensure that the unintended consequences of the previous bill do not disadvantage people, we mark our considered opposition to the stripping away of entitlements for both seniors and veterans. Accordingly, we will support the bill as amended.",SENATE,"<title>FAMILIES, HOUSING, COMMUNITY SERVICES AND INDIGENOUS AFFAIRS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2008 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>",<title>Consideration of House of Representatives Message</title>,Bills,15,1,speech

"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I present the report of the Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee, Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
This inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Communications and the Arts, which resulted in this report, has received much attention from the media and the public. More than 160 submissions were received from community groups, academics and everyday Australians who have taken an interest in the issue of the sexualisation of children in the contemporary media. I note at the outset that this is a comprehensive report about a complex issue, and I urge people interested in the committee’s deliberations to consider the report in its entirety, including its recommendations, and not just accept pre-emptive media speculation about what may or may not be in this report. I acknowledge that this inquiry came about on the motion of Senator Lyn Allison, who today is retiring from the Senate. Her longstanding interest in and commitment to childhood development and rights and protections is to be applauded. I thank her in particular for her work on this inquiry.
Sexualised images and actions are increasingly widely portrayed and discussed in the media and used ever more explicitly as a marketing device. There is, it seems, no doubt that the adage ‘sex sells’ is indeed true, and we and our children are exposed daily to adverts, songs, magazines, programs and products that have sexual themes. The committee accepted that these developments may have a negative influence on child development, although the actual extent and effect of that influence is not well researched, particularly in Australia. Many things influence a child’s development—their family, their peers, economic circumstances, diet and education all have an impact. What children see and hear in the media is but one influence amongst many.
The committee approached this enquiry from the position that, in a free society, the rights of adults to see, hear and purchase what they wish is a value that should not be interfered with lightly. It is also a responsibility of society to protect its children from things that may harm them. As I said in the previous report of this committee into the broadcasting codes of practice, achieving the correct balance between freedom and protection is difficult, but it should be the objective. The committee also notes the key responsibility of parents to manage the material to which their children are exposed. Particularly in the case of younger children, these decisions are still primarily in the hands of parents or other adults.
The report also notes that there is an onus on broadcasters, publishers, advertisers, retailers and manufacturers to take account of community concerns on the issue that is the subject of this report. The committee noted that the Australian Association of National Advertisers has developed a code for advertising and marketing to children to specifically address this issue. Perhaps Senator Fielding might have paid attention to that before he wrote the supplementary comments to this report.
In our report the committee recognises the importance of supporting parents and children in dealing with the pressures that confront them in contemporary society and in responding to exposure to sex and sexual themes in the contemporary media. The report recommends an upgrading of sexual health and relationships programs for school children, greater parental involvement in the development and delivery of such programs and the need for a national approach to the subject.
The committee did not come down with findings about banning products or censoring media, but it does recommend tightening the operation of the regulations and codes of practice which seek to inform parents as to the content of television programs or publications and to protect children from material which they would find disturbing or that is inappropriate to their stage of development.
The committee recommends that the current rules in relation to children’s television should be amended to enable children’s material to be shown at more suitable times and that broadcasters should consider establishing dedicated children’s television channels. In our earlier report on broadcasting the committee also recommended tightening up G, PG and M classifications and the consumer advice that accompanies them.
Broadcasting and advertising are the subject of self-regulatory or co-regulatory regimes which classify material and deal with complaints having regard to community standards. The many submissions that the committee received, particularly about the content of advertising but also with regard to magazines marketed to young girls and teenage girls, suggest that the regulators need to try harder in assessing and reflecting contemporary community standards. The committee recommends, as it did in its earlier report on broadcasting, that the regulators, especially the Australian Communications and the Media Authority and the Advertising Standards Board, put more effort into this important area. There is a recommendation that the ASB apply the advertising standards for billboards and outdoor advertising to take account of community concerns about the inability of parents to restrict exposure of such material to children.
The complaints processes available to the public are a major focus of community concern, with people feeling confused, frustrated and ultimately baffled by how to make a complaint. The committee has made recommendations to make these processes simpler, more accessible and more responsive.
The committee is also keenly aware of the limitations and practical difficulties of research into the subject of this report. It is not easy to interview children about matters to do with sex and sexual themes. However, those difficulties notwithstanding, the report recommends that the Commonwealth should commission a major long-term study on the impact of inappropriate sexualisation on child development.
I would like to thank all the people and organisations who made submissions to this enquiry and who appeared at our public hearings. My thanks to other committee members for their cooperation during the inquiry and to the secretariat for their assistance. As I said earlier, I would particularly like to thank Senator Lyn Allison for initiating this inquiry and for her participation in the inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,16,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-06-26,"—I thank the chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts for her thanks and, in return, thank her by saying that it was a very good inquiry to be on and that she and the rest of the committee conducted themselves in a fine manner on a difficult but important inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media. It was initiated by parents who approached me and, no doubt, others about this issue. They said: ‘We are concerned about our children. We think they are being prematurely drawn into a sexualisation which is inappropriate for their age, and we feel that we cannot counter a very broad and pervasive sexualisation which is happening in advertising and in the media.’ So I am pleased that the Senate saw fit to agree to the environment committee taking up this inquiry.
The inquiry was difficult because no-one on the committee—and I expect it would be the same in this place—wanted to bring down the heavy hand of censorship on advertisers or on the media. That would be both difficult and unpopular. Yet we did recognise that there was a problem in terms of what was not understood to be the community standard. We have some processes in place, but there seemed to be doubt as to how we measure what is acceptable and what is not. If it is the case that parents are buying unacceptable material for their children, how do you deal with that? This was quite a challenge to us and, in the middle of the inquiry, we had the Bill Henson photographic exhibition, questions about underage models being dressed up as adults and the public debate that surrounded those issues. I think that made this inquiry very timely and very useful.
Parental responsibility is a difficult area. We can say that it is up to the parents to determine whether to expose their children to material, but parents may not know that some of this material can be damaging to their children. We heard from psychologists who said that, although they do not have research studies that they can point to, there is evidence of children coming into the care of psychologists at an earlier and earlier age with symptoms of anxiety and eating disorders and the like, which they attribute, at least in part, to the sexualisation process that is going on. While the committee recommended that a longitudinal study of children be undertaken to find out exactly what harm is being done, I think we need to recognise that that research is extremely difficult to do. You cannot deliberately expose children to material which may be harmful to them just to understand whether it was harmful. So there are some ethical constraints as well.
I am pleased that the debate and our inquiry did generate some rethinking. The Australian Standards Board put out a protocol about the sexualisation of children—in fact, they did that before we had our hearing. As is so often the case, the public debate and the Senate inquiry process play a role in involving these organisations, which do not wish the heavy hand of the law to come down on them and which prefer to have protocols that are optional and to have their own systems in place. I think that was a signal that this was likely.
I strongly support the idea that we should have a children’s television station. I think the ABC is the best one to do that. I would like to see the government find some money to fund it. If the commercial stations can put on children’s TV and not have advertising then that would be terrific too.
Returning to parents and their responsibility, it is not always possible for parents to shield their children from magazines that are very readily available in shops and in other retail establishments. There are also huge billboards, which many people find offensive and difficult to deal with when their children see them. At the end of the day, I think it is parents who need assistance here—hence, the recommendation that there should be some sort of classification, for instance, on magazines so that parents would be warned whether or not a magazine was suitable for children and whether parental guidance was required.
Many of the other recommendations are very sound too. It is wise for the Senate—not ‘us’ as in me but the Senate—to come back and see whether the recommendations have had an effect, whether this inquiry has made a difference and whether the new code of practice for children has made a difference. I strongly support the recommendation, and I acknowledge Senator Kemp for making this contribution.
The committee discovered that the complaints process in place for the Australian Advertising Standards Board was inadequate: complaints had to be in writing in order to be counted and to be heard and listened to. That is not acceptable in this day and age. People ought to be able to make a phone call, send an email or send a note that might not be on the right form, because parents often do not have the time to be writing letters and may not have the facilities to do that. The various ways of making a complaint should be legitimate rather than there being red tape or constraints on what does or does not qualify.
We thought it was very important that outdoor advertisements should be vetted, because you cannot choose whether or not you see them. This is where community standards are important, and they need to be identified. Vetting of outdoor advertising is a very good move. It is what happens with television ads. It is nothing new in the advertising industry and so this recommendation should not pose a significant problem.
I thank those people who contributed to the inquiry through submissions and by appearing at our two hearings. Their contributions were most interesting and very useful to us in our deliberations. I again thank the Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts for its efforts on this issue, and I hope that the committee’s recommendations are adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee</title>",Committees,16,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-06-26,"—I am pleased to speak on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media. In doing so, I am mindful that it is one of several inquiries that I have participated in recently. As Senator McEwen mentioned, one related to the effectiveness of the broadcasting codes of practice and another related to an inquiry conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill 2007.
Each of these inquiries related to issues of culture, issues in our society and very much to issues of individual responsibility. These are great challenges for government and for this parliament to consider in trying to balance individual responsibility, choice and freedom in society with concerns about the direction that our culture may be taking and how we may influence it. The Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill looked at restrictions on alcohol advertising and was very focused on the potential impact of such advertising on young people and their drinking habits, and it is commensurate with the current national debate on binge drinking. The broadcasting codes of practice inquiry looked in particular at the use of language on television, the type of language that young people and children may hear and how that can influence them, and the effectiveness of the broadcasting codes.
The inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media looked at the very broad issue of how children are sexualised, how they are portrayed, how this influences them as they grow up and at what age they may become sexualised and whether or not that is too early. These are all incredibly complex issues, and the last one has been the most complex of all for us to tackle. The committee found it a challenge to initially define what is meant by ‘child sexualisation’. The report that has been handed down does attempt to do that, borrowing from an overseas task force which looked at this issue, but the community debate about it is wide ranging. The report touches on advertising, on what is shown in the media, on the types of toys that exist and the marketing that surrounds them, and on art—as we saw when the Bill Henson controversy erupted during the course of this inquiry. This issue really is all-encompassing in the modern media environment. With such a complex issue, there were limits to what we could achieve in a relatively short period of time; nonetheless, I think the report does go some way to try to tackle these serious issues.
In particular and most importantly, the report makes a statement to the community at large that this parliament and this Senate take this issue seriously. For that, I recognise Senator Allison in particular. I know that Senator Ronaldson also played a role in helping to establish this inquiry but I note that Senator Allison has driven this for some period of time and I praise her for helping to put it on the national agenda, because making that statement is probably the most important thing we can do. When it comes to changing culture, no amount of regulation and no amount of recommendations by a Senate inquiry will necessarily hit home with the community in achieving that cultural change. Cultural change has to be adopted by the community at large. It requires the whole gamut of people out there—mums, dads, grandparents, advertisers, television executives, others in the media and those who manufacture, market and produce toys—to be mindful of this issue of early childhood sexualisation when they are developing products or making decisions in their day-to-day lives, in their businesses and in their homes.
The committee have attempted, with this report and the other reports, to strike the right balance. It is not in my nature to support tighter restrictions on what people see, hear or think—I believe that, in a free society, people should be able to make free decisions and free choices—nor do I think it is right or, indeed, possible for us in this place or for other groups to define and set community standards, because community standards are an ever-evolving thing. They are changing constantly and it differs from household to household and from person to person as to what people believe is acceptable for them, for their children and for their family circumstances. As such, in this report, as in the other reports, we have very strongly backed self-regulation—self-regulatory approaches and co-regulatory approaches that put the responsibility back on industry, advertisers, marketers and others who make the decisions about what is seen, what is heard, what is marketed and what is sold in society. Some of those systems are not living up to all that they should and these groups need to toughen up their act, get it together and ensure that they better reflect what appears to be, and genuinely is, an increased level of community concern.
As Senator Allison mentioned, I am also mindful of Senator Kemp’s contribution to this report. We have put the broadcasting and advertising industries on notice that this Senate should reconsider this very important issue in 18 months to two years and look at how the recommendations of the report have been adopted and also the proactive approach that should be taken by those who have a collective responsibility in society for such an important issue. This is, in a sense, a warning to industry—a yellow card, to use soccer parlance—that the Senate takes this issue seriously, that the industries need to lift their game and be mindful of this issue and not push the boundaries too far, whether it is in the types of girly magazines that are published, the types of toys that are sold and marketed or the types of images that are shown on television. Industry needs to take responsibility and be ever vigilant and ever mindful and know that this Senate should, if it adopts the report’s recommendations, come back and look at this issue again in time.
Importantly, we have also flagged a review that should be undertaken into the new code of practice in television and advertising relating to children. Senator McEwen mentioned that in her comments. It is a new code that was developed just prior to this inquiry, and its effectiveness and operation need to be considered within 18 months to ensure that it is achieving what those who established it claimed it was set out to achieve—that is, providing a greater level of protection and responsibility.
The importance of alternatives is highlighted strongly in this report, and I back Senator Allison’s strong push for there to be a children’s television channel funded by the ABC. The coalition took that policy to the last election. Senator Conroy has said in estimates hearings that this is part of the triennial funding negotiations for the ABC from next year. I urge the government to adopt this. I think there is very strong community support for this. There are benefits that stem beyond children in having a dedicated children’s channel. There are benefits in Senator Conroy’s own communications portfolio in terms of the uptake of digital technology, which we have seen in the UK. But, most importantly, the ABC providing a dedicated children’s channel is something that could change the lives of parents in the way they protect their children from what they see and hear on television, in the media and in advertising. It would address many of the issues that were covered in both the broadcasting codes of practice inquiry and this inquiry into the sexualisation of media. I note that Senator Bernardi initiated the broadcasting codes of practice inquiry and a dedicated children’s channel. The opportunities that digital TV presents not just for the ABC but also for other free-to-air broadcasters to expand their coverage for children would give parents much more comfort in knowing that there would always be something appropriate for them to consider. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Many things influence a child’s development—their family, their peers, economic circumstances, diet and education all have an impact. What children see and hear in the media is but one influence amongst many.
The committee approached this enquiry from the position that, in a free society, the rights of adults to see, hear and purchase what they wish is a value that should not be interfered with lightly. It is also a responsibility of society to protect its children from things that may harm them. As I said in the previous report of this committee into the broadcasting codes of practice, achieving the correct balance between freedom and protection is difficult, but it should be the objective. The committee also notes the key responsibility of parents to manage the material to which their children are exposed. Particularly in the case of younger children, these decisions are still primarily in the hands of parents or other adults.
The report also notes that there is an onus on broadcasters, publishers, advertisers, retailers and manufacturers to take account of community concerns on the issue that is the subject of this report. The committee noted that the Australian Association of National Advertisers has developed a code for advertising and marketing to children to specifically address this issue. Perhaps Senator Fielding might have paid attention to that before he wrote the supplementary comments to this report.
In our report the committee recognises the importance of supporting parents and children in dealing with the pressures that confront them in contemporary society and in responding to exposure to sex and sexual themes in the contemporary media. The report recommends an upgrading of sexual health and relationships programs for school children, greater parental involvement in the development and delivery of such programs and the need for a national approach to the subject.
The committee did not come down with findings about banning products or censoring media, but it does recommend tightening the operation of the regulations and codes of practice which seek to inform parents as to the content of television programs or publications and to protect children from material which they would find disturbing or that is inappropriate to their stage of development.
The committee recommends that the current rules in relation to children’s television should be amended to enable children’s material to be shown at more suitable times and that broadcasters should consider establishing dedicated children’s television channels. In our earlier report on broadcasting the committee also recommended tightening up G, PG and M classifications and the consumer advice that accompanies them.
Broadcasting and advertising are the subject of self-regulatory or co-regulatory regimes which classify material and deal with complaints having regard to community standards. The many submissions that the committee received, particularly about the content of advertising but also with regard to magazines marketed to young girls and teenage girls, suggest that the regulators need to try harder in assessing and reflecting contemporary community standards. The committee recommends, as it did in its earlier report on broadcasting, that the regulators, especially the Australian Communications and the Media Authority and the Advertising Standards Board, put more effort into this important area. There is a recommendation that the ASB apply the advertising standards for billboards and outdoor advertising to take account of community concerns about the inability of parents to restrict exposure of such material to children.
The complaints processes available to the public are a major focus of community concern, with people feeling confused, frustrated and ultimately baffled by how to make a complaint. The committee has made recommendations to make these processes simpler, more accessible and more responsive.
The committee is also keenly aware of the limitations and practical difficulties of research into the subject of this report. It is not easy to interview children about matters to do with sex and sexual themes. However, those difficulties notwithstanding, the report recommends that the Commonwealth should commission a major long-term study on the impact of inappropriate sexualisation on child development.
I would like to thank all the people and organisations who made submissions to this enquiry and who appeared at our public hearings. My thanks to other committee members for their cooperation during the inquiry and to the secretariat for their assistance. As I said earlier, I would particularly like to thank Senator Lyn Allison for initiating this inquiry and for her participation in the inquiry.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2008-06-26,"—I thank the chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts for her thanks and, in return, thank her by saying that it was a very good inquiry to be on and that she and the rest of the committee conducted themselves in a fine manner on a difficult but important inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media. It was initiated by parents who approached me and, no doubt, others about this issue. They said: ‘We are concerned about our children. We think they are being prematurely drawn into a sexualisation which is inappropriate for their age, and we feel that we cannot counter a very broad and pervasive sexualisation which is happening in advertising and in the media.’ So I am pleased that the Senate saw fit to agree to the environment committee taking up this inquiry.
The inquiry was difficult because no-one on the committee—and I expect it would be the same in this place—wanted to bring down the heavy hand of censorship on advertisers or on the media. That would be both difficult and unpopular. Yet we did recognise that there was a problem in terms of what was not understood to be the community standard. We have some processes in place, but there seemed to be doubt as to how we measure what is acceptable and what is not. If it is the case that parents are buying unacceptable material for their children, how do you deal with that? This was quite a challenge to us and, in the middle of the inquiry, we had the Bill Henson photographic exhibition, questions about underage models being dressed up as adults and the public debate that surrounded those issues. I think that made this inquiry very timely and very useful.
Parental responsibility is a difficult area. We can say that it is up to the parents to determine whether to expose their children to material, but parents may not know that some of this material can be damaging to their children. We heard from psychologists who said that, although they do not have research studies that they can point to, there is evidence of children coming into the care of psychologists at an earlier and earlier age with symptoms of anxiety and eating disorders and the like, which they attribute, at least in part, to the sexualisation process that is going on. While the committee recommended that a longitudinal study of children be undertaken to find out exactly what harm is being done, I think we need to recognise that that research is extremely difficult to do. You cannot deliberately expose children to material which may be harmful to them just to understand whether it was harmful. So there are some ethical constraints as well.
I am pleased that the debate and our inquiry did generate some rethinking. The Australian Standards Board put out a protocol about the sexualisation of children—in fact, they did that before we had our hearing. As is so often the case, the public debate and the Senate inquiry process play a role in involving these organisations, which do not wish the heavy hand of the law to come down on them and which prefer to have protocols that are optional and to have their own systems in place. I think that was a signal that this was likely.
I strongly support the idea that we should have a children’s television station. I think the ABC is the best one to do that. I would like to see the government find some money to fund it. If the commercial stations can put on children’s TV and not have advertising then that would be terrific too.
Returning to parents and their responsibility, it is not always possible for parents to shield their children from magazines that are very readily available in shops and in other retail establishments. There are also huge billboards, which many people find offensive and difficult to deal with when their children see them. At the end of the day, I think it is parents who need assistance here—hence, the recommendation that there should be some sort of classification, for instance, on magazines so that parents would be warned whether or not a magazine was suitable for children and whether parental guidance was required.
Many of the other recommendations are very sound too. It is wise for the Senate—not ‘us’ as in me but the Senate—to come back and see whether the recommendations have had an effect, whether this inquiry has made a difference and whether the new code of practice for children has made a difference. I strongly support the recommendation, and I acknowledge Senator Kemp for making this contribution.
The committee discovered that the complaints process in place for the Australian Advertising Standards Board was inadequate: complaints had to be in writing in order to be counted and to be heard and listened to. That is not acceptable in this day and age. People ought to be able to make a phone call, send an email or send a note that might not be on the right form, because parents often do not have the time to be writing letters and may not have the facilities to do that. The various ways of making a complaint should be legitimate rather than there being red tape or constraints on what does or does not qualify.
We thought it was very important that outdoor advertisements should be vetted, because you cannot choose whether or not you see them. This is where community standards are important, and they need to be identified. Vetting of outdoor advertising is a very good move. It is what happens with television ads. It is nothing new in the advertising industry and so this recommendation should not pose a significant problem.
I thank those people who contributed to the inquiry through submissions and by appearing at our two hearings. Their contributions were most interesting and very useful to us in our deliberations. I again thank the Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts for its efforts on this issue, and I hope that the committee’s recommendations are adopted.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,16,2,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-06-26,"—I am pleased to speak on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media. In doing so, I am mindful that it is one of several inquiries that I have participated in recently. As Senator McEwen mentioned, one related to the effectiveness of the broadcasting codes of practice and another related to an inquiry conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill 2007.
Each of these inquiries related to issues of culture, issues in our society and very much to issues of individual responsibility. These are great challenges for government and for this parliament to consider in trying to balance individual responsibility, choice and freedom in society with concerns about the direction that our culture may be taking and how we may influence it. The Alcohol Toll Reduction Bill looked at restrictions on alcohol advertising and was very focused on the potential impact of such advertising on young people and their drinking habits, and it is commensurate with the current national debate on binge drinking. The broadcasting codes of practice inquiry looked in particular at the use of language on television, the type of language that young people and children may hear and how that can influence them, and the effectiveness of the broadcasting codes.
The inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media looked at the very broad issue of how children are sexualised, how they are portrayed, how this influences them as they grow up and at what age they may become sexualised and whether or not that is too early. These are all incredibly complex issues, and the last one has been the most complex of all for us to tackle. The committee found it a challenge to initially define what is meant by ‘child sexualisation’. The report that has been handed down does attempt to do that, borrowing from an overseas task force which looked at this issue, but the community debate about it is wide ranging. The report touches on advertising, on what is shown in the media, on the types of toys that exist and the marketing that surrounds them, and on art—as we saw when the Bill Henson controversy erupted during the course of this inquiry. This issue really is all-encompassing in the modern media environment. With such a complex issue, there were limits to what we could achieve in a relatively short period of time; nonetheless, I think the report does go some way to try to tackle these serious issues.
In particular and most importantly, the report makes a statement to the community at large that this parliament and this Senate take this issue seriously. For that, I recognise Senator Allison in particular. I know that Senator Ronaldson also played a role in helping to establish this inquiry but I note that Senator Allison has driven this for some period of time and I praise her for helping to put it on the national agenda, because making that statement is probably the most important thing we can do. When it comes to changing culture, no amount of regulation and no amount of recommendations by a Senate inquiry will necessarily hit home with the community in achieving that cultural change. Cultural change has to be adopted by the community at large. It requires the whole gamut of people out there—mums, dads, grandparents, advertisers, television executives, others in the media and those who manufacture, market and produce toys—to be mindful of this issue of early childhood sexualisation when they are developing products or making decisions in their day-to-day lives, in their businesses and in their homes.
The committee have attempted, with this report and the other reports, to strike the right balance. It is not in my nature to support tighter restrictions on what people see, hear or think—I believe that, in a free society, people should be able to make free decisions and free choices—nor do I think it is right or, indeed, possible for us in this place or for other groups to define and set community standards, because community standards are an ever-evolving thing. They are changing constantly and it differs from household to household and from person to person as to what people believe is acceptable for them, for their children and for their family circumstances. As such, in this report, as in the other reports, we have very strongly backed self-regulation—self-regulatory approaches and co-regulatory approaches that put the responsibility back on industry, advertisers, marketers and others who make the decisions about what is seen, what is heard, what is marketed and what is sold in society. Some of those systems are not living up to all that they should and these groups need to toughen up their act, get it together and ensure that they better reflect what appears to be, and genuinely is, an increased level of community concern.
As Senator Allison mentioned, I am also mindful of Senator Kemp’s contribution to this report. We have put the broadcasting and advertising industries on notice that this Senate should reconsider this very important issue in 18 months to two years and look at how the recommendations of the report have been adopted and also the proactive approach that should be taken by those who have a collective responsibility in society for such an important issue. This is, in a sense, a warning to industry—a yellow card, to use soccer parlance—that the Senate takes this issue seriously, that the industries need to lift their game and be mindful of this issue and not push the boundaries too far, whether it is in the types of girly magazines that are published, the types of toys that are sold and marketed or the types of images that are shown on television. Industry needs to take responsibility and be ever vigilant and ever mindful and know that this Senate should, if it adopts the report’s recommendations, come back and look at this issue again in time.
Importantly, we have also flagged a review that should be undertaken into the new code of practice in television and advertising relating to children. Senator McEwen mentioned that in her comments. It is a new code that was developed just prior to this inquiry, and its effectiveness and operation need to be considered within 18 months to ensure that it is achieving what those who established it claimed it was set out to achieve—that is, providing a greater level of protection and responsibility.
The importance of alternatives is highlighted strongly in this report, and I back Senator Allison’s strong push for there to be a children’s television channel funded by the ABC. The coalition took that policy to the last election. Senator Conroy has said in estimates hearings that this is part of the triennial funding negotiations for the ABC from next year. I urge the government to adopt this. I think there is very strong community support for this. There are benefits that stem beyond children in having a dedicated children’s channel. There are benefits in Senator Conroy’s own communications portfolio in terms of the uptake of digital technology, which we have seen in the UK. But, most importantly, the ABC providing a dedicated children’s channel is something that could change the lives of parents in the way they protect their children from what they see and hear on television, in the media and in advertising. It would address many of the issues that were covered in both the broadcasting codes of practice inquiry and this inquiry into the sexualisation of media. I note that Senator Bernardi initiated the broadcasting codes of practice inquiry and a dedicated children’s channel. The opportunities that digital TV presents not just for the ABC but also for other free-to-air broadcasters to expand their coverage for children would give parents much more comfort in knowing that there would always be something appropriate for them to consider. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-06-26,"—As the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs I present the report of the committee on the Rights of the Terminally Ill (Euthanasia Laws Repeal) Bill 2008 together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
On behalf of the members of my committee I present this report on the Rights of the Terminally Ill Bill. Firstly, you will notice from the outset that there is not a majority or minority report providing comments from the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee to this report. Why is that? That is for a number of reasons. We did that because, in presenting this report, it would have been much more balanced to have provided and reflected on the views of the members of the committee rather than seek to have a majority or a minority view. So the report is structured in a way that we have made comments on legality and on the terms and clauses in the bill. We have chapters for and against the issue of euthanasia and a chapter that is simply titled ‘Statements and summaries of views of members of the committee’. I want to put on record my view about this legislation in relation to this report as chair of the committee, and my views are supported by Senator Kirk and Senator Marshall.
From my point of view, the legislation that was produced by Senator Brown went to two issues. The first issue for me was whether or not the territories, and in particular the Northern Territory, should have the right to legislate in every area but particularly, of course, in the area of euthanasia laws. The second issue, which people on the committee and certainly a number of submissions concentrated on, was whether or not there should be euthanasia in this country at all, let alone in the Northern Territory. During the inquiry I found myself focused not so much on what sort of legislation a territory government would introduce on any subject, but on whether or not a territory should have the right to do it. It is true that under section 122 of the Constitution, the Commonwealth has the power to make laws for the government of any territory. In the last 12 months we have seen that occur a number of times in relation to this parliament. But back in 1995 when the then Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, led by the Hon. Marshall Peron, put through laws in relation to euthanasia, their ability to be able to do so was tested. Those laws were passed and, as I said, their ability to do that was challenged.
In the Northern Territory Supreme Court in 1996 a majority of the full bench of the Supreme Court upheld that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly did in fact have the power and that the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was a valid law of the Northern Territory. An appeal was lodged in the High Court, but it was not heard and did not come to fruition because Kevin Andrews introduced the Euthanasia Laws Bill in 1996.
During the inquiry we heard that the Territory was not mature enough to determine its own destiny. A number of very significant national lobby groups argued that, because the Territory had a population of fewer than 250,000 people, a legislature of only 25 and no upper house, we had no capacity to make laws on such a significant matter as euthanasia. I totally reject that argument. We have the capacity to make laws in every manner available to us under the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act. If you look at the conscious, emotive issues of life and death, the Northern Territory does have laws in relation to abortion. For me it is inconsistent to think that we should not also be able to have laws in respect of euthanasia. We have laws in relation to assisting people who are terminally ill and in relation to abortion so, for me, it does not equate that we would not have the maturity to deal with laws in relation to euthanasia. I totally reject that argument. I believe that the rigorous processes of the parliament in the Northern Territory are as rigorous as anywhere else. The deliberations of the members of the Legislative Assembly are as serious and as complete as anywhere else, and we do have the maturity to pass laws in this regard. (Extension of time granted) Therefore I have come to the conclusion that Senator Brown’s bill should proceed but in an amended form. It should be amended to give back to the Northern Territory the power to create laws in relation to euthanasia; however, as it has been 13 years since the Rights of the Terminally Ill Bill was passed, I uphold the view of the Northern Territory government that Bob Brown’s bill should be amended to not re-enact the Rights of the Terminally Ill legislation. Therefore, what we should see is the Territory being given back its powers and then determining its destiny on the issue of euthanasia.
In summing up, the one way to solve this problem about the Commonwealth’s obsession with overriding Territory laws when it believes it ought to and not when it is good policy is to consider in this house of parliament a bill that would give statehood to the Northern Territory. In that respect I totally support the Northern Territory government’s submission on this bill, and my comments as chair reflect that.",SENATE,<title>RIGHTS OF THE TERMINALLY ILL (EUTHANASIA LAWS REPEAL) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Affairs</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2008-06-26,"—At the start of my short time available to speak on this, I would like to reflect on the comments of Senator Crossin’s analogy, where she compared abortion with euthanasia. I wonder whether there may be an opportunity for her to clarify those comments. I find such a comparison deeply disturbing—that we are able to kill unborn Australian babies and that therefore there should be some sort of equal right to support for the euthanasia legislation. If my understanding of her comments is incorrect, perhaps Senator Crossin could correct the record. We will have a look at the Hansard to clarify that.
Solstice day, 21 June, was also Motor Neurone Disease Global Awareness Day. Last week I had the honour of hosting a breakfast for Motor Neurone Disease Australia. One thing that we are all entirely supportive of is support for more funding and resources for palliative care. That view was put at the breakfast last week—and it was the view of all members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—that there should be further and significant funding and resources for palliative care in this country. So we are at one on the importance of palliative care. However, we are not at one on this bill being put forward by Senator Bob Brown. On behalf of Liberal senators, and as deputy chairman of the committee, we are deeply concerned about the draft bill and consider that it should not proceed under any circumstances. These concerns are so significant that it does not warrant the recommendations and amendments put forward by Senator Crossin and the Labor senators. The bill is inaccurate, unclear and ambiguous, and it creates considerable uncertainty about the status of the Northern Territory (Rights of the Terminally Ill) Act.
I want to particularly draw the Senate’s attention to the report of the Liberal senators and note that during the nine-month period when the act was in effect, there was a reference in our committee proceedings to a study published by the Lancet. Its principal author was Professor David Kissane, consultant psychiatrist and professor of palliative medicine. Dr Philip Nitschke was a co-author of that paper, and I note that Dr Nitschke is here in the gallery today. Four people were assisted to terminate their lives by Dr Nitschke under the RTI Act. No other medical practitioner made use of the provisions of the act to assist any other person to terminate life.
The Lancet study and evidence from Dr Nitschke to our committee raised serious doubts about the effectiveness of the act in ensuring competent psychiatric assessments of patients before they were administered euthanasia. The previously undisclosed admission by Dr Nitschke that he had personally paid the fee for the psychiatric assessment of one of the patients he euthanased gives rise to a serious concern about a potential conflict of interest. That is just one concern that we wanted to raise, and our report is set out in terms of the range of other concerns. Dr David van Gend summarised other problems with the administration of the RTI Act in this way. He said:
The four levels of medical safeguard that were built into the act were either diminished or blatantly violated ...
We have particular concerns with the inadequate safeguards under the act which Senator Brown wishes to restore to life. We are particularly concerned about the slippery slope argument and the possible move from voluntary euthanasia to involuntary euthanasia.
A number of other issues were raised, and we want to raise them very briefly with the Senate today. They relate to the Aboriginal issues in the Northern Territory. We received a good deal of evidence which expressed serious concern about the impact that this would have on, and its inconsistency with, Aboriginal culture and Indigenous culture. Based on the evidence that was put, it is our view that it poses a threat to the health of Indigenous Northern Territorians.
With respect to euthanasia tourism, it is noted that, of the four people who were euthanised during the time when the act was operating, two were from outside the Northern Territory. So euthanasia tourism is clearly a concern because the act has no residency requirement, and we received a good deal of evidence about that.
Several submissions drew attention to the problems in the jurisdictions overseas, particularly in the Netherlands and in Oregon. The Festival of Light Australia pointed out some of those concerns. I do not have to go into them today, but I did want to make the comment that the overseas experience certainly persuaded us against supporting this legislation put forward by Senator Brown. From a personal point of view, I certainly believe in the protection of human life and the sanctity of human life, and I think that all Australians, no matter what colour, what shape or what size, deserve respect and dignity. I know that view is held by many in this chamber and throughout this great country.
In conclusion, I want to thank the secretariat, in particular Peter Hallahan, Sophie Power and Hannah Jones, for their wonderful work and the professionalism with which they pulled together this report. We thank them very much for their assistance. Finally, I want to thank the many witnesses who appeared before our committee in Sydney and also in Darwin and for the submissions that were made to our committee.",SENATE,<title>RIGHTS OF THE TERMINALLY ILL (EUTHANASIA LAWS REPEAL) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Affairs</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2008-06-26,"—I would like to congratulate Senator Brown for bringing forward the Rights of the Terminally Ill (Euthanasia Laws Repeal) Bill 2008. I think it is a very important issue that needs more debate. As I indicated in my personal comments in the report, Senator Brown’s bill is quite similar, if not the same, to one put forward by Senator Allison not so long ago. I would also have to say that I do not agree with either of them. A majority of the committee did have the view that the bill should not proceed, but for differing reasons. As a reflection of the fact that this is a conscience vote matter, it is appropriate that the committee not have a majority and a minority report but simply reflect the evidence and some of our individual views. It was a short inquiry, and this is a very short debate on what is a big issue regarding one of the most fundamental aspects of human life, which is the enormity and mystery of death.
Just briefly on the issue of Territory rights, as I reflect in my additional comments, I have a lot of sympathy for that. I very much understand how infuriating it must be for Territorians to be potentially able to be overridden on any matter. Nobody likes that. But if you are going to apply that principle, I think you have to apply it universally, not just to arguments and issues that you agree with. Unless people want to simultaneously argue that Northern Territory land rights laws should also be handed over to the Territory then I think you have to set that argument aside. I do support statehood for the Territory. I do think we would be better off having a national framework for euthanasia in which all Australians, whatever state or territory they live in, live with the same overarching framework and standards. That is the way I would like to see the debate go.
The issue of euthanasia itself is vexed and complex. I get frustrated with how advocates from both sides of the debate sometimes present it in what I think is an oversimplistic or a polarised way. I do not accept at all the suggestion that those who are opposed to it are all religious zealots with no concern at all for human suffering, imposing their religious values on other people, versus the other view—which we have just heard put a little bit by Senator Barnett—that advocates of euthanasia have no respect for human life and no consideration of human dignity. I think everybody has concern for human dignity and the sanctity of life; they just view it differently in terms of how our laws should interpret that and where you balance the competing values involved.
The issue of human dignity is a big one for advocates of euthanasia, as it is for all sides. The concern for human suffering and the concern for the vulnerable also apply to those who are opposed to euthanasia. As I say in my comments, I am supportive of the principles behind the arguments put forward by advocates of euthanasia, but I am apprehensive about whether they can be adequately and safely legislated for without leaving vulnerable people in an even more vulnerable situation.
I recall a well-respected disability advocate—a person on the progressive side of the spectrum, not your stereotypical so-called religious zealot—saying to me that they were very concerned about the potential change in attitudes that comes with euthanasia where a right to die that can be effectively and safely implemented by people who are powerful and well-resourced could potentially become an expectation or almost a duty to die for the powerless, for the disabled and for those who are seen as marginalised. I do not in any way suggest that is what euthanasia advocates hope to see, but I think they are potential issues.
I was very impressed with the evidence that Dr Nitschke gave in Darwin. I thought he was very clear and consistent in the evidence and in the argument he put forward. I do think there is too much loose language here for what is such an important, fundamental and complex issue. To just have vague language and sloganeering is not good enough, certainly when it comes to looking at laws. You can make your broad case, but when you are looking at what laws we pass that is not good enough. That is why I think we need to de-polarise the debate and accept there are valid issues and valid concerns on both sides, and it needs to be far more nuanced. As I said, I have apprehension about whether euthanasia could be safely implemented, but I would like to see it if it could be done. I am not religious at all, so that is not the issue for me.
I am someone who has examined issues of depression and suicide, and the causes behind them. Euthanasia is a form of suicide and is one that a lot of people think is a positive form, and that is why they usually do not use the word ‘suicide’. We think of suicide, quite rightly, as a bad thing. (Extension of time granted) If we are using language such as a right to die and the right to have assistance to die then it is a big shift for people who think regularly about whether or not they want to die—not because they have a terminal illness but because they are just contemplating whether they want to end their life. We need to think about that more fully and debate that more fully. That is why I think bills like this are desirable, so we can have that debate and explore those issues in a more nuanced and deeper way. I hope the future Senate does that.",SENATE,<title>RIGHTS OF THE TERMINALLY ILL (EUTHANASIA LAWS REPEAL) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Affairs</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-06-26,"—I will be proceeding with the Rights of the Terminally Ill (Euthanasia Laws Repeal) Bill 2008, but it will be in the form of restoring the rights of the territories, if it were to pass both houses of parliament—and I am confident that it will pass both houses of parliament. I thank Senator Crossin, all members of the committee and all people who have helped with it, including those who have made submissions. The committee has cleared doubts about the way in which the bill should proceed, and that is the function of a committee. It shows the Senate working well, and I will move to progress the bill, adopting the recommendations that Senator Crossin has put forward. They are, effectively, to restore the rights of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory to legislate for death with dignity, because the peoples of those territories and their elected representatives ought not to have had that right taken away from them—it should be restored.
The legal evidence to the committee, including that from the Northern Territory Law Reform Commission, was that had the bill proceeded as I had brought it to the Senate, it may, in fact, have entrenched the euthanasia laws in the Northern Territory, without the assembly having the ability to rescind it. My primary intention here is to give the territory the right to make the determination either way, and the same for the Australian Capital Territory. I will amend the bill accordingly, if the Senate permits, and it will proceed to be debated in the Senate and the House of Representatives in the coming months.
There is a lot of structured confusion about the content of the legislation—euthanasia and the rights of territories to legislate, which is the primary intent of the bill. I want to talk about that for a moment. Senator Barnett and his fellow Liberals said that the bill should not proceed under any circumstances. What an extraordinary statement; that the Senate should not have a discussion about the rights of territories, let alone euthanasia. What an extraordinary prospect, coming from those three senators, that this Senate should be not be debating any matter brought before it by a senator, or any piece of legislation. That needs to be treated with the contempt that it deserves.
The proposal from Family First went one step further, and I note Senator Fielding is going to speak next. It took up with the Australian Christian Lobby, which is not related to any church but has that name. It said that the territories, which represent relatively small numbers of people, should not pass laws on such contentious issues as euthanasia. Really? When you look at the argument that is brought forward, Family First believes the Australian parliament does have a legitimate role in overturning the Northern Territory’s euthanasia laws and in preventing the territories from making laws on euthanasia. Of course, the logic is that it has a legitimate role in reversing that. But we get a denial on that matter from the four senators who have a different position.
The argument is that the Senate or the parliament should not force the availability of legal euthanasia on all Australians; it should not force options. What an extraordinarily dictatorial, antipublic point of view this is. Let me, again, make this very clear: this bill will proceed. I will move it to be amended according to the chair’s suggestion so that we can debate in this parliament the rights of the territories to legislate in this matter. Separately, I also intend to look at the matter that Senator Bartlett is talking about—that is, the wherewithal of the Commonwealth vis-a-vis the states and territories to legislate for the option of euthanasia to be brought to the Australian people. The last poll showed that Australians want the right to have the option of death with dignity by 80 per cent to 14 per cent. Senator Bartlett said that all Australians deserve dignity, but then inherently says that he withdraws that right of Australians when it comes to their dying process.
Like the Netherlands, like Belgium, like Oregon and, indeed, like the Northern Territory back in 1995, that is an option that ought to be available to Australians. It is inevitable. There is legislation before the Victorian parliament at the moment that has great legitimacy. The Australian people want this, but here we have senators saying that it should not even be debated in this parliament. It shows timidity, a failure of logic, and an insecurity in the ability to be able to argue both the matters of territory rights and euthanasia in this great parliament. That is the role of this great parliament, and this bill will proceed to be debated in this place and, hopefully, in the House of Representatives.",SENATE,<title>RIGHTS OF THE TERMINALLY ILL (EUTHANASIA LAWS REPEAL) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Report of Legal and Constitutional Affairs</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-06-26,"—Family First opposes euthanasia and believes that people with suicidal thoughts do not need lethal help but need life-saving assistance. The Rights of the Terminally Ill (Euthanasia Laws Repeal) Bill 2008 is intended to overturn the federal government’s ban on both the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory having laws to allow euthanasia. It also aims to reinstate the Northern Territory’s 1995 euthanasia law.
Legalised euthanasia puts pressure on vulnerable people who feel they have to justify their existence because they know their continued illness is putting strain on family and friends. The euthanasia law, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995, operated in the Northern Territory for nine months from 1996 to 1997 and during that time four people died by lethal injection.
Family First is concerned that there were a number of instances where what were supposed to be safeguards in the Northern Territory’s euthanasia law were ignored, calling into question the safety and effectiveness of the legislation. For example, there was a requirement in the legislation that doctors certify that a patient was terminally ill before the patient could receive a lethal injection, but the legislation did not say what should happen if the doctors had differing opinions. In one particular case in the Northern Territory’s experience with euthanasia, the evidence provided by palliative care expert Professor Kissane was that one oncologist gave their patient’s prognosis as nine months but a dermatologist and a local oncologist judged that she was not terminally ill. There was no system in the legislation to deal with disagreements between doctors, so the particular person received a lethal injection despite the possibility that they were not terminally ill.
There was also a requirement under the legislation for a psychiatrist to have confirmed that ‘the patient is not suffering from a treatable clinical depression in respect of the illness’ as one of the conditions before the medical practitioner was allowed to give the patient a lethal injection. But this was also seen as another hurdle to clear, with Dr Nitschke saying of the four people who died by lethal injection:
All of them showed aspects of depression, and that, to my mind, was entirely expected. Ultimately, the question—and this was not brought out in the Lancet article—was: does that mean that they were so debilitated by that psychic condition that they had lost the ability to make rational thought?
This, of course, is contrary to the legislation and common sense on what depression does to people. To quote one journal article, the interest of depressed people in euthanasia is because they ‘often focus on the worst possible outcomes and are impaired by apathy, pessimism and low self-esteem’. They are not in a position to make good decisions, whatever you think of euthanasia. The danger with all legislation is that it can be seen as a list of requirements to overcome rather than protection against the abuse of patients or against mistakes. In this case, those seeking euthanasia could try multiple doctors until they find enough signatures to meet the requirements.
The Northern Territory’s nine-month experience with euthanasia demonstrated that the so-called safeguards in the legislation were not effective in protecting vulnerable people from a lethal injection. It caused fear in the Territory’s Aboriginal community. The Northern Territory’s euthanasia act should not be revived and the Senate should not support this legislation.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-06-26,"—With your guidance, do I need to seek leave?
 (Senator Hutchins)—You do not need my guidance at all. You can go for your life.
—I can go for my life?
—You’re obviously not going to be called a sensitive new-age guy.
—A new-age girl, maybe. I rise to speak in relation to this proposition that we finally—can I say with some sense of pride—see an approval going through both houses of parliament to provide a childcare facility in this building. Ten years ago this week, in fact, I stood in this chamber for the first time and gave my first speech. I had my family with me and little Kate was two years and three months old. I was still breastfeeding at the time. I had this to say:
I put on the record that it is unfortunate that there are no child-care facilities in this building for a politician like me. It may well be one of the reasons limiting the capacity of women to enter this arena.
From the moment I put those words down in Hansard, I decided that I would spend my time in this place developing a campaign and pushing for some recognition that a childcare centre would benefit not just politicians—in fact, not politicians at all—but the many thousands of families, women and men, who work in this place. I came to realise their life would be much easier if in fact there was a childcare centre within the building. So I embarked on a quest to see if I could realise that ambition.
My research of the history books tells me that in an article in a newspaper some 25 years ago this was said:
After months of apparent inaction, the new Parliament House may get a creche.
Senator Pat Giles, a fantastic Labor senator from Western Australia, was quoted as saying:
“We have been frustrated about the whole thing”—
Can I say, Senator Giles, tell me about it—
the head of the caucus committee on the status of women said yesterday. A commitment had been given in 1983 that there would be provision made for childcare in the new building.
Jumping to 1986, Senator Powell asked of the minister representing the then Prime Minister here in the Senate whether they could inform the Senate if the original plans for the new Parliament House, which did not provide for child-minding facilities, had been changed to make such provision. Of course, a couple of days later this was the answer:
The Joint Standing Committee, through a special sub-committee, considered the question of a childcare facility within the precincts of the New Parliament House. I am advised the JSC has decided that no childcare facility will be provided within the precincts.
So I am not the only one who has been on a quest to ensure that we have some family-friendly provisions within this building; it emanated many years before I entered this chamber. In 1988, a Parliamentary Zone survey was conducted by the Parliament House childcare committee. It surveyed workers in Parliament House, the National Library and the National Gallery and found that 83 places could be taken up if available. Funding of $0.7 million was included in the National Capital Development Commission’s 1988-89 capital works program.
We then go to 1989, when the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House recommended approval of a centre, but four senators at that time presented a minority report. In December 1989, the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House recommended the establishment of a community based childcare facility adjacent to the provisional Parliament House, and that year a community based childcare centre catering for 40 places was due to open next to the Forrest Primary School. Since my day, of course, the recommendation has been made to many people who have worked in this House that they use that Forrest childcare centre, but that did not quite go to the nub of what people were actually looking for.
Moving on to childcare issues in Canberra in 1992, the CSIRO were in the process of completing a childcare centre at Black Mountain and the ATO became the first public sector organisation to reach an industrial agreement regarding the provision of childcare for staff. Going on, we see that even the new Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade building has a childcare centre, which is dedicated to staff that specifically work there.
In 2000, I started to convene informal meetings of people in this House who might be interested in pursuing the issue of childcare facilities at Parliament House. Certainly, these meetings had no structure and had no legal standing within this parliament; nonetheless, we got together. At that time, Senator Woodley of the Democrats was still in this place and was very supportive of this move. I place on record my appreciation of the work of Consie Larmour from Senator Kate Lundy’s office and Meg Martin, who with a number of us—including, of course, Senator Lundy—have vigorously pursued the quest to have a childcare centre in this place. Mike Bolton from the Joint House Department joined us at that time, and we finally managed to convince the Joint House Department to hire a consultant, Prue Warrilow, from Families At Work. However, again we had another survey. It seems that the path this childcare centre has taken in Parliament House has been step by step and survey by survey. If my memory serves me right, that survey showed that at that time this place could support a childcare centre for at least 95 places.
We did make some gains, though. In 1994, the former Spouses Lounge on the House of Representatives side of the building was converted to a child-friendly family lounge. That was not really the same as a childcare centre; you could send your children there and they could be occupied throughout the day—unsupervised, though, unless you were there with them. It was suitable for children of various ages, but it did not quite hit the mark in terms of what was needed in this place.
Nevertheless, we pursued and continued. My informal reference group met from time to time, with invitations being extended to people like Joe Hockey, who, I have to place on record, was a great supporter of this campaign, and Jackie Kelly, who, as we know, also jumped on board and started to push for this campaign. We have been down to the DFAT childcare facility and we have looked at the one at Forrest. With Maggie Barnes from the Joint House Department, I have walked this building looking at potential spaces where a childcare centre could be built. We have talked about having a childcare centre in one section of the ministerial car park and we have talked about locating a childcare centre out near the tennis courts on the House of Representatives side.
However, finally, a couple of years ago, we got down to the serious business of really looking at what sort of space was available inside this House and what we would need in square metres per child, because any childcare centre established here needs to comply with the ACT regulations and guidelines. We did home in on a few places—the old staff bar and the back of the staff canteen. Of course, you will know now that we finally decided on renovating the old staff bar. We know that it will take children only of up to 18 months and that it will have only 22 places. We would like to see the provision for at least a 75-place centre in this building, but that is never going to happen, because we literally do not have the space. Back when the building was designed—and I can only imagine there were very, very few women in parliament at that time—there was very little prospect of ever thinking that there would be women in this parliament who would one day need a childcare centre. It was not on the radar and it was not on the agenda—or, if it was, it was completely dismissed out of hand.
But we move on. We have had debates about whether or not this parliament and this workplace should be paying for such a facility. We have had a debate, believe it or not, about whether the clocks that ring in this House would actually wake the babies who were asleep—ably discredited, of course, by the number of members who have had young babies in this place and who have said, ‘Well, it never seemed to wake my little tacker up when the bells went, despite the fact that they were sleeping in my office.’
I sometimes felt at joint house committee meetings that I was taking two steps forward and 32 steps back. But I do want, very sincerely, to place on record my colleagues from across the parties—and also from the national press gallery. There were certainly times when people like Catherine McGrath and Steve Bloom came to me and urged me to keep going. Of course those people, like Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, have had children, and those children have moved well past their need for child care. That is certainly the case in Catherine McGrath’s instance. In my instance, that is the case. Kate is now 12 and enjoying a day at Questacon today. Nevertheless, I always knew that this was going to be a long, hard struggle, but it was something that we could put in place for people in the future.
I have a vivid memory of gathering people together, when the campaign became increasingly frustrating, and urging them to bring their babies and partners into this house. There were many delightful photos taken of young babies crawling up and down Senate committee tables, to press the point that putting your young child on a committee table was not acceptable in this day and age and that really staff in this place were looking for the recognition that, to balance their life, family and work commitments in this house, they needed a childcare facility.
I am specifically talking here about people in Hansard, people in the Parliamentary Library—and I must pay tribute to Glenda James for the research work and the work that she did in our campaign to get this established—and the many staff who work in the committees and particularly in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. So do not be under any illusion here that this is a childcare centre for politicians; it is clearly not. In fact, of the 20 or 22 places, I think, in the coming year, I will be surprised if four or five politicians take one up. Hopefully, Catherine King might be lucky enough to be able to put her new baby in there next year to make her life a little bit easier. But this was always about providing a childcare centre for the staff who work here: security staff, Hansard, DPS staff, committee staff—everybody except us, essentially. It was not about us as politicians; it was about finally recognising that this Parliament House, in this country, needs to be at the leading edge as a workplace that recognises the needs of families in this place, the needs of working mums and working dads, in having on hand their child at their workplace.
It was also about acknowledging the very crucial role that breastfeeding plays in the early weeks and months of a child’s developing life. Not everyone can stay at home with a young baby, and not everyone wants to stay at home with a young baby, but we should be a country that encourages women to breastfeed. When we have a childcare centre in this place and women choose to come back to work when their child is six months, nine months or 12 months old and they are still breastfeeding, they will be able to go down to that centre and continue to feed their child in that way. This should be the pre-eminent place in our nation that encourages breastfeeding and encourages a work-life balance and now, finally, it recognises the role of having child care in the workplace.
I am incredibly proud today to be able to stand up and speak to this approval motion. But I also want, as I said, to place on record the large number of people who have been on my email distribution list and who have been at the end of my phone calls—and I apologise to the people in the Joint House Department who occasionally had to deal with, perhaps, my wrath as I continually put this on the agenda. Senator Jacinta Collins, for example, was one of those people who were part of that campaign. She has actually gone from the Senate and come back again. Finally, though, we will now have a childcare centre.

Senator Webber interjecting—

—No, she does not have any young children now, but she would have been one of those people who would have benefited back then. Tanya Plibersek is another one, and I know Joe Hockey is another. I know there are a number of politicians from both sides. But it is not about the politicians in this place. It is about the other people who support the life of this parliament 24/7 and who need the support of this childcare centre, as I said, so they can put their young children there and continue to breastfeed. I also want to place on record your support, Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, in this campaign. It has been a bipartisan campaign, and I am so pleased to be able to say that we have reached the end of it.
However, I do want to give one final warning and fire this shot across the bow. We have got 22 places. The centre is for children under the age of 18 months. So now we look forward to the next campaign, which is to finally extend that to a 75- or 95-place centre very close to Parliament House. As I said, it cannot be built inside, but it will have to be around National Circle or State Circle. I reckon there is plenty of land out there in the bush to build a purpose-built childcare centre so that, if people cannot get access to their child inside the building, it is less than a couple of minutes walk away. That is the next phase of our campaign, and I look forward to starting that. I congratulate everyone who has been involved in getting this to this stage and, as I have always said, I look forward to cutting the ribbon on the first cot that is placed in that childcare centre early next year.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2008-06-26,"—I just want to put on record that, while many of us are very pleased to have Senator Trish Crossin’s acknowledgement, she has been very generous. I think it needs to be recorded once again in the Hansard and for all to see that Senator Trish Crossin has done more than any other individual, certainly in contemporary times, to make this a reality. My child is also at Questacon today, like Kate. Had Katie been here today, she would have been a very clear reminder of the fact that she, a 12-year-old, was two when Trish started this campaign.
Senator Crossin, you deserve to be applauded for this, and I look forward to seeing you cut that ribbon—although maybe I will not be here. The only point I was going to make was one that you picked up at the end, relating to breastfeeding. Obviously you have put on record the clear association between breastfeeding and mothers being able to be close to their children. I think that perhaps the Senate should take a leaf out of the House of Representatives’ book today in relation to breastfeeding and consider implementing a process of pairs, because it ain’t easy. That is one thing I would have liked to have seen rectified before I left this place, but I am sure that there are many women in the future who could benefit from that particular change. I say to Trish and the many other people she has acknowledged: well done. I think it is incredibly symbolic that this Parliament House, built only 20 years ago, failed to have a childcare facility. I know my former colleague the late Janine Haines had something to say about that. I know it has been a cross-party effort, but bravo Trish and the many others who have been involved. This is a historic occasion, but I look forward to, as Senator Crossin said, the next phase. I think all men and women in this place should play a role in it.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,Parliamentary Zone,18,1,speech
"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I would like to briefly take this moment to also commend Senator Crossin on the work that she has put into this issue over a very lengthy period of time. Sitting up in my office just now, I was pleased to hear her go through the very long history that has been involved in establishing this centre. Indeed, I look forward now to the possibility of using it for my grandchild rather than for my own children. That is how long this history has been. Senator Crossin did not go into the full details about the difficulty of accessing child care in Canberra. Senator Stott Despoja has covered some of the breastfeeding issues, but there is a far broader range of issues about accessing child care and services relevant for members and senators with children that relates to the nature of our work, the amount of time we spend away from home and the hours which we work. Some of those issues have been accommodated for public servants working for organisations such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but there had never really been any effort in the past to deal with those issues as they relate to members and senators.
Senator Crossin and Senator Stott Despoja, I am sure, would reinforce the point that as politicians we are not looking for any special treatment or any additional funding to meet our own personal costs in relation to childcare arrangements. But we do need services that will be accessible, given the nature of our work. The very first point made to me about accessing child care when I came here—I was pregnant with my son James, who is now 12—was that there was indeed a centre at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. My first inquiry at that centre was met with, firstly, ‘We’re full,’ and, secondly, ‘We only take full-time places.’ By ‘full-time places’, they meant paying for a childcare place that you used 50 weeks of the year. We are not here 50 weeks of the year, and the arrangements just would not suit. I look forward to some of those flexibilities being incorporated in our new centre. As Senator Crossin indicated, it will only be available for children up to the age of 18 months. But from experience I have discovered that, by the time your child is around that 18-month stage, there are often many more reasons why you make arrangements back home to better suit their needs. Certainly we will need arrangements to accommodate our needs beyond the 18-month stage. It may be a bit less critical that the facility actually be in Parliament House itself, but I look forward to joining other senators in the campaign to improve services for children over 18 months of age as well.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>PARLIAMENTARY ZONE</title>,<title>Approval of Works</title>,Parliamentary Zone,18,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-06-26,"—I rise to make some more remarks, because I am still waiting for the government to answer my questions on this. I will keep asking them until I get the Minister for Climate Change and Water in here to answer them. We were told yesterday by Senator Conroy that this bill does not put environmental constraints around these tax deductions for so-called carbon sinks. That relies on the minister for climate change setting the guidelines. We are told: ‘Buy a pig in a poke. Just vote for this now, and you will get guidelines later which will tell you whether or not these trees can be cut down.’ It defies common sense to say that you get a tax deduction for planting a carbon sink, but there is no requirement for it to stay in the ground. It is clear to me that the wording has been done very carefully. All you have to do is say at the time you plant it, ‘I intend for it to be a carbon sink.’ After that, you can change your mind or sell it to somebody else who does not have the same intention.
There is a line in the explanatory memorandum which says that you do not have to have any connection with the land to be able to benefit from this. That is clearly for the coal industry, the aviation industry, the cement industry—everyone who wants to offset their carbon rather than reduce emissions at the source. But it was also very clear to me that this is a rort for the forest industry. This is MIS on steroids. I have done some more research on that, and I have found that to be true. I have looked at what the Australian Greenhouse Office now accredits as a carbon sink. I can harvest a forest and still generate greenhouse-friendly abatement. You might think, ‘How could it be that, if you cut it down, you still get carbon credits?’ This is somewhat confusing to someone who is trying to reduce emissions. The answer is that you pool your forests and you manage them for a certain volume of carbon. You might plant a thousand hectares of forest. You say, ‘I am managing that for the equivalent of 700 hectares of equivalent carbon.’ Then you go through your forest rotations so that you still get the money for your woodchips, your product, and you get the money for the carbon abatement while those forests are growing. You get to double dip here, and you get the Commonwealth to help you out doing it. They even specifically say that decisions on when to sell carbon could be based on considerations around wood product and carbon prices.
As I said yesterday, you will work out, ‘Wow, the woodchip price is $90 a tonne and carbon is so much a tonne on carbon market, so at the moment it is better to reduce my volume of carbon and go with the chips,’ or it may go the other way. If you are allowed to pool all the managed forests under your control—if you are Gunns, Great Southern or any other company—you have now got a scheme which gives you double the money for nothing, essentially. This is outrageous and it will drive people off the land. Senator Conroy told us yesterday, and I will just read it out from the explanatory memorandum:
The Climate Change Minister must, by legislative instrument, make guidelines about environmental and resource management in relation to carbon sink forests.
So the minister has to make these guidelines for the management of these forests. I just want a simple answer from the government to this question: do you intend to make the guidelines the same guidelines as those currently in this greenhouse abatement accreditation scheme? If you do, it is nonsense. We are not going to get an increased take-up of carbon; we are just going to get a double whammy for the forest industry—a double whammy in the sense of a double bonus for the forest industry because it is money for jam for them.
I would also like to put on the record a letter from the Mayor of King Island. I draw this particularly to the attention of Senators Abetz, Barnett, Polley, Carol Brown, Sherry, Watson, Bushby, Parry, O’Brien and Colbeck. You are the 10 Tasmanian senators apart from Senator Bob Brown and I. The Mayor of King Island has written this:
I am the Mayor of King Island. We were able to fend off the planting of forest trees on our grazing lands some two years ago. We realised that the risk of having plantation forests for harvesting as chips or logs would be low due to the heavy infrastructure costs and the remoteness of our island. The matter of MIS schemes for the planting of trees as carbon rebates is another matter. The experience of Kangaroo Island causes us to take up the cudgel to protect our island. The King Island brand is very dependent on the maintenance of the areas of agricultural land available at this time. We are unable to replace any lands lost to forests as we have a very finite boundary to our island. To lose the King Island product due to the inability of the population to support itself is not a tenable idea and would be stupid. We only exist because of the quality of our product, which allows an adequate return to compensate for our remoteness and the added costs of transporting these products to market. All of our products are value added by industries on the island which will be lost.
Kind regards,
Charles Arnold.
That is the Mayor of King Island putting it absolutely on the record specifically for those 10 senators to listen to. If you do this, you will destroy the King Island brand because there will not be a critical mass of people left on the island to sustain the industries. I do not want any of you standing up in Tasmania and putting out press releases saying how bad this is, that it should not have happened, that you did not know it was going to happen and so on. I am telling you now. The Mayor of King Island is telling you now. In this Senate, I am showing you now that the guidelines are not in place and there is nothing to stop these trees being cut down and managed as a pool by the forest industry, the coal industry, the airlines or anybody else. You know what you are doing.
I also want to say that people have stood up in here and said it is a rort. Senator Heffernan in particular described it as bottom-of-the-harbour scheme and as a rort. He knows full well that it is a rort. The Nationals know it is a rort; they have stood up and said so. We have the numbers in this Senate today to stop this rort, if the people who recognise it is a rort get rid of it. But no, that is not going to happen because those for the forest industry—Senator Abetz; Malcolm Turnbull; the member for Wentworth, and others; Senator Minchin is no doubt amongst them—are in there saying the Liberal Party will vote for this rort. That is what is going on. They will vote for it today. They will knock out my amendments which require mixed species and require the trees to be in the ground, even though the government has not said, and will not say, you cannot cut down the trees, because they intend the trees to be cut down through managed investment schemes. There will be pooling of trees by the forest industry under your very own greenhouse abatement program scheme to manage pooled forests.
As I have said time and time again, there is nothing here at all—and I would like to know from Senator Wong why there is not—about a rebate for protecting standing carbon stores. If the government is serious, why don’t we have that in there? All we have got is a tax bill and another rort for the forest industry. It is a rort for people who just want to put in the trees, get the tax deduction and sell or lease them to somebody else who can then decide what they want to do with them—whether they want to manage them for carbon or logging or both. It is not putting any pressure on the coal industry or the airlines to reduce their emissions to just say, ‘Let’s plant the trees and offset them over time.’ You think about the volume of emissions we are talking about that need to be offset. If those coal-fired power stations cannot get their emissions down at the source—carbon capture and storage is nowhere to be seen and will not be here for 20 years—they will have to take up hundreds of thousands of hectares of land to go anywhere near it because, when these trees are planted, they have got virtually no carbon in them. It is going to take years to get any kind of volume of carbon. To get anything like it, you need hundreds of thousands of hectares of agricultural land, and that will be agricultural land with water. They will buy water rights and land.
I think it is disgraceful that the minister for climate change is not here confirming for this Senate that these trees can be cut down, that there is no requirement for them not to be cut down and that they will allow them to be managed by forest companies in conjunction with their plantations for fibre. I want to put very clearly on the record that I have no confidence whatsoever in the minister for climate change setting guidelines that will guarantee these are carbon sinks into the future, nor do I have any confidence whatsoever that we are going to see permanent carbon reductions because of this. There will be no plantings on marginal land because the trees will not grow on marginal land. The only land these plantations are going to go on is land with water, where the trees will grow, and that will take it out of agricultural production.
Let us be very clear: the contempt of the Senate being shown by the government is real. Senator Conroy has not answered the questions. Senator Wong, the Minister for Climate Change and Water, even though she is the one who will set the guidelines, has not come here and said anything about it. I bet she does not even know herself what the guidelines are going to be, and what she will revert to will be these foolhardy guidelines in this Greenhouse Friendly Forest Sink Abatement Projects Scheme they have going. And if anybody thinks that people around the country are going to take this scheme seriously as being a reduction in carbon emissions, they have another think coming. It is not worth the paper it is written on, to be frank, as an abatement scheme. Get real and have an abatement scheme for protecting standing vegetation, standing native forests. Then we will start talking about real carbon sinks.
I would like to have an explanation from the government on those matters. Are the guidelines that the government is talking about the guidelines that are in this current scheme? Yes or no, Minister Wong? Where are you, Minister Wong? Are these the guidelines? Because they allow for them to be cut down. That is all there is to it. A rort is going through this parliament. The Liberal and Labor parties know it is a rort going through this parliament, and they are going to sit and let it go through. And if anyone is stupid enough to think that we are going to be pacified by the promise of some sort of inquiry after the event, don’t insult our intelligence. Once it is law, it is law. The opportunity is here today to knock it off, to kill it, to end this rort. If you do not do that then you do not have the courage of your convictions and it is your intention to drive people off the land, to take land out of agricultural production—and there is nothing else that can be said for it. I would like someone from the government—there is not even anyone in the chamber; there is only Senator Webber sitting on the government benches.
—No, Senator Conroy is over there.
—Oh, Senator Conroy has just wandered back into the chamber. Could Senator Conroy please tell me now: can these trees be cut down? Can they?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-06-26,"—I think it is appalling that the minister who is responsible for this is outside the chamber when this highly contentious piece of legislation is coming forward. I acknowledge what Senator Milne has said. I also acknowledge that the reality here today is that we do not have the numbers to stop it; we have to come up with—
—Well, we do—
—No, we don’t. We have to come up with a solution that keeps this issue ventilated, with a process that actually takes it forward. I would be only too happy to cross the floor—but to what effect? There would be me and, I imagine, a couple of others and the Greens, and the issue would be lost. I believe there is a genuine sense of concern as we go forward. I am hoping that Senator Ronaldson in due course will talk to an inquiry to deal with this issue. In dealing with this issue we will get a chance to further ventilate this issue and to flesh this issue out further so that we can change the law—because the law has already passed, unfortunately.
I acknowledge also that we have the capacity today to reach back into that law if it were the wish of the majority of the chamber—that is very important: if it were the wish of the majority of the chamber—to change the law. But it is quite evident that the wish of the majority of the chamber is not there. So you have to be honest and practical and, in trying to deal with the farmers who have a concern with this, come up with a solution that actually takes them forward in some way, shape or form. To do anything else may be a pious amendment; it may be a Pyrrhic victory. I am only too prepared to do that, if it were not for the chance out there that you do have the potential to go forward and deal with this issue in another way. That is what my responsibility is here today. And I imagine it is the same for the responsibility of others.
It is self-evident. Why on earth are we going to give a tax deduction to coal companies, who are receiving record prices and record returns, to go out there, buy agricultural land that is currently supplying the Australian supermarkets with cheap product, so that they can get a tax deduction and the Australian consumer can pay more for food? It is an absolute no-brainier. How on earth can this have come forward? There is an amendment I have tabled, which I will have to withdraw, to hold an inquiry. That talks about strengthening the guidelines specifically for that. I acknowledge fully that, even if I did go forward with the amendment, it would not get up because it does not have the numbers.
So how do we progress the issue in such a manner so that we have an inquiry, so that we have a proper ventilation of this issue, so that we have the capacity to clearly explain to the Australian community and get away from the technicalities of talking about a TLAB bill to a situation where we are talking about the price of food in the supermarket, the economies of local towns, the capacity for certain mills to stay viable, and the problems that MISs are causing from the Murray River up to Tully? To try to properly deal with it, these issues have to be further ventilated. If there were a move today against the numbers then the issue would die today. But we must continue to pursue the issue.
When the amendment comes forward I propose to withdraw my amendment on the premise that an inquiry will come forward. I am hoping to hear about a foreshadowed inquiry. That is extremely important. There are issues. I think that, as people become genuinely and further engaged with this issue—we have only had about three days of good oxygen on this—and we get a further inquiry into this, over a period of time, we have a better chance to do something about it. However, I also clearly put on the record that, if this inquiry turns into a farce, if it turns into something that is not taken seriously, if it turns into a tick-and-flick show, then, if other instances occur in the future where people need our support, it might be a little harder to come by.
Government senators interjecting—
—Senator Conroy, what I want to know from you is: why on earth isn’t Senator Wong here today? It is her piece of legislation. What is going on? As you are here, we need to have some of these issues explained. Yesterday you said that land was not going to be part of the deductible expenses; however, the legislation clearly states in section 40-10: ‘capital expenditure for the establishment of trees in carbon sink forests’. There are two forms of account: capital account and income account. Income account relates to recurring expenses; capital account is for such things as land. If I read this legislation in its purest form, I would say: ‘Capital expenditure is the purchase of land. I purchase the land for establishing the trees; it must be deductible.’ If it is not, the government is going to have say so in the legislation. It is no good saying that land is not capital—because land is capital. These are the sorts of issues that have great consequence in this legislation.
We are receiving calls from all around the place from people who have serious concerns about this legislation. I imagine that, with those calls coming in, the people who have made them will want their time at an inquiry to ventilate their opinions as to why this issue is important. I look forward to hearing about the foreshadowed inquiry. If it occurs, it will provide the best opportunity for us to look at this issue. The numbers are not with us in the chamber; quite evidently the numbers are against us today. We have to come up with a better alternative to take this issue forward.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2008-06-26,"—I would like to have an answer to the question on capital. The young fellows in the box, near the minister, might be able to provide that to him. As I said yesterday, it is regrettable that, last week, a piece of seriously flawed legislation slipped under the radar of this parliament. We are in a difficult position, but I am confident that the government, the opposition and the other parties in the Senate are aware of the flaws in the bill. I am hopeful that, with some goodwill and in the interests of a better Australia, we can fix this legislation by giving oxygen to the issues of concern. There are fundamental issues to be dealt with here. This is a classic example: the idea of a carbon sink rings the bell. We have rung the bell before we have sorted out how to implement it. The legislation in its present form is, without a doubt, putting the cart before the horse. We do not know the price at which carbon will be traded in the offset market. Also, the higher the price for carbon, the better the class of land that will be used for it. As a practising farmer, I am not going to bother growing a crop of wheat when I can get as much as I would from that from leasing my land to someone who will get a carbon offset from the gross emissions of a power station somewhere; I will go off to the Gold Coast and lie on the beach. That would be the attitude of farmers. You try and make the most out of your land, and, if it is not growing food, why worry about food?
This is just crazy. The legislation in its present form is a raid on the prime agricultural lands of Australia. I remind the chamber that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says in black and white that, in 50 years time, 50 per cent of the world’s population is going to be short of water; one billion people will be unable to feed themselves; and—note—30 per cent of the productive land of Asia will go out of production due to climate change. Also, 1.6 billion—not million but billion—people could be displaced on this planet, including a large slab of central Africa and northern Asia, and the food task will double. For many years the world has modelled energy but it has not been modelling the food task. The world population is growing from 6.2 billion people to nine billion people. Everyone has been focusing on energy. No-one has been focusing on how you feed them. It is an interesting price signal in the market that in the United States, where everyone expects to fill their Hummer and go down to the supermarket and get the tucker, Wal-Mart have put a restriction on what rice is available. In the future, you will not be worrying about filling the Hummer; you will be worrying about what is in the fridge. Today we are flying in the face of understanding that problem.
This legislation is an attack on farming land—but it can be fixed. This is very distressing for me and for people out there. I have had phone calls about this from people all over Australia. To the people in this chamber, we are pleading with the government to use the democratic process in this parliament to fix this legislation. This legislation is an attack on farming land. We cannot afford to do that. The legislation is full of flaws. I will not bother going through the technical questions—and I see that the minister is tied up in another discussion with his advisers. There are a whole lot of basic questions, and I do not know why they have not been asked. This legislation went to a lot committees and was given the flick because it was considered non-controversial. No-one really looked at it until it turned up here.
—I did. I said it was controversial.
—I have not even been told what the definition of a contract is between the lease owner or the landowner and the person who is looking for a carbon offset. What is the definition of the carbon sink? How long do the trees have to stay in the ground? The land use will relate to the market in carbon offsets. Everyone ought to listen to this: at $17 a tonne—and people are talking about $80 a tonne—every irrigated dairy farmer will be insolvent if we have to participate in such a market. This is serious.
There are a lot of academics out there in academia who would listen to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and I believe there would be some vagary in the science of its predictions. But, even if those predictions are only 10 per cent right, and 160 million people, not 1.6 billion, are displaced, it is still serious. I note that is starting to hit the news now, Senator Milne. The news this morning reported that people are worried about displacement on the planet. Mick Kelty said nine months ago that one of the greatest threats to Australia’s sovereignty is climate change, and that is about displacement. I said something about it and it was misconstrued in the press, ‘Heffernan: Asian invasion’. This is not about some lunatic; it is about reality, and this is an attack on the capacity of Australia to provide for the food task.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-06-26,"—We are dealing with a crucial piece of legislation, and the Greens stand absolutely 100 per cent on the need for this legislation to be put in the rubbish bin where it deserves to go. We have heard arguments from Senators Heffernan and Joyce, and from some other senators, agreeing with that.
The argument we are now getting is that, because the numbers are not with us, we should change our mind, drop the argument and let the legislation go through, and we will have an inquiry afterwards. As all of us from the bush know, closing the stable door after the horse has bolted is not a very effective way of working. I think the good senators from the National Party, and Senator Heffernan, who have argued so cogently against this legislation ought not to allow the sop of an inquiry after the event to alter the fact that this legislation should be voted down.
An amendment is mooted asking for an inquiry and, because this debate will obviously come back this afternoon, I want to give notice that I will be moving that the further consideration of the bill be made an order of the day for the day on which the committee reports. If we are going to have an inquiry, let’s be sensible about this. Let the stakeholders be heard over the winter months, and particularly the farmers of Australia, on the sheer unfairness of legislation which will mean corporations can buy up their land, with massive tax deductions, and use it under a shonky proposal for plantations as carbon sinks, which has no assurance at all, but not get similar tax deductions for keeping that land going and growing food on it.
The arguments that we have heard on this legislation hold 100 per cent: it will displace communities, it will degrade remote and regional communities and it will inevitably end in ownership by city based corporations, through a massive tax lurk, of what would otherwise be productive family owned farms. There is no doubt about that. If there is going to be an inquiry into it, let us hear from rural Australia. Let us hear from the Mayor of King Island who says this will be—I hope I am not misrepresenting him—devastating for that fantastic producer of good foods for Australia. Let us hear from them before we allow this opportunity to change this legislation to pass.
The argument is there that, even if this amendment gets through the Senate to withdraw this schedule, it still has to get through the House. But let us have the authority of a Senate inquiry to convince the government that that should happen. We should have an inquiry and then finally have a vote on this bill. That is the logical, sensible and people-serving way to go in this democracy; otherwise an inquiry becomes a sop and becomes hollow. If we do not take this opportunity, we all know that, with the new Senate further down the line, the government will not entertain this matter in the way it is now doing. If you have an inquiry afterwards, it takes a lot of power from the Senate to fix up this very important matter.
I want to reiterate the argument against this legislation and encapsulate it again. I am grateful to Senator Milne for having alerted the chamber to this matter and, in fact, alerting everybody to it a long time ago. She is another senator from the bush and is very aware of the ramifications of this legislation. Here it is. It is called ‘carbon sink’ legislation, but it is not. It says it will withhold carbon from the atmosphere and that big investors will get huge tax deductions, but it has no guarantees at all attached to it. Senator Milne has moved an amendment which states, ‘If you put the trees in, you’re going to have them there for a bare minimum of 100 years.’ Anybody who knows about the threat of global warming and the massive impact that it will have on farmlands—and, as Senator Heffernan said, on society and the economy—understands that, if you are going to have a carbon sink, it will be beyond our lifetimes. The government and opposition will not support the amendment. That is a deliberated and well thought out admission that this legislation is a shonk. It is feather bedding big, polluting interests in this country who want a greenwash and to get paid for it. It is a false scheme, a sham. They get paid for it out of public money, because that tax is not collected. It is incredible that this legislation has the support of the government and the coalition. I am full of admiration for those senators in the opposition ranks who have pulled up on this and said: ‘This is not right. It is a sham, it is a rort and it is doing the wrong thing by the people in the bush.’
But it is doing the wrong thing by everybody in Australia because it is clearly a well thought out deception to assist already big, wealthy corporations firstly to window-dress and falsely claim they are investing in the world’s future by having guaranteed carbon sinks and secondly to get massive amounts of tax deductions they simply do not deserve. Put those millions of dollars of tax deductions, if you want, into rural health centres, rural schools, rural amenity and helping people stay on their farms.
I read another thing in the international press this week, and I am sure it will hold true in Australia. Everywhere, the impact of corporate takeover of farmlands—of this ‘get big or get out’ thing—is found to be that the food production of the big industrial farmers never matches the food production of the family farm. It simply does not match it in terms of productivity—productivity for the world. As everybody knows in this place, we are facing a global food crisis, and here we are going to compound that. People are going to be paid to take food-producing Australian lands out of production. That is very wrong; it should not be entertained. The opposition has the numbers here now; it is not going to after the winter break. If its leaders are serious about an inquiry, let’s have that inquiry over winter and come back here informed with this option still open to us so that this Senate can deal with it in the most powerful way still available to us.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-06-26,"—I have absolute sympathy for and am in complete agreement with Senator Brown, Senator Milne, Senator Joyce and Senator Heffernan.
—And Family First. Don’t forget Family First!
—And Family First. Take a bit of advice from me, Senator Conroy: we have five minutes to go and this bill will not come to conclusion. If I were you, I would go over and see the Prime Minister during the lunch break and say, ‘Listen, we are on the verge of a tragedy here.’ There is nothing political about this. We are marching down to one of the greatest disasters we are ever going to see. It can be stopped. I suspect it is not being stopped because of some sort of fear among the coalition and the Labor Party—‘If we pull out of here our credentials on climate change will be damaged, so we’ve gotta both march over the cliff like a pack of lemmings’—that there will be a disaster.
Let me address something that Senator Brown said. He said that this is in law; the law is operating as now. Collectively, it went under our radar. It was taken out of T1 and put into another tax package and it slipped under the radar and got through. So it does not matter what we do in this place, we cannot change the law unless the law is changed in the House of Representatives. That is the reality of life. I have seen the Clerk on a number of occasions and have tried to think of ways through this. But, unless you can get support for your amendment in the lower house, then it is not going to work. You can do anything you like—you can scream, you can shout, you can shout it from the hilltops—but it is not going to work.
What we have left is to have a Senate inquiry. It will be up to Barnaby Joyce, Senator Heffernan and me to invite the sugar industry and the banana industry down and to talk to the dairy industry. It will go further than an inquiry, and the inquiry will be as good or as bad as we let it be. I am not a member of that particular committee but I will certainly be a participating member. Senator Joyce and I will go around Queensland saying: ‘Hey, there’s a Senate inquiry. This is your opportunity, your big chance, to stop these managed investment schemes and carbon sinks.’
—For God’s sake get on with the bill!
—That was the Labor Party’s previous representative for primary industries interjecting. No wonder they dumped you like a hot potato! You were sent to the back bench and that is where you deserve to rot if those are your comments on these issues. In Queensland you cannot cut down native vegetation. It is just not allowed. It is banned by state legislation. So where do you have to go to put these carbon sinks? There is only one place to go. You cannot go to Queensland and take down native vegetation; it is all covered by legislation. So you can only go onto prime agricultural land. From a practical point of view, that is where the trees grow fastest and where the water and rainfall are. That is why people are going to go onto prime agricultural land.
Government senators interjecting—
—If you want to scream and shout, I suggest you go to the Prime Minister at lunchtime and start screaming and shouting at him!
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Order! Senator Boswell, resume your seat please. There is too much interruption and interjection across the chamber. Senator Boswell should be heard in silence.
—We have a crisis on our hands. The Greens are right; they are coming at it from a different angle from Senator Joyce, Senator Heffernan and me, but we all arrive at the same point—that it is going to be a disaster. You can prevent that disaster, if you have any feeling for rural and regional Australia. You have heard the debate. You have gone up there and promised various things to the people and then reneged on them when you got into government—you know that. This inquiry will have to be a big inquiry. It will be up to us to make sure this proposition is thoroughly investigated, along with MISs.
I am very sympathetic to the amendment but it will not achieve anything, Senator Brown, because the bill is on foot. It is law now. The only way for your amendment to work would be to carry the Liberal and the Labor parties in a vote—which we are not going to do; we have not got the numbers—and take it over there and get the vote taken in the other place. Practically, that is not going to happen. The next practical thing, and the best thing, we can do is—
—To mobilise the nation.
—to mobilise the people. I can tell you there will not be too many people from North Queensland that will be coming—

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2008-06-26,"—I want to be very brief on this because this bill, the Australian Energy Market Amendment (Minor Amendments) Bill 2008, is a technical amendment to the Australian Energy Market Act 2004. The Commonwealth and all of the states and territories, with the exception of Western Australia, have agreed to introduce legislation known as application acts to apply the national gas law as law in their own jurisdictions. Western Australia will pass complementary legislation to give effect to the NGL rather than applying the NGL established by South Australian law, as is in force from time to time.
In 2007 there was extensive consultation and briefing—this bill is very largely a bill of the coalition, and the passage of the bill was interrupted by the election—of industry participants in the introduction of legislation to amend the AEM Act. The Australian Energy Market Act also amended the TPA to empower several Commonwealth bodies—the Australian Energy Regulator, the National Competition Council and the Australian Competition Tribunal—to perform key functions under the National Gas (South Australia) Act 2007.
The Ministerial Council on Energy has worked cooperatively and diligently since it was established by the coalition in 2001. The council has worked diligently in developing a framework for an efficient and effective national energy market for Australia. The opposition will be cooperating with the government to assist in strengthening the energy reform program under the ministerial council and delivering the economic gains that are available for such reform.
I seek leave to incorporate the balance of my speech. It is very straightforward.
Leave granted.

The remainder of the speech 
 
read as follows—

The bill will make minor amendments to existing Commonwealth legislation that underpins the national regime for the regulation of gas pipeline infrastructure.
Specifically, the bill will amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004, the Australian Energy Market (Gas Legislation) Act 2007, the Administrative Appeals (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (ADJR Act) and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA) to correct the year of enactment of South Australian and Western Australian legislation from 2007 to 2008
The new legislative regime will apply the National Gas Law and National Gas Rules in all participating jurisdictions to create a harmonised national gas access regime.
The South Australian parliament has taken the lead in the development of this legislation which is complemented by the enactment of ‘application legislation’ in all other participating jurisdictions (with the exception of Western Australia). Western Australia which has a stand alone gas network will pass complementary legislation to give effect to the National Gas Law, rather than applying the National Gas Law established by the South Australian law. The legislation will replace the current cooperative Gas Pipelines Access Law and provide crucial incentives for investment in gas pipelines.
The South Australian parliament has agreed, as I understand it, to enact the lead legislation for the regime, the National Gas (South Australia) Act 2008, in the first half of this year. The National Gas Law will be the schedule to that act.
This bill makes minor amendments to the Australian Energy Market Act 2004, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 and the Trade Practices Act 1974 to correct references to the South Australian lead legislation and to Western Australia’s complementary legislation. These amendments will ensure that the Commonwealth’s application legislation correctly applies South Australian and Western Australian legislation in the offshore area, and correctly empowers the Commonwealth bodies under the regime.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-06-26,"—I confirm that the opposition does not oppose the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (International Agreements and Other Measures) Bill 2008. It is a bill that makes amendments to the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986. It gives effect to revised arrangements for entering into agreements with the governments of other countries in relation to payments of pensions and provision of assistance and benefits to eligible persons residing in Australia. It will authorise the use of funds from the CRF for payments to eligible persons. It will enable the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs to enter into agreements with foreign governments of other relevant countries—currently a duty performed by the Governor-General. It extends the period for which the Commonwealth or Australian Federal Police may be considered to be a nuclear test participant for the purpose of the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006. Finally, the bill amends the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to correct minor errors and anomalies in the act.
Therefore, we do not oppose the bill or the measures contained therein, and in particular we welcome schedule 2, dealing with Commonwealth or Federal Police who served at Maralinga, in my state of South Australia. Overall, the bill contains relatively minor amendments, and the EM reports that they have negligible financial impact. But I do want to take this opportunity to echo the comments of the shadow veterans’ affairs minister, Bronwyn Bishop, in the Main Committee that we are concerned by evidence of the government’s attempts to undermine veterans entitlements. On the surface this bill would seem to be non-controversial, but Mrs Bishop, as she said, received a caucus-in-confidence note that talked about the impact of these changes on veterans in relation to schedule 3, part 2, the effect of days worked on compensation. The minister was silent on the anticipated impact of these changes, and this potential savings measure is not stated in the EM, but caucus was duly alerted to the potential negative impact of these measures on veterans entitlements under changes to section 196(3)(c). We do express our concern about that and other evidence of the extent to which the government is placing restraints on veterans entitlements. So, while we do not oppose this bill, we do place on record our concerns with evidence of Labor’s policy in relation to veterans and we, the opposition, put the government on notice that we will be closely monitoring these and future amendments to ensure that veterans do not have their entitlements undermined.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS’ AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2008-06-26,"—As the shadow minister has indicated, this legislation is non-controversial. The Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (International Agreements and Other Measures) Bill 2008 contains minor amendments that will further align the veterans entitlements means test with the social security means test, provide greater flexibility in arrangements with other countries, correct a number of minor errors in the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and extend the eligibility period for Commonwealth Police or Australian Federal Police under the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act 2006.
There are further technical consequential amendments of the Veterans’ Entitlements Act and military rehabilitation matters. Minor changes to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will ensure that widowed partners and incapacitated members receive correct compensation payments to which they are entitled under the MRCA and, in particular, the amendment in relation to the incapacity payments will ensure that a person’s compensation is commensurate with his or her loss of earnings during a part week of incapacity. The Labor government was elected with a commitment to provide robust service assistance support to Australia’s ex-service community, and that commitment includes continuing to review the operation of Australia’s repatriation and military compensation rehabilitation schemes. This legislation will strengthen support in a number of areas to ensure that assistance available through the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio is efficient, effective, equitable and fair.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-06-26,"—The opposition does not oppose the Military Memorials of National Significance Bill 2008, but I do want to take this opportunity to record our criticism of the government in relation to what I think is quite misleading behaviour in relation to this issue. The government claims this bill will provide a mechanism to honour its election promise to declare the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial to be a national memorial. That is in fact not true. It is not what this bill does, and the government is not fulfilling its commitment, because it cannot. This bill creates a new mechanism to enable a memorial located outside the ACT to be recognised as ‘a military memorial of national significance’, not a national memorial as the government said before the election. So this bill in fact confirms the coalition’s position, and Labor now effectively acknowledges that its election commitment cannot in practice be achieved. We condemn the government for misleading the citizens of Ballarat over this matter.
The Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat was completed in February 2004. The names of more than 35,000 POWs from the Boer War through to the Korean War are etched into the memorial, and it is a great tribute to those 35,000. As we know, many Australian prisoners of war did not make it home. Of the 8,400 who died in captivity, 4,000 have no known grave, so this is a very significant memorial and one that the coalition has always supported. The previous coalition government was a strong advocate of the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial at Ballarat, and my colleague Senator Ronaldson, as the then member for Ballarat, announced in 1999 on behalf of our government that Ballarat would be the site of an Australian ex-prisoners of war memorial. The then coalition government allocated half a million dollars towards the memorial, the largest federal government grant allocated to a memorial outside Canberra, and Senator Ronaldson was instrumental in supporting and promoting that concept. In 1999, the then Assistant Treasurer, Senator Rod Kemp, announced that gifts to the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial Fund to the value of $2 or more would be tax-deductible, so our commitment to this memorial is very longstanding and clear.
As I said before, this bill has resulted from a Labor Party election promise to declare this memorial in Ballarat a ‘national memorial’. That is now a promise we know they are effectively abandoning by creating a mechanism to establish this memorial as a memorial of national significance, and we do criticise the government for their grandstanding on this matter in Ballarat. Our position has been clear from day one. The legislative base for declaring a national memorial is the National Memorials Ordinance 1928, which restricts such memorials to being situated in the ACT. What the Labor member for Ballarat and the Labor Party have failed to recognise is that the National Memorials Ordinance 1928 only applies to such national land. This bill does not in fact make the Ballarat memorial a national memorial; by this bill they have introduced a new category to declare the Ballarat memorial a memorial of national significance, which is very different from declaring it a national memorial. Labor in opposition argued there was no legal impediment to declaring this war memorial a national memorial, contrary to our advice, and now that they are in government they understand the basis of our advice and have effectively admitted the error. The introduction of this bill demonstrates obviously that they now agree with our position that it is simply not possible to make memorials outside the ACT national memorials.
Clause 4(1) of this bill provides that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs may declare a memorial to be a military memorial of national significance if certain conditions are met, and those conditions are set out explicitly in the act. Therefore, on that basis we are happy to support this bill, but I felt it necessary to put on the record that the government misled the people of Ballarat prior to the election as to its capacity in government to declare this a national memorial.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-06-26,"—I want to say a couple of words on the Military Memorials of National Significance Bill 2008. I thank Senator Minchin for his kind words but I can assure the chamber that this was a massive community effort and, while I am reluctant to talk about commercial involvement in a project such as this, I do want to pay enormous tribute to the Tattersalls organisation for putting some $1.1 million into this project. Quite frankly I think we should give credit where credit is due: we would not have had this project the way it is unless it were for the involvement of Tattersalls.
I vividly remember Mr Scott from the other place visiting Ballarat when he was Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. When shown the plan, he said: ‘Why are you only doing this? Why aren’t you doing a bit more? Why aren’t you making this bigger?’ He was the inspiration for David Baird OAM, the chairman, who is an ex-POW, and others to go ahead and build this magnificent memorial. It is visited by tens of thousands of people every year. It is a very moving memorial, and I would encourage everyone to see it. I know a number of my colleagues have done so.
It is with reluctance that I talk about this memorial of national significance because I do not want in any way to debase what has been done. But it would be unreasonable to not place on the public record that you cannot go to the people of Ballarat with a notion that they were going to be delivered a national memorial, because that could never have happened. The Prime Minister must have known that that could not have happened. I do not know whether ‘duplicitous’ is the right word. But it is inappropriate when you know or should know that something cannot be delivered.
We have known since the first sod was turned that this was a memorial of national significance. We were talking about this as a memorial of national significance before the first sod was turned. So why would someone then go out and say it was going to be a national memorial, which it is not and can never be? No-one would like more than me for this to be a national memorial. No-one would want it more than me for this to be a national memorial. It was very obvious to me, it was very obvious to the committee and it was very obvious to a lot of people before the event that it could not be a national memorial. Could it be a memorial of national significance? Absolutely. Was it treated by the former government as a memorial of national significance? Absolutely.
Was it treated as such by the people of Ballarat? In fact, it was not just the people of Ballarat. Fifteen thousand people from Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales came down to the opening of this magnificent memorial. This may surprise some people, but it was stinking hot in Ballarat on the day this memorial was opened. It was stinking hot. I reckon it was about 42 in the waterbag. It was a hot, hot day. There were 15,000 people at the opening of this magnificent memorial attended by the Governor-General. Can we please celebrate this remarkable memorial to some remarkable people, but can we please be honest about what the description is? It is a memorial of national significance but it was prior to this bill. It has never been, nor can it ever be, a national memorial due to legislative reasons. I support this bill and I am proud of the people of Ballarat who made this extraordinary contribution to this country.",SENATE,<title>MILITARY MEMORIALS OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2008-06-26,"—The Military Memorials of National Significance Bill 2008 delivers the government’s election commitment to provide national status for the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat. And no matter how much pumped up self-aggrandisement comes from the opposition, no matter how much hypocrisy and grandstanding comes from the opposition, you will not change this fact. This bill delivers an election promise. The memorial is the result of the outstanding efforts of the Ballarat RSL, the Ex-Prisoners of War Association, the city and the people of Ballarat to recognise the bravery and sacrifice of more than 35,000 Australian prisoners of war during the Boer War, the two World Wars and the Korean War.
The Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat will be the first memorial to be declared under this bill. The bill will also provide a mechanism to enable in the future other memorials that are located outside the Australian Capital Territory and meet the criteria specified in the bill to be accorded national memorial status. The national status of memorials in the ACT is governed by the National Memorials Ordinance 1928 and this mechanism restricts memorials to within the ACT. However, the ordinance does not preclude the granting of national status through another mechanism to the memorials outside of the Australian Capital Territory. No matter what level of sophistry, no matter what level of semantics is pursued by the opposition, this bill achieves the national recognition that is so rightly deserved for this memorial.
The bill will establish a clear process and stringent criteria to be applied when determining future national status of military memorials of national significance outside of the Australian Capital Territory. The responsibility, the ongoing maintenance and the refurbishment of the declared memorial will remain with the authority which owns or manages that memorial. I acknowledge the commitment and the fine work of the various levels of government in establishing and maintaining memorials around Australia during the last century, and I trust that we will continue to preserve these important components of our heritage. This legislation will support the strong traditions of commemoration in Australian communities recognising significant memorials that are worthy of being declared national memorials.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-06-26,"—I hope this bill is as uncontroversial as the last one. The opposition supports the Customs Amendment (Strengthening Border Controls) Bill 2008. It is a legacy measure from the previous government. The provisions of the bill were initially included in the Customs Legislation Amendment (Augmenting Offshore Powers and Other Measures) Bill 2006 and the Customs Legislation Amendment (Modernising Import Controls and Other Measures) Bill 2006, which lapsed when the parliament was prorogued last year.
The bill amends the Customs Act 1901 and the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Act 2001 to permit a person to surrender certain prohibited imports that have not been concealed; allow for the granting of post-importation permissions for certain prohibited imports; permit infringement notices to be served for certain offences, including importing certain prohibited imports and border security related offences; and enable Customs officers boarding a ship or aircraft to conduct personal searches for, and take possession of, weapons or evidence of specified offences.

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-06-26,"—The Lands Acquisition Legislation Amendment Bill 2008 is identical to the Lands Acquisition Legislation Amendment Bill 2007, which was introduced into the Senate on 13 September last year and which lapsed when the parliament was prorogued. The bill amends the Lands Acquisition Act 1989 to reflect the changes in the modern Commonwealth property environment and to decrease administration costs.
By schedule 1, which deals with mining regulations, the bill proposes to enable the dissemination of Commonwealth mining regulations for the administration of mining on Commonwealth land to enable state and territory legislation to be applied in a manner consistent with Commonwealth policy. It also vests the Federal Court with jurisdiction in matters arising under those regulations.
By schedule 2, which deals with offers by the minister for compensation where no claim is made, the bill proposes to expedite the compensation process and ease the financial and administrative burdens in relation to compulsory acquisitions. The purpose of the proposal is to avoid delays to settlement of compensation in relation to acquisitions and to provide certainty to the Commonwealth on its financial exposure in such circumstances.
Further amendments by schedule 3 bring the administration of land on the Cocos Islands into line with land administration on Christmas Island and Norfolk Island without the intervention of the act. The issue of land tenure on those external territories is, as you are no doubt aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Bishop, a matter of great interest to those who have a taste for such constitutional and legal arcana.
Dealings in land on the Cocos Islands under the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955 have, by reason of oversight, not been made exempt from the act. The amendment proposes to remove the tabling of commercial acquisitions on market of an interest in land to reduce duplication and administrative burdens. Accountability and transparency of commercial acquisitions is provided by AusTender, which makes public commercial acquisitions of property by the Commonwealth. AusTender has a standard of transparency and accountability equivalent to that of tabling in parliament. The amendment proposes to substitute the Attorney-General with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation in connection with cancelling and amending title documents related to land held in trust. This is a practical measure, as that minister has responsibility for the administration of the act.
By schedule 4, the Lands Acquisition (Defence) Act 1968 is repealed. That legislation, which was created in order to acquire public parkland in New South Wales, is now redundant, since the acquisition has long since passed.
There has been extensive consultation and agreement with the states and territories regarding the miscellany of matters that are the subject of this bill. As I previously mentioned, the bill essentially is designed to ease administrative burdens and associated financial costs. The opposition supports these measures.",SENATE,<title>LANDS ACQUISITION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-06-26,"—In speaking to this bill briefly, I indicate that the coalition will be supporting the Governance Review Implementation (AASB and AUASB) Bill 2008. It is technical in nature but it is very straightforward. It seeks to improve corporate governance in Australia. The bill will transfer the governance of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1996. The Uhrig review, which reported in 2003, identified issues with existing governance arrangements and set about identifying options to improve the performance to get the best long-term results from these statutory authorities. Comparing these two bodies against the Uhrig review templates shows that we would be better served with the AASB and the AUASB transferred to be under the authority of the Financial Management and Accountability Act. The measure is designed to improve existing accountability and governance arrangements while maintaining operational autonomy. The Financial Reporting Council will maintain the strategic oversight of both these boards. There will be no changes to the statutory functions performed by either of the agencies, other than to enhance the financial and administrative arrangements of the board, which includes consequential changes to the Financial Reporting Council functions in relation to the approval of finance and administrative matters.
The bill, like others debated in this non-controversial part of the order of the day, is essentially a continuation of the good work undertaken by the former Howard government on corporate governance reform, and we are very pleased to support this bill.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNANCE REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION (AASB AND AUASB) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1,speech

I concur with what Senator Coonan has said. In discussions with both the CPAs and chartered accountants, they do not anticipate any ramifications in the way the standards would operate. Obviously the standards underpin the whole process of how, in accountancy, we do our job. This is something that has been pursued since the Uhrig review. It was also pursued in the 1975 royal commission on Australian government administration, which argued for greater flexibility, and that has also had an influence on this bill.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2008-06-26,"—This bill, like so many pieces of legislation we have been looking at over the last few months, is legacy legislation from the previous government. The Montreal convention has substantively changed. Under the Warsaw convention, carriers currently are not liable for the death or injury of a passenger or for damage to air cargo if they can prove that they took all necessary precautions to avoid the loss. It also capped the carriers’ liability at a rate which is now out of date, unreasonably low and set at a currency which was then, I think, the Poincare gold franc, which no longer exists.
Different parties to the Warsaw convention subsequently adopted a variety of amending instruments, resulting in a complex and confusing array of international arrangements. The Montreal convention is designed to overhaul the system and to eventually replace the Warsaw convention. It introduces a two-tier system of liability for death or injury. The first tier, which is for damages up to approximately A$190,000, is on the basis of no-fault liability and cannot be reduced except in the event of contributory negligence by the passenger. For the second tier—damages exceeding this threshold—the carrier is liable unless it can demonstrate that the change was not due to its negligence or that of its agents.
Effectively, the Montreal convention increases the compensation limit for victims of air accidents. It also sets the monetary unit of compensation as the SDR—the special drawing right—of the IMF rather than the long-abandoned gold standard and provides for the periodic review of compensation to take account of inflation. It will also enable Australians to bring legal action in Australia rather than in the country where the air accident occurred, and it modernises the list of family members who are entitled to seek compensation in the event of death in an air accident.
The Montreal convention will also ease the burden on air shipping companies by removing the need for handling paper waybills for air cargo and allowing them to use electronically based waybills. The Montreal convention was concluded in May 1999. It combined the various provisions of the previous Warsaw system arrangements into a single package and entered into force in November 2003.
The Department of Transport also issued a discussion paper in 2005 reviewing the Civil Aviation (Carriers’ Liability) Act 1959 in light of the decision by the Australian government to accede to the Montreal convention and proposing amendments to the Australian law that would have had the same effect as the legislation currently proposed by the government. Effectively, the coalition government, as I have indicated, had already decided to accede to the Montreal convention. This is the next step—to amend the law in such a way as to put this into force. This legislation, therefore, is implementing a convention that the coalition had already approved when it was in government and which it had already planned to implement.

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2008-06-26,"—The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Bill 2008 and the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 will give effect in Australia to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, which is now known as the bunkers convention. The principal impact of this legislation is that shipowners will be strictly liable, regardless of fault, for any bunker oil spillage. A shipowner can be the owner, registered owner, bareboat charterer, manager or operator of the ship. The consequential amendments bill will ensure that there is no duplication of requirements due to existing acts for vessels entering Australian ports and no additional burden on shipowners. The shipping industry has accepted that it must pay its way in the event of an oil spillage. The industry is only too happy to guarantee the safety of marine environments for those that depend on the bounty of the sea.
Protection of Australian waters is very important to those who make a living from the sea and live in coastal towns. Australia has a mostly pristine environment that needs to be maintained at any cost. An oil spill in Australian waters could have catastrophic consequences to Australia’s environment and our economy. Australia’s signing of the convention further encourages other nations to sign. Australia has been progressive and led the way internationally in the creation of a convention on bunker oil pollution damage. Australia took a leading role in the negotiations within the International Maritime Organisation, which led to the development of the bunkers convention in 2002. Both Australia’s role at IMO and Australia’s domestic legislation in 2001, requiring ships with a gross tonnage of 400 or more to be insured to cover liability in cases of pollution damage, complement Australia’s oceans policy.
Australia’s role in the development of the bunkers convention, which this legislation ratifies, had its origins in the 1992 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure Ships of shame report. The report recommended that the Australian government require proof of possession of adequate protection and indemnity insurance cover as a prior condition for entry of vessels into Australian ports. The bunkers convention complements Australia’s high standards for ships trading along our coastlines and entering our ports. Australia is now world renowned for the enforcement of strict inspection regimes. This legislation excludes tankers.
The liability of oil tankers is covered by the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation 1990. It will be surprising to many who are listening that international data on oil spills indicates that, even in the case of larger spills, the number of non-tanker ship spills is far greater than the number of tanker spills. Approximately 93 per cent of incidents requiring response action actually originate from ships other than oil tankers. Under the bunkers convention prompt and effective insurance compensation claims can be sought directly against the insurance company. No longer will the fault of the shipowner have to be proved or the trouble taken to trace the registered shipowner. The carriage of insurance certificates will facilitate claims for compensation by making it easier to determine who the insurer is. The carriage of necessary liability cover for a business is nothing more than sound business practice. The legislation will mean victims of bunker oil pollution will no longer have to prove that the shipowner was at fault in order to receive compensation. Until now, shipowners have only been liable for payment of compensation if proof could be given that the owner was at fault. The bunkers convention, as ratified by these bills, ensures compensation is available even if the oil spill was accidental.
Implementation of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage 2001 will ensure that clean-up and response costs are recoverable from all shipowners without difficulty. In establishing a liability and compensation regime for bunker oil spills from ships that are not oil tankers, the bunkers convention ensures adequate, prompt and effective compensation for damage caused by pollution resulting from the escape or discharge of bunker oil from ships. It also adopts uniform international rules and procedures for determining questions of liability and providing adequate compensation in such cases. The shipping industry was widely consulted in 2001, providing valuable input into the findings of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties 2001 report and the committee’s recommendation to ratify. Australia depends almost exclusively on shipping to transport its exports and imports and has, in terms of tonnes of cargo shipped and kilometres travelled, the fifth-largest shipping task in the world. Australia also has some of the most iconic and sensitive marine areas in the world.
The basis of liability is the size of the ship—that is, over 1,000 gross tonnes is considered a fair level by the industry. The bunkers convention enters into force on 21 November 2008, which is one year after the date on which 18 states, including five states each with ships whose combined gross tonnage is not less than one million, have ratified the convention. Inaction by the Australian government has not delayed the ratification of the convention. Legislation was not prioritised due to the legislation already in place since 2001, requiring certificates of insurance to be held by vessels of over 4,000 gross tonne. In 2001 an amendment was made to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 requiring all vessels, except oil tankers of 400 gross tonne and over entering Australian waters to carry certification of insurance to cover the cost of oil spillage, pollution damage and clean-up, in the case of proof of fault of the owner. Australia benefits from a world where interaction between countries takes place within a transparent framework based on fair rules as agreed in treaties.
The building of a global alliance through which Australia seeks to influence standards under which international relations are conducted is advantageous to industry. If Australia did not ratify the bunkers convention, it would result in Australian shipping legislation not keeping pace with international developments and would leave open the possibility of government being ultimately responsible for bunker oil spill response costs. Australia played an active role in developing the bunkers convention at the International Maritime Organisation and internationally has been a strong supporter of its early entry into force. Amendment of the protection of the sea bill, with the addition of part 111A, provided some level of insurance cover but did not include the broader range of issues included in the bunkers convention, which will now be ratified by these bills.
As of February 2008, the following countries belong to the bunkers convention: the Bahamas, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Jamaica, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Spain, Tonga and the United Kingdom. Discussions with Australian peak industry bodies, including the Shipowners Association, Shipping Australia, the Association of Australian Ports and the Marine Authority reveal full support of this legislation.",SENATE,<title>PROTECTION OF THE SEA (CIVIL LIABILITY FOR BUNKER OIL POLLUTION DAMAGE) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,28,1,speech

"Scullion, Sen Nigel",CLP,2008-06-26,"—I rise to speak on the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2008. This bill makes some technical changes, including definitions, to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 to ensure that the slot management regime at Sydney airport is robust. Of course, the framework that has successfully managed aircraft demand in Australia’s busiest airport is provided by the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997. This legislation, as members in this place are no doubt well aware, was implemented by the coalition early in its first term and arose from its 1996 election promise that aircraft movements at Sydney airport should be capped at 80 per hour.
It is worth noting that in the long years of the previous Labor government no such effort was made to manage aircraft demand in Sydney airport. It took a coalition government to do it. On this point I note with some amusement the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Local Government’s bizarre claim in his second reading speech that the demand management scheme operating in Sydney airport is the result of his private member’s bill introduced in 1996. Of course, we are used to this minister’s shameless attempts to rewrite history and claim coalition successes as his own. We have seen, for example, his trumpeting media release of 31 March this year regarding the open skies agreement. The opposition acknowledges the benefits of an agreement that permits Australian and US-owned airlines to fly freely between the two countries.
We welcome the intention of the Virgin Blue Group to launch daily direct Sydney-Los Angeles flights. It is a first step in opening up a key air route to greater competition—but, Minister, please do not pretend that it was your work that did it. At least have the courtesy to acknowledge the heavy lifting undertaken by the previous coalition government that made it possible. Likewise, as discussed quite comprehensively in last year’s Australian National Audit Office report entitled Implementation of the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997, the genesis of the framework that regulates the scheduling of aircraft in Sydney was conducted by the coalition in its first few months of office.
The introduction on 4 November 1996 by the member for Grayndler of a private member’s bill to limit aircraft movements at Sydney airport was a shameless copycat action designed to appease his constituents, who are becoming angry at the neglect by their member of a key community issue and the failure of that member to persuade his government to do anything about it. Of course, we are pretty used to Labor ducking the hard decisions. I believe that barely six months into this government’s term we are up to 74 reviews. Plainly this is a government that cannot make the hard decisions. It is quite staggering that, after 11 years in opposition, all the government can do upon gaining office is to commission yet further reviews. It is symptomatic of a government that is devoid of ideas—when in doubt, call for a review; when wanting to delay a difficult decision, call for a review.
That is why I was not surprised to note the announcement by the minister on 10 April this year of his intention to develop a national aviation policy statement. This will lead to a national aviation policy green paper to be released at a nebulous date some time this year. I note with interest that the minister has released an issues paper as a guide to industry in the development of this statement. This issues paper includes in the second chapter, entitled ‘Airport planning and development’, a section called ‘Future airport needs’. In that section a sentence refers to the need for ‘additional airport capacity for Sydney in the future’. This, of course, is code for a second airport for Sydney. Well, they have had 11 years in opposition to think about this difficult policy question but, once again, when faced with a hard decision, Labor go for a review.
Of course, the contortions of Labor over the need for a second airport in Sydney are well known. In 2004 the member for Batman admitted in a burst of honesty that the debate about an additional airport in Sydney has ‘torn the Labor Party apart for decades’. I also recall this was the time that Labor proposed a second airport should be built at Wilton or ‘somewhere south of the Nepean River’. This extraordinary proposal would have resulted in the location of an airport at the furthest point from a CBD in the world—further even than Tokyo’s Narita airport, which is 64 kilometres out of the city. Neither the infrastructure requirements of such a location nor the fact that it is the site of a major water catchment for the Sydney region were discussed. Now, it seems that Labor has dismissed building an airport at Badgerys Creek.
I also note in its issues paper that Labor observes that the 2009 review of the Sydney Airport Master Plan provides an opportunity to consider current and future capacity issues. So, even after a review leading to a national aviation green paper, Labor is giving itself an option for another review to consider the second airport further. I would have thought that after 11 years in opposition, Labor would have made up its mind. What is Labor’s view on the need for a second airport, and where should it be? The people of Australia await with interest Labor’s decision. However, with particular regard to this bill, the Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill 2008, the opposition is willing to support it.
The definition of ‘aircraft movement’ in the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act and the definition used by the operational elements created by this legislation—that is, the Slot Management Scheme and the compliance scheme—are different. The former defines aircraft movement as the landing and take-off of an aircraft on the runway; the latter uses the aircraft industry standard definition which considers aircraft movement to be the time an aircraft moves to and from a gate. This means that a key component of the demand management regime at Sydney airport—that is, the definition of aircraft movement—is in fact not in harmony. This contradiction, and the legal uncertainty it creates, has been noted as an issue of potential concern by the Australian National Audit Office in its March 2007 report.
The Sydney Airport Demand Management Amendment Bill seeks to rectify this anomaly by changing those definitions, and that will ensure that an aircraft movement will now be considered to be the time an aircraft moves to and from a gate. This is a routine and technical amendment to the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997, a piece of legislation developed by the coalition that has successfully managed the pressures on Australia’s busiest and largest airport. The opposition is happy for this amendment to go to the other place.",SENATE,<title>SYDNEY AIRPORT DEMAND MANAGEMENT AMENDMENT BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,29,1,speech

It sets an annual salary for the office of the Governor-General during the term of Her Excellency Ms Quentin Bryce—and I take this opportunity to congratulate Ms Bryce for her appointment to the office of Governor-General. I think she will be terrific in that role. The bill also removes references in the Governor-General Act 1974 to the superannuation surcharge, which was discontinued by the previous government in 2005. I commend the bill to the chamber.",SENATE,<title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL AMENDMENT (SALARY AND SUPERANNUATION) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,30,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2008-06-26,"—I wonder if I might just momentarily take the opportunity of this debate on the Governor-General Amendment (Salary and Superannuation) Bill 2008 to acknowledge and congratulate the government on the appointment of Her Excellency Quentin Bryce to her high office. I have had the privilege of having known Her Excellency since 1975, when she taught me as a first-year law student.
—She’s to blame.
—She is to blame; that is right, Senator McGauran! She has been a wonderful mentor of generations of young Queenslanders—and people elsewhere in Australia too, during her time as Principal of Women’s College at the University of Sydney. The appointment of Quentin Bryce, which Dr Nelson welcomed on behalf of the opposition when it was announced several weeks ago, has certainly caused me great pleasure. She is a wonderful person, as is her husband Michael, and I think the new occupants of Yarralumla will certainly bring to this city a charisma and a stature which will—with no disrespect to any previous occupant—be greatly welcomed by all the residents of this city.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-06-26,"—Senator Milne gave an outline of this amendment before the break. It is an important amendment because it would change the schedule to ensure that what purports to be a carbon sink program, but which is not, would move in some direction towards becoming a legitimate carbon sink. Amongst other things, Senator Milne’s amendment requires that the trees that are put into the ground for the purpose of sequestrating carbon have to be there for at least 100 years—that is the intention. As the schedule in the bill stands, there is no time requirement at all. It is an astonishing piece of legislation, which purports to provide for a carbon sink, but which does nothing of the sort.
Under the current managed investment schemes, if an investor wanted to invest in a future woodchip or sawmilling product by putting in a plantation, they are going to grow them for at least 15 to 30 years—80 years, as far as sawlogs are concerned. That is more of an assurance than we have in this bill, which is supposed to help save the planet from carbon going into the atmosphere. It is totally untoward that the government has said that they want this legislation through and will tell us what their guidelines are going to be in assessing legitimate carbon sinks somewhere down the line. We get carbon sink legislation and then we get an explanation from the minister.
I would ask the minister to tell the committee what the definition of a carbon sink is under this legislation, and why not the 100-year rule that Senator Milne wants to bring in? What is it that the government finds in this amendment that is going to, in any way, do other than help the government to achieve its stated purpose?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-06-26,"—I believe that some of the issues the Greens have brought up are valid and do need addressing. These are the sorts of issues that will be addressed as we go forward in the inquiry. I think there are serious questions as to whether you truly want a carbon sink. This is one of those peculiar instruments about which I have a greater sense of scepticism than I imagine the Greens do. There is a collective communion that, regardless of whether this is what you wish to achieve, you are not going to achieve it.
I am really concerned about some of the advice that has been given in this chamber, especially in the discussions about what a capital deduction is. We now hear that land is not capital. There will be a lot of tax lawyers who are going to be fascinated about that and very perturbed too. There is only capital and revenue. If it is not revenue and it is not capital then what is it? Invisible? There is nowhere else for it to exist.
I understand fully the sentiment of what the Greens are providing here, and I have stated before that the reasons that I will not be voting with them are: firstly, it will be unsuccessful—it will not pass the Senate and it will not pass the lower house; and secondly, it would compromise our capacity to get a Senate inquiry up, which is the best mechanism for ventilating this issue further. I see that the inquiry has been circulated here, as moved by Senator Ronaldson. I am very appreciative of that process going forward—it has taken a bit of heartache, but that is very good. At least Senator Ronaldson has reacted to the issues which have become apparent, and I commend him for that.
Where to from here? I think that, as of right now, the Australian people are awake to this and they are going to be absolutely furious when they find that large coal companies get tax deductions to put up the price of groceries in their shops. I think that is basically what it comes down to. I implore the Prime Minister to show that he has the capacity to work quickly and adroitly on an issue that is before him. Maybe this has gone under everybody’s radar; maybe everybody has missed this one. As it is an issue that is now getting strong public airing, let’s deal with it and fix it up.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,32,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-06-26,"—I rise to ask for further clarification from the government on the financial implications of the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 1) Bill 2008. It says that in 2008-09 we will have forgone $4.7 million in revenue, in 2009-10 the figure is $8.5 million and in 2010-11 it is $11.1 million—making a total of $24.3 million forgone from the government revenue by virtue of the cost of this tax deduction. So I would like to know from the government how many hectares they expect to be planted out under this tax deduction scheme if this is the amount of money that is in the estimates for it. I would appreciate that.
I am still waiting to find out, and will keep on asking, whether the trees can be cut down. If you are going to have a carbon sink forest, it must be in the ground to accumulate carbon. We supposedly have a whole-of-government approach to climate change and we supposedly have a Prime Minister’s department with a climate change unit in it which is determining government policy. Given that the Minister for Climate Change and Water has to, by legislative instrument, make guidelines about the environment and resource management that will pertain to the plantations planted under this legislation, will the government please tell me whether the guidelines are going to be the same as those that exist already in the Greenhouse Friendly Forest Sink Abatement Projects? If that is the case then it is rubbish and it is not worth anything because all it is doing is giving forestry companies who want to plant a plantation and get the money from the fibre in the end an additional income stream along the way. If they are intending to plant those plantations for fibre then why should they be given additional double-dipping, if you like? Their intention would have to be to have a carbon sink, but they could soon change that along the way. Under these rules they do not even have to do that. They can say they want it as a carbon sink and then they can manage the area for both forestry production and carbon.
The government have been utterly remiss. They do not understand just how controversial and how bad this legislation is. They just picked it up straight from former Treasurer Costello and brought it in here because NAFI wants it, the coal industry wants it and the aviation industry wants it. They happily brought it in here knowing that, because the member for Wentworth had drawn it up previously with the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, the member for Higgins, they will get it through for the big end of town. They do not care about the consequences for small rural communities. We have seen it. It is not just happening in North Queensland. My colleague Senator Siewert was telling me about south-west Western Australia, where it has also had really bad impacts. There have been particularly bad impacts in terms of hydrological implications. You come in and fill up a district with these plantations and they take water out of the catchment, so it has huge implications.
My amendments say that these trees must be mixed species and of a local variety, that an easement must be put over the property so that they are there for 100 years and that there must be an ecological evaluation which looks at hydrological impacts, plus surrounding conflicts in land use. What is wrong with that? Why will the government, the opposition and the Nationals not support that? If you are serious about carbon sinks, why would you not actually want them to be carbon sinks if that is your genuine reason?
In my view, this is a complete rort by companies in order to undermine the integrity of an emissions trading system. They know they are going to get a cap. They know they are going to have to reduce their emissions. So instead of reducing their emissions at the power station, at the cement company and in aviation, what they can do is try to offset those emissions by taking up massive areas of land and planting them out as plantations. They have the option then to flog them off to somebody else as fibre if the pulpwood price is high. Alternatively, they can sell them in the carbon market if the carbon price is high. So they have a double option. They even have the option under the government’s existing rules for a forest company to manage the area for both fibre and climate. This is a complete and utter rort: a managed investment scheme on steroids.
As I have said, I want to know why the government will not tell the Senate whether these trees can be cut down. It is a very simple question. Why can we not be told now? Since they have calculated a cost, they must be calculating a hectarage. Where is that? Instead of being given that, we get treated with complete contempt. They have the numbers and they do not care. I know that Senator Abetz has been there in the back row supporting this for the forest industry because it is yet another rort for them on top of what they got from the grants schemes over which he presided in the last period of government. He is there supporting it. In the background, Senator Minchin and Malcolm Turnbull, again, are there supporting it, just as they supported it last year. The only reason it did not go through on the last day before the last federal election was that I pointed out at the time that if you go and tell rural Australia what you are up to they will be absolutely horrified. It was essential legislation at that point and was then changed to non-essential. So that is the context in which we are debating this legislation.
Since Senator Wong is now in the chamber, I think that as the Minister for Climate Change and Water she should be prepared to tell the Senate what the guidelines are that she, by legislative instrument, as it says in this legislation, will be putting out for these carbon sink plantations. If we do not know that, we are buying a pig in a poke. That is what is happening here. Rural and regional Australia do not like it and do not want it, and they have said quite clearly they do not. It is no use saying, ‘We’ve been caught out.’ We have not been caught out. It is clear what this means. There are a lot of people sitting in this chamber who support it.
I do not want any bleeding hearts around rural Australia saying, when the disaster sets in, that we could not have known what the ramifications were. The Senate knows what the ramifications are and, frankly, does not care enough to repeal the legislation. Therefore, senators should be prepared to stand up and say, ‘We actively did it because we wanted to have offsets and not put too much pressure on the industries to reduce their carbon emissions.’ So that is the context in which we are dealing with this. I think it is incumbent on the government to provide those answers. It is also incumbent on the government to explain why the schedule from this bill was put into another bill as well, so it was live in two bills, and why it came up to the Senate live in two bills when one of those bills had been deemed noncontroversial. That is how it got through here, and then they moved to take it out. It is an absolutely cynical move from the government.

I took two questions without notice from Senator Colbeck earlier today. I would like to provide a response to these questions. The government has issued drafting instructions for this measure. Consistent with provisions of the excise and customs legislation, the revenue can be collected for 12 months from the time the tariff alterations are proposed in the parliament or until the close of the parliamentary session—that is, until the next election—whichever occurs first. The government intends introducing the required customs and excise tariff amendment bills into parliament consistent with those provisions.

It is standard practice that governments do not release legal advice. Consistent with provisions of the excise and customs legislation, the revenue can be collected—

"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2008-06-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (Senator Conroy) to a question without notice asked by Senator Colbeck today, relating to taxation.
Not only are Labor not ready with some of their taxation measures but they do not even know that they are not ready. I am not sure whether we are dealing with known unknowns or unknown unknowns, but it was pleasing to see that during question time the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy scurried around to find out exactly where the government are with respect to the supporting legislation for their $3.1 billion tax grab on ready-to-drinks.
We have already heard through the Senate inquiry that this particular tax proposal is not supported by the evidence. It is not supported wholeheartedly by health officials. In fact, in today’s Canberra Times Dr Tanya Chikritzhs said:
Low-risk drinkers preferred ready-to-drink products commonly called alcopops but straight spirits were the alcoholic beverage of choice for teenagers who drank to excess.
We heard during the inquiry into alcopops that this is not a measure that on its own is going to address binge drinking. It is not a health measure, as it has been dressed up to be. It is in fact a tax revenue measure. The government have come into this place and into the other place and criticised the opposition for holding up their legislation. But in fact they did not even know themselves, when asked on two consecutive days, where their own legislation was in respect of a measure that is going to raise $3.1 billion over five years. The government have very convenient memories. They forget how many times they have referred legislation to committees themselves. They forget how many times they have referred budget measures to committees themselves, yet they come into this place and accuse the opposition of all sorts of terrible crimes against their budget. But for two days running they have not been able to answer a very simple question: where is the enabling legislation with respect to the tax on alcopops?
It really does beggar belief that they would impose a tax such as this when the decision has been taken outside all of their own decision-making processes. As we indicated during the debate on the committee report, the government have set up the Henry review to look at taxation, and yet this decision has been made with no reference to that. They have set up a process under COAG to look at the issues surrounding the misuse of alcohol, and yet this decision has been made with absolutely no reference to that. Then, when they are asked where the legislation is to support it, they have no idea. Even when they are given a day’s notice they have no idea. They come back in here for a second day running and have no concept of what is going on. They have to scurry around for an hour during question time to come up with an answer.
All the government have told us is that they may bring the legislation in within 12 months. Yet they tell us that we are economic vandals for holding up the processes with respect to the budget. This is a significant budget measure. It raises $3.1 billion. I am pleased that they have taken the appropriate legal advice to see what might happen. But I do know that the industry are saying to consumers, ‘Keep your receipts,’ because it may be that the government have to give the money back. A significant amount of money—in the hundreds of millions of dollars—will be raised in the first year, and yet it could be up to 12 months before the government decide to bring this legislation in. You just have to wonder: are they waiting until they might have a better chance? It has been interesting to note the comments of the crossbenchers in recent days that they too are having doubts about this measure. We have heard the concerns of the Democrats and the Greens in the debate and we understand quite well that others have similar concerns. (Time expired)

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2008-06-26,"—Thank you, Mr Deputy President, or perhaps I should congratulate you as ‘Mr President in limbo for the moment’—a matter you obviously take very seriously. In taking note, can I follow Senator Colbeck’s comments today and reflect, in part, on Senator Conroy’s answer provided to the Senate. Senator Conroy indicated that the government has issued drafting instructions for this measure and, in listening to Senator Colbeck, you might have been confused about whether that was indeed the answer provided. Senator Conroy indicated that, consistent with the provisions of the excise and customs legislation, revenue can be collected for 12 months from the time the tariff alterations are proposed in the parliament or until the close of the parliamentary session—that is, until the next election—whichever occurs first.
Senator Colbeck provided appropriate advice, which is that people potentially affected by this measure should keep receipts, and indeed they should. But the hypocrisy indicated from the other side on this matter is astounding. Is Senator Colbeck suggesting that, during the term of the Howard government, similar things never occurred? I think he will need to consult the record on that. I can think of several. But it brings me to one of my favourites. My favourite is the government’s childcare measures in the lead-up to the 2004 election. If you are looking at the approach by different governments to tax systems—as indeed we are in referring to the Ken Henry review and other matters—you will see that it was the first and only occasion, of which I am aware, where the government introduced measures that were not to apply until the tax year after the year in which the expenses occurred. I invite senators on the other side to give me an example of a similar measure in our taxation history, and I think they will struggle.
In taking note of Senator Conroy’s answer today, Senator Colbeck gives me the opportunity to reflect more broadly on the Ken Henry review. I have had some time in the last few weeks to look closely at that review as we dealt with the fringe benefits tax issue and the issue of concessions available to charitable and not-for-profit organisations. I am extremely pleased to reflect on the breadth of the review that has been established. Senator Stephens will recall that she inherited a review that I attempted to establish in the Senate some years back when, unfortunately, other priorities overtook our attempt to take an early look at some of the issues that the Ken Henry review will now address. Labor have indicated for many years that a comprehensive review of our taxation arrangements is urgent. That is not to say that the government should stand back from taking measures such as those applied to ready-to-drink beverages, but we are looking at this issue far more comprehensively and more broadly. My favourite aspect of the Ken Henry review is indeed at point 2, which states:
Raising revenue should be done so as to do least harm to economic efficiency, provide equity (horizontal, vertical and inter-generational), and minimise complexity for taxpayers and the community.
Significantly, we should also be looking in this review at improvements to the tax and transfer payment systems for individuals and working families, as well as those for retirees. Aside from simplification issues, we are addressing not only the key transfer issues, the relationships between our social security system and our tax system, but also such issues as customs and excise relating to ready-to-drink beverages.
I took the opportunity during question time to have a quick look at the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs on this matter. They do indeed highlight the need for the Ken Henry review to address broader issues. I think some of the suggestions that Senator Murray made in his report, though, are also worth noting:
I look forward to Labor in government being able to address issues such as lower alcohol ready to drink beverages, tax and excise issues in relation to that area, and indeed wine as well can be a part of a much broader …

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2008-06-26,"—Question time today presented a cipher of all that this government seems to be doing when it comes to its policy on taxation. Here we have one of the most significant tax measures, worth $3.1 billion, which this government has announced—it came out of the blue; it was not on its agenda before the election—on users of ready-to-drink alcoholic products. The measure was introduced by way of a regulation in April this year. The minister was asked, ‘When will we see the legislation whereby parliament is able to confirm that this tax should be imposed?’ The minister said: ‘I don’t know; I can’t tell you. It’ll happen at some point, and I’ll get back to you about that.’ An hour later, at the end of question time, the minister rises and says he will table the legislation in due course. To me, that indicates the kind of shambolic approach this government has been taking in general to taxation issues and the planning of its budget.
This particular tax is a good example. It was not announced in the lead-up to the last election. Mr Rudd had a plan for Australia—a way of being able to deliver on all sorts of important social changes. He did not mention to Australians that he was going to increase taxation levels on ready-to-drink alcoholic products. And bear in mind that that same committee report that Senator Collins was just quoting from indicated that the majority of people who are consuming these products are not adolescents; they are older Australians who, for the most part, are using these drinks responsibly. This out-of-the-blue burden on these drinkers was not announced at all before the election. Suddenly, in April, a new tax is announced on these products and a measure is put in place to allow it to occur but, in terms of the legislation, we do not see any follow-up that will make that possible.
There is serious concern here about how much money the government will collect before its actions are vindicated by an act of this parliament. This financial year, 2007-08, the government, under this proposal, will collect almost $100 million in tax, without the legislative base for that passing through parliament, with the real possibility that, if the parliament does not endorse this particular measure or endorses it in a different form to the one the government puts forward, we might see the government, possibly, having to refund money to those Australians who paid that tax. It is a bizarre circumstance which, apparently, has not been foreshadowed or adverted to by this government. It is a chaotic approach to budgeting across the board.
So many measures announced in this budget were not foreshadowed to the Australian community before the last election, like the taxes on alcopops and luxury cars, the increase in health insurance rebates and the gutting of the solar panel rebate system. The effect on this city particularly is very concerning. In my community we are seeing the failure of the government to identify areas where, as Senator Conroy put it in question time today, wasteful spending was occurring, which means that the government has moved over to areas where painful and unnecessary cuts are having to be made. So we are seeing cuts to the national institutions based here in Canberra: the National Library, the National Museum, the Australian War Memorial and the National Gallery. Where did that come from? Where were the announcements about that before the last election?
These things are happening because you people have discovered that there is not that much wasteful expenditure that you could easily lop off in order to make these sorts of policy changes in your budget. You are having, as a result, to go back and cut things which are much more important to the Australian people than those things that you previously suggested were there to be cut easily. So we are seeing cuts to the CSIRO and to innovation programs. Commercial Ready is going out the door. We are seeing extra burdens on Australian drinkers. We are seeing, as Senator Fielding suggested today, extra government taxes on petrol. We are seeing all sorts of burdens on the Australian community of which no notice was given before the election in November. This is a very serious turn of events and it indicates the shambolic approach this government takes to taxation. (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I place on record my congratulations and thanks to the President of the Senate for the way in which he presided over this chamber, the way in which he conducted himself and the advice that he has made available to all of us. Taking on the points that have been brought up in this taking note of answers debate, it never ceases to amaze me how the people on the other side come into this chamber and lecture us about budgets and responsibility. If you look at the budget we brought down, with a $22 billion surplus, you will see that we are showing the economic credentials to be a good government that is going to balance the budget and have a surplus, while having to deal with the inflation that we inherited from the previous coalition government.
I remind the Senate that the now opposition, which was in government for 12 years—very long years as far as the community was concerned—did nothing in the way of reviewing the taxation system. We have now instigated the Ken Henry review. That is going to be a wide-ranging review, which will impact on the Australian community. Having worked alongside Senator Humphries on the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I know that he knows only too well the sorts of issues that are going to be addressed by that review. One of those issues concerns Australian pensioners—a very important one. Because of the plight of single pensioners, I am most interested in what will come out of this review in regard to how we can better assist them.
Talking about budgets and taxation, I remind the Senate of the burden left by the Howard coalition government on Australian families and how Australian working families are struggling to make ends meet, whether you are talking about grocery prices, petrol or, more importantly, the family home and interest rates. How many interest rate rises did we have under the Howard government? Was it nine, 10 or 11 consecutive interest rate rises? All of those had a huge impact on Australian working families. But the Rudd Labor government are delivering on all its election promises. I know they do not want to hear that on the other side. When it comes to personal income tax, childcare costs and education costs, we are delivering on all of those for working families. We are taking very, very important steps to ensure that Australian families have the best opportunities ever to own their own homes.
Talking about election commitments and budgets, I remember, as do the Australian community, that the Howard government, when it was election time, had to be asked, ‘Was it a core promise or a non-core promise?’ One thing the Australian people remember, as we do on this side, is that the Howard government failed to deliver on many of its election promises. We on this side of the chamber—the Rudd Labor government—have articulated a five-point plan to address the inflation that we inherited. We have brought down a budget surplus. We have encouraged private savings. We are addressing the skills crisis that we were left. For 12 long years we had to put up with the Howard government, and we are paying the price for that now. The Rudd Labor government are investing in infrastructure. All of these measures are there to address the inflationary pressures that the Australian community are facing, which, as I said, were one of the worst legacies left by the Howard government.
In regard to the ready-to-drink liquor issue in this taking note of answers debate, let us say that this taxation measure is only one measure. We all know that there are serious concerns in relation to binge drinking. But, like I said, this is not something that has just manifested itself within the community; it has been there for a long time. Once again, it has been left to the Labor government to start addressing these real issues that Australian families are facing, particularly when it comes to our young people and their plight in all sorts of circumstances. Something that is of great relevance to us Tasmanians is the investment that this government is making in our health system—unlike the previous government, where there was huge neglect.

"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2008-06-26,"—During the break, I consulted with the Clerk of the Senate, and the information I was given is that this bill will be regulated by disallowable instrument, and if that disallowable instrument is carried then the bill will be gutted—similar to what happened with the Australia Card. So I just want to put on notice that anyone who wants to take advantage of this tax break does so at their own peril, because my advice is that it would only require one side, either the government or the opposition, to support a disallowance motion and the bill would not be workable—very similar to what happened with the Australia Card. I want to put on record that anyone who goes out and takes advantage of this today, tomorrow or the next day might be buying a big fat lemon, and it may not be operable.
The Greens are opposed to this, the National Party are opposed to it and some people in the Liberal Party are opposed to it. It is going through a Senate inquiry and if that Senate inquiry divulges what I think it will divulge then I think both the government and the opposition will abandon this. I just want to warn people that, if they invest money in the next couple of days or the next couple of weeks, they do it at their own peril.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I have some information on a number of questions. One of those was, again, a question which I actually answered yesterday, but I stress it again for Senator Boswell, and Senator Joyce, who is an intelligent man and particularly understands these issues: land is not deductible under this provision. Land is treated as a CGT asset under the existing tax law and nothing in this bill alters this treatment. The explanatory memorandum for the carbon sink measures says at paragraph 3.39:
Expenditure on assets separate from the trees is not considered to be establishment expenditure.
Land is a separate asset to the trees themselves. I do not know how much clearer the legislation, the EM and that explanation can be. I know it is an important issue and I know it is one that is particularly exercising the minds of National Party senators, but it could not be clearer.
I will address a number of other matters that have been raised. The legislation, which allows a deduction for the establishment expenditure for carbon sink forests, is modelled on the provisions for deduction of costs associated with establishing horticultural plants. Under these provisions, there is no requirement for the taxpayer to leave the plant in the ground—whether it be a grapevine or an orange tree, for instance. The tax law simply recognises that a legitimate expense has been incurred in the course of business and allows a deduction.
It is worth noting, though, that there are additional requirements for claiming a deduction under the carbon sink forest provisions. These include that the primary and principal purpose for establishing the trees is carbon sequestration. The purpose cannot include felling the trees. The expenditure cannot be incurred under a managed investment scheme. The trees must be consistent with the Kyoto protocol requirements for a recognised forest. In addition, the taxpayer must give the tax commissioner a notice which confirms that they have met the aforementioned requirements and must comply with environmental and resource management guidelines. Issues expected to be covered in the notice given to the tax commissioner include the latitude and longitude of the forest, the species of the trees planted, the estimated number of trees planted per hectare and the rationale for the probability of meeting the relevant requirements. Those are all the tests and criteria. You will be seeking more information on these things; I hope that gives you most, if not all, of the information you are seeking, Senator Milne. I am happy to try and get further information for you. Hopefully, that addresses what I know has been a major concern of the National Party members.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-06-26,"—Thank you to the government for coming back with some information. I now have an answer to what I was asking—that is, is there any requirement for the trees to be left in the ground and can they be cut down? The minister has just said there is no requirement for the trees to be in the ground, so it is precisely as I said: under this tax law there is no requirement for trees to stay in the ground. The only guarantee that the senator has just made to me is that the Minister for Climate Change and Water will have to issue guidelines which will classify eligibility, and the guidelines are a disallowable instrument, as Senator Boswell has just indicated.
But the point I am making is that I want to know from the minister whether the Greenhouse Friendly forest sink abatement projects regulations are going to be the regulations that the climate change minister agrees to, in which case they will be completely useless. I am told to wait and see what the climate minister delivers in terms of guidelines, and rest assured I will—and rest assured it is a disallowable instrument, and when it comes before this chamber, if it is not good enough, we will deal with that. But it does not alter the fact that even if you can achieve some of the things we want to achieve—that the trees are in the ground, that the trees are mixed species and that there is a hydrological assessment—it does not alter the impact on agricultural communities, which is the point that we have been trying to make here time and time again.
So I would like an answer from the minister now. I asked another question in relation to where you got your cost estimates. The minister is going to tell me in a minute, but perhaps he could also tell me whether the Greenhouse Friendly forest sink abatement projects guidelines are the ones that are being referred to, before we actually put the amendments.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I will follow up with some further information for Senator Milne. For the total area planted in number of hectares in 2007 the calculation is 3,000 hectares; in 2008 it is 15,500 hectares; in 2009 it is 18,000 hectares; in 2010 it is 21,500 hectares; and in 2011 it is 23,500 hectares. On the secondary question, I am told that the ones you refer to are a voluntary mechanism. I will get more information, because I am not sure that that completely answers your question. It may not answer the point that you believe you are making and that you have made on a number of occasions. We are happy to give you all the information that we have but, no matter how many times we go around the chamber, I do not know that we are going to solve the point that you are advancing, which is that whatever we have is not good enough. We will give you all the information we have, but if in your judgement that is not sufficient I do not know that another hour or two of discussion will actually change your view. We believe the process that we are undertaking through the emissions trading scheme, a green paper, will address a number of the concerns you are raising, but we are happy to give you any information we have that is available, Senator Milne.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2008-06-26,"—Thank you for the answer, Minister, on how many hectares are estimated in this scheme. Could you explain to me the model that you used to come up with those estimations, given that we do not know the value of the market and we do not know what price the market is going to put on the carbon trade? Could you explain to me, if you meet those recommendations, how much carbon will be offset by those hectares and what the value of it would be?
This is flying by the seat of your pants. No-one really knows. There is no regulation and no market in Queensland. Minister, can we have some explanation of what we are doing to Australia’s taxpayers and of the pressure on agricultural land, because this is—I will not use the terminology I would normally use, Mr Deputy President—baloney. I would like to know what modelling was used to come up with those estimations and what presumption they were based on. In some states there is not even an established market, and if we met those 80,000 hectares, or whatever it is, what minuscule part of the market would that offset? I just cannot believe that we have come up with this law, and I would like to put the investors on notice that I am going to do everything I can to make this a fair dinkum sink operation where you will lock land up if you participate. No-one can explain to me the contractual arrangements between the freehold, the leasehold and the emitter and the legal obligations in that. We do not even know what the market is going to establish as the value, and of course the higher the value the higher the grade of land that will be used because, as I said before, no-one in their right mind is going to grow a crop if they can sit on their backside and collect the dividend out of this.
There are millions of hectares in northern Australia that would be suitable climatically and geographically for carbon offsets, but they will go to cleared land and prime farming land under this ridiculous proposition that has gone through the parliament. Minister, could you explain to me the modelling behind that and the amount of carbon that will be offset, and what percentage of the offset that will be required in Australia, given that there is no market in Queensland?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I do not have the exact amount of carbon that this will offset, but it is expected to offset carbon emissions. The modelling is exactly the same modelling as that used to gain the support of your party room, when it passed your party room and when you first introduced this bill. But most importantly, I think there is an informal understanding that we are proceeding to a Senate committee on these matters. Those are matters which you will be able to explore in depth in the committee process, Senator Heffernan. That information, I am sure you would understand, is not readily available. I am sure if you put some of your questions on notice for that committee, you will get some answers to them. I appreciate that you are genuinely interested in information, but those questions go to such a level of detail that I think the Senate committee that I suspect will gain the support of the chamber will be the perfect vehicle for you to gain that information.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2008-06-26,"—I am pleased the government is cooperating and that we are all fair dinkum that what comes out of this committee will be looked at and used to fashion what is a proper carbon market and a carbon sink in a responsible way. Would there be a need to grandfather people who are going into the market? We all admit there is a grave unknown in all this and I do not know how we have come to get ourselves in this position, but there are people in the investment vehicle market now who are promoting this, even before we know what the requirements around it are. Do we put people on notice, do we grandfather it? God knows what we do.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-06-26,"—I want to follow up on that. I still would like to know how you came up with a figure of 80,500 hectares or thereabouts to be in the ground by 2011. What is the basis for suddenly magicking up that figure for being what you expect to be taken up and there being a $24 million tag attached to it? I would like some detail as to how that came about. Secondly, I would like some clarity around the disallowable instrument. From what I can see, as I have said before many times, the climate minister must by legislative instrument make guidelines about the environmental and resource management in relation to carbon sink forest. These guidelines will be a disallowable instrument. The establishment of the trees must satisfy these guidelines in order for the relevant expenses to be claimed as a tax deduction. Can you clarify for me, Minister, that this will not come into effect until these guidelines or this instrument come through the Senate, in which case they can be disallowed? In that case, nobody can go out and start this process until those guidelines come through here in order to be ratified. I need to understand that, because that will tie up one big rort with this. There will be no loophole between times. Since it says here clearly that the establishment of these trees must satisfy these guidelines in order for the relevant expenses to be claimed as a tax deduction, until we have the guidelines one would assume you could not qualify. I want to have clarity that this will not come into effect until that disallowable instrument comes before the Senate. Secondly, I would like more detail about how you magicked up 18,500 hectares by 2011.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-06-26,"—We will see if we can gather some more of that information, particularly on those calculations, for you, Senator Milne. In terms of whether it comes into effect, I am advised that it cannot come into effect until the instrument is tabled. However, from previous parliamentary experience, an item is tabled, in effect, until it is disallowed. That is the way the instrument works. I notice I disallowed an accounting standard some months after it was introduced and a company went to produce its accounting report using the standard. It was then subsequently disallowed, a court case ensued and the court ruled that the instrument had life until it was disallowed. So from the moment it is tabled to when it is disallowed, it is actually a live instrument. There are a number of court cases, and I am very familiar with one in particular on an accounting standards.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-06-26,"—Can the minister then indicate whether the climate change minister has finalised the guidelines and, if so, when she intends to table them? We need to have a very clear idea about this because, like Senator Boswell, I want it on the record here that no-one need go investing in this and think that they have got it sewn up, because there will be a revolt around rural Australia in relation to this. So I would like some indication as to when we are going to see these environmental guidelines, which I have indicated we are buying as a pig in a poke if you allow this to continue.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I have more information on those figures. They are based on existing carbon sink forest plantations and an assumed take-up rate on existing policies settings, noting that at the moment there is only a limited market for carbon offsets. As you know this bill has already passed. This is not the actual substance of this particular bill, so that is why Senator Wong is not here. This is a tax bill dealing with matters to do with political donations. If I am able to gather any information from Senator Wong in the meantime, I will. But it is not actually her bill and, while you have moved an amendment on all of these issues and we are trying to happy to try and gain that information as fast as we can, I am aware that cabinet is meeting and I will do my best to get as much information for you as I can. But there are no officials here from Senator Wong’s department. Sorry, there is one. We will attempt to gain that information for you.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Milne, Sen Christine",TG,2008-06-26,"—I have to say that I am pretty appalled. To say it is a tax bill and therefore it is not reasonable to expect the climate minister or whomever to be here is a nonsense. The fact that this whole tax measure is dependent upon the climate minister’s guidelines for a carbon sink forest means we ought to have had the guidelines before we actually debated the tax bill so we knew what a carbon sink forest was designed to do. We needed to know that before we could make a judgement as to whether it was worthy of a tax deduction. I do not think there will be any basis on which I would consider it would be worthy of one; nevertheless we should have seen those guidelines.
Minister, it is not really good enough to say, ‘You’ll get to see them at a later time,’ because they are in direct relationship to this bill, and since it was the government who switched this schedule around into other bills you knew this was coming. You knew the guidelines were dependent on this bill taking effect. At the very least the climate minister should have known this. To me this is further evidence that the government are in chaos on climate policy. They do not have a consistent climate policy across all departments; otherwise they would have a very clear idea. The whole review that is going on at the moment into taxation is to look at consistency across government—and we do not have any consistency across government. To say now that ‘we projected the figures based on the current voluntary carbon market’ is just a joke. It is really a joke that you have come in here and said that, because the circumstances have changed. We are going into an emissions trading scheme. We do not know at this point whether Professor Garnaut is going to recommend agriculture and forestry going into the emissions trading scheme—and if they are not going in we want to know when they will go in. So with the whole market framework in terms of carbon, we have gone from a voluntary carbon market to something much more substantial. In my view, we are going to have the classic case of your allocating the money for 80,500 hectares when, in fact, you are going to end up with millions of hectares.
—A huge amount.
—Yes, but they are going to end up with millions. This is not even a fraction of what is likely to occur once the instruments change under emissions trading or under a more robust carbon market. So the voluntary market to date is no indication of what the market is going to be in the future. Also I would like to know where these 80,500 hectares of land that you expect these trees to go on is, because, as I have said, it is likely to be prime land. There are no specifications as to where or when and, as you say, Minister, we will have to wait for the environmental guidelines.
I really want to say to the government that this is really ill considered. It was the former government’s legislation. The former government had no climate credentials and no decent climate policy. Why would you think that they would come up with anything half-decent? Why on earth didn’t you look at their legislation before you adopted it and brought it in here when it is so ill considered? As I have said so many times, you would have been far better off—and you would have got the full support of the chamber for this—if you had come in here and repealed the managed investment schemes, instead of leaving the MIS for forestry and adding another one with this carbon sink legislation—because that is what it is. But my amendment stands. I believe it is a sound amendment. It specifies what a carbon sink is and then I will give the chamber the opportunity to knock out this schedule from this bill. That is what my amendment seeks to do. Everyone has the opportunity to do that. My amendment is in the Notice Paper and has been moved.",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-06-26,"—I have one of the last questions that I will ask. I acknowledge that there has not been a formal socioeconomic study done on this. If there had been, I presume it would be before the chamber at the moment and we would be discussing it. Be that as it may, in any study—or in whatever you have done in the office—have there been any discussions about how much prime agricultural land would be tied up once we ended up with 80,500 hectares of these schemes going? What would be the effects on food inflation when that issue comes to light? Was there any consideration of any limitations on the use of prime agricultural land, especially that associated with food production for our nation, as it is at the moment?
What do you consider will be the greatest mechanism for getting carbon credits? What species of trees would be involved? There has been some talk around that you would be using such trees as mallees—or would you be more likely to go to heavy eucalypts, which would get you a far greater carbon credit, so far more bang for your buck? So you would be looking for an area that has the ability to sustain such timber, which means you would be looking at prime agricultural land. Was any study done on the relationship effects of this scheme seeing as it is, in form, extremely similar to the managed investment schemes that we currently have? Was there any consideration of the acceptance or otherwise of MIS in rural communities as they are at the moment? Was there any study into the market implications of managed investment schemes or schemes like these when you have differentiation between different forms of taxation treatment that are only noted so much by offence?
Is the capacity of an individual farmer to access a scheme like this the same as it would be for a large corporation? Who are the most likely users of this scheme? Are they to be predominantly companies, such as coal companies, which are currently experiencing record profits? If that is the case, why do we need to give them any further advantages? What is the way by which the minister intends to deal with this issue if, during the course of the committee inquiry, it is shown clearly that there will be problems with this bill when, as I imagine, you have people running out there trying to take advantage of it? What information has the minister given to these people so that they know they could be in a position where they have made an economic expenditure into this form of scheme and it has been knocked out later on? In those discussions what feedback have you had? Seeing that there was not a formal socioeconomic study, whose predominant views did you take? Where did they come from and what parts of the industry were they involved in?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-06-26,"—Thank goodness he only wanted to ask one question! Senator Joyce, as I am sure you are aware, the comprehensiveness of those questions could not possibly be addressed in this chamber this afternoon.

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—Perhaps, when this bill was passing through your party room originally, you should have actually been awake at the time and asked these questions of your own government, who actually drafted, created and endorsed this, which was passed by your party room. But the point is that with the general agreement of everybody in the chamber, it seems, there will be a Senate committee to investigate thoroughly all of those matters. In fact, if you are quick I am sure Senator Ronaldson will take shorthand for you and actually write all of those issues into the terms of reference of the committee, Senator Joyce.
The depth and scale of those questions go well beyond the capacity for the officers in the chamber to deal with. These are matters that should have been raised last week when this bill was actually debated. They should have been considered in an inquiry that took place prior to the legislation appearing in the chamber. But that is spilt milk, if you like. To address those questions, there seems to be a general agreement that we have an inquiry.
—With goodwill?
—Genuinely with goodwill. I have got no problem with seeking that information for you. As I said, if we can get that written into the terms of reference—

Senator Joyce interjecting—

—It is all on the public record, so the officers who will be appearing before the committee will be well aware of the information that you are seeking, and I am sure that you will be robustly pursuing them—as will Senator Milne, Senator Brown, Senator Boswell, Senator Heffernan and Senator Fielding. I do not think that there is any chance that this committee inquiry is going to be a squib, given the extent of Senator Milne’s questions, Senator Heffernan’s and your own. It is in the transcript; it is in the Hansard.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-06-26,"—I am grateful to Senator Boswell for getting the information about the disallowable instrument but, as I see it, it is not going to have the full information required to assure us that these forests are going to indeed be a carbon sink. There will be environmental guidelines for planting the trees, but there are not going to be, on the face of it, time demands for growing those trees—as there are in Senator Milne’s amendment, which says they have to aim to be there at least 100 years. I want to foreshadow to the Minister for Climate Change and Water and the Treasurer that, if those matters are not dealt with, we will move to disallow this instrument. As Senator Boswell said, that is a serious matter. Be warned, anybody who wants to take this particular scheme up before this Senate has had its inquiry, dealt with it and seen the instrument that the minister is bringing forward. Might I also put a request through you, Minister, here and now, if there is an inquiry established in a moment, that the government furnish the details of the proposed disallowable instrument so that the inquiry can take that into account in its deliberations?",SENATE,<title>TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES NO. 1) BILL 2008</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,39,1,speech

The Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 has effect as if Schedule 8 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 2) Act 2008 had not been enacted.
The purpose of these amendments is to add a schedule which effectively repeals the schedule that was in the bill that went through last week. So this is the clause that would kill the schedule that went through last week, and I am asking that the two be dealt with together.

A very strong argument can be made that the scheme can only operate when the climate change minister makes legislative instruments relating to environmental and the actual resource management. The important aspect of this is that either House acting alone may disallow an instrument. The reasoning behind my advice is section 40/105 provides for deduction if you comply with section 40/1010. Section 40/1010 provides that expenditure is covered if you meet conditions. One of the conditions is that you must meet the requirements of guidelines. If these guidelines in subsection 40/1010(3) which are disallowable ...
So I think it is absolutely important that that be part of the debate, because people may feel inclined to go ahead with this.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE FOR THE SCRUTINY OF BILLS


Twelfth Report – Entry, Search and Seizure Provisions in Commonwealth Legislation

January 2008
Executive summary of government response to the Twelfth Report of 2006
The Government welcomes the Twelfth Report of 2006 by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills (‘the Scrutiny Committee’), entitled ‘Entry and Search Provisions in Commonwealth Legislation’ (‘the Entry Powers Report’).  
The current inquiry represents a follow up of the Committee’s original inquiry in 1999-2000 in relation to search and entry provisions in Commonwealth legislation. 
The Committee expressed its interest in examining what improvements have been made since that time, in the level and quality of information available to the Parliament to assist in its consideration of relevant legislation.   The report also specifically considers the recent developments in relation to the provisions authorising the seizure of material that is unrelated to an investigation.
The Committee has emphasised its scrutiny role in ensuring that the provisions in relation to law enforcement are balanced.  The Government agrees with the Committee’s view that search and entry powers need to be justified and closely monitored.  
The Committee made fourteen recommendations.  In examining the Committee’s report, the Government supports a number of the recommendations (ten have been fully accepted and two are accepted in part).  This response addresses each recommendation and the government’s response, referring to particular agencies where appropriate.   
As a consequence of the recommendations in the report, amendments are also being made to update ‘A Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers’ (‘the Guide’).    The amendments address many of the areas specified in the report.  It is expected that the amended Guide will provide further explanation and assistance.
The relevant changes are specified in the responses below.
Substantive responses to each Recommendation of the Twelfth Report
1.The Committee recommends that the Guide be amended to advise that the justification for entry and search powers in general, and for those conferring the power to conduct personal searches, in particular, should be clearly set out in the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

Government response to Recommendation 1: Accepted

The Government agrees that justification for entry and search powers, including the power to conduct personal searches, should be clearly set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  In order to justify the introduction or expansion of such powers, a clear need for them should be identified and made clear in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill for the benefit of the Parliament and the public. 
Sections 9.1 and 11.3 of the Guide, ‘Entry powers generally’ and ‘Personal search powers’, are being amended to accord with this recommendation and inform readers of the Committee’s views on the subject.
2. The Committee also recommends that the Guide be amended to advise that the justification for entry and search powers, particularly the power to conduct personal searches, should address the need for such powers in the particular circumstances and should not rely on precedent alone.

Government response to Recommendation 2: Accepted

The Government agrees that justification for entry and search powers, including the power to conduct personal searches, should address the need for such powers in the particular circumstances rather than relying on precedent alone.  The Parliament should be provided with information that allows for these provisions to be considered on their own merits and in the context of the particular circumstances that gave rise to them. 
Sections 9.1 and 11.3 of the Guide, ‘Entry powers generally’ and ‘Personal search powers’, are being amended to accord with this recommendation and to inform readers of the Committee’s views on the subject.
3. The Committee further recommends that entry and search without a warrant should only be authorised in very exceptional circumstances and only after avenues for obtaining a warrant by telephone or electronic means have proved absolutely impractical in the particular circumstances. In such circumstances, senior executive authorisation for the exercise of such powers should be required together with appropriate reporting requirements. The Guide should be amended to reflect this.

Government response to Recommendation 3: Accepted in part

The Government considers that in some circumstances it is necessary for entry and search powers to be exercised without a warrant.
Legislation may address special circumstances in which entry without warrant is provided. One example is particular powers under the Customs Act 1901 exercisable within customs places to ensure the security and integrity of people and cargo at the Australian border. These powers are exercised routinely on a daily basis by Customs officers at their discretion, but are subject to approved guidelines and direction.
Notwithstanding any exceptional circumstances, the Government agrees that where it is considered necessary to provide for such powers, appropriate safeguards should be in place to ensure a sufficient level of accountability is maintained.  A new section 9.10 is being added to the Guide concerning entry and search powers without warrant, which sets out a number of additional procedures. Details are provided below.
In most circumstances where it is not practical to obtain a warrant in person, a warrant should be sought by telephone or other electronic means.
There are situations in which the delay that may be associated with contacting and consulting a judicial officer in order to obtain a warrant would interfere unduly with law enforcement functions.
Where it is considered necessary for legislation to provide for powers of entry and search without a warrant, provision should be made requiring senior executive authorisation for the exercise of such powers together with appropriate reporting requirements.
Strong justification is required for such powers, and should be provided in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.
4. The Committee recommends that the Guide be updated to include the statement of principle and practice set out in the Government’s response and to also include advice that the justification for the empowerment of non-government employees in particular circumstances should be set out in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Similarly, the justification for any deviation from these principles and practice should also be set out in the explanatory memorandum, for the benefit of the Parliament and the public.

Government response to Recommendation 4: Accepted

The Government considers that non-government officials or agencies should only be empowered to exercise entry and search powers in cases of necessity, which are assessed by the Attorney‑General’s Department on a case‑by‑case basis.
The statement of principle and practice set out in the Government Response is being integrated into section 9.2 of the Guide, ‘Authorised officers’.  This section is also being amended to advise that justification for conferring entry and search powers on non-government employees should be included both in the letter to the Minister for Home Affairs seeking approval of such provisions and in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. 
The Committee’s views on justification for any deviation from the policy set out in the Guide also being provided in the explanatory memorandum have likewise been included in that section of the Guide.
5. The Committee recommends that where legislation provides for entry and search of premises, legislative provision should also be made for an authorised officer to identify himself or herself prior to execution of a warrant and for the occupier of the premises to be provided with written advice, in plain language, prior to execution of a search under the warrant. Such requirements should only be waived in exceptional circumstances, such as the exercise of covert search powers authorised under a warrant.

Government response to Recommendation 5: Accepted

The Government agrees that legislative provision should be made for an authorised officer to identify himself or herself and for the occupier to be provided with written advice prior to the execution of a warrant. 
The requirement for an authorised officer to identify himself or herself to an occupier prior to executing a warrant is in line with subsection 3H(4) of the Crimes Act and section 9.2 of the Guide.   The provision on ‘Authorised officers’ is now being amended to make specific reference to both that provision and this recommendation.
Section 9.4 of the Guide, ‘Notification of entry’, will provide that that these requirements should only be waived in limited circumstances.  Examples of this may be where there are reasonable grounds to believe that compliance would endanger a person’s safety, where evidence could be destroyed, or where notification is impractical because no occupier is present.   
The Government’s policy is that where legislation provides for entry and search of premises without consent, the occupier should be informed of his or her rights and responsibilities. 
Section 9.2 of the Guide will also be amended to specify that written notice should be in plain language and should explain the relevant legislative provisions rather than merely reproducing them.  A note will also be placed in the guide instructing officers to ensure that the provisions are framed in such a way as to be legally accurate. 
6. The Committee further recommends that the advice in the Guide be revised to more clearly reflect the requirements referred to in Recommendation 5.

Government response to Recommendation 6: Accepted

Sections 9.2 and 9.4 of the Guide, entitled ‘Authorised officers’ and ‘Notification of entry’, are being amended accordingly (see response to recommendation 5). 
An appendix will also be added to the Guide providing an example of a ‘plain language’ written notice that agencies may use as example in creating their own notice.
7. The Committee recommends that the Guide be revised to require legislative provision for the development of guidelines for the implementation of entry, search and seizure powers. Other than in specific exceptional circumstances, such guidelines should be tabled in both houses of Parliament and published on the agency’s website.

Government response to Recommendation 7: Not Accepted (alternative measure accepted)

The Government accepts in principle that appropriate training procedures and internal controls should be in place in Commonwealth agencies that exercise entry, search and seizure powers. 
The Government does not believe however that there should be a general requirement for such guidelines and for their tabling and publishing.  A general requirement of this kind would unnecessarily regulate the use of entry and search regimes without a corresponding accountability benefits. 
The Guide provides extensive direction on the framing of entry, search and seizure provisions and the safeguards that should be built into legislation to protect the rights of individuals.  It recommends that such powers should generally only be conferred on members of the Australian Public Service and that legislation conferring such powers should require that they only be exercised by appropriately qualified persons.  The Guide also outlines various safeguards that should be provided for in legislation, including those relating to entry under force of law, the issuing of warrants, seizure under warrant, and monitoring warrants.  Further amendments are being made to the Guide as discussed throughout this response in order to update and provide additional clarification as required. 
Legislation and the safeguards it includes provide the framework within which operational guidelines and training procedures are developed.  Guidelines and training procedures support the operational implementation of entry, search and seizure powers within the bounds of the relevant provisions.  As the legislation itself is publicly available and open to Parliamentary scrutiny, the Government does not agree that it is necessary for the relevant guidelines and training procedures to be tabled in Parliament or published on the agencies website.
The Government considers that the decision of whether or not to make such material public should be at the discretion of individual agencies.  In some cases the publication of operational guidelines and training procedures may compromise the integrity of law enforcement operations by revealing operationally sensitive information.
As noted in paragraphs 3.57 to 3.62 of the Committee’s Report, a number of agencies have put guidelines and training procedures into place in relation to the exercise of entry, search and seizure powers, some of which are publicly available.  While the Government does not agree that legislative provision for such measures should be required, it does agree that appropriate training procedures and guidelines should be developed in cases where legislation provides for powers of entry, search and seizure.  A new part is being included in section 9.1 of the Guide, under ‘Entry powers generally’, recommending that where legislation provides for such powers, training procedures and operational guidelines should be put in place to ensure that authorised officers exercise powers fairly and responsibly.
8. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Ombudsman evaluate the feasibility of establishing a register of entry, search and seizure powers in Commonwealth legislation and the ongoing monitoring and audit of the application of such powers.

Government response to Recommendation 8: Accepted in principle

The Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman is an independent body for which priorities are determined by the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman already conducts oversight activities under a range of legislation.  Except in cases where legislative provision is made requiring ongoing monitoring of the powers contained in a particular piece of legislation, the final decision as to whether or not to implement such a scheme rests with the Ombudsman, as does the decision of whether to implement the proposed register. 
In the case of intelligence and security agencies, there are separate oversight arrangements that do not involve the Ombudsman.  A note will be inserted into the Guide to clarify the position in relation to these organisations. 
9. As an interim measure, the Committee recommends that all new proposals for entry, search and seizure powers include legislative provision for regular reports to Parliament in relation to the agency’s use of the powers and the continued need for them.

Government response to Recommendation 9: Not Accepted

The Government agrees that Ministers and agencies should regularly review the powers at their disposal, the extent of their use and the ongoing need to retain them.  However, the Government does not believe that it is necessary or practical for this information to be provided in regular reports to Parliament.
Information relating to the exercise of entry, search and seizure powers is likely to be of a sensitive nature and as such not appropriate for public release.  On the other hand, if such information was to be de-identified for reporting purposes, it would be of little practical use.  Any significant matters can be covered in the annual reports of agencies exercising such powers.
The Government will include provision for reporting to Parliament on the exercise of particular powers where this is appropriate in the specific context, as is the case for example, for telecommunications interception powers.
10. The Committee recommends that consideration be given to expanding the Guide to set out the principles governing the seizure of material relevant to a different offence, particularly an offence under a different statute, to ensure that proper authority is provided and that proper provision is made for the subsequent investigation and prosecution of offences.

Government response to Recommendation 10: Accepted

The Government’s view in relation to entry, search and seizure powers is that the search warrant provisions at Part 1AA of the Crimes Act define the minimum limitations and safeguards that should apply to such powers. 
This position is reflected in section 9.9 of the Guide, ‘Search warrants (offences)’.  This outlines the relevant safeguards and limitations that legislation conferring these powers should provide for and also the views of the Committee.  A new part is being added within section 9.6 of the Guide, ‘Seizure under warrant’, setting out the provisions that should be included in legislation that confers the power to seize material related to an offence other than that for which a warrant was issued.
11. Covert access to stored communication should only be permitted with a warrant and should only be accessible to core law enforcement agencies. The subject of the warrant and the telecommunications services for which access is being sought should be clearly identified in the application for the warrant and on the warrant itself.

Government response to Recommendation 11: Accepted in part


Covert access to stored communications should only be permitted with a warrant

This is accepted.  Where access to stored communications is sought covertly from a telecommunications carrier, Chapter 3 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (the TIA Act) requires that a warrant be sought.  The limited exceptions to this requirement ensure the workability of the telecommunications industry as well as other access schemes such as the computer access and listening device regimes contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s enforcement of the Spam Act 2003.

Covert access to stored communications should only be accessible to core law enforcement agencies

This is not accepted.  There is a separate regime for access to stored communications to reflect technological developments in the storage of documents, and different privacy impacts.  The regime clarifies and centralises access arrangements for a range of enforcement (criminal law enforcement, civil penalty enforcement and public revenue) agencies, which have previously accessed stored documents via a range of different warrant and notice to produce provisions.
It is not agreed that access to stored communications should be limited to ‘core law enforcement agencies’, such agencies are generally interpreted as including State and Federal Police agencies and National Security Agencies’.  The wider group of civil penalty enforcement and public revenue protection agencies have a legitimate need to access these types of information to enable effective investigations.
This reflects the reality that the growing dominance of electronic communications in all forms of business and personal transactions displaces and renders obsolete agencies’ earlier powers of access to paper documents.  However, this access is subject to controls.  In particular, stored communications warrants may only be granted in relation to investigations into a contravention of a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that is:
a serious offence (the existing threshold for obtaining a telecommunications interception warrant, as defined by section 5 of the Interception Act)
an offence punishable by imprisonment for a period, or a maximum period, of at least three years, or the equivalent pecuniary penalty (which is at least 180 penalty units for individuals or at least 900 penalty units for corporations), or
a breach of a civil penalty provision that would render the person committing the contravention liable to a fine of at least 180 penalty units (or at least 900 units if the person is a corporation).

The subject of the warrant and the telecommunications services for which access is being sought should be clearly identified in the application for the warrant and on the warrant itself

This is accepted in part.  The form and content of a stored communications warrant are specified by the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Regulations 1987, which require the person to whom the warrant applies to be fully identified.  Where the person’s name is not known there is scope for a telecommunications service to be identified.
A stored communications warrant authorises the access to all stored communications held by a carrier in respect of a person.  That is, all stored communications made by the person in respect of whom the warrant was issued or that another person has made and for which the intended recipient is the person in respect of whom the warrant was issued.  Accordingly, there is no need to identify the telecommunications service on the warrant.  However, from a practical perspective, there is a requirement that the carrier on whom the warrant is served be provided with sufficient details as to identify the stored communications sought, which will usually be by identification of a telecommunications service.
12. Committee recommends that the Guide be amended to require that legislative provision be made for the regular review of seized material and for the timely return or destruction of material not relevant to a particular investigation.

Government response to Recommendation 12: Accepted

The Government agrees that seized material should be regularly reviewed, and if it is found not to be relevant to any lawful purpose for which it can be used, either returned or destroyed as appropriate.  A new part is being added within section 9.6 of the Guide, ‘Seizure under warrant’, recommending that where legislation authorises the seizure of material, provision is made for the regular review of such material and for the timely return or destruction of material found not to be relevant to any lawful purpose.
As noted in the Committee’s report, the Guide recommends that an upper limit of 60 days should generally attach to the retention of seized material.  The new part to be inserted into the Guide will note that regular evaluation of seized material is particularly important where legislation does not specify a time limit on the retention of such material. 
13. The Committee recommends that the Guide be amended to encourage the inclusion of limitations on the use and derivative use of seized material which is not relevant to a particular investigation.

Government response to Recommendation 13: Accepted

A new part is being added within section 9.6 of the Guide, ‘Seizure under warrant’, recommending that where legislation authorises the seizure of material, consideration be given to the inclusion of limitations on the use and derivative use of incidentally seized material, particularly information accessed via stored communications warrants. 
14. The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General give consideration to the formulation of core principles governing the seizure of material.

Government response to Recommendation 14: Accepted

The Government accepts that core principles in relation to the seizure of material are required.  Additional material on these issues is being inserted into the Guide under section 9.6 entitled - ‘Seizure under warrant’.  This will deal with subjects including the requirements for warrants, review of seized material, limits on the use and derivative use of seized material, material related to a different offence and limits in relation to its use.   In addition, the views of the Committee will be outlined.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE FOR THE SCRUTINY OF BILLS


Twelfth Report – Entry, Search and Seizure Provisions in Commonwealth Legislation

January 2008
Executive summary of government response to the Twelfth Report of 2006
The Government welcomes the Twelfth Report of 2006 by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills (‘the Scrutiny Committee’), entitled ‘Entry and Search Provisions in Commonwealth Legislation’ (‘the Entry Powers Report’).  
The current inquiry represents a follow up of the Committee’s original inquiry in 1999-2000 in relation to search and entry provisions in Commonwealth legislation. 
The Committee expressed its interest in examining what improvements have been made since that time, in the level and quality of information available to the Parliament to assist in its consideration of relevant legislation.   The report also specifically considers the recent developments in relation to the provisions authorising the seizure of material that is unrelated to an investigation.
The Committee has emphasised its scrutiny role in ensuring that the provisions in relation to law enforcement are balanced.  The Government agrees with the Committee’s view that search and entry powers need to be justified and closely monitored.  
The Committee made fourteen recommendations.  In examining the Committee’s report, the Government supports a number of the recommendations (ten have been fully accepted and two are accepted in part).  This response addresses each recommendation and the government’s response, referring to particular agencies where appropriate.   
As a consequence of the recommendations in the report, amendments are also being made to update ‘A Guide to Framing Commonwealth Offences, Civil Penalties and Enforcement Powers’ (‘the Guide’).    The amendments address many of the areas specified in the report.  It is expected that the amended Guide will provide further explanation and assistance.
The relevant changes are specified in the responses below.
Substantive responses to each Recommendation of the Twelfth Report
1.The Committee recommends that the Guide be amended to advise that the justification for entry and search powers in general, and for those conferring the power to conduct personal searches, in particular, should be clearly set out in the explanatory memorandum to the bill.

Government response to Recommendation 1: Accepted

The Government agrees that justification for entry and search powers, including the power to conduct personal searches, should be clearly set out in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.  In order to justify the introduction or expansion of such powers, a clear need for them should be identified and made clear in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill for the benefit of the Parliament and the public. 
Sections 9.1 and 11.3 of the Guide, ‘Entry powers generally’ and ‘Personal search powers’, are being amended to accord with this recommendation and inform readers of the Committee’s views on the subject.
2. The Committee also recommends that the Guide be amended to advise that the justification for entry and search powers, particularly the power to conduct personal searches, should address the need for such powers in the particular circumstances and should not rely on precedent alone.

Government response to Recommendation 2: Accepted

The Government agrees that justification for entry and search powers, including the power to conduct personal searches, should address the need for such powers in the particular circumstances rather than relying on precedent alone.  The Parliament should be provided with information that allows for these provisions to be considered on their own merits and in the context of the particular circumstances that gave rise to them. 
Sections 9.1 and 11.3 of the Guide, ‘Entry powers generally’ and ‘Personal search powers’, are being amended to accord with this recommendation and to inform readers of the Committee’s views on the subject.
3. The Committee further recommends that entry and search without a warrant should only be authorised in very exceptional circumstances and only after avenues for obtaining a warrant by telephone or electronic means have proved absolutely impractical in the particular circumstances. In such circumstances, senior executive authorisation for the exercise of such powers should be required together with appropriate reporting requirements. The Guide should be amended to reflect this.

Government response to Recommendation 3: Accepted in part

The Government considers that in some circumstances it is necessary for entry and search powers to be exercised without a warrant.
Legislation may address special circumstances in which entry without warrant is provided. One example is particular powers under the Customs Act 1901 exercisable within customs places to ensure the security and integrity of people and cargo at the Australian border. These powers are exercised routinely on a daily basis by Customs officers at their discretion, but are subject to approved guidelines and direction.
Notwithstanding any exceptional circumstances, the Government agrees that where it is considered necessary to provide for such powers, appropriate safeguards should be in place to ensure a sufficient level of accountability is maintained.  A new section 9.10 is being added to the Guide concerning entry and search powers without warrant, which sets out a number of additional procedures. Details are provided below.
In most circumstances where it is not practical to obtain a warrant in person, a warrant should be sought by telephone or other electronic means.
There are situations in which the delay that may be associated with contacting and consulting a judicial officer in order to obtain a warrant would interfere unduly with law enforcement functions.
Where it is considered necessary for legislation to provide for powers of entry and search without a warrant, provision should be made requiring senior executive authorisation for the exercise of such powers together with appropriate reporting requirements.
Strong justification is required for such powers, and should be provided in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.
4. The Committee recommends that the Guide be updated to include the statement of principle and practice set out in the Government’s response and to also include advice that the justification for the empowerment of non-government employees in particular circumstances should be set out in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Similarly, the justification for any deviation from these principles and practice should also be set out in the explanatory memorandum, for the benefit of the Parliament and the public.

Government response to Recommendation 4: Accepted

The Government considers that non-government officials or agencies should only be empowered to exercise entry and search powers in cases of necessity, which are assessed by the Attorney‑General’s Department on a case‑by‑case basis.
The statement of principle and practice set out in the Government Response is being integrated into section 9.2 of the Guide, ‘Authorised officers’.  This section is also being amended to advise that justification for conferring entry and search powers on non-government employees should be included both in the letter to the Minister for Home Affairs seeking approval of such provisions and in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. 
The Committee’s views on justification for any deviation from the policy set out in the Guide also being provided in the explanatory memorandum have likewise been included in that section of the Guide.
5. The Committee recommends that where legislation provides for entry and search of premises, legislative provision should also be made for an authorised officer to identify himself or herself prior to execution of a warrant and for the occupier of the premises to be provided with written advice, in plain language, prior to execution of a search under the warrant. Such requirements should only be waived in exceptional circumstances, such as the exercise of covert search powers authorised under a warrant.

Government response to Recommendation 5: Accepted

The Government agrees that legislative provision should be made for an authorised officer to identify himself or herself and for the occupier to be provided with written advice prior to the execution of a warrant. 
The requirement for an authorised officer to identify himself or herself to an occupier prior to executing a warrant is in line with subsection 3H(4) of the Crimes Act and section 9.2 of the Guide.   The provision on ‘Authorised officers’ is now being amended to make specific reference to both that provision and this recommendation.
Section 9.4 of the Guide, ‘Notification of entry’, will provide that that these requirements should only be waived in limited circumstances.  Examples of this may be where there are reasonable grounds to believe that compliance would endanger a person’s safety, where evidence could be destroyed, or where notification is impractical because no occupier is present.   
The Government’s policy is that where legislation provides for entry and search of premises without consent, the occupier should be informed of his or her rights and responsibilities. 
Section 9.2 of the Guide will also be amended to specify that written notice should be in plain language and should explain the relevant legislative provisions rather than merely reproducing them.  A note will also be placed in the guide instructing officers to ensure that the provisions are framed in such a way as to be legally accurate. 
6. The Committee further recommends that the advice in the Guide be revised to more clearly reflect the requirements referred to in Recommendation 5.

Government response to Recommendation 6: Accepted

Sections 9.2 and 9.4 of the Guide, entitled ‘Authorised officers’ and ‘Notification of entry’, are being amended accordingly (see response to recommendation 5). 
An appendix will also be added to the Guide providing an example of a ‘plain language’ written notice that agencies may use as example in creating their own notice.
7. The Committee recommends that the Guide be revised to require legislative provision for the development of guidelines for the implementation of entry, search and seizure powers. Other than in specific exceptional circumstances, such guidelines should be tabled in both houses of Parliament and published on the agency’s website.

Government response to Recommendation 7: Not Accepted (alternative measure accepted)

The Government accepts in principle that appropriate training procedures and internal controls should be in place in Commonwealth agencies that exercise entry, search and seizure powers. 
The Government does not believe however that there should be a general requirement for such guidelines and for their tabling and publishing.  A general requirement of this kind would unnecessarily regulate the use of entry and search regimes without a corresponding accountability benefits. 
The Guide provides extensive direction on the framing of entry, search and seizure provisions and the safeguards that should be built into legislation to protect the rights of individuals.  It recommends that such powers should generally only be conferred on members of the Australian Public Service and that legislation conferring such powers should require that they only be exercised by appropriately qualified persons.  The Guide also outlines various safeguards that should be provided for in legislation, including those relating to entry under force of law, the issuing of warrants, seizure under warrant, and monitoring warrants.  Further amendments are being made to the Guide as discussed throughout this response in order to update and provide additional clarification as required. 
Legislation and the safeguards it includes provide the framework within which operational guidelines and training procedures are developed.  Guidelines and training procedures support the operational implementation of entry, search and seizure powers within the bounds of the relevant provisions.  As the legislation itself is publicly available and open to Parliamentary scrutiny, the Government does not agree that it is necessary for the relevant guidelines and training procedures to be tabled in Parliament or published on the agencies website.
The Government considers that the decision of whether or not to make such material public should be at the discretion of individual agencies.  In some cases the publication of operational guidelines and training procedures may compromise the integrity of law enforcement operations by revealing operationally sensitive information.
As noted in paragraphs 3.57 to 3.62 of the Committee’s Report, a number of agencies have put guidelines and training procedures into place in relation to the exercise of entry, search and seizure powers, some of which are publicly available.  While the Government does not agree that legislative provision for such measures should be required, it does agree that appropriate training procedures and guidelines should be developed in cases where legislation provides for powers of entry, search and seizure.  A new part is being included in section 9.1 of the Guide, under ‘Entry powers generally’, recommending that where legislation provides for such powers, training procedures and operational guidelines should be put in place to ensure that authorised officers exercise powers fairly and responsibly.
8. The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Ombudsman evaluate the feasibility of establishing a register of entry, search and seizure powers in Commonwealth legislation and the ongoing monitoring and audit of the application of such powers.

Government response to Recommendation 8: Accepted in principle

The Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman is an independent body for which priorities are determined by the Ombudsman.  The Ombudsman already conducts oversight activities under a range of legislation.  Except in cases where legislative provision is made requiring ongoing monitoring of the powers contained in a particular piece of legislation, the final decision as to whether or not to implement such a scheme rests with the Ombudsman, as does the decision of whether to implement the proposed register. 
In the case of intelligence and security agencies, there are separate oversight arrangements that do not involve the Ombudsman.  A note will be inserted into the Guide to clarify the position in relation to these organisations. 
9. As an interim measure, the Committee recommends that all new proposals for entry, search and seizure powers include legislative provision for regular reports to Parliament in relation to the agency’s use of the powers and the continued need for them.

Government response to Recommendation 9: Not Accepted

The Government agrees that Ministers and agencies should regularly review the powers at their disposal, the extent of their use and the ongoing need to retain them.  However, the Government does not believe that it is necessary or practical for this information to be provided in regular reports to Parliament.
Information relating to the exercise of entry, search and seizure powers is likely to be of a sensitive nature and as such not appropriate for public release.  On the other hand, if such information was to be de-identified for reporting purposes, it would be of little practical use.  Any significant matters can be covered in the annual reports of agencies exercising such powers.
The Government will include provision for reporting to Parliament on the exercise of particular powers where this is appropriate in the specific context, as is the case for example, for telecommunications interception powers.
10. The Committee recommends that consideration be given to expanding the Guide to set out the principles governing the seizure of material relevant to a different offence, particularly an offence under a different statute, to ensure that proper authority is provided and that proper provision is made for the subsequent investigation and prosecution of offences.

Government response to Recommendation 10: Accepted

The Government’s view in relation to entry, search and seizure powers is that the search warrant provisions at Part 1AA of the Crimes Act define the minimum limitations and safeguards that should apply to such powers. 
This position is reflected in section 9.9 of the Guide, ‘Search warrants (offences)’.  This outlines the relevant safeguards and limitations that legislation conferring these powers should provide for and also the views of the Committee.  A new part is being added within section 9.6 of the Guide, ‘Seizure under warrant’, setting out the provisions that should be included in legislation that confers the power to seize material related to an offence other than that for which a warrant was issued.
11. Covert access to stored communication should only be permitted with a warrant and should only be accessible to core law enforcement agencies. The subject of the warrant and the telecommunications services for which access is being sought should be clearly identified in the application for the warrant and on the warrant itself.

Government response to Recommendation 11: Accepted in part


Covert access to stored communications should only be permitted with a warrant

This is accepted.  Where access to stored communications is sought covertly from a telecommunications carrier, Chapter 3 of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (the TIA Act) requires that a warrant be sought.  The limited exceptions to this requirement ensure the workability of the telecommunications industry as well as other access schemes such as the computer access and listening device regimes contained in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 and the Australian Communications and Media Authority’s enforcement of the Spam Act 2003.

Covert access to stored communications should only be accessible to core law enforcement agencies

This is not accepted.  There is a separate regime for access to stored communications to reflect technological developments in the storage of documents, and different privacy impacts.  The regime clarifies and centralises access arrangements for a range of enforcement (criminal law enforcement, civil penalty enforcement and public revenue) agencies, which have previously accessed stored documents via a range of different warrant and notice to produce provisions.
It is not agreed that access to stored communications should be limited to ‘core law enforcement agencies’, such agencies are generally interpreted as including State and Federal Police agencies and National Security Agencies’.  The wider group of civil penalty enforcement and public revenue protection agencies have a legitimate need to access these types of information to enable effective investigations.
This reflects the reality that the growing dominance of electronic communications in all forms of business and personal transactions displaces and renders obsolete agencies’ earlier powers of access to paper documents.  However, this access is subject to controls.  In particular, stored communications warrants may only be granted in relation to investigations into a contravention of a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory that is:
a serious offence (the existing threshold for obtaining a telecommunications interception warrant, as defined by section 5 of the Interception Act)
an offence punishable by imprisonment for a period, or a maximum period, of at least three years, or the equivalent pecuniary penalty (which is at least 180 penalty units for individuals or at least 900 penalty units for corporations), or
a breach of a civil penalty provision that would render the person committing the contravention liable to a fine of at least 180 penalty units (or at least 900 units if the person is a corporation).

The subject of the warrant and the telecommunications services for which access is being sought should be clearly identified in the application for the warrant and on the warrant itself

This is accepted in part.  The form and content of a stored communications warrant are specified by the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Regulations 1987, which require the person to whom the warrant applies to be fully identified.  Where the person’s name is not known there is scope for a telecommunications service to be identified.
A stored communications warrant authorises the access to all stored communications held by a carrier in respect of a person.  That is, all stored communications made by the person in respect of whom the warrant was issued or that another person has made and for which the intended recipient is the person in respect of whom the warrant was issued.  Accordingly, there is no need to identify the telecommunications service on the warrant.  However, from a practical perspective, there is a requirement that the carrier on whom the warrant is served be provided with sufficient details as to identify the stored communications sought, which will usually be by identification of a telecommunications service.
12. Committee recommends that the Guide be amended to require that legislative provision be made for the regular review of seized material and for the timely return or destruction of material not relevant to a particular investigation.

Government response to Recommendation 12: Accepted

The Government agrees that seized material should be regularly reviewed, and if it is found not to be relevant to any lawful purpose for which it can be used, either returned or destroyed as appropriate.  A new part is being added within section 9.6 of the Guide, ‘Seizure under warrant’, recommending that where legislation authorises the seizure of material, provision is made for the regular review of such material and for the timely return or destruction of material found not to be relevant to any lawful purpose.
As noted in the Committee’s report, the Guide recommends that an upper limit of 60 days should generally attach to the retention of seized material.  The new part to be inserted into the Guide will note that regular evaluation of seized material is particularly important where legislation does not specify a time limit on the retention of such material. 
13. The Committee recommends that the Guide be amended to encourage the inclusion of limitations on the use and derivative use of seized material which is not relevant to a particular investigation.

Government response to Recommendation 13: Accepted

A new part is being added within section 9.6 of the Guide, ‘Seizure under warrant’, recommending that where legislation authorises the seizure of material, consideration be given to the inclusion of limitations on the use and derivative use of incidentally seized material, particularly information accessed via stored communications warrants. 
14. The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General give consideration to the formulation of core principles governing the seizure of material.

Government response to Recommendation 14: Accepted

The Government accepts that core principles in relation to the seizure of material are required.  Additional material on these issues is being inserted into the Guide under section 9.6 entitled - ‘Seizure under warrant’.  This will deal with subjects including the requirements for warrants, review of seized material, limits on the use and derivative use of seized material, material related to a different offence and limits in relation to its use.   In addition, the views of the Committee will be outlined.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2008-06-26,"—As the Senate would be aware, notice was given by Senator Guy Barnett last week of a motion to disallow item 16525 of regulations that provide Medicare funding under the Health Insurance Act 1973. The aim of the disallowance motion is to withdraw Medicare funding for second trimester abortions. The effect of the disallowance motion will be to trigger a debate on the subject of late-term abortions when the parliament returns in the spring session.
Equally, this is an overdue debate in society. It is an issue that has been successfully hidden away, wrapped in society’s acceptance of early-term abortions. But it is a much worse procedure, as are the reasons for it. I believe it is time to put the brakes on the runaway culture of violence that has developed in our hospitals and within the medical profession. It is as easy to get a late-term abortion as it is to get an early-term abortion. As is the case with such moral issues, the matter will be a conscience vote—a time when parliamentarians are released from their party obligations and are left alone to rely on their conscience to decide their vote.
For those who believe that life begins at conception—that is, that the body grows and the soul exists, and I am one of those who hold such a belief—then what choice do you have but to support a pro-life stance and reject the aid or promotion of abortion? On voting patterns, the pro-life position has not held sway in past parliaments. One in four of the conscience votes that could be considered a pro-life position have been successful in the past decade. However, the merit and substance of this coming debate surely warrant even greater moral attention than before. There seems to be a greater horror and an even more distinguishable human right of the child when discussing late-term abortions.
Perhaps when talking about legislating RU486, as this parliament has done, it can be said that it is just a pill that is available. Perhaps when discussing embryo experimentations, as this parliament has also done, it can be said that it is just an embryo in a tube or that cloning is just a single cell. But, for late-term abortions, the gravity of the issue is clearer. We are dealing with a fully formed, viable baby. If you are a pro-choicer, within the confines of past debates you have only dealt with embryos or early life. Where there are completing rights between the adult and the baby, a clear choice is available. The answer the pro-choicer gives is: the woman’s right reigns. However, the question is not the same for late-term pregnancies—there are no competing rights between the mother and the baby. The baby is viable at some 20 weeks and can live away from the mother. So the question in the debate on late-term abortions is: do adults have an unfettered right over the child? That is the basic human rights question that will be presented to the parliament in the spring session.
The woman’s health and life are often used as a reason for termination. I accept that, where the mother is in imminent danger of her life, abortion is a choice; however, we are all only too aware that that is not the source of the majority of the some 100,000 abortions in Australia every year. Moreover, this argument put up to justify early-term abortions does not relate to late-term abortions because here the baby is viable. Any danger to the mother can be attended to by evacuating the baby. That is a medical fact. The debate is therefore brought back to the sole question of: is the adult entitled to an unfettered right over the child? That is all that a vote against the disallowance motion can amount to.
With regard to the medical process of late-term abortion, it must be distinguished clinically from an early-term abortion. The method is a more invasive and difficult surgical procedure. The doctor must undertake a greater physical and mental intent to terminate the baby. The Victorian Crimes Act, section 10, describes late-term abortion after 28 weeks as ‘child destruction’, which is a measure of what I mean by a physical and mental intent. The truth of the matter is that these babies are strong and fight for their lives. The latest figures from Victoria indicate that 47 out of 309 post-20-week abortions performed in 2005—the latest figures available—resulted in the delivery of a live baby who died shortly after delivery. Late-term abortion, therefore, is clinically different because the foetus is more mature and consequently larger, has recognisable human appearance, a solid bone structure, a well-developed cardiovascular and central nervous system and is responsive to painful stimuli. It has been well featured in pictures and documentaries that a baby in the womb responds to an invasion by a probing needle by placing its hands in front of its face to protect itself.
We cannot debate this issue and give it the gravity it deserves without knowing or acknowledging the methods undertaken to terminate the late-term baby. There are three methods and each requires delivery: firstly, killing the baby in the womb with a solution injected into the heart of the baby; secondly, dismembering the body in delivery; and, thirdly, a partial birth abortion—and the controversy of this method has been the subject of debate in the congress and the Senate of the United States and consequently banned.
In Australia the partial birth abortion method is certainly undertaken in the private clinics of the most prolific abortionist in Australia, Dr David Grundmann, and there is nothing to say that, at least to some extent, it has not been undertaken in Australian hospitals. Shockingly, this method, which would be known to most people who understand the gravity of late-term abortion—that is, partial birth abortion—does attract Medicare benefit.
There is no running from the facts. What this method means to the unborn warrants the absolute truth. I will therefore quote from the Washington Times, on 29 February 1996, when the newspaper described in detail the partial birth abortion method as follows:
Partial birth abortion is a gruesome procedure that is even opposed by many who support ... legal abortion. In the procedure, which commonly takes place after the foetus is about 6 months old, the foetus’ feet and torso are delivered ... while its head remains in the birth canal. The abortionist then stabs the base of the foetus’ skull with scissors and inserts a catheter into the opening. The catheter is used to suck out brain matter, which kills the foetus and allows the skull to collapse for easy delivery.
As I say, this shocking method does attract Medicare benefit.
The landmark case in 1969 entitled the Menhennitt ruling, which effectively legalised abortion on demand in Australia, never contemplated late-term abortion, nor it was contemplated by society until recently. This is evidenced by the fact that, in my own state of Victoria, late-term abortions have been illegal. Section 10 of the Crimes Act specifically states that an abortion after 28 weeks is termed ‘child destruction’ and is a criminal offence. However, the Menhennitt ruling is being used to justify the hundreds of late-term and, consequently, illegal abortions that occur in Victoria. The laws are contradictory in the eyes of those who seek legitimacy for late-term abortions; however, they are not contradictory for those who believe there is a line in the sand to be drawn at late-term abortions.
As evidenced by the much publicised late-term abortion case of 32 weeks at the Royal Women’s Hospital in 2001, no responsible Victorian authority would enforce the law that is on the statutes. Although that law may be dormant, under the current gaggle of state authorities, while it exists, it still acts as some form of deterrent to doctors and hospital administrations. The Menhennitt ruling referred to abortion as ‘a necessity to save the health and life of the mother’. So the word ‘necessity’ is crucial, given that, if the mother’s health is in danger in a late-term pregnancy, the baby’s viability is not in conflict with the rights or life of the mother. Basically, that negates the Menhennitt ruling; in other words, there is no necessity to abort but rather to deliver a life.
What of the question of life itself? When does life begin? That question, once central, is still relevant to this debate today. In 1969, when Menhennitt ruled, the common belief of pro-choicers was that the foetus was not life, at least at anything less than 12 weeks. In this regard, over the past decade, science has been the instigator of a major shift in attitude. Science has proven that all senses and early body form exist within seven days, and the rate of growth of the embryo between one and seven days is as fast as it is during any other term of the whole human experience. In other words, the embryo is hurtling towards its human existence and selfhood.
I make this point to show that the old debate of whether or not the foetus is a life is over. Society and even pro-choicers now accept that it is life; the science is too compelling. Then, if that is the case for early term, how could personhood be denied of the baby in late term—the second and third trimesters? As I said at another time in this place, to leave this new wave of child destruction unchecked will place us on a roller-coaster ride to the outer limits.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-06-26,"—In this debate on the appropriation bills, I want to speak about what I consider to be a quite disgraceful attack on the incumbent Governor-General, Major General Michael Jeffery, in the national media yesterday. His Excellency Major General Jeffery has been an outstanding representative of Her Majesty in Australia, both during his original vice regal appointment as Governor of Western Australia from 1993 to 2000 and during his subsequent appointment as the 24th Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia. He has also been a very mature and experienced part of the process of governance, both in Western Australia and in the Commonwealth. His Excellency was a distinguished and decorated senior Australian Defence Force member. He served with distinction in Malaya, Vietnam and Papua New Guinea. I am pleased that the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, thought fit to nominate Major General Jeffery for the position.
I particularly want to thank His Excellency Major General Jeffery for the very visible visit he made to Townsville earlier this year, principally to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Royal Australian Regiment of which he was a distinguished leader at one stage of his military career. I thank him for the way that he interacted with the Townsville community during the visit. It was, I think, representative of the way His Excellency has interacted with all Australians in all of his dealings in his role as Governor-General. During that visit to North Queensland, he and his wife were very gracious and the Governor-General demonstrated the sort of interest that he has taken in all things Australian since becoming our leader.
I understand from media reports that the allegation of Major General Jeffery leaking documents some years ago was made by what was described as ‘a former Labor minister’. The former Labor minister, who clearly did not have the courage to put his name to the accusation, was quoted as saying:
We never found any evidence, but if I had caught him leaking I would have executed him ...
I think that is a fairly despicable revelation—and all the more so, given the Labor Party’s concession that there was no evidence whatsoever to suggest that Major General Jeffery had engaged in such conduct. I note that His Excellency has described the allegation as repugnant and defamatory—and it is, I suggest, repugnant, defamatory and quite despicable.
I find it degrading that the Governor-General, who has maintained strict political neutrality and brought great honour not only to the vice-regal role but as a distinguished and decorated soldier, should be subjected to the vindictive spite of former Keating government ministers. Given that the media reports quote three senior members of the ALP, it is clearly a concerted attack on His Excellency’s reputation. The Prime Minister has a responsibility to ensure that his senior party members are not going around rubbishing the Governor-General or spreading false rumours, particularly when they are acknowledged as being false.
When Their Excellencies retire in early September, I wish them all the best and look forward to Major General Jeffery, in the long tradition of former Governors-General like Sir Zelman Cowen and Sir Ninian Stephen, continuing to make a distinguished contribution to the nation as a former Governor-General.
While I am on this subject, I also want to congratulate Queensland Governor and Governor-General Designate, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, on her appointment by Her Majesty as the 25th Governor-General of Australia. I think that Her Excellency will be a great Governor-General, and I look forward to her taking up her new vice-regal appointment. I note that both the Governor-General Designate, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, and Governor-General Jeffery are former or soon-to-be-former state governors. I want to congratulate the current government on following the previous government’s precedent in elevating a distinguished state governor to the post of Governor-General.
Her Excellency is widely respected in Queensland. She is a very, very gracious person and has carried out her duties as Queensland Governor in an exemplary fashion. I am particularly pleased to see that someone who hails from country Queensland has been chosen as our nation’s next Governor-General. Her Excellency comes from Ilfracombe, which is a very little town in Central Queensland, out near Longreach. Her elevation was a great delight to the people of that small town of about 270 people. I think it is a great indication of Australia and being Australian that someone from a small country town right out in the centre of the bush can rise to be the leader of our nation, taking on the most significant role in the governance of our nation. I do understand the role and the constraints that there will be on the new Governor-General, but I certainly look forward to Her Excellency highlighting the plight and also the potential of country Australia in her new role.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,50,1,speech
"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,2008-06-26,"—I am feeling nostalgic today. This will be my last speech on a budget; indeed, my last speech in the Senate. I first came to this parliament in 1975, at the tender age of 26 years old. Nothing takes me back to those days like a good, old-fashioned, class warfare Labor budget, a bash-the-rich budget, a budget that punishes people’s aspirations, a budget with the politics of envy and payback. Ah, the days when—to use taxidermy terminology—Labor always stuffed the economy! Here we go again. As Treasurer, Wayne Swan is Jim Cairns without the charisma. This budget, cobbled together by a work-experience Treasurer, is based on two things and two things alone: Labor Party ideology, as deeply embedded as a mutant gene that is passed from one generation to another, and a shameless appetite for the approval of the left-leaning media. The sad reality is that neither of these priorities addresses the best interests of the Australian economy or the very working families who entrusted their future to the Rudd Labor government at the last election.
I ask Treasurer Swan: what do the following have in common—prickly pear, cane toads, the soursob, the rabbit? Give up? They are all examples of unintended consequences. Mr Swan has brought down a budget riddled with unintended consequences. The boys from Brissie have smuggled a few cane toads south of the border. They claim they are drafting a budget to control inflation, and they deliver a budget that fuels inflation. Did I say fuel? I bet the blood drains from the faces of those opposite when I mention fuel. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation runs about for months like Edward Scissorhands, promising to cut expenditure to the bone. Labor present a budget that increases government spending and, as a consequence, pushes inflation higher. They promise a budget to improve the lives of working families. They bring down a budget that they blandly admit will increase unemployment—the first budget in 11 years to do so. Labor claim to represent working families. They ensure that there will be fewer families working. Unintended consequences indeed.
Let me offer some specific examples. Labor’s budget increases the income threshold for the Medicare surcharge from $50,000 to $100,000 a year income for singles and from $100,000 to $150,000 for couples. This is a policy based not on economic common sense but entirely on ingrained Labor ideology. It will have a devastating impact on our public health system, which is already suffering under the mismanagement of state Labor governments. The reality of this policy is that it will drive people and, more importantly, working families out of private health cover and force them back into the public hospital system. Here is the irony: while this policy herds more and more people back into the public health system, it simultaneously ensures that fewer and fewer people will be paying the surcharge which funds that very system—unintended consequences.
The government’s own budget papers and the Treasurer himself have confirmed that they expect 500,000 people will leave private health cover—that is, half a million extra people will rely on the public system, which is already buckling under Labor’s state-by-state mismanagement. Include their families, and Labor have added over a million extra patients to the public hospital queues, which are, of course, already obscenely overstretched. What makes it even worse is the sheer hypocrisy of Labor’s scare tactics. The Prime Minister, Treasurer Swan and their spear carriers have been playing the politics of fear in the media by talking up a so-called inflation crisis. There is no doubt that we are currently experiencing a period of rising inflation. But, if their rhetoric is correct and we face an inflation crisis, why would any government introduce a policy which encourages people to withdraw from private health cover—effectively putting an extra $50 to $200 per month of disposable income back into those people’s pockets?
The Rudd government cannot have it both ways. Either consumer spending needs to be constrained or it does not. Either the public health system needs more funding or it does not. Labor cannot spend an entire election campaign and its first six months in office saying one thing and then deliver a budget that is creaking with policies that deliver the exact opposite. These are very real objections. These are sound economic arguments. The government simply confronts them with spin. When I say ‘spin’, I mean the googly, the flipper and the doosra all rolled into one. The Labor Party operates under an entrenched ideology which, at its heart, proclaims free universal health care for all. It emerges in this screwball budget as a resentment and disdain for private health cover. Do not get me wrong—we all agree that universal, free, high-quality health care is an admirable goal. But we on this side of the Senate—the Liberal and National parties—are realists. We know that someone actually has to pay to achieve that admirable goal. If you massively reduce the number of people paying the surcharge and propping up the system, those with even a basic grasp of economics—and here I am magnanimously including the Treasurer—know what the consequence will be: less funds to service those who already rely on the system, let alone the huge influx of people enticed back into the system. The inevitable flow-on result will be higher private health premiums—cane toads!
Then there was that other well-orchestrated leak, the increase in the tax on luxury vehicles from 25 per cent to 33 per cent. The luxury car tax currently kicks in when a car costs $57,000. But here is what Treasurer Swan has failed to consider: this figure has not been indexed to account for inflation since its inception in 1999. His statement that individuals who buy these cars can afford it is spiteful, insulting and dangerous.
—And wrong.
—It is wrong, Senator Macdonald. A major factor pushing up the price of vehicles in this range is the increasingly sophisticated safety and environmental features they offer. This new measure will result in car makers reducing state-of-the-art safety features or environmental advances in their vehicles simply to scrape in under the tax threshold. The unintended consequences of this class-warfare policy may prove fatal for some Australian motorists, leaving the government with blood on its hands.
As if families have not suffered enough under this budget, you would not want to be a working family with three kids and about to have your fourth. You will now find the family Tarago is even more expensive, and that is before the cost of filling it with petrol. I forgot about Fuelwatch, or, as Minister Martin Ferguson calls it, ‘fuel botch’. Minister Ferguson went off to apply the blowtorch to OPEC. I will say this: they were impressed when he addressed them in Arabic, until they realised he was not speaking Arabic. Let’s take bets: how long before Kevin 07 becomes Kevin 03.8c a litre off? Closer to home for me, you would not want to be a blue-collar worker on the assembly line of Holden’s Elizabeth plant in South Australia building Statesmen that will now fall foul of this threshold. Can Treasurer Swan guarantee that no Australian car-manufacturing jobs will be lost?
Now let us jump into one of those luxury cars that so offend the Treasurer. Let us mortgage the house to fill it with petrol. Let us drive to rural and regional Australia, to places and people abandoned by Labor. Those people have suffered terribly under this budget. At the end of his budget speech, the Treasurer asserted:
It is a Labor Budget for the nation. For Australia’s future. For all Australians.
Well, this was certainly a Labor budget—and that is hardly a compliment in economic circles. But it was not a budget for all Australians, and it damn well was not a budget for the future of rural Australia and the people who are already doing it tough after years of record drought. We rightly condemn the callousness of the Burmese generals in the face of their people’s current tragic suffering from natural disaster. Labor’s Burmese corporals have similarly reacted with uncaring neglect for those who are suffering in the bush and enduring long-term hardship. Labor has chosen to abolish the Regional Partnerships program and the Growing Regions program. It will rip $436 million out of our regions and abolish programs which are aimed at developing our regional centres and communities, creating and maintaining jobs in regional Australia and keeping our farming families on the land. Do we start to see where Labor’s admitted increase in unemployment will happen? Do we see who it targets and punishes? This government for all Australians has chosen to pull $334 million out of existing agriculture programs and replace them with entirely different programs worth $220 million, which is far less.
In the process of kicking rural Australia while it is down, Labor has chosen to cancel the OPEL contract, which would have enabled access to high-speed broadband for 99 per cent of Australians. It has provided no funding for an alternative other than to extend the Howard government’s Australian Broadband Guarantee. Enough is enough. The bush has been the backbone of this nation since Federation. The government’s own budget papers show that. They confirm that rural and remote Australians account for over one-third of the population and generate two-thirds of Australia’s export income. But regional Australia is suffering. It suffered terribly in recent years under one of the worst droughts on record. How does this cynical Rudd Labor government respond? It sticks the boot into rural Australian families again by reducing exceptional circumstances funding. This is not a government for all Australians; it is a government for all Australians who conform to the 1950s ideology of the Labor Party. This is a budget that panders to Labor’s supporters and punishes anyone it myopically sees as its class enemies.
I am wondering what schools and the environment did to alienate this government and get onto its enemies list, because they are not left untouched by this work experience budget either. I would have thought that, with this government’s AEU mates funding its election campaign and the Greens preferencing Labor, the environment and education would be two areas spared the ideological idiocy of this budget. Think again. The green voucher program introduced under the Howard government, which enabled schools to apply for up to $50,000 for rainwater tanks and solar hot water systems, was also neutered by Treasurer Swan’s budget for all Australians. This program has been replaced by a new one that caps the available funding at $30,000, which leaves schools—and that essentially means parents—to raise the missing $20,000.
I have seen the green vouchers program in action. Schools like St Martin de Porres in the electorate of Kingston, and many others in South Australia, welcomed their green voucher with open arms when I presented it to them. These schools work hard at fundraising, not just to improve their own facilities but also for a range of charities. Their parents are not the so-called wealthy that the Prime Minister and Treasurer Swan were going after in this budget; they are ordinary working Australians, and most of them are in families with both parents working. Without the $50,000 green voucher, parents like these will be forced to sacrifice more time and find more money so that their school and their children can set an environmentally responsible example. As one unintended consequence after another of this budget is considered, one begins to ask: what are the intended consequences, if any, aside from sinking the boot into those that Labor hates? Did I mention that St Martin de Porres is a private school?
In this instance, schools will prioritise. With the Labor states critically underfunding education, schools already have to fundraise to provide basic infrastructure and services. Now Treasurer Swan’s king hit means that, while they would love to pursue practical, environmentally responsible measures like solar hot water and rainwater tanks, without the former government’s green vouchers they cannot put these items ahead of sports facilities, shade shelters and IT equipment. What a fine message to send to the next generation of Australians while you are signing the Kyoto protocol with the other hand! The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Peter Garrett, should be blushing to the point of his bald head about such senseless false economics. But then, he may have used up his quota of embarrassment after decimating the Australian domestic solar panel industry inside a fortnight with another stroke of Treasurer Swan’s poison pen. You have to wonder how much midnight oil was burned dreaming up those idiocies in the name of budget savings. Now Minister Garrett is off to the International Whaling Commission, having already been harpooned by his Prime Minister’s capitulation to the Japanese in order to save his own face after gratuitously snubbing our major Asian ally. Anyone who saw Prime Minister Rudd’s meeting with the Japanese royal family will have noticed that our emperor was wearing no clothes.
The frustration for parents and schools does not end with the abolition of green vouchers. During the last election campaign, Kevin 07 spouted another slogan, for this is a government of slogans, mantras and empty catch phrases: education revolution. He would be the Che Guevara of the classroom. If elected, he would provide one computer for every high school student in the country—one computer in a box, terrific! But another definition of a revolution is ‘going around in circles’. He had not thought about what happens when you take the computer out of the box. Who is going to pay for all the stuff you need to make a computer a useful teaching tool—basic stuff like rewiring all the high school classrooms in the country, all those extra power points and electricity bills, software purchasing and licensing, equipment maintenance and repairs, internet access, virus systems, mousepads, disks, USB drives, printers and all the extra training for all the extra teachers? Who is going to pay for those things? Guess what, schools and parents of Australia: you are. The Prime Minister is not going to. There is no provision in this budget for all the essential extras without which the computer stays in the box and gathers dust.
—Quite right.
—Indeed, Senator Macdonald. Maybe your school’s fundraising committee can scrounge a few extra dollars after you have paid for the solar hot-water system and the rainwater tank. Then there is this government’s ill-considered plan for trade training centres in every school, which was developed just to be different from our plan for specialist trade schools. Treasurer Swan has announced $2.5 billion in this budget to honour that promise. I am sure our schools will be delighted, until they divide the allocated funding by the number of schools and discover that each of them can now purchase a lathe or a welder. Of course, there will not be anyone to teach the kids how to use them. If your child wants to be an electrician, or pursue any other trade, then they might have to change schools. But look on the bright side—they can now take their new computer with them because it will still be in its box.
Of course computers and trade equipment are commendable, but if they are misdelivered then they are of no use. You cannot provide a quality education for the leaders of tomorrow, you cannot even begin to reverse the effects of the global dumbing down of education systems everywhere, without high-quality teachers dedicated to the future of Australia’s children. While this government has ploughed billions of dollars into headline-grabbing programs of dubious long-term impact, they have cut the Howard government’s summer schools, which were designed to inspire and further educate our teachers. Minister Gillard should go and sit in the corner. She is a class hater Arthur Calwell would have embraced, just as she laid one on Treasurer Swan on budget night.
Now Foreign Minister Smith is reinventing nuclear policy on the run in India. Next it is a seat on the UN Security Council, instructing South Africa on how to fix Zimbabwe and an Asian version of the European Economic Community—all of it the politics of hubris and distraction. The Prime Minister just does not get it; it is the economy, stupid. Budgets set a framework within which a government will work for the next 12 months. They are the clearest outline of what a government stands for. They define in dollars and cents a government’s vision for the future of the nation. In this case the budget serves to expose hype and hypocrisy.
For the last 11 years I have sat in this place and been inspired on budget night by the direction our nation was taking. Budgets were presented with vision and responded to economic and social challenges with innovative and responsible solutions. Sadly, this year I was left with a sense of emptiness. We need more than spin and empty rhetoric from a federal government. This cannot be a budget for all Australians when our rural Australians are delivered yet another raw deal. You need to understand that, when you sit behind a big desk in Canberra, you need to get out into the community, and Labor failed to do that. So this budget fails to deliver. It is a sad budget that squanders the inheritance from the previous government. As I said, it is a budget of unintended consequences. I am confident that in two years time, or possibly less if the rumours are true, the Australian people will see the Rudd government and dismiss it for what it is—an unintended consequence.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2008-06-26,"—Yesterday I sought leave to take note of documents tabled on 23 June 2008 by Senator Faulkner relating to sports grants and I was told that leave would be granted today. Therefore, I again seek leave to move to take note of the document.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Often in politics, as in many other fields, the original offence is not a problem but the cover-up that follows the offence destroys careers. Accordingly, we could probably forgive or excuse or understand the massive pork-barrelling that was advanced by this government before the election; the duplicity, the culture of deceit, the argument that ‘we are fiscally conservative and we will not buy this election’. But they did, and it has clearly undermined the reputation of Mr Tanner, Mr Rudd and the machine men of the Labor Party. The problem is that there is an innocent victim in this, and it threatens to destroy her career because there is a cover-up of absolutely massive proportions.
The Minister for Sport boasted on television about 100 projects that had been committed to by the Rudd Labor government during the election campaign. Further information suggested there was over $100 million worth of pork-barrelling rolled out by the Rudd government, in opposition, for sports and community grants. These projects may indeed be worthwhile. Some of them may indeed pass the ‘prince of pork’ test. But I suspect that many of them will not. The Minister for Sport was asked to deliver a list of these projects through the Senate. While she showed enormous contempt for the Senate, as did whoever in the Labor leadership was delivering them up here, she was very proud to tell a House of Representatives committee last week that she had delivered on all the election commitments in this area.
A list of election commitments cannot be that hard to provide, even for the most inexperienced minister or member of parliament. The Senate asked for the documents to be laid on the table. What was produced was not 100 projects, not an additional 30 projects, but a total of 35 projects which included the original 15 that had been provided. This is absolute contempt of this place by not only the Labor leadership here but also the minister herself. It has undermined the standing of the minister, and some of the Labor leadership here, I have to tell you. But the buck has to stop somewhere and, unfortunately, in this case, it doesn’t stop with Mr Rudd, no matter how much he claims that it should; it stops with Minister Ellis. The cover-up is an absolute scandal.
Let us look at the list for a moment and examine what is missing. There are a whole lot of things missing from the list, but I am going to create the Senate version of The Rich List TV show and we will just deal with, say, a top eight today. Let us have a look at the seat of Makin. Tony Zappia, the new member for Makin, is proudly boasting about the pork barrel grants that have been issued there: $200,000 for the Para Hills Soccer Club, $50,000 for the Ingle Farm Soccer Club, $50,000 for the Golden Grove baseball club. Were any of these on Minister Ellis’s election commitment list? The answer is no. What about the $1 million for the North East Hockey Club, the $875,000 for the Hope Valley community centre or the $500,000 for the Tea Tree Gully football club? Were any of these on the list that Minister Ellis provided? The answer is no. But what about the $160,000 commitment to the Traralgon West sports complex? The minister herself reannounced this project on the 20th of this month. On the 23rd of this month, when the documents were tabled, do you think that was on the list? The answer is no, it was not on the list. None of these things were on the list—and the list of what was not on the list is enormous.
Let me turn my mind to one other project. What about the Penrith Valley sports hub—do you think that was on the list? Yes, it was. Finally, something is on the list, and it was on the list to the tune of $250,000 in grants. There is nothing wrong with that, except for the fact that the $250,000 worth of grants to the Penrith Valley sports hub is listed in the budget papers as a $5 million grant. There is a $4.7 million black hole: a cover-up of monumental proportions. It is a cover-up that is caused by incompetence, incapacity or instruction. Any one of those three means that Minister Ellis needs to get her whiteboard in order. Need I remind her of what happens if your whiteboard is not in order? Her predecessor Ros Kelly lost her job over sports rorts No.1. No-one is blaming Minister Ellis for announcing these grants because she inherited the portfolio afterwards. But now we have got sports rorts 2, and that means that Minister Ellis is going to wear it. She has been asked to become a human shield for the fragile but gigantic ego of the ‘prince of pork’ himself, the Prime Minister. The challenge now is for Minister Ellis to wheel out the whiteboard—
—I rise on a point of order. I request that the spokesperson withdraw that comment. I do not think it is appropriate for you to be using language like that in this place. I allowed it when you spoke in the appropriations, but I think that you are just overdoing it now.
—Madam Acting Deputy President, that term has been used repeatedly in this chamber. If it is unparliamentary and I am asked to withdraw it, I will.
 (Senator Carol Brown)—I would ask you to withdraw it.
—I withdraw it. But the challenge now is for Minister Ellis to wheel out the whiteboard to save her own bacon, or she will be remembered as the queen of cover-ups and her legacy will be sport rorts 2. There is a great deal more to go in this saga, let me assure you of that. It is time for the government to come clean and put all of their lists on the table. To do anything else will prolong this cover-up, but it will not prolong or sustain the Rudd Labor government.",SENATE,<title>ELECTION COMMITMENTS</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,56,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,2008-06-26,"—I rise to speak on the motion that was moved by Senator Bernardi. This is an extraordinary story, I have to say. There is an issue that has emerged. Prior to the election—in fact, for the 12 to 18 months prior to the election—Lindsay Tanner and Mr Albanese spent a great deal of time criticising the Howard government for our pre-election commitments, and some very unkind comments were made. What we did not actually know at that time was that, while Messrs Tanner and Albanese were attacking the Howard government on our pre-election commitments, they were planning the largest pork barrel in Australian history. What Senator Bernardi has indicated is that already we have found some 116 sporting grants to sporting bodies that were made in the run-up to the last election, which are valued at over $100 million.
—How much?
—One hundred million dollars. I have a list here which I think establishes the point I have made. I seek leave to have this incorporated in Hansard. I have shown the list to the Labor Party.
—We have not had the opportunity to see it.
Leave not granted.
—This is again totally in line with the policy of trying to hide these grants.

Senator McLucas interjecting—

—Senator, a list of the grants was shown to the Labor Party. I asked whether this list could be incorporated in Hansard. I made it clear that the list was prepared by my office. Once again, the Labor Party has refused to allow this information to be put on the public record. As I said, while the Howard government were being attacked for what was allegedly pork-barrelling, we did not know that the Labor Party were preparing the largest pork barrel in Australian history. I made the point that all we are doing is speaking about sporting grants. We are not speaking about the vast range of other grants that the Labor Party made in the course of the election. I think Minister Ellis has been put in a very difficult position. I believe her to be a conscientious minister, a minister who is seeking to work hard on behalf of the sporting community, and I make no attack on Minister Ellis in that regard. Minister Ellis has been asked by the machine men, by people in the PM’s office and presumably by people in Tanner’s office to attempt to cover up the vast range of pork-barrelling which occurred in the sporting area.
The Labor Party has a rather unfortunate history in this regard. Remember that then minister for sport, Ros Kelly, was sacked over what is now termed sports rorts 1. In its final phase, it totalled, I think, about $30 million. Contrast the $30 million that Ros Kelly was sacked for with this $100 million plus—and growing almost daily as we get new figures in to show the large scale of grants. It is not for me really to advise Minister Ellis, but my view would be this: Tanner and Albanese prepared a major pork-barrelling exercise. They should wear the odium of it. I do not think Minister Ellis should wear the odium of it. I do not think that the advisers to Minister Ellis are aware of just what powers this Senate has. I suspect they are expert in the ways of the other place—possibly some of them have come from state arenas—but they are now dealing with the Senate. The Senate has very extensive powers to obtain information and extensive powers to make sure that this is debated. Our procedures would allow this to be debated virtually every day in this chamber as the information came to hand.
I shall be leaving the Senate, so I shall not be leading that debate or taking part, but I suspect I am not letting any secrets out of the bag when I say that Senator Bernardi will be very active over the break. Senator Bernardi will be contacting a lot of organisations over the break. I can perhaps share with the Senate some of the methods that he will be using. He will be speaking to organisations close to those bodies which have received grants but did not receive grants themselves. I suspect that, over the next three months, a great deal more information will be obtained. I just want to state again what I believe is the best advice for Minister Ellis: simply table the list of grants which she has been asked to administer.
We are not interested, really, in the argument that these grants are going to be administered correctly, because we believe they will be. Any government would be foolish not to make sure that the grants were administered in an effective way. The big issue is this, and I think people have to understand it: a massive degree of pork-barrelling has occurred—
—The largest in history.
—probably the largest that we have ever seen. The second thing is that there is a huge effort to have it covered up. During the estimates process I asked some senior public servants if we could have a list of the election commitments that were being administered by their department. That was a very straightforward question. To be quite frank, I was embarrassed for the senior public servants who had to fend off these questions. And I say to the Labor Party: the contempt that the public service must start to feel when they are asked to take part in a Labor Party cover-up should not be underestimated. You cannot treat people in this fashion. You cannot ask senior public servants—secretaries of departments—to attempt to obfuscate and to pretend that they have not got lists of the election commitments which they are being asked to administer. It is not right to require that of senior people in the public service. I have to say that it is yet another example of how Labor is failing in its relations with the Australian Public Service.
My argument is simply this: all of us know that pork-barrelling occurred to an extraordinary extent during the last election. We know it occurred in the area of sports. I have a list here which I have been prevented by Senator Wortley from tabling. I do not want Senator Wortley to take part in a cover-up. That would be most unfortunate. I do think that it is important that the public know precisely what has occurred under the Labor Party, and I make it very clear to the chamber that I have no doubt that this matter is going to be vigorously pursued by my colleagues in the days, the weeks and the months to come.",SENATE,<title>ELECTION COMMITMENTS</title>,<title>Return to Order</title>,Miscellaneous,56,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I think it is appropriate that I respond to some of the points that have been made by Senator Bernardi and Senator Kemp. First of all, I would like to go to the issue, Senator Kemp, of why leave was not granted to table the document that you wished to table. It is normal practice in this place, as you know, that documents are shown in good time to the whip—to the Government Whip in this case. I think you would certainly agree that a couple of minutes before beginning to speak on a contentious question, a politically contentious question—
—It’s not contentious; it’s factual.
—I will go to that point in a moment, Senator Bernardi. But that is the normal process and that was not followed. Senator Bernardi has used quite the language of opposition. It suits him well. He has learnt it quickly. It is very easy to use very colourful language with flourish when you are in your position, Senator Bernardi. But the thing is that you have been told on a number of occasions why we are in this situation—why we are going through the proper process and why we are ensuring that due diligence is undertaken, unlike what the former government did in the infamous Regional Partnerships program. We are undertaking the process correctly, and Senator Bernardi simply does not want to listen. He is trying to run a story out there in the media and the legitimate answers to his questions do not suit his story so he prefers not to listen.
In total there are over 100 separate facilities projects across health and infrastructure. We are progressively working through the task of conducting some basic due diligence on each one. Progressively we are making formal, independent, public announcements when those due diligence processes have been completed. This is what Senator Bernardi refuses to understand. This is the way you spend taxpayers’ money wisely. This is what you need to do before you spend taxpayers’ money. You simply need to find out whether or not the project will be delivered. That is why you do due diligence. That was not done, and I have many examples of when it was not done, in Regional Partnerships. The process of negotiating and conducting a proper funding agreement with project proponents is an ongoing one. Senator Bernardi has raised a couple of specific examples, and I will give some information to the Senate on those.
In respect of facilities funding in Penrith there are two separate projects: one project is the Penrith stadium upgrade of $5 million and another is the Penrith Valley Regional Sports Centre upgrade of $250,000. I can confirm that both have received funding in the budget and, while a funding agreement has yet to be concluded for either, we do not envisage there being any impediments to the conclusion of funding agreements for each of these two Penrith projects in the future.
—Why did you try to hide them then?
—Well, if you had not been talking to your whip when I was explaining the process, Senator Bernardi, you might have actually understood. You might like to have a look at the Hansard and then you will understand what in fact due diligence is.

Senator Bernardi interjecting—

 (Senator Troeth)—Order! I have allowed a reasonable amount of interjection, and I am happy to take that, but the level of interjection is becoming disorderly. You have had your moment and Senator McLucas needs to have hers.
—I can also confirm that funding for the Traralgon West Sports Complex was announced by the government on 20 June. This is an example of how the number of projects formally announced by the government post budget will continue to increase week by week as the due diligence process is completed and as discussions are held with proponents and potential other funding sources.
This is a government doing the right thing—making sure that taxpayers’ money that is going to be spent will deliver the outcome that is expected. We could remember the $400,000 that was paid to the Indigo Cheese Company—the cheese factory whose doors were in fact closed, with $22,000 being paid to them three months after the closure. We could remember the half a million dollars that was given to the Mareeba wildlife park about a month and a half before it went into receivership.
—And you were opposed to that wildlife park.
—That is what your government did, Senator Abetz—a half a million dollars.
—And?
—It went into receivership about six weeks after you gave them that money, so it is dead. It is not happening. Half a million dollars went nowhere. That is because due diligence was not undertaken. That is why we are undertaking due diligence now. It is a good and sensible process to go through and one that Senator Bernardi is determined not to understand. There will therefore be a rolling schedule of public statements as the due diligence process continues and subsequent formal announcements are made by the government. The government has absolutely nothing to hide and certainly nothing to fear. While we are proud of funding over 100 local sports facilities projects in the budget, we are also pleased to ensure there is an appropriate process in place before formally announcing project funding after the budget.
While we are happy to clear up any confusion, Senator Bernardi might reflect upon the fact that the coalition did not follow such due process when administering their now famous Regional Partnerships program and Sustainable Regions program. The fact that the opposition got the process so wrong has reaffirmed the government’s resolve to get this process right. As I said earlier, Senator Bernardi thinks he has a story that he can trot around to the papers. Senator Bernardi does not bother listening to the very sensible answers that the minister provided in a statement to the Senate yesterday and that I hope I have been able to provide today. This is good government, good practice, making sure that we do not end up doing things like your government did—that is, throwing money around wildly without undertaking any due diligence on the process.
If I had some more time, and had had a little more time to prepare, I could have gone through the many projects that started the whole inquiry into the Regional Partnerships program and the Sustainable Regions program. Have you read the Australian National Audit Office’s report that, one by one, goes through the lack of process that was undertaken by the previous government and as a result the abject waste of taxpayers’ money? We do not have time to do that now. This government has learned from the previous government’s mistakes and we intend to ensure that taxpayers’ money allocated to good sporting projects and good facilities projects will turn benefits for those small communities. We do not want to be throwing money where it is not going to turn into an outcome.
Senator Bernardi, I hope I have been able to provide some clarity in answer to your questions but I do fear that your desire for a headline means that you will not bother thinking through what this government is doing—that is, being wise with taxpayers’ money so that we get an outcome for children and for users of sporting facilities around Australia. I think my fears are right—I think Senator Bernardi is still seeking that headline and not bothering to listen to the answer.

"Wortley, Sen Dana",ALP,2008-06-26,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I welcome the opportunity to add my voice to those already heard in this place on Appropriation Bills numbers 1 and 2, and in doing so will also make some observations on Appropriation Bill number 5.
At the foundation of these bills is Labor’s commitment to the electorate.
These bills represent the Government’s determination to deliver on the promises made to the Australian people.
In doing so, the Rudd Labor Government is returning decency and confidence to the democratic process—confidence which was sorely tried by our predecessors.
WorkChoices, education cuts, children overboard, disinvestment in skills training and infrastructure, non-core promises, a complete disregard for climate change and the list goes on.
Unlike the former government that neglected vital nation-building investment, this Government is determined take the hard steps, do the hard yards, to ensure a safe, prosperous and equitable future for all.
As the Treasurer explained on Budget night, the principles on which our package of interconnected, coherent reforms is based are fourfold:
security for working families,
adhering to our commitments,
investment for the future and
fiscal responsibility.
This Government is committed to delivering its Working Families Support Package.
Over four years, $55 billion will be expended on targeted programs in tax reform, child care, housing, education, and related matters including dental health - not to mention supported accommodation for disabled people with aged carers.
This Government is investing in the skills and education sector, hospitals and health, infrastructure particularly water, to which I will return and sustainability
And this Labor Government is looking to the future in a way that the previous government could not possibly have contemplated.
Through these bills, we propose to the Australian people a Building Australia Fund to alleviate the neglect of critical transport and communication infrastructure, an Education Investment Fund to finance capital works in our dilapidated education and vocational education sector and a Health and Hospital Fund to ensure renewal of hospital facilities, investment in technology and the fostering of research projects and facilities.
These bills are economically responsible and have been formulated to reprioritise spending away from ad hoc, electorally-expedient spending to sustainable growth and the reduction of inflation.
Appropriation Bills numbers 1 and 2 represent two of the principal items of legislation supporting the Rudd Labor Government’s first Budget.
The major items provided for in Appropriation Bill number 5 are education and infrastructure in this instance water.
As a proud representative of South Australia, and as a former educator, both have particular resonance for me, and that is why I address these items now.
I turn first to education.
A strong and appropriately resourced education sector is vital to Australia’s future, both locally and, of course, in terms of our international competitiveness. One of the cornerstones of our future well-being as a community and of our economic security is, undoubtedly, investment in education.
OECD research clearly demonstrates the sliding scale of the neglect, the downgrading of facilities, and in certain instances the wilful failure to act of the previous government in this particular area the result being the crisis we are dealing with in the education sector today.
In the decade since 1995, Australia was the only OECD country to effectively disinvest in the tertiary sector - just when additional funds were so desperately needed!
As I said in this place just prior to the last election, to give a young Australian the chance to get ahead, to maximise his or her potential, to take a valued place in a forward-looking, contemporary society, is one of the most important things a Government (can) do. And the Rudd Labor Government is acting now to alleviate the past capital disinvestment and underinvestment in this crucial sector.
The Government will provide an additional $500 million in the current financial year to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations for distribution among Australian universities. The funds will be allocated to capital investment in five priority areas.
These areas include:
IT communications in research and teaching,
laboratories,
libraries and places to study,
teaching spaces and
investment in critical student amenities.
I wholeheartedly commend this measure, as I do the water initiatives that formed the greater part of the balance of the appropriation.
The Government does not resile on its promise to tackle our water crisis. Indeed, it has already taken enormous strides in doing so.
Through Appropriations Bill number 5, the Government has provided an additional $112.3 million to the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts to fund a variety of water initiatives. These initiatives reflect the Government’s recognition that the water situation is absolutely critical and that urgent action must be taken.
The Rudd Labor Government is determined to act on this country’s needs for the future and that includes addressing areas of health that have so seriously been neglected by the previous government.
Today I speak of an issue that is having an increasingly adverse effect, not only on the physical and social health of our community, but also on our economy and the future productivity of our nation.
I refer, of course, to the issue of obesity.
Every person present in this chamber is aware of the escalating need to confront this issue.
But the Rudd Government understands that obesity is an issue which, if left unaddressed, would have the capacity to burden our health system with an explosion of preventable diseases.
Disturbingly, latest available Bureau of Statistics survey figures released in January 2008 show that in 2005, 7.4 million people aged 18 years and over were classified as overweight or obese that’s 54 per cent of the adult population! And these figures represent an increase from 5.4 million adults, or 45 per cent of the adult population, in 1995.
Figures adjusted to reflect differences between the age structures of indigenous and non-indigenous populations during the same survey period indicate that indigenous adults were more than twice as likely to be overweight or obese than non-indigenous adults.
Just as alarmingly, one in four Australian children is now overweight or obese.
What does the future hold for these children, these indigenous people, these present and potential contributors to our common good?
The direct consequences of overweight and obesity may include, among other conditions, coronary heart disease, diabetes, breast and other cancers, gallstones, degenerative joint disease, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea.
And the burden of chronic disease does not fall solely on the individual. An Access Economics study carried out also in 2005 showed that annual productivity loss from obesity related conditions was approximately $1.7 billion, with the net aggregate cost of the impact on the health system, carer costs, and the burden of disease on the community valued at an additional $17.2 billion the total, a staggering $21 billion.
We’re talking now about loss of inclusion through compromised ability to participate in community life, and cost to business not only through productivity loss but through lower participation and higher absenteeism.
The World Health Organisation reports that obesity is a global epidemic. Certainly obesity has reached epidemic proportions in Australia.
Physical inactivity and television viewing time have been shown to be the strongest correlates with measures of obesity, according to the most recent report of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study.
Poor diet, and our long work hours combined with sedentary lifestyles, are significant contributors.
Those who would argue this assertion have only to look around their electorates to see its proof.
And if that is not sufficient, I’m sure that Senators will be interested to receive some information drawn from, and ancillary to, the Annual Report of the National Health and Medical Research Council for 2006-2007.
Alive to the dangers inherent in an epidemic of obesity-related diseases, the NHMRC has allocated some $70 million to obesity related research during the period 2000-2007. This is the greatest area of cumulative expenditure in the five areas of nutrition- related issues over that period.
Just a few days prior to the release of that Annual Report on 4 February last, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced that in the coming year the Government would invest in a number of new medical and health research projects.
These are intended to allow Australian researchers to pursue their areas of study and pursue collaborative work both in Australia and overseas.
As Minister Roxon noted:
‘We will...ensure that all Australians have access to the best possible research in relation to the critical health and medical conditions facing them today... Improving preventative health services and chronic disease management through targeted research will deliver better outcomes for Australians and their families’.
Among other key priorities set out on the occasion of the opening of this Parliament just four months ago, reform focusing on the area of obesity is specifically looking at the integration of preventative health care and improved health outcomes.
National leadership and State co-operation are key elements in the action to be taken, and the involvement of health professionals, sporting groups, local government, industry and the community is welcomed.
The first steps have been taken. Already the Minister has confirmed the Government’s investment of $25.6 million in our ‘Healthy Kids Check’, to be introduced over the next four years.
The Healthy Kids Check will be delivered by GPs or practice nurses, or by local councils and community health centres, in conjunction with or after each child’s four-year immunisation.
The program will benefit around 255,000 four year old children across the nation, and will provide a base line for future analysis of health indicators.
The need for follow-up services, particularly any services not available under existing referral arrangements, will also be monitored.
This initiative has been widely welcomed by a broad range of interested individuals and groups, including the Australian General Practice Network.
We will also see the distribution of the ‘Healthy Habits for Life Guide’, providing achievable and accessible ideas for parents keen to keep their young children healthy and active.
And the funding of school-based kitchen and garden infrastructure will be piloted in 190 primary schools across Australia to support the curriculum-based nutrition and gardening program ‘Stephanie Alexander’s Kitchen Garden’.
The Rudd Labor Government will also provide $1.7 million over four years to encourage community initiatives that combat obesity.
By contrast to the masterful inactivity of the previous government, Labor is demonstrating its commitment to action, elevating this very serious matter to the front line of our national preventative health strategy.
This government knows that long term policy is necessary for infrastructure, education, climate change, and for tackling disadvantage.
This is a government committed to the long term objective of building the best educated, best trained and best skilled workforce in the world.
From the Education Revolution, the high speed Broadband Network, the Working Families Support Package to the National Health and Hospitals Reform plan and the many other initiatives demonstrated...this is clearly evidence of a government that acts now planning for a secure future for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,57,1,speech
"McEwen, Sen Anne",ALP,2008-06-26,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I am pleased to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. I) 2008-2009 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009 which together are two of the principal pieces of legislation underpinning the Government’s first budget.
Appropriation Bill (No. I) 2008-2009 seeks authority for meeting the expenses of the ordinary annual services of Government, and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009 seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund totalling almost $12.7 billion. This funding is part of the Rudd Labor Government’s first Budget - a budget which will—if the Opposition don’t abuse their Senate majority to vote against it—put downward pressure on interest rates and inflation as well as providing for Australia’s working families.
The rising cost of living has made life difficult for families during the last decade. There have been 8 interest rate rises in the last 3 years and in the last 2 years rent has increased by over 10 per cent and the price of fruit and vegetables has increased by 14 per cent. While these financial pressures on families increased, the Howard Government looked on and contributed to inflation by spending nearly $285 million in the 2006/2007 financial year on Government advertising.
Instead of helping families, the former Government worked hard on its reviled WorkChoices legislation which would have made it even harder for working families to make ends meet. The Howard Government lost touch with Australian families and in doing so, failed to recognise what they needed was fiscal support, not glossy publications and WorkChoices mouse pads.
Labor will not make the same mistake. We believe in giving everyone a fair go. Last month, the Rudd Labor Government delivered its first budget. We delivered a budget that will deliver to Australians who missed out in the 12 budgets of the Howard Government. We will do this through the $55 billion Working Families Support Package.
Being a parent is a fantastic experience but the cost of raising children is expensive. The Government is determined to ease that pressure, lifting the Child Care Tax Rebate is a clear example of this determination. Labor proposes to increase child care assistance by lifting the rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs and increasing the annual cap from $4354 to $7500 per child. We understand that the cost of childcare isn’t the only obstacle faced by parents, availability is a big problem. For this reason, the Government, over the long term, has committed to ensuring 260 child care centres are built in priority areas.
An important part of the Working Families Support Package in respect to raising children, is the $4.4 billion education tax refund. This refund will mean that parents who are entitled to family tax benefit A or whose children receive the youth allowance, can claim a 50 per cent tax refund of up to $750 in education expenses for each child in primary school. That’s a refund of up to $375 per year, and up to $1500 in expenses for every child in secondary schools, a refund of up to $750 per year.
Another great initiative to ensure that all families, including those who are struggling financially, are still able to provide their children with a good education, is the roll out of universal access to early learning for all four-year-olds by 2013. The Government will fund 15 hours per week for 40 weeks per year of play-based learning and development programs, allowing every child to start their schooling on equal footing, regardless of their families’ financial circumstances.
Education is a focus of the Government and it shows in our first budget. One hundred million dollars will be provided to the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, as part of a $1.2 billion funding package over five years, to implement the digital education revolution in partnership with state and territory governments. This initiative delivers on an election commitment and includes:
the establishment of a National Secondary School Computer Fund to provide grants of up to $1 million to eligible secondary schools to assist them in providing new or upgraded information and communications technology to students in years 9 to 12;
contributions towards the provision of high-speed fibre-to-the-premises broadband connections to schools and to provide support to ensure the effective deployment and installation of computers and ICT equipment purchased under the fund; and
funding for collaborative work between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments and non-government school system and industry to develop a unified technical framework and to fund administration costs of block grant authorities which will manage funding for non-government schools.
The schools receiving computers in the first round were announced earlier this month and I was happy to see that 63 schools in South Australia will be benefiting from the first roll out.
The tax cuts in this budget total around $46.7 billion. The benefits of these tax cuts are two fold as they will encourage people to enter the workforce, increasing workforce participation and will alleviate the financial pressures facing many people. Under the new system, Australians will be able to earn up to $14000 for the next financial year, without having to pay any tax, this is effectively $3000 higher than the current threshold. This change will be of particular benefit to part time workers, who according to the Productivity Commission make up 29 per cent of the workforce. It’s important that part time workers who are concentrated in low-paying jobs with high turnover, are provided with as much assistance as possible.
Labor made a number of significant election promises in the area of health and this budget delivers on those promises. It is essential that all Australians are able to access high quality, affordable healthcare. That is why we will immediately inject $1 billion to relieve the pressure on public hospitals as part of a $3.2 billion health and hospital reform plan. Also included is $275 million over five years to establish 31GP Super Clinics in local communities. These super clinics will improve health services in rural, regional and outer metropolitan areas by bringing together general practitioners, nurses, allied health professionals, some specialists and other health care providers to deliver a range of health services that are tailored to meet local health needs and priorities.
Dental health has been given great consideration when writing this Budget as a dental care waiting list of 650,00 is not acceptable. The previous Government did not deliver adequate health and dental services to Australians. The Liberal Government’s dental scheme was a failure, it had low uptake and didn’t provide to those patients who needed it the most.
Over the next three years, the Government intends to provide $290 million to State and Territory governments to help fund up to one million additional consultations and treatments for Australians needing dental treatment.
Over the next five years, the Government also plans to invest up to $490.7 million to help more than one million Australian teenagers look after their teeth. The Government will provide $150 (through the newly established Dental Benefits Schedule) per eligible teenager towards an annual preventative dental check, including an oral examination, scale and clean and x-rays where required.
Around 1.1 million teenagers aged 12-17 in families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A, and teenagers in the same age group receiving Youth Allowance or Abstudy, will be eligible for the program each year. By funding preventative check-ups, the Government wants to prevent more expensive procedures in the future as cavities and other dental diseases will be caught early or avoided all together.
Despite all of these positive proposals, the Opposition moved last week that the Health Insurance (Dental Services) Amendment and Repeal Determination 2008 made under section 3C(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 be disallowed. The Opposition want us to continue with their failed dental plan because they are not willing to own up to their mistakes. The arrogance of the Coalition is truly breathtaking.
Working families as well as singles will benefit from the changes to the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds. While the cost of living and incomes have changed over the last 11 years, the income thresholds haven’t. This has resulted in people on average wages by today’s standards, becoming liable for the surcharge. The Government are increasing the thresholds to bring them in line with today’s wages so that the Medicare levy surcharge is only placed on higher income earners. From I July 2008, singles with incomes up to $100 000 and families with incomes up to $150 000 will no longer have to pay the surcharge. These are both increases of $50 000 from the current thresholds.
Older Australians are also battling with the rising cost of living. To assist seniors in making ends meet, the Government has:
increased the Utilities Allowance from $107.20 to $500 per year;
increased the Seniors Concession Allowance from $218 to $500 per year;
increased the Telephone Allowance from $88 to $132 per year for those with an internet connection; and
committed to paying the $500 Seniors Bonus again this year.
I have been in contact with my older constituents and they have been concerned by the fact that their pension has not increased at the same pace as the cost of living. To alleviate this, the Government will ensure that the Age Pension will increase in line with the higher of the consumer price index, increases in male total average weekly earnings or the living cost index for age pensioner households. Older Australians have contributed, and continue to contribute, a great deal to Australia, Labor has not and will not leave them behind as we move towards a fairer, better future.
The Government also appreciates the contribution that carers make in our community. This appreciation is reflected in this budget with $293.6 million being allocated for 19,000 carers of children with profound disability and a $500 Utility Allowance for seniors which is now extended to 130,000 carers for the first time.
Labor honoured another election promise in its first budget, and that was to address the issue of climate change. Unlike the opposition who when in Government denied the existence of climate change, we have listened to researchers and taken action. One of the first acts of this Government was the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and this budget ensures that we continue work in this area. This Budget allocates $2.3 billion over five years to reduce Australia’s greenhouse emissions, adapt to climate change and ensure that Australia takes the lead in the transition to a low emissions economy.
The Rudd Government knows that everyone can make a difference in the battle against climate change, which is why the government will invest almost $1 billion to help Australians make their homes more environmentally sustainable. This includes $300.0 million over five years for low interest green loans of up to $10,000 to assist families to install solar, water, and energy efficient products.
Climate change along with extended drought and over allocation has had a significant impact on the Murray-Darling, this is an area of particular concern to my South Australian constituents. The Government is acting quickly to restore the river’s health. With this Budget, an additional $112.3 million will be provided to the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts to fund a variety of water initiatives. This includes an additional $81.0 million in 2007-08 as part of a bring-forward of $400 million of funding from 2011-12 under the Water for the Future package, to accelerate investment in water-saving infrastructure and to purchase water entitlements from willing sellers. Water for the Future focuses on four key priorities: taking action on climate change, using water wisely, securing water supplies and supporting healthy rivers.
Another area of Government spending which is of much interest to South Australians is defence. South Australia has a proud history of defence innovation.
Labor’s Budget has made a significant investment of $1.036 billion for 2008-09, into the Australian Defence Forces to assist the ADF in their vital role of supporting domestic, regional and international security. The funding consists of:
$618.9 million for Operation Slipper, Australia’s contribution to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. This demonstrates Australia’s commitment to working with the international community to help combat terrorism;
$174.3 million for Operation Astute, Australia’s assistance to Timor-Leste to restore peace and stability;
$215.7 million for the continuation of Operation Catalyst, Australia’s contribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq; and
$27.1 million for Operation Anode, Australia’s contribution to the Australian-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands.
This funding is evidence of the Rudd Labor Government’s commitment to supporting the defence forces and their role in providing the defence and security of our nation.
The budget also gives back to those in the veteran community and their families who need and deserve the support of their country. During the election campaign, Labor was clear that if elected, we would work closely with the veteran community to address the issues that concern them. We owe much to our defence personnel and must reflect this in the way we treat veterans when they complete service. The Rudd Labor Government budget amends veteran’s entitlements through the extension of the income support supplement to war widows and war widowers who are under qualifying age. No longer will those under qualifying ago have to be permanently incapacitated or have a dependant child or partner receiving an income support before they can receive the income support supplement that they so rightly deserve. Once in place, this amendment will immediately benefit approximately 1400 war widows or widowers, assisting them in meeting the rising cost of living.
The budget extends the automatic grant of war widow, widower or orphan pension to the widows, widowers and eligible children of veterans and members who, immediately before their death, were in receipt of the temporary special rate or intermediate rate disability pension.
Veterans will also see the disability pension bereavement payment extended in certain cases. As it stands, this payment is only payable in respect of partnered disability pension recipients. Labor wants to make these payments more equitable. That is why this Budget extends the bereavement payment to cover single recipients of the special rate and extreme disablement adjustment disability pension who die in poor circumstances.
Appropriation Bills 1and 2 are part of Labor’s budget that delivers to working families, addresses the issue of inflation and will take Australia into the future with confidence and strength. Despite this, those opposite continue to play games, stopping these benefits from being rolled out to Australians. The opposition’s referral to committees of several key budget measures has the effect of stripping away nearly $300 million worth of real money from the budget surplus.
The Labor Government has come up with a budget that includes much needed initiatives many of which the Opposition is frustrating by its belligerent attitude in the Senate. By blocking and delaying Budget bills, the Opposition is eroding the $22 billion surplus of our Budget and taking away from those who need assistance. We have developed a Budget that provides for Australians, is economically responsible and will put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. To not allow this Budget to come into effect shows just how economically irresponsible the Opposition are but we already knew that, as did the people of Australia who chose to elect a Rudd Labor Government last year.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,57,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-06-26,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The 2008 Budget is a responsible one that will help fight the high inflation inherited from the previous government and help working families.
We have the highest inflation figures for the past 16 years and high inflation puts upward pressure on interest rates. It was essential therefore in framing this budget that we fight inflation by bringing in a surplus, while at the same time investing in our future growth and productivity.
The global economy is going through what the International Monetary Fund describes as the greatest financial shock since the great depression. We are in no way free of the effects of this.
Record oil prices have added to an already very difficult situation.
Despite this we have framed a responsible Budget which honours our election commitments, helps working families, invests for the future and still produces a strong surplus.
The Working Families Support Package with $55 billion helps families meet increasing costs of living through tax cuts, help with childcare, education and housing costs.
We recognise the financial problems faced by these families, unlike the previous government which tried to persuade them that they had never been better off.
The Budget also delivers $5.9 billion towards meeting our Education Revolution, $2.3 billion to address climate change, and $3.2 billion to end the blame game on our hospitals.
We have invested in our future with a $20 billion Building Australia Fund for investment in infrastructure, $11 billion Education Investment Fund for improving university and TAFE education and a further $10 billion in the Health and Hospitals Fund.
These are all areas of spending investment sadly neglected by the previous government. The result has been a worsening infrastructure bottleneck slowing down our exports and productivity. A worsening position for our higher education sector with deteriorating infrastructure, increasing class sizes, falling morale and a rising skills shortage. Our hospitals have been struggling to meet demand for their services.
We achieved this budget by cutting out waste. Every new dollar in our budget came from savings elsewhere. This meant of course thoroughly analysing previous spending and making tough decisions on where to save money to invest for the future with new programs.
Federal Labor’s first Budget in 13 years won the backing of the Reserve Bank as one that fights inflation. The Reserve Bank is of course rightly an independent body that makes its own decisions, but to have them consider that this budget is one that fights inflation is a considerable plus sign.
I make no apology for now focusing on a few of the Budget areas of particular interest to me as a former teacher working in Indigenous Education, playing an early role at Charles Darwin University and representing the whole of the vast Northern Territory.
The Education Revolution includes $2.5 billion over 10 years for Trade Training Centres in schools. This will enable more of our young Australians to pursue technically oriented careers, contributing to reducing the skills shortage our nation inherited.
Applications for these funds have been open for some time and schools are already applying to use this program.
The Education Revolution includes $1.9 billion over 5 years for an additional 630,000 training places to boost workforce skills. Again this will greatly increase the number of skilled workers far more over time than the Australian Technical Colleges seem to be doing.
It includes $1.2 billion over 5 years to fund computers for those in years 9 to 12. Again, in this day and age our students cannot afford to be anything but computer literate and so much learning occurs using computers and associated programs.
School needs have been assessed and the first tranche of these funds is out there for those assessed as most needing computers to get them.
An additional $500 million will be provided in 2007-08 to help universities upgrade and maintain teaching and research facilities in advance of any decisions on funding made under the Education Investment Fund in future years.
This is for universities to start catching up on capital works projects that they have for years had to postpone due to under funding by the previous government. In later years when the Education Investment Fund starts more funds will be available to them.
We believe higher education is an investment in skills for the future, and quality education cannot take place in poor facilities.
In addition full fee university courses are abolished and there is a growth in the number of scholarships offered. These will increase from 44000 up to 88000 by 2012 — a doubling of the number. This measure will clearly help families who are doing it hard to get their children into tertiary education.
There will be a reduction in the maximum annual student contribution in subjects such as maths and science to encourage more students into these important areas.
Once again we have fallen behind many other developed nations in the number of science graduates entering the workforce — science teachers for example are becoming very hard to find or recruit.
At the same time as reducing costs for students there will be a Transitional Loading under the Commonwealth Grants Scheme to fully compensate Higher Education providers for the reduced revenue from lower contributions for maths and science.
Students and providers are all remembered in this Budget. It is responsible AND fair.
This budget delivers $1.2 billion over 5 years towards Closing the Gap between Indigenous and non Indigenous Australians. The Gap is too well known for me to enter into details here, but exists in health, education, training and employment.
If I may focus on my electorate for a while. There are commitments totalling $666.1 million in the Northern Territory alone. These include: $3.4 million for early childhood development services; and $154.2 million to expand educational opportunity which includes building 3 new boarding facilities, increased professional development of teachers, a Nutrition Program to provide breakfast and lunch in many community schools and funding of 200 additional teachers by 2012.
Despite the efforts of the Territory Labor Government in establishing secondary education facilities and courses in many remote communities, there are still many Indigenous children whose only access to secondary education is by going away from home.
These proposed new boarding facilities will enable many more to do so at the same time as having safe, supported accommodation to stay in.
The School Nutrition Program is providing breakfast and lunch for many young kids who might otherwise well go without. I have heard reports from health clinic nurses in communities who say the rate of anaemia for example has dropped when kids have a good breakfast and lunch.
The NT commitment includes $78 million for community safety and policing for further assistance for safe houses and support workers; alcohol diversionary activities; more on ground police; more night patrols in remote communities.
Night patrols make communities safer and more secure for families and children and will continue in communities covered by the NTER.
More police on the ground in communities has been welcomed and while reports indicate that since the Intervention rates of alcohol abuse and violence have dropped, this is again a valuable program which will continue to help closing the gap and keep children safe.
$168 million for employment and pre employment services to increase Indigenous access to skills development and jobs.
This too is a key element in closing the gap in enabling Indigenous people to access more training to increase their employability.
While many remote communities in the NT have only limited real jobs, we want to ensure that Aboriginal people can take them
$113.3 million for health services to provide follow up health care, improved child and family health service delivery.
This government is committed to ensuring that the interests of children are foremost but equally that we Close the Gap.
The team to carry out the Intervention Review has recently been announced and they will report by September on how the Indigenous people see these interests best served.
The Indigenous population in the Northern Territory is fast growing so these tasks will not be easy and will require long ongoing budget commitments.
More generally this budget provides $8 million over 4 years for the establishment of the Office of Northern Australia. This will provide high level advice on infrastructure, transport, and sustainable regional development for the whole north of Australia. Information from this office will flow direct to Canberra to the Minister.
Defence Force families in Katherine will benefit from the roll out of the free basic health care trial — this enables families to select the doctor or dentist of their choice and receive basic general practice consultations free of charge or dental care up to $300 per dependent per annum.
Defence personnel get moved around frequently and are often away doing a great job for the nation so it seems only fair that we look after these families.
Defence bases across Australia, including those in the Territory will benefit from base maintenance both in facilities and base living-in accommodation including at the Darwin patrol boat base and Bradshaw Field Training Area.
This budget provides $78 million for infrastructure in the NT. Of this $8.8 million will deliver as a matter of urgency, funds for the Port Keats Road, Tanami Road, Plenty Highway and Buntine Highway.
While these roads may not be big in terms of comparison to a city freeway in size or traffic volume, for the NT they are very important.
They are important not only for connecting territory communities, but for tourism and the pastoral industry.
For example The Buntine Highway connects Katherine to communities such as Kalkaringi and Lajamanu and goes on to join the road to the Tanami which is used not only by a gold mining company but by ""adventure"" tourists. The Buntine itself is important for bringing out live cattle exports to Darwin.
Improving roads such as these, while fairly small in the big picture, reduces infrastructure bottlenecks for moving our products thereby improving our productivity.
A total of $11.7 million will funds Roads to Recovery projects. These projects enable local authorities to upgrade smaller roads through relatively minor works but this contributes to improved road conditions and safety.
So while only a very small part of the overall national budget, the Northern Territory gets funding for a range of programs that will help to close the gap for Indigenous people, help families, help our defence force facilities and personnel and develop our road network that bit more.
So despite the difficult circumstances under which this budget has been framed, it is both fair and responsible, meets election commitments, helps working families and Indigenous Australians, invests heavily in our future health, education and infrastructure, and yet still brings in a strong surplus.
It is a budget that shows this government as sound economic managers that can make tough economic decisions and find savings to fund necessary budget commitments.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,57,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2008-06-26,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

I am pleased to support the Appropriation Bills Nos 1 and No. 2 and the first Labor Government Budget in more than a decade.
Indeed the Rudd Labor Government used their first budget to deliver on its election commitments to the Australian people and to build strong and secure foundations for our Nations future.
The Government used this year’s budget to deliver some much needed financial relief to working families.
It also used this year’s budget to invest in our Nation’s long term future, establishing a number of funds in the priority areas of infrastructure, health and education.
Therefore this budget effectively delivered a double dividend for working families by providing both immediate relief on the family budget and investing in their long term economic security.
While the Rudd Labor Government used the budget to deliver much needed financial relief for working families and invest in our nation’s long term future it did so responsibly.
The Rudd Labor Government believes in governing for the future—it believes in laying the foundations for the nation’s long-term prosperity.
That is why it used this year’s budget process to rein in unnecessary and wasteful spending by the previous Government, in a bid to tackle inflation and put downward pressure on interest rates.
This budget proves the Government understands the concept of responsible economic management. It understands that it is possible to deliver for Australian families while at the same time pursuing economically responsible policies to tackle inflation and protect our long term future.
Need I remind the chamber that this lies in stark contrast to the previous Howard Government, whose spending habits drove up inflation and which ignored the basic long term needs of many Australians?
Indeed, the spending habits of the previous Howard Government reveal that it had no long term plan for the future or little understanding of the needs of working families.
This is reflected by the fact that when the Howard Government left office last November inflation was at its highest level in 16 years and we had the second highest interest rates among advanced economies.
To add to this, the failure by the Howard Government to invest in essential infrastructure, resulted in the Rudd Labor Government inheriting a nation plagued by a permanent skills crisis and a chronically under funded health and hospitals system.
However, as history demonstrates, the Labor party has never been a party to shy away from the challenges of Government.
Indeed, since being elected last November the Rudd Labor Government has hit the ground running—it has rolled its selves up and got stuck into the business of government and business of building prosperity of our nation’s future.
Our sleeves most definitely are rolled up, Mr President. The measures contained in the Governments first budget prove that.
It proves that this Government is a Government of action and is dedicated to building for our nation’s long term future.
Indeed, this budget contains several “national building” initiatives aimed squarely at re-establishing the key foundations of a strong economy and thus laying the key foundations for Australia’s future.
The Government has taken a strategic approach to the investment of the budget surplus by creating three new funds.
These funds largely address capital shortages resulting from the failure of the Howard government to invest in the important areas of infrastructure, health and of course education.
As a result the Government will invest $40 billion in these priority areas through three primary funds.
These funds include:
Building Australia Fund, which will receive around $20 billion over the next two years to fund shortfalls in the national transport and broadband;
Education Investment Fund, in which the government will invest $5 billion and which will absorb and extend the Higher Education Endowment Fund, bringing the total funding to around $11 billion in this area; and
The Health and Hospitals Fund, to which the Government has allocated $10 billion to help revitalise our public health system and refurbish the nations public hospitals. The fund will also be used to support the development of major medical research facilities and projects.
This is nation building—these measures deliver on our commitment to govern for the Nation’s future.
These measures will help address critical infrastructure shortfalls, they will assist greater access to crucial services and most of all they will help tackle inflation.
Indeed, the Rudd Labor Government’s first budget, brought down just over a month ago, made tackling inflation and bringing the economy under control front and centre.
To this end, the Government used the budget to introduce a number of measures, based upon its five point plan to tackle inflation, including increased investment in infrastructure, and education and training.
For working families this means a double dividend, because not only has the Rudd Labor Government delivered a budget aimed at tackling inflation, it has also delivered a budget that provides some relief to working families when it comes to cost-of-living pressures.
The Rudd Labor Government recognises that families were forced to do it tough under the Howard Government’s twelve years of inaction and families are now faced with housing prices at an all time high and rising petrol and grocery prices as a result of growing inflation.
That is why the Rudd Labor Government, along with delivering a budget that is economically responsible has also delivered a budget aimed at tackling cost of living pressures on families.
The Budget contains $55 billion working Families Support Package, which includes:
$46.7 in tax cuts, which will see families with a single income of $40,000, $1,050 better off a year and families with a combined income of $100,000, where the primary earner’s income is $60,000, $1,650 better off a year;
The introduction of the  Education Tax Refund; which will provide up to $350 per primary school child and up to $750 per child for those currently in receipt of Family Tax Benefit; helping parents with the cost of their kids’ education; and
An increase to the Childcare Tax Rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent to be paid quarterly; with the first payment being made to families in October this year. The Government is increasing the amount payable cap from $4354 per child per year to $7,500 per child per year. This measure alone will assist up to 700,000 families a year.
The Budget also importantly catered to the immediate and long term needs of seniors. The Government announced a number of measures with immediate benefits for seniors including:
An increase to the Utilities Allowance from $107.20 to $500.00 per year to be paid quarterly. The second instalment of the allowance is due to paid in the next week or so, as are the bonuses of $500 for seniors, the $1000 for those in receipt of carers payment and $600 for those receiving the carers allowance.
The Government also increased the Telephone Allowance from $88 to $132 per year to assist those with an internet connection to be paid quarterly.
The Labor Government also announced that it will investigate and review the adequacy of current levels of social security benefits received by seniors as part of its comprehensive review of the Australian tax system. The Government plans to release an initial discussion paper on the review as early as July this year.
This move comes off the back of a recommendations made by the Senate Community Affairs Committee to review basic pension levels as part of the recently completed Inquiry into the cost of living pressures on older Australians.
With Housing affordability at an all time high the Rudd Labor Government also used this year’s budget to tackle the issue of housing affordability head on, with the Government announcing a $2.2 billion housing affordability package to assist first home buyers and renters, including enhanced First Home Saver Accounts, a National Rental Affordability Scheme and the Housing Affordability Fund.
These are the actions of a Government that recognises the pressures on working families, seniors and carers and that is genuinely committed to assisting them achieve long term financial security and stability.
Our Government has also in recent times proven that it is serious when it comes to the issue of climate change.
In the lead up to last year’s election, the Rudd Labor Government, unlike the previous Howard Government acknowledged the need to take urgent action on climate change.
The Government, as part of the budget announced $2.3 billion over four years to help tackle climate change-delivering on its pre-election commitments to take real action on in this area.
The $2.3 billion includes:
$1.0 billion to help make Australian’s homes and their communities more energy and water efficient;
$260 million to Australian businesses to reduce their impact on the environment;
$1.7 billion to support Australia’s leading scientists, researches and industry in their work to improve energy efficiency and develop cleaner energy options; and
$459 million to establish the Department of Climate Change to deliver on commitments in this area including a national renewable energy target and an emissions trading scheme.
With the green paper on the emissions trading scheme due to be handed down next month, the Government has wasted little time on taking action to address climate change.
The Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong has already openly stated that “climate change is one of the biggest challenges we face as a nation.”
Indeed its impacts threaten not only our economic prosperity, but also our way of life.
While the Minister has also acknowledged that after eleven years of inaction by the previous Government, taking action on this issue will not be easy and it will involve an element of cost, the cost of inaction threatens to be much greater.
Those opposite know this—yet they are already threatening to delay the introduction of the emissions trading scheme.
For eleven long years they failed to act to protect the nations future from the threat of climate change, and now, when action is needed more than ever, they have retreated to the same position.
This proves once and for all that those opposite have been and continue to be climate change sceptics.
Just in the same way that, for eleven long years the opposition failed to act in response to the threat posed by climate change, it also failed to sufficiently fund our now failing health and hospitals system.
After 11 years of neglect there is a desperate need to provide a better health and hospital system for Australians.
This year’s budget delivers on the Rudd Government pre-election health commitments.
The Rudd Labor Government’s first budget saw the creation of a multi-million dollar plan aimed squarely at building a stronger public health system for all Australians.
The $3.2 Billion National Health and Hospitals Plan will ensure Australian families have access to affordable health care by working with the States and Territory Governments for the first time in 12 years.
The Government’s significant long-term commitment to health is nowhere better reflected than in my home state of Tasmania, where it will provide more than $50 million in additional health services.
This significant investment in Tasmanian health services includes, amongst other things:
Up to $15 million to build 4 new GP Super Clinics in Burnie, Devonport, Bellerive and Sorell;
$15m towards the establishment of an Integrated Care Centre in Launceston;
Up to $7.7 million to establish an additional radiation oncology unit in the north or north-west coast;
$3.5m to support the purchase of a PET scanner at Royal Hobart Hospital; and
a share of:
The Government’s investment in the public health system, comes as a welcome relief, especially in my home state of Tasmania, where, in its last five years in office, the Howard Government under funded the public health system by a staggering $70 million.
The Budget also contains a number of significant other measures which directly benefit Tasmanians. These include, amongst other things:
$104 million in road and rail in the 2008-09 year, with more than $450 million in rail and road infrastructure over the next five years. This money is for vital projects such the Bridgewater Bridge upgrade, the Kingston by-pass, the North-East Freight Roads, and the Brighton by-pass. And, in 2008-09 there is $1.2 Million in Black spot road funding and $11.1 million in the roads to recovery program.
There is over $140 million for water infrastructure in Tasmania, including $12 million for the Huon Valley Water Scheme, which will provide clean drinking water to residents that live just 40 minutes to the south of Hobart. There is also $10.5 million for the Clarence Water Re-Use Scheme—a valuable scheme that provides reused water for irrigation.
$12 million to establish a manufacturing centre on the north-west coast to assist Tasmania’s 2,000 small and medium size manufactures become more productive and competitive.
To quote the Tasmanian State Treasurer:
“[The Federal Budget] delivers in the key areas of health, education and infrastructure and will ease the pressure on working families.”
“I am pleased that the Federal Government has recognised the areas of importance to Tasmanians with three special funds for infrastructure, education and health and hospitals.”
Other important Budget measures to benefit Tasmania include:
The establishment of a specialised child care centre for children with autism in the north-west of the state;
$10 million to fund research into the crippling devil facial tumour disease;
$11.5 million for the University of Tasmania to revamp its buildings;
The extension of the Tasmanian freight Equalisation Scheme to cover the cost of freight from King Island to Mainland Tasmania; and
An increase in the vehicle rebate, under the Bass Straight Passenger Subsidy Equalisation Scheme, from $168 to $180 which will benefits tourists travelling to Tasmania as well as Tasmanians heading interstate.
When combined with the Rudd Labor Governments other budget measures aimed at reducing cost-of-living pressures and tackling inflation, this year’s federal budget has been a win, win for the majority of Tasmanians.
While the Rudd Labor Government delivered an economically responsible budget that promised to provide some welcome relief to families when it comes to the household budget, Australian families could be denied such benefits if those opposite have their way.
Right from the word go, Dr Nelson and the federal opposition, faced with poor opinion ratings decided to play politics with several of the Governments budget announcements.
They did so purely in an attempt to score political points rather than advancing the best interests of the Australian people.
Indeed, not content with leaving a legacy, which saw inflation levels at its highest in 16 years, the liberal opposition last week used its numbers in the senate to block a number of crucial budget measures including:
The increase to the Medicare levy threshold, which was set to free around 400,000 from the liability of paying the levy and level a significant number of Australians up to $1,000 better off a year;
The National fuel watch scheme; which would have given motors more control over what they pay at the bowsers;
The luxury car tax;
The amendments to the rules regarding political donations and;
Reforms designed to end financial discrimination against same sex couples.
Adding to this, the opposition is also threatening to delay a number of other crucial budget measures and policy initiatives, including:
The proposed tax increase on ready-to-drink beverages-which gained the support of the Senate Community Affairs Committee in its report, handed down yesterday; and
The emissions trading scheme, which the Government working to a crucial time line of introduction by 2010.
This amounts simply to opposition for opposition’s sake. It is a staged attempt to get short-term political mileage out of key measures designed to protect our long term future.
Indeed the oppositions actions in relation to blocking key budget measures is nothing more than budget vandalism-with no purpose except to delay key measures that would benefit Australian families.
Treasury estimates that the cost of delaying these measures will be $284 million, which will come directly out of the budget surplus. Such a fall in the Budget surplus will result in increased pressure on inflation and interest rates.
Indeed as Senator Evans pointed out last week, that’s the equivalent of taking $13 out of the pockets of each and every Australian.
Australian families have already been forced to do it tough because of eleven years of neglect by the Howard Government, who turned a blind eye to the pressures on inflation, and the impact it was having on the family budget; why should the liberal opposition be allowed to force them to endure more?
Australians should condemn Doctor Nelson and the opposition for putting party politics above their best interests by failing to support measures designed to assist working families and secure our country’s long term economic future.
Overall the Rudd Labor budget delivers something for all: it delivers some much needed relief to working families and it delivers significant investment in our long term future.
I commend this bill to the Senate, and urge those opposite to stop their budget vandalism and support the measures contained in this years budget.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2008-2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,57,1,speech
"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I am pleased to bring the second reading debate on Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and the cognate bills to a close. The government’s first budget delivers on election commitments to ease pressures on working families by helping them to deal with rising costs of living. It outlines farsighted steps to address the long-term challenges for Australia in education and skills, infrastructure, health and climate change. We are keeping our election promise to reduce inflationary government spending by introducing an economically responsible budget. We are delivering a strong surplus of 1.8 per cent of GDP in 2008-09 to put downward pressure on inflation and to help build a strong economy in the face of difficult global financial conditions.
By honouring our election promises, we have kept faith with the Australian people. In doing so, we are helping to restore trust and confidence in Australia’s political processes and institutions. As the Treasurer explained on budget night, we have delivered a coherent package of reforms based on four principles: delivering for working families, meeting our commitments, investing in the future and beginning the new era of economic responsibility.
In conclusion, this is a budget for working families. We are keeping our election promises to reduce inflationary government spending while providing tax cuts for working Australians hit hard by rising living costs. We have trimmed the fat from the budget, and we will use the savings to invest for the future—tackling long-term challenges like climate change, infrastructure bottlenecks and skills shortages. This is the end of short-term irresponsible spending and the beginning of long-term responsible investment. The Rudd Labor government has delivered a tight, well-managed budget that focuses on practical solutions to immediate problems and long-term planning and investment for future challenges. I commend the bills to the Senate.

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2008-06-26,"—I rise to give my final speech, and I wish to inform the Senate of some important measures that are being taken by the South Australian and the Rudd Labor governments to help protect children from abuse and neglect, and to promote their wellbeing. In valedictory statements tonight, a number of senators kindly acknowledged the work that I have done over a number of years with Parliamentarians Against Child Abuse. It is for this reason that I would like to make some comments about this very important social issue that faces this country in my final remarks to the Senate this evening.
What prompted me to do this tonight, in part, was the shocking news that emerged on Monday of this week of allegations of child neglect involving two families—one of seven children, and one of 12 children—who are living in Adelaide’s northern suburbs. A police raid was triggered by one of the mothers taking her son, who had hypothermia and malnutrition, to hospital. It transpired that at least 16 children were taken to hospital, and six of these children, aged between two and six, were admitted to the Women’s and Children’s Hospital. Fortunately, they have been responding well to treatment.
I raise that example here tonight merely to point out that child neglect and child abuse are continuing problems in our society, and things that this parliament needs to continue to address. I hope that our continuing senators and other members of parliament will do so. Whilst he is in the chamber, I would like to acknowledge the work that Senator Bartlett has done in raising this very important social issue in this chamber during his term as a senator.
There has been an alarming increase right across Australia in the number of children needing protection. Substantiation rates of children that have been, or are likely to be, harmed, abused or neglected increased by 45 per cent over the four years to 2007. In the 10 years to 2007, the number of children in out-of-home care doubled to over 28,000. We are failing our children as a society. We are allowing their opportunities for a productive and fulfilling life to be squandered before they even reach adulthood. We know that a child who is neglected or abused is more likely to experience physical injuries, anxiety, depression, mental health disorders and suicide. Their school performance and ability to socialise is likely to suffer. They can go on to develop substance abuse problems and repeat the pattern by becoming perpetrators of child abuse themselves. Children who have been abused or neglected become adults who have higher rates of criminality, higher rates of chronic disease, and higher rates of homelessness.
We all know that child abuse is not a pleasant subject—delving into this subject is uncomfortable for many, and painful to talk about. Despite this, it is clear that the community does want something to be done about child abuse. Just look at the newspapers in the major capital cities, and throughout this country. We see headlines all the time alerting people to the grave cases of child abuse that do, unfortunately, occur—and they seem to be increasing. These examples of alleged neglect of many children just cry out to us that we need to take action to prevent the abuse happening in the first place. We need to educate and empower parents in parenting; we need to train parents, carers and teachers, and even neighbours—people in the community—to pick up signs of abuse and respond appropriately when they do see something which does not seem right. Many service providers, research bodies and key stakeholders repeatedly identify the need to move beyond only managing the crisis end of child protection, and to focus on the issues driving these increases: the poverty, homelessness, drug and alcohol addiction, domestic violence, mental health issues, and social isolation.
What, then, is being done to reverse this very difficult and concerning rise in neglect and child abuse? I am pleased to say that the South Australian Labor government and the Rudd Labor government are taking this issue seriously, with major initiatives to stop the increase in child abuse notifications and to care for those children who are being abused. Last week, the South Australian Premier, Mr Rann, made an apology on behalf of the South Australian government and the churches to the people whose sexual abuse as children in state care was exposed by the Mullighan inquiry report earlier this year, about which I spoke in the chamber.
The South Australian government also announced that it had accepted 49 of the 54 recommendations made by the Mullighan inquiry. Some of these actions include the establishment of a task force to examine compensation schemes, including those operating interstate, for survivors of the abuse. The state Labor government in South Australia also will expand screening processes for people involved in child related work and will strengthen child-safe environments. A specialist team is being created to provide assertive, specialised therapeutic services and to provide secure care for those children in care who frequently abscond and place themselves at high risk.
The state government in South Australia has allocated extra resources to the Guardian for Children and Young People to strengthen her role and independence as an advocate for children in care and to monitor that care. A pilot scheme is being initiated to fast-track trials involving child complainants of sexual abuse. A number of other announcements were made in the state budget. Time does not permit me to go into detail on all of those announcements, but I do congratulate the South Australian Labor government on its initiatives in this area.
I turn now to the Rudd Labor government. I am pleased to say that this government has released a discussion paper entitled ‘Australia’s children: safe and well’, which outlines various options to address the increase in the number of child protection substantiations. The Rudd Labor government is providing national leadership to protect Australia’s children. The government has committed some $2.64 million towards the development of the National Child Protection Framework, which is going to have a stronger focus on prevention.
This government wants to work closely with the states and territories to improve the way that agencies, payments and programs interact with each other in order to help prevent abuse and better protect children identified as being at risk. The paper discusses a range of child protection issues, including: a stronger prevention focus; better collaboration between services; improving responses for children in care and young people leaving care, including ways to boost and retain high-quality foster carers; improving responses to Indigenous children; attracting and retaining the right workforce; and improving child protection systems. I commend the paper to all senators and suggest that they take the time to look at the important initiatives that are outlined there. The paper considers how we can better use existing resources, such as child care, to provide more support for children at risk and respite for parents who are under stress.
The Chief Executive Officer of Families Australia, Mr Brian Babington, said in the Canberra Times:
What makes [the] launch of the Government’s discussion paper on a national child protection plan so significant is that it makes a long-overdue acknowledgment of the crisis Australia faces in protecting its children from abuse and neglect, as well as proposing a course for the coming decade which aims to join together government and non-government efforts in an overarching plan.
One of the greatest gifts that we can give to our children is the love and support of caring adults in an environment that is free from abuse. A safe and nurturing environment provides an unrepeatable head start in life and freedom from the traumas that damage a child’s prospects of growing into a well-adjusted and productive adult. On the other hand, every time we fail a child, there is a cost. There is not only a personal cost to the child, which they will pay throughout their lifetime, but also a very significant social and financial cost that we incur as a society.
